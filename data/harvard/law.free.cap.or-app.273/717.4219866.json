J.</author>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">In this consolidated appeal, the relator, Kip O\u2019Connor, appeals judgments in two mandamus cases that arose out of a dispute between O\u2019Connor and Clackamas County about development permits relating to a rock revetment (commonly referred to as a retaining wall or rip-rap) along the Sandy River. In the first mandamus action (\u201cthe permit case\u201d) (A152148), O\u2019Connor sought to compel the county to issue a floodplain development permit \u2014 for the revetment but also for authorization to construct a new residence on a lot along the river \u2014 on the ground that the county failed to take final action on that permit application within 150 days after the application was complete. <em>See generally </em>ORS 215.429 (authorizing a mandamus remedy when the county fails to take timely action on a permit application). The county moved for summary judgment on the petition, which the circuit court granted on multiple grounds, including that approval of the requested permit would violate substantive provisions of the county code. The circuit court then awarded attorney fees to the county as the prevailing party. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in the permit case but vacate and remand the award of attorney fees for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In the second mandamus action (\u201cthe enforcement case\u201d) (A149697), O\u2019Connor sought a peremptory writ to compel a county hearings officer to issue a final order in a code-violation proceeding that the county had initiated because O\u2019Connor had not obtained a floodplain development permit after completing the revetment. The circuit court entered a judgment quashing that petition on the ground that O\u2019Connor should have requested an alternative writ rather than a peremptory writ. On appeal, O\u2019Connor argues that the circuit court erred in concluding that a peremptory writ was unavailable under the circumstances and that, in any event, he should have been allowed to replead his claims as a declaratory judgment action. As we will explain, we conclude that the enforcement case is moot, because the county has since dismissed the underlying proceedings that are the predicate for the specific act \u2014 issuance of a final order \u2014 that O\u2019Connor sought to compel through mandamus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>relief, and that O\u2019Connor was not entitled to restyle his petition as a claim for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Although this appeal involves a complicated and contentious history between the parties, many of those facts are not pertinent to our resolution; accordingly, we recite only those facts that bear on the dispositive assignments of error. O\u2019Connor operates a construction and excavation business, Big Mountain Excavation, and is also a member of Lifestyle Ventures, LLC (Lifestyle Ventures), a limited liability company that owns real estate along the Sandy River. O\u2019Connor\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Lisa Konell, owns a lot adjacent to lots owned by Lifestyle Ventures.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">In January 2009, the Sandy River reached flood stage, which caused erosion to property along the river, including lots owned by Lifestyle Ventures and Konell. O\u2019Connor, who is experienced in working in the riparian areas along the Sandy River, applied to the Oregon Department of State Lands for an emergency authorization to repair and protect the riverbank from further erosion. The department issued the authorization on February 2, 2009, and a copy of it was forwarded to the Clackamas County Planning Department. O\u2019Connor completed the authorized work, which involved installation of a large rock revetment. The authorization stated, \u201cIn addition, you should contact your city or county planning office to be sure your project is in compliance with local land use plans and programs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">A. <em>The Permit Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">On August 11, 2009, O\u2019Connor applied for a County Floodplain Development Permit for the revetment pursuant to the county\u2019s zoning and development ordinance. However, O\u2019Connor also wanted to build a residence on his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s lot (tax lot 4400), so his permit application included a request to construct a new residence as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">On August 17,2009, Steve Hanschka, who was in the county\u2019s planning division, provided O\u2019Connor with a Notice of Incomplete Application with regard to the floodplain development permit. The notice indicated, through handwritten markings on a standardized form, which materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>were missing and informed O\u2019Connor that the application would be considered \u201cvoid\u201d unless, within 180 days of the date the application was first submitted, he provided (1) all of the missing information; (2) some of the missing information and written notice that no other information would be provided; or (3) written notice that none of the missing information would be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">On December 2, 2009, O\u2019Connor delivered a packet of additional materials to the county in response to the notice. On the same day, the county provided him with a second \u201cNotice of Incomplete Application.\u201d The second notice stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">\u201c1. The recently submitted materials do not address, or provide appropriate documentation for, Subsection 703.10(J)(l)(e) [requiring evidence from a professional engineer that the proposal complies with certain sections of the code and that \u2018the proposed stream bank protection measures will cause no adverse impacts to upstream or downstream properties, when compared to impacts of the pre-existing conditions].\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">\u201c2. The materials do not provide a plan of the entire site development that is proposed, or already has been developed ***, <em>all of which are likely to have been, or to be, installed within the Regulatory Floodway, none of which is allowed within the Regulatory Floodway * </em>* *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">\u201c3. The County has determined Base Flood Elevation (BFE) at the westerly edge of Tax Lot 4400 to be [higher than listed on the] Elevation Certificate and Site Plan. <em>Thus, from the County\u2019s perspective, the entire site is located within the Regulatory Floodway. To resolve this dispute, the applicant may file a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) through [the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)] that requests to remove, from the </em>floodplain/ <em>Regulatory Floodway, all areas of the site that are above the applicant\u2019s determination of BFE across the site, and the County will agree with FEMA\u2019s determination of BFE across the site.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">\u2021 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">\u201c5. Again, <em>if through a LOMA, FEMA determines that there are areas of the site that are above BFE, and thus not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>in the Regulatory Floodway, then development in those areas could proceed </em>normally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">(Emphases added.) Like the first notice, the second notice gave O\u2019Connor three options: provide all the missing information, provide some of the missing information and notice that nothing more would be submitted, or provide notice that no additional information would be supplied. O\u2019Connor returned the notice after checking a box that stated, \u201cI am submitting the required information (attached).\u201d Next to that box, O\u2019Connor made a notation to the effect that a LOMA would be forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">At the same time that it provided the second notice that O\u2019Connor\u2019s application was incomplete, the county presented O\u2019Connor with a document entitled \u201c150 Day Waiver Request,\u201d which O\u2019Connor reluctantly agreed to sign. (According to O\u2019Connor, he only agreed to sign the waiver because the county \u201cthreatened\u201d him that it otherwise would not continue to process his permit application, thereby exposing him to criminal fines and penalties in the enforcement proceeding.) The waiver stated that O\u2019Connor was \u201crequesting additional time to provide information or argument regarding the above land use application\u201d and that he understood that \u201cthis request may make it impossible for the County to render a final decision within 150 days of the date a complete application was filed, and therefore agree to waive any right of action under ORS 215.427.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Later that month, on December 22, 2009, O\u2019Connor submitted a LOMA application to FEMA to change the floodway designation for land identified in the permit application. On February 9, 2010 \u2014 more than 180 days after O\u2019Connor\u2019s floodplain development permit application was filed \u2014 the LOMA application was returned to him because the county, which was required to sign off on the LOMA application, had refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Meanwhile, as we will later discuss in greater detail, the county was moving forward with enforcement proceedings for code violations based on the revetment that O\u2019Connor built, and at a hearing in those proceedings on February 23, 2010, O\u2019Connor had an opportunity to cross-examine Hanschka. During the hearing, Hanschka <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>acknowledged that the engineering report, which was identified as missing in the county\u2019s second notice of incomplete application, had actually been provided by O\u2019Connor on December 2, 2009, but had been misfiled with a different application. Hanschka testified that he would therefore process the floodplain development permit application as \u201cdeemed complete\u201d as of December 2, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">O\u2019Connor followed up with an email to Hanschka after the hearing, asking for clarification on whether his floodplain development permit application had been \u201cdeemed complete\u201d for purposes of the permitting process. The county subsequently issued a notice that it had accepted O\u2019Connor\u2019s application as complete. The notice stated that the application \u201cwas determined to be complete on March 11, 2010\u201d\u2014 the day after O\u2019Connor\u2019s email.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Shortly thereafter, on March 19, 2010, the county planning division issued a preliminary denial of O\u2019Connor\u2019s requested development permit. O\u2019Connor timely appealed that decision, and the county scheduled a hearing for July 29, 2010. On July 21, 2010, O\u2019Connor asked to postpone that hearing for 90 days, but the request was not granted. Rather than proceed with the scheduled hearing, O\u2019Connor elected to file, on the morning of July 29, a petition for a writ of mandamus in the circuit court pursuant to ORS 215.429, thereby depriving the county of jurisdiction to act. <em>See </em>ORS 215.429(1) (authorizing an applicant to file a petition for a writ of mandamus when the county has not taken final action on a permit application within the time specified); ORS 215.429(2) (providing that, after a mandamus petition is filed, \u201cjurisdiction for all decisions regarding the application, including settlement, shall be with the circuit court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In his mandamus petition, O\u2019Connor alleged that his application was complete as of December 2, 2009, and that more than 150 days had passed without a final decision by the county. Thus, he alleged that he was \u201centitled to a peremptory writ requiring the county to issue an approval of his application unless the County or an intervenor shows that approval would violate a substantive provision of the comprehensive plan or land use regulations.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 215.429(5) (providing that the court \u201cshall issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>a peremptory writ unless the governing body or any intervenor shows that the approval would violate a substantive provision of the county comprehensive plan or land use regulations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">In response to the petition, the county moved for summary judgment, which the circuit court granted on various independent grounds. Some of those grounds concerned the timing of the county\u2019s obligation to make a final decision. The circuit court ruled that O\u2019Connor\u2019s representation that he would submit a LOMA, in response to the second notice that his application was incomplete, prevented the application from being \u201cdeemed complete\u201d until he provided that information or told the county that it would not be forthcoming. The court concluded that, because he did neither within 180 days of filing the application, his application was void and the county was not required to act on it. <em>See </em>ORS 215.427(4) (setting forth when an application becomes \u201cvoid\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Alternatively, but relatedly, the court ruled that, even if the application was \u201cdeemed complete,\u201d O\u2019Connor\u2019s representation about providing additional information would have \u201cexcused performance\u201d by the county; that O\u2019Connor had extended the county\u2019s time for a decision by signing the waiver of the 150-day period; and that O\u2019Connor had a \u201cplain, speedy, and adequate <em>remedy\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., continuing with the administrative process \u2014 that made mandamus relief inappropriate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In addition to those reasons, the court offered yet another justification for why mandamus relief was not available as a matter of law: that approval of the permit requested by O\u2019Connor would violate substantive provisions of the county code. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u201cThe County asserts that the undisputed fact is that the property in question currently lies entirely within the regulatory floodway as established by FEMA. Upon review of the record before the Court and considering the arguments of the parties, this Court is inclined to agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">\u201c[O\u2019Connor] attempts to defend against dismissal by asserting that the property is not in fact within the floodplain. [O\u2019Connor] provides a wealth of factual evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>the property should not be classified as within the regulatory floodway. However, [O\u2019Connor] provides no evidence and makes no argument that FEMA\u2019s classification has in fact changed. [O\u2019Connor] conceded at oral argument that a LOMA permit signed by the County was the proper method to determine this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\">\u201cAs such, this Court finds that a grant of mandamus in the case at bar would violate substantive law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The court subsequently awarded the county its attorney fees as the prevailing party in the action, based in part on its ruling that O\u2019Connor had pursued a mandamus remedy while he still had the \u201cplain, speedy, and adequate remedy\u201d of continuing through the administrative process, including review by the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">B. <em>Enforcement Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">During the time that O\u2019Connor was pursuing a floodplain development permit, the county was nonetheless proceeding with the enforcement process for code violations based on the fact that O\u2019Connor had not obtained permits for the revetment work. On October 27, 2009, the county had issued citations to Lifestyle Ventures for \u201cfail[ing] to submit complete land use applications to abate river violation.\u201d On February 3, 2010, the county filed formal complaints against various landowners, Lifestyle Ventures included, for not having permits for the revetment built by O\u2019Connor.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">On March 17,2010, a hearings officer for the enforcement proceeding issued a \u201ccontinuing order\u201d in which he concluded that the county had proved that Lifestyle Ventures and other property owners had violated the county code \u201cby removal of vegetation and construction of a riprap wall on properties they own along the bank of the Sandy River, without land use approval, and this is a continuing violation.\u201d The continuing order explicitly stated, \u201c[T]his order is NOT a final order.\u201d (Uppercase in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">O\u2019Connor subsequently initiated a second mandamus action, taking issue with the hearings officer\u2019s issuance of a \u201ccontinuing order\u201d rather than a final order that O\u2019Connor could challenge by way of writ of review. O\u2019Connor\u2019s mandamus petition sought \u201ca peremptory writ directing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Clackamas County Hearing Officer, Carl Cox, to promptly issue a final order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The circuit court ruled against O\u2019Connor in the enforcement case as well, concluding that O\u2019Connor improperly sought a peremptory rather than an alternative writ of mandamus. <em>See </em>ORS 34.160 (\u201cWhen the right to require the performance of the act is clear, and it is apparent that no valid excuse can be given for not performing it, a peremptory mandamus shall be allowed in the first instance; in all other cases, the alternative writ shall be first issued.\u201d). O\u2019Connor then moved for a new trial, arguing, among other contentions, that he should be permitted to restyle his petition as a request for a declaratory judgment. In response, the county<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pointed out that it had dismissed the underlying enforcement actions after the circuit court\u2019s ruling, so the issue was moot. The circuit court denied the motion for a new trial and entered a judgment dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"ANL\">A. <em>The Enforcement Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">We begin with O\u2019Connor\u2019s first two assignments of error, which relate to the enforcement case. He contends that the circuit court erred in (1) quashing the peremptory writ and (2) dismissing the case without giving him the opportunity to replead. The county responds that the appeal is moot as a result of the county\u2019s dismissal of the enforcement proceedings regarding the underlying code violations. We agree with the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">A case is considered moot if a decision by the court \u201cno longer will have a practical effect on or concerning the rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Brumnett v. PSRB, </em>315 Or 402, 406, 848 P2d 1194 (1993). For instance, \u201ca case becomes moot when an event occurs that \u2018render [s] it impossible for the court to grant effectual relief.\u2019\u201d <em>Hamel v. Johnson, </em>330 Or 180, 184, 998 P2d 661 (2000) (quoting <em>Greyhound Park v. Ore. Racing Com., </em>215 Or 76, 79, 332 P2d 634 (1958)). That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>is precisely what happened in this case. O\u2019Connor sought a writ \u201cdirecting Clackamas County Hearing Officer, Carl Cox, to promptly issue a final order\u201d in the county\u2019s enforcement proceedings, but those proceedings have since been dismissed; thus, it is no longer possible for the court to grant O\u2019Connor\u2019s requested mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">On appeal, O\u2019Connor does not contest that fact. That is, he does not argue that there remains any present dispute as to whether the court should order the county to issue a final order, as requested in his petition. Rather, O\u2019Connor contends that there remains a justiciable controversy with regard to the underlying dispute that gave rise to the enforcement proceeding, and that the circuit court should have allowed him to restyle his pleading in a way that presented <em>that dispute </em>for review after the court rejected his request for a peremptory writ. Specifically, O\u2019Connor contends that he should have been allowed to amend his mandamus petition to state a claim for declaratory relief with regard to whether his emergency work is in violation of the county code. In other words, O\u2019Connor essentially concedes that \u201c[t]he voluntary temporary cessation of the code violation hearing may eliminate a mandamus proceeding, but it does not eliminate the right to challenge the County\u2019s action and their stated position by declaratory relief when they attempt to render the initial action moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">In support of that argument, O\u2019Connor relies, as he did in the circuit court, on ORS 34.740. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">\u201c(1) A circuit court <em>shall </em>allow a person to amend a petition or action in the manner provided by this section if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">\u201c(a) The person seeks relief against a public body, as defined in ORS 192.410;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">\u201c(b) The person incorrectly filed a petition for a writ of review, a petition for a writ of mandamus or an action for declaratory judgment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">\u201c(c) The correct remedy of the person is a petition for a writ of review, a petition for a writ of mandamus or an action for declaratory judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>(Emphasis added.) O\u2019Connor argues that the county hearings officer is a \u201cpublic body\u201d under ORS 192.410(3),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that, \u201csince the court found the peremptory writ inappropriate [,] the relator has the right to amend his writ\u201d to seek the correct remedy \u2014 an action for a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">We are not persuaded that ORS 34.740 was intended to address O\u2019Connor\u2019s situation. The statute was enacted, along with ORS 14.165, as part of House Bill (HB) 3119, which was intended to address circumstances in which a citizen mistakenly files the wrong type of action against a public body or files it in the wrong place. Or Laws 2001, ch 561, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; Audio Recording, House Floor Hearing, HB 3119, Apr 27, 2001, at 1:22 (statement of Rep Kathy Lowe, explaining that the process for suing a public body is confusing, that a citizen may be required to seek declaratory relief, a writ of mandamus, a writ of review, or other relief, and that the bill was intended to assure that mere technicalities do not prevent citizens from addressing legitimate issues with a public body), http://www.leg.state.or.us (accessed Sept 17, 2015); Audio Recording, Senate Floor Hearing, HB 3119, May 31, 2001, at 48:00 (statement of Sen Peter Courtney, likewise explaining that the bill ensures that citizens will not be penalized for mistakenly filing an action against a public body in the wrong forum), http://www.leg.state.or.us (accessed Sept 17, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Consistent with that intent, one of the explicit predicates for an amended petition under ORS 34.740 is that the citizen <em>\u201cincorrectly </em>filed a petition for a writ of review, a petition for a writ of mandamus or an action for declaratory judgment\u201d when the citizen should have filed a different form of action. (Emphasis added.) Here, petitioner did not \u201cincorrectly\u201d file a petition for a writ of mandamus instead of a petition for declaratory relief, and the circuit court did not reject his petition on that basis. On the contrary, the circuit court ruled that O\u2019Connor had not demonstrated a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>clear entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of a peremptory writ, as opposed to an alternative writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">In short, the pleading amendment that O\u2019Connor proposed \u2014 to convert his petition from a mandamus action in which the legal question was whether he was entitled to a final order, into a declaratory judgment action in which the legal question was whether his emergency work is in violation of the county development code \u2014 is one of substance, not form or forum. O\u2019Connor does not point to anything in the text, context, or legislative history of ORS 34.740 that would suggest that the statute was intended to confer a right to make that type of substantive amendment during the course of a judicial proceeding, and the circuit court correctly rejected his reading of that statute. Therefore, even assuming that O\u2019Connor could plead a justiciable declaratory judgment claim regarding his underlying dispute with the county, ORS 34.740 did not require the court to allow him to do so as part of a mandamus action directed at a hearings officer\u2019s conduct in a particular enforcement proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject O\u2019Connor\u2019s argument that he should have been allowed to plead a declaratory judgment action, and we conclude that his appeal of the judgment of dismissal in Case No. A149697 is therefore moot.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">B. <em>The Permit Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">1. <em>Summary Judgment Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s remaining assignments of error concern the circuit court\u2019s rulings in his land-use mandamus action, in which he sought issuance of a floodplain development permit. The circuit court dismissed that petition on multiple independent grounds, including that approval of O\u2019Connor\u2019s requested permit would violate the county\u2019s substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>restrictions on development in the regulatory floodway of the Sandy River. We view the facts in the light most favorable to O\u2019Connor, the nonmoving party, <em>Jones v. General Motors Corp., </em>325 Or 404, 408, 939 P2d 608 (1997), and we affirm the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">In the application underlying this mandamus action, O\u2019Connor sought a permit for emergency work that he had already performed, as well as for construction of a new single-family residence on tax lot 4400. In response, the county asserted that approval of the permit would violate a substantive provision of the county code \u2014 namely, County Development Code (CDC) section 703.07, which provides that \u201c [development in the floodway is prohibited,\u201d subject to certain limited exceptions, which include certain emergency and repair work but not the construction of a new residence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">CDC section 703.07 is among the county\u2019s regulations concerning the Floodplain Management District (FMD). The FMD applies to the special flood hazard area that has been \u201cidentified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled, \u2018The Flood Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Study for Clackamas County, Oregon &amp; Incorporated Areas/ (FIS) dated June 17, 2008, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs).\u201d CDC \u00a7 703.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The special flood hazard area includes, among other things, the \u201cfloodway\u201d which is the \u201cchannel of the river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot, often referred to as the \u2018regulatory floodway.\u2019\u201d CDC \u00a7 703.05(U).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The \u201cregulatory flood,\u201d also known as the \u201c100-year flood\u201d or \u201cbase flood,\u201d is the \u201cnational standard used by the National Insurance Flood Program and all federal agencies for the purposes of requiring the purchase of flood insurance and regulating new development.\u201d CDC \u00a7 703.05(A). The \u201c[b]ase flood elevation\u201d is defined in the code as the \u201ccomputed elevation to which floodwater is anticipated to rise during the base flood. Base flood elevations are shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and on the flood profiles included in the Flood Insurance Study.\u201d CDC \u00a7 703.05(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The county code expressly recognizes that the regulatory floodway on the existing federal maps (FIRMs) can be overly inclusive, sometimes incorrectly identifying a property\u2019s location in relation to the special flood hazard area. The county code includes reference to a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), which the code defines as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">\u201c[a]n official amendment, by letter from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to an effective National Flood Insurance Program map. A LOMA establishes a property\u2019s location in relation to the special flood hazard area. <em>LOMAs usually are issued because a property has been inadvertently mapped as being in the floodplain, but is actually on natural high ground above the base flood </em>elevation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>CDC \u00a7 703.05(W) (emphasis added). Thus, the code contemplates a process for addressing circumstances in which property is inadvertently included in the regulatory floodway, in light of federal regulation of floodplain management. <em>See </em>44 CFR \u00a7 60.3 (\u201c [W]hen special flood hazard area designations and water surface elevations have been furnished by the Federal Insurance Administrator, they shall apply.\u201d); 44 CFR \u00a7 60.3(d) (setting forth requirements for communities to follow \u201c[w]hen the Federal Insurance Administrator has provided a notice of final base flood elevations within Zones Al-30 and/ or AE on the community\u2019s FIRM and, if appropriate, has designated AO zones, AH zones, A99 zones, and A zones on the community\u2019s FIRM, and has provided data from which the community shall designate its regulatory floodway\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Part of the permit dispute between O\u2019Connor and the county, which we briefly described earlier, 273 Or App at 722, concerned whether the subject property \u2014 including tax lot 4400 \u2014 was in the regulatory floodway. O\u2019Connor took the position that the subject property should not have been classified within the regulatory floodway, while the county concluded that, based on the FIRM and flood profiles from the adopted FIS, the property was located within the flood-way. The county then insisted on a LOMA to resolve the dispute but \u2014 much to O\u2019Connor\u2019s frustration \u2014 refused to sign off on the LOMA, which caused FEMA to cancel the LOMA process after O\u2019Connor had spent thousands of dollars preparing the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">For purposes of summary judgment, it was undisputed that tax lot 4400 is shown on the FIRM and flood profiles to be within the regulatory floodway. However, the parties disputed the legal significance of that fact. O\u2019Connor argued that his experts could prove that the property was inadvertently mapped in the floodplain, and that the county\u2019s refusal to sign off on the LOMA was the only barrier to obtaining a LOMA and building the residence on the property. O\u2019Connor also offered an ORCP 47 E declaration on that issue, and, at the summary judgment hearing, his counsel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">\u201cSo I\u2019ve also \u2014 in my declaration, Your Honor, I have put in there what \u2014 what we\u2019re required to do with experts. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>that is, we have experts that are readily available to testify this property is not in the floodplain. And if they could have gotten the County to cooperate, they\u2019re going to testify they would have gotten their LOMA, and the house would have been okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The trial court rejected O\u2019Connor\u2019s arguments and ruled that his evidence regarding the floodplain, including his declaration about experts, was beside the point. The court explained that O\u2019Connor had provided <em>\u201ca </em>wealth of factual evidence that the property should not be classified as within the regulatory floodway,\u201d but that he \u201cprovides no evidence and makes no argument that FEMA\u2019s classification has in fact changed\u201d and \u201cconceded at oral argument that a LOMA permit signed by the County was the proper method to determine this issue.\u201d Thus, the circuit court concluded that, on the record before it, approving the permit to build a home on property classified within the floodplain would violate the substantive prohibition on such development set forth in CDC section 703.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">On appeal, O\u2019Connor\u2019s argument, as we understand it, is that the circuit court\u2019s reasoning in that regard was incorrect for two reasons: (1) There were disputed issues of fact regarding whether the property is actually on high ground above the base flood elevation, and a LOMA therefore could be made a condition of approval; and (2) in any event, the writ should not have been dismissed in its entirety because the permit sought approval for at least some activities (the revetment and repair of a county roadway) that are allowed within the regulatory floodway. We are not persuaded by those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">As the circuit court understood the case, the question framed by the parties below was not whether there was a factual dispute about whether the subject property <em>should be </em>designated as part of the regulatory floodway; the question was whether it <em>has been, </em>in light of the fact that the relevant parts of the county\u2019s code, when viewed in the context of federal regulations, make clear that the regulatory floodway is determined in the first instance by the flood profiles included in the FIS and the accompanying FIRMs. O\u2019Connor does not dispute that the subject property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>including tax lot 4400, is within the regulatory floodway as shown on FEMA\u2019s existing maps. Nor does he dispute that, as of the date of the mandamus action, no LOMA had been processed by FEMA to change that designation; in fact, one of O\u2019Connor\u2019s complaints is that the county planning director incorrectly refused to sign off on the LOMA, thereby precluding him from obtaining the LOMA to which he would otherwise be entitled. On this record, and in light of the parties\u2019 arguments, the trial court correctly ruled that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether tax lot 4400 is within the designated regulatory floodway, thereby precluding the construction of a new residence on that lot under the restriction in CDC section 703.07 in the absence of a change of designation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The question, then, is whether the lack of a LOMA in this case was a proper basis for summary judgment. O\u2019Connor points out that, under ORS 215.429(5), the writ \u201cmay specify conditions of approval that would otherwise be allowed by the county comprehensive plan or land use regulations,\u201d and he argues that his permit could be approved as submitted, with the LOMA merely made a condition of that approval. However, O\u2019Connor does not explain how a LOMA \u2014 which requires agency action by the county <em>and by FEMA, </em>is the type of \u201ccondition\u201d that is authorized by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>the county comprehensive plan or land use regulations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If O\u2019Connor is entitled to a LOMA, as he claims, the remedy is a separate mandamus action to compel the planning director to sign off on the application to FEMA, not an approval of a permit conditioned on O\u2019Connor actually satisfying the criteria of the code at some later date.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s final contention in opposition to summary judgment is that, even if permission to build a home on tax lot 4400 would violate a substantive provision of the county code, there remain genuine issues of material fact as to whether other parts of the permit \u2014 approval of the revetment work and road repair \u2014 would violate the code, and the court therefore erred in dismissing the writ in its entirety. However, O\u2019Connor develops no argument, and cites no authority, for that <em>proposition </em>\u2014 i.e., that the circuit court in a mandamus action can pare down a requested permit to avoid violating a substantive provision of the county code, and then compel the county to issue that pared-down permit. As the applicant, O\u2019Connor was in a position to define the breadth of the application; he sought a single permit from the county and then enlisted the court, through mandamus, to compel the issuance of that permit. We will not, on our own, supply an argument for why the court erred in holding O\u2019Connor to the permit he requested. <em>See Beall Transport Equipment Co. v. Southern Pacific, </em>186 Or App 696, 700 n 2, 64 P3d 1193, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>187 Or App 472, 68 P3d 259 (2003) (\u201c[I]t is not this court\u2019s function to speculate as to what a party\u2019s argument might be. Nor is it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>our proper function to make or develop a party\u2019s argument when that party has not endeavored to do so itself.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">In sum, in light of the evidence offered by the parties and the arguments framed below and on appeal, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in the permit case.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">2. <em>Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Last, we turn to O\u2019Connor\u2019s challenges to the circuit court\u2019s award of attorney fees to the county as the prevailing party in the permit case. O\u2019Connor contends that the court erroneously based the award on the fact that he elected the mandamus process rather than continuing with the administrative process, and that the amount of the award was excessive in light of the internal rate that county counsel charges when it represents a department of the county. We agree with O\u2019Connor that the circuit court relied on an improper factor when awarding fees to the county, and we therefore vacate and remand the award for reconsideration without reaching the question of the amount of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">An award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in a mandamus proceeding under ORS 215.429 involves an exercise of discretion on the part of the circuit court based on the factors set forth in ORS 20.075(1). <em>See State ex rel Stewart v. City of Salem, </em>268 Or App 491, 497, 343 P3d 264, <em>rev den, </em>357 Or 595 (2015) (explaining, in the context of the analogous land-use mandamus statute that applies to cities, that \u201cfee entitlement is permissive, predicated on the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion\u201d). We therefore review the award for an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>ORS 20.075(3) (\u201cIn any appeal from the award or denial of an attorney fee subject to this section, the court reviewing the award may not modify the decision of the court in making or denying an award, or the decision of the court as to the amount of the award, except upon a finding of an abuse of discretion.\u201d). A circuit court can abuse its discretion if it bases its decision on an erroneous understanding of the scope or content of the factors set forth in ORS 20.075(1). <em>See Niman and Niman, </em>206 Or App 400, 415, 421, 136 P3d 1186 (2006) (explaining that an abuse of discretion can arise from a court\u2019s erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>understanding of the scope and content of discretionary factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">In this case, the circuit court based its decision in considerable part on the fact that O\u2019Connor elected to pursue mandamus relief even though the city appeared to be willing and ready to make a decision on the permit. In initially granting summary judgment, the court had explained its view that the right to mandamus relief is limited to cases in which no other \u201cplain, speedy, and adequate remedy\u201d exists. <em>See </em>ORS 34.110 (\u201cThe writ [of mandamus] shall not be issued in any case where there is a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.\u201d). The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">\u201cFurther, the Court finds that there was a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy for [O\u2019Connor] in the ordinary course of the law and mandamus would be inappropriate in this case. [O\u2019Connor] filed this matter on the date set for a final decision to be issued by the County. Twelve hours later, appeal (if necessary) would have been exclusively .to LUBA, a body created to address such controversies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">\u201cWhile this Court understands that under certain circumstances mandamus is authorized by statute and appropriate, under these undisputed facts \u2014 where the County was very likely within 12 hours of issuing its final decision\u2014 it was not and mandamus will be DENIED.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The court\u2019s ruling on attorney fees drew, in part, on that same reasoning. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-8\">\u201cFirst, [O\u2019Connor] believed (at the time) the County <em>could </em>still issue a valid decision in his favor at the July 29, 2010 hearing. Second, if [O\u2019Connor] was unprepared for the July 29,2010 final hearing he would likely have been unprepared for an earlier hearing. And third, after [O\u2019Connor] filed the request for continuance (in which he asserted that the process was \u2018timely\u2019), [O\u2019Connor] decided that if his continuance request was not granted he would seek mandamus rather than proceed before the County. In summary, evidence in the record indicates to this Court that this mandamus action was filed not because the County had failed to take timely final action, but because [O\u2019Connor] believed his chances of success (and the time allowed to prepare) would be greater in Circuit Court than before the County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>on July 29, 2010 (where he likely assumed he would lose) and LUBA thereafter. [O\u2019Connor] took a calculated risk and lost. But the decision to initiate this litigation rather than proceed before LUBA was entirely with [O\u2019Connor]. Consideration of these facts weighs toward a finding that the imposition of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees is proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-4\">\u201cAlso, under ORS 20.075(l)(c) - (d) this Court believes that an award of attorney\u2019s fees in this matter would not dissuade legitimate claims but only encourage attorneys to consider whether mandamus is appropriate in their case before pursuing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">\u201cIn conclusion, the law provides for attorney\u2019s fees. The questions before the Court were worthy of dispute. The suit was well litigated. However, <em>I do not believe this case was necessarily appropriate for mandamus, which I believe was used as an alternative to LUBA on the eve of a final decision by the County. </em>Here, the factors influence this Court to decide that attorney\u2019s fees are appropriate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">(First emphasis in original; second emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">On appeal, O\u2019Connor argues that the circuit court erred in relying on the alternative of LUBA, because an award of attorney fees based on that factor would \u201cclearly deter other land use applicants from pursuing their rights to a writ of mandamus, while defeating the purpose of ORS 215.427 to make Counties provide timely decisions on land use matters.\u201d O\u2019Connor points out that the court had \u201cpreviously ruled that there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether or not [his] application was complete on December 2, 2010,\u201d and that \u201c [t]he record in this matter is fairly clear that the County is a forever moving target with belated request for documentation, refusing to sign off on [O\u2019Connor\u2019s] LOMA application after requesting it, and then blaming [O\u2019Connor] for failing to meet procedural requirements for the application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">We agree with O\u2019Connor that the circuit court erred in relying on the fact that he proceeded with a mandamus petition for strategic reasons despite the county\u2019s willingness to issue a decision promptly. As the Supreme Court has observed, the land-use mandamus statutes grant an applicant a \u201cstatutory right, not merely to an order that rules on the application, but to an order <em>compelling an approval. </em>If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>a [local government] could avoid the mandamus remedy by denying the application on the eve of a court hearing, the incentive to make a timely decision within 120 days would disappear.\u201d <em>State ex rel Compass Corp. v. City of Lake Oswego, </em>319 Or 537, 545, 878 P2d 403 (1994) (emphasis in original). Thus, \u201c[p]roperly viewed, the approval action that the court compels through mandamus is not a second decision by the [local government]; it is an action that the law requires as a consequence of the [local government\u2019s] violation of the 120-day deadline. *** The applicant\u2019s right to that remedy is not affected by the [local government\u2019s] decision, after the 120-day period has expired, to deny the application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Furthermore, ORS 215.429(4) explicitly authorizes applicants to elect whether to pursue mandamus relief or to continue with the administrative process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">\u201cIf the governing body does not take final action on an application within 120 days or 150 days, as appropriate, of the date the application is deemed complete, <em>the applicant may elect to proceed with the application according to the applicable provisions of the county comprehensive plan and land use regulations or to file a petition for a writ of mandamus under this section. </em>If the applicant elects to proceed according to the local plan and regulations, the applicant may not file a petition for a writ of mandamus within 14 days after the governing body makes a preliminary decision, provided a final written decision is issued within 14 days of the preliminary decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">(Emphasis added.) That choice is inherently strategic, in light of the differences between the two forums themselves (court and agency) and the nature of the decisions in each forum. <em>See State ex rel K. B. Recycling v. Clackamas Cty., </em>171 Or App 46, 50, 14 P3d 643 (2000) (\u201cOne might, of course, take precisely the opposite view from the county\u2019s [contention that the applicant engaged in improper \u2018forum shopping\u2019], <em>i.e., </em>that the purpose of the mandamus statutes is to provide an alternative forum to applicants when the first forum at which they shopped has failed to deliver the goods in the time and manner required by state law. Indeed, we indicated as much in <em>State ex rel Coastal Management v. Washington County, </em>159 Or App 533, 551-52, 979 P2d 300 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>(1999), in rejecting a point similar to the one that the county makes here. <em>See also State ex rel Aspen Group v. Washington County, </em>166 Or App 217, 996 P2d 1032 (2000).\u201d (Emphasis omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">To impose attorney fees on an applicant for making the strategic election that is authorized by ORS 215.429 would, in our view, frustrate the purpose of the land-use mandamus statute. If applicants with meritorious claims under that statute expose themselves to the risk of attorney fees merely by electing mandamus for strategic reasons \u2014 for instance, because they think they have a better chance of prevailing in court or would feel better prepared to litigate in that forum \u2014 it would chill the use of the mandamus remedy in a way that is contrary to the legislature\u2019s manifest intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the circuit court erred in partly basing its award of attorney fees on the fact that O\u2019Connor made a strategic decision to pursue mandamus rather than continue with the administrative process. Because we cannot tell what award, if any, the court would have made without that consideration, we vacate and remand for reconsideration.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Stewart, </em>268 Or App at 503 (explaining that \u201cVacated and remanded for reconsideration\u2019 is the strongly presumptive disposition when a trial court has misconstrued or misapplied one or more considerations bearing on the exercise of discretion\u201d); <em>Shumake v.

The SFHA includes the floodway, flood fringe, flood hazard, flood prone, and shallow flooding areas.\u201d CDC \u00a7 703.05(LL).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b752-5\"> We note that there are other parts of the county code, such as CDC section 703.08(B) and section 703.11(A), which suggest that the county\u2019s planning director can, in some circumstances, make determinations about what is in the flood fringe or floodway based on a \u201cfederal, state or other authoritative source.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>CDC \u00a7 703.08(B) (\u201cWithin the special flood hazard area, when more detailed base flood elevation or floodway data is available outside of the adopted Flood Insurance Study (FIS) from a federal, state or other authoritative source \u2014 such as preliminary or draft information from a new study that will revise the FIS\u2014 the Planning Director may obtain, review, and reasonably utilize such data. When the data pertains to a preliminary or draft FIS in Zone A, the Planning Director is required to reasonably utilize the data, and is allowed discretion in using this data only to the extent that the technical or scientific validity of the data in the draft or preliminary FIS is questioned by a qualified professional.\u201d). However, O\u2019Connor does not cite those provisions, let alone develop any argument as to their significance in this case. The circuit court understood O\u2019Connor to \u201cconcede\u201d during the summary judgment hearing that a LOMA was the proper method to resolve whether the property is within the regulatory floodway, and he does not address that aspect of the court\u2019s ruling on appeal. Accordingly, we assume, as did the circuit court, that a LOMA is the proper way to resolve whether tax lot 4400 is within the regulatory floodway for purposes of satisfying the criteria of the county code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b753-5\"> CDC section 703.09(D) provides that \u201c[t]he County may attach conditions of approval to [a floodplain development permit] if such conditions are deemed necessary to further the purpose of this section.\u201d It then provides a nonexclusive list of the type of conditions that might he applied, though nothing in the list suggests that a LOMA is a permissible condition of approval. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cSuch conditions may include, but are not limited to: 1. Limitations on periods of use and operation; 2. Imposition of operation controls, sureties, and deed restrictions; and 3. Floodproofing and other protective measures * * *.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\"> Although he does not explicitly argue the matter on appeal, we note that O\u2019Connor offered an ORCP 47 E declaration in which his attorney averred that he had retained an expert to testify on \u201c]t]he issue of whether or not a home can be built on the subject property under conditions that do not violate substantive land use regulations and laws.\u201d However, the question before us \u2014 whether a LOMA is the type of \u201ccondition\u201d of approval that is permitted in these circumstances \u2014 is one of law that is not susceptible to proof by expert testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\"> Although the court\u2019s opinion regarding attorney fees indicates that there was uncertainty about when the application was \u201ccomplete\u201d for purposes of triggering the mandamus statute, we do not understand the circuit court to have ruled that O\u2019Connor lacked a good-faith belief or was objectively unreasonable in believing that he was authorized to pursue mandamus relief under ORS 215.429 on the record in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
