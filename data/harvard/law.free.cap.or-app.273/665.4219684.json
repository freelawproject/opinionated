In a demurrer, defendant argued that the charging instrument failed to state an offense. After a stipulated facts trial following the trial court\u2019s denial of the demurrer, defendant was convicted of one count of second-degree unlawful water pollution, ORS 468B.050(l)(d) and ORS 468.943, and was sentenced to 36 months of probation. On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his demurrer. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court correctly denied the demurrer, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The facts are undisputed. A federal law enforcement officer observed defendant at or near the Rogue River on two days in September 2011. On both occasions, defendant had a suction dredge, a gasoline-powered device used by miners to suction water and small particulates through a hose and discharge them back into the water source. A suction dredge creates turbidity in the water source. On the second day, defendant told the law enforcement officer that he had been using the dredge in the river. Defendant dredged 0.10 cubic yards of the river bed. Rules promulgated by the state Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) require a person to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) 700-PM permit to operate a suction dredge. Defendant did not have such a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The state charged defendant by information with second-degree unlawful water pollution, alleging that defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">\u201cdid unlawfully and with criminal negligence violate [ORS] 468B.050 by operating an industrial operation without holding a permit from the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, to wit: by operating a small suction dredge without a [NPDES] 700-PM permit, the operation of which would otherwise alter the physical, chemical, or biological properties of a water of the state in a manner not already authorized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">In a demurrer, defendant raised several arguments as to why the information failed to state an offense. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>court denied the demurrer. Defendant waived his right to a jury trial and was convicted after a stipulated facts trial. On appeal, his sole assignment of error is to the trial court\u2019s denial of the demurrer. Defendant\u2019s arguments, as we understand them, are that the charging instrument failed to state an offense because: (1) DEQ lacks the authority to issue the NPDES 700-PM permit that defendant failed to obtain, and (2) the charging instrument did not describe a \u201cdischarge\u201d or \u201caddition\u201d into a water source.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a demurrer for legal error. <em>State v. Huckins, </em>176 Or App 276, 281, 31 P3d 485 (2001). ORS 135.630(4) provides that a defendant \u201cmay demur to the accusatory instrument when it appears upon the face thereof * * * [t]hat the facts stated do not constitute an offense [.]\u201d We have repeatedly held that, in light of that language, a court \u201cmay consider only the information alleged in the indictment.\u201d <em>State v. Cervantes, </em>232 Or App 567, 573, 223 P3d 425 (2009); <em>see also State v. Morgan, </em>151 Or App 750, 755, 951 P2d 187 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 82 (1998) (demurrer \u201ccannot be sustained on the basis of facts extrinsic to the indictment\u201d); <em>State v. Barker, </em>140 Or App 82, 84, 914 P2d 11, <em>rev den, </em>323 Or 265 (1996) (\u201cDefendant\u2019s argument about what he expects the state to present at trial is premature and does not provide a basis for sustaining a demurrer.\u201d); <em>State v. Durant, </em>122 Or App 380, 382, 857 P2d 891 (1993) (\u201cA defendant may not rely on facts extrinsic to the indictment to support his theory of invalidity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Thus, the state\u2019s charging instrument is generally sufficient to \u201cwithstand a demurrer if it tracks the pertinent wording of the statute defining the crime.\u201d <em>State v. Fair, </em>326 Or 485, 490, 953 P2d 383 (1998). In this case, the state charged defendant with violating ORS 468.943, which provides that a person commits the crime of unlawful water pollution in the second degree \u201cif the person with criminal negligence violates ORS Chapter 468B or any rule, standard, license, permit or order adopted or issued under ORS Chapter 468B.\u201d The charging instrument tracks the language of ORS 468.943 by alleging that defendant did \u201cwith criminal negligence violate [ORS] 468B.050.\u201d The instrument proceeds to allege that defendant <em>\u201coperatfed] an industrial operation without holding a permit from the Oregon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number><em>Department of Environmental Quality, </em>to wit: by operating a small suction dredge without [an NPDES] 700-PM permit, <em>the operation of which would otherwise alter the physical, chemical, or biological properties of a water of the state in a manner not already </em>authorized\u201d (emphasis added). The italicized language tracks the language in the underlying statute, ORS 468B.050.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">In short, the charging instrument contained all of the elements of the offense with which defendant was charged. In arguing that the charging instrument failed to state an offense, defendant contends that the particular permit that defendant allegedly failed to obtain, the NPDES 700-PM, is legally invalid because DEQ lacks the authority to issue it. Thus, defendant reasons, he cannot be penalized for failing to procure the permit. Defendant\u2019s argument is a nonsequitur. Even assuming the correctness of his assertion that DEQ may not lawfully issue an NPDES 700-PM permit, it does not follow that suction dredging without a permit is therefore lawful. ORS 468B.050\u2019s prohibition on engaging in unpermitted activities that have certain effects on the state\u2019s water does not affirmatively require the state to issue a permit. As pertinent to the charge against defendant, the material allegations are simply that he engaged in activity for which a permit was required, and he did not have one.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Defendant also argues that the charging instrument failed to state an offense because suction dredging does not cause any \u201caddition\u201d or \u201cdischarge\u201d into the water; rather, according to defendant, suction dredging \u201cremoves water and puts it back, without adding any substances or pollutants.\u201d The state argues that suction dredging does cause a \u201cdischarge\u201d requiring an NPDES 700-PM permit. We need not resolve that question, as it is clear that the nature and consequences of suction dredging implicate factual matters that are extrinsic to the face of the charging instrument. Accordingly, the state is correct that a demurrer was not the appropriate procedural vehicle for defendant\u2019s legal theory. <em>Cervantes, </em>232 Or App at 573. The trial court did not err in denying the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-5\"> ORS 468B.050 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">\u201c(1) Except as provided in ORS 468B.053 or 468B.215, without holding a permit from the Director of the Department of Environmental Quality or the State Department of Agriculture, * * *, a person may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">\u00absj: sj: * sjs <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">\"(d) Construct, install, operate or conduct any industrial, commercial, confined animal feeding operation or other establishment or activity or any extension or modification thereof or addition thereto, the operation or conduct of which would cause an increase in the discharge of wastes into the waters of the state or which would otherwise alter the physical, chemical or biological properties of any waters of the state in any manner not already lawfully authorized.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b686-9\"> Defendant\u2019s only response to that point is to argue that, if one cannot obtain a valid permit, then the state has effectively banned suction dredging, which would be contrary to the federal Mining Act. We reject that argument without written discussion. <em>See Kinross Copper Corp. v. State of Oregon, </em>160 Or App 513, 525-26, 981 P2d 833, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>163 Or App 357 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 71, <em>cert den, </em>531 US 960 (2000) (holding that the state did not effect a taking of a party\u2019s property when the takings claim was \u201cpredicated on the loss of a right\u201d that the party \u201cnever possessed, namely, the \u2018right\u2019 to discharge mining wastes into the waters of the state\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
