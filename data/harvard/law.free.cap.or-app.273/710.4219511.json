We reject without written discussion defendant\u2019s first and second assignments of error, and write only to address his third assignment, in which he contends that the trial court erred in imposing attorney fees. Defendant points out that, although he argued to the trial court that there was \u201cno indication\u201d in the record that he could \u201cpay those attorney fees now or in the future,\u201d the court ordered him to pay $1,300 in attorney fees. According to defendant, all \u201cof the information in the record concerning [his] financial circumstances showed that [he] was and would continue to be impoverished,\u201d and, consequently, there was no information in the record to support a finding that he \u201cis or may be able\u201d to pay the attorney fees. ORS 151.505(3) (\u201cThe court may not require a person to pay costs under this section unless the person is or may be able to pay the costs.\u201d); ORS 161.665(4) (\u201cThe court may not sentence a defendant to pay costs under this section unless the defendant is or may be able to pay them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The state concedes that, under our case law, \u201cthe trial court erred by imposing $1,300 in attorney fees where the record was silent as to [defendant\u2019s] ability to pay them.\u201d We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>See State v. Pendergrapht, </em>251 Or App 630, 634, 284 P3d 573 (2012) (\u201c[A] court cannot impose attorney fees based on a record that is silent regarding the defendant\u2019s ability to pay those fees.\u201d); <em>State v. Kanuch, </em>231 Or App 20, 24, 217 P3d 1082 (2009) (the state \u201cbears the burden of persuasion and the obligation to make a record\u201d regarding a defendant\u2019s ability to pay attorney fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
