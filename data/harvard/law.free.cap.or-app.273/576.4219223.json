Defendant concedes that he did not make the argument that he now makes on appeal when he appeared before the trial court, but he asks us to exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s plain error. <em>See Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991) (court may exercise its discretion to review an unpreserved error of law that is obvious and that appears on the face of the record). We conclude that, because the claimed error is not obvious in this case, it does not satisfy all three requirements of the first step of plain error review, and we may not review it. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">While defendant was on probation, police officers found him in possession of a knife and marijuana, and the state moved for an order to show cause why defendant\u2019s probation should not be revoked. On the morning of August 27, 2012, the court held a show cause hearing, found that defendant had violated conditions of his probation, and revoked defendant\u2019s probation. At a later point in the day, the court \u201chad second thoughts\u201d about its decision and wrote' \u201cVACATE\u201d across the face of the judgment revoking defendant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">On August 28, 2012, the prosecutor sent an email to the court and defense counsel, raising the issue of \u201cthe jurisdiction of the trial court in changing a sentence\u201d and suggesting that the court did not have the statutory authority to vacate its judgment. The prosecutor attached to the email a brief, which had been prepared for a different case and which presented a lengthy analysis of ORS 138.083, which provides, in part, that a \u201csentencing court retains authority irrespective of any notice of appeal after entry of judgment of conviction to modify its judgment and sentence to correct any arithmetic or clerical errors or to delete or modify any erroneous term in the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">On August 29, 2012, the court held a hearing on the matter, during which neither party advanced any argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>on the record regarding the trial court\u2019s authority to vacate its judgment. The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\">\u201cIn the case, I originally revoked probation and then had second thoughts about it, vacated or attempted to vacate my order which revoked probation and, [the prosecutor suggested] that maybe I didn\u2019t have the statutory authority to do that. And * * * I\u2019ve had a chance to take a further look at the statute [ORS 138.083] and although I think I ought to have the statutory authority to do that, as I read the statute, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">\u201cAnd because of that, I\u2019m going to reinstate my original decision which was made on the 27th, two days ago and revoke probation. I want to make it clear on the record that I\u2019m doing this because I think the statute requires me to do it. I am not doing this as an exercise of discretion. And so it\u2019s * * * clearly [a question] * * * which the defendant\u2019s entitled to appeal if he feels I\u2019ve made a mistake. And he should be aware that I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve made a mistake, so that this would be an appropriate matter to raise on appeal in my view. And the DA\u2019s office probably doesn\u2019t mind that one way or the other, but I just want to make it very clear that I\u2019m doing this because I think I have to. That would be the order of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In accordance with that conclusion, a judgment of revocation was entered on August 30, 2012, withdrawing the vacated judgment of revocation. That judgment was later amended to correct a clerical error, and an amended judgment of revocation was entered on September 7, 2012, again withdrawing the vacated judgment of revocation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Defendant argues for the first time on appeal that the issue in this case is governed by ORS 137.010(6), which provides that \u201c[t]he power of the judge of any court to suspend execution of any part of a sentence or to sentence any person convicted of a crime to probation shall continue until the person is delivered to the custody of the Department of Corrections [DOC].\u201d \u201cA prison sentence is executed when the offender is placed in the custody of the Oregon Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>of Corrections.\u201d <em>State v. Hoffmeister, </em>164 Or App 192, 196 n 2, 990 P2d 910 (1999) (citing ORS 137.010(6)). Based on ORS 137.010(6), defendant contends that the court\u2019s authority to vacate its original judgment of revocation depended on whether the judgment had been \u201cexecuted\u201d \u2014 that is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\">\u201cdepended entirely upon whether defendant had been transported to the physical custody of the DOC before the court vacated its judgment. If he had, the original judgment was executed and was no longer subject to modification. If he had not, the judgment was not yet executed, and the court\u2019s order vacating the original judgment was valid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Thus, according to defendant, \u201c[t]he trial court erred in concluding that it lacked authority to vacate its judgment without determining whether the judgment had been executed\u201d \u2014 that is, without determining, as a factual matter, whether defendant had been delivered to the custody of the DOC by the time that the court attempted to vacate its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Defendant concedes that he did not argue to the trial court \u201cthat the court was required to determine whether the court\u2019s original judgment had been executed before concluding that it lacked authority to vacate [,]\u201d apparently acknowledging that he did not preserve that argument for appeal. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court *** provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the record.\u201d); <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (to preserve an argument for review, \u201ca party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted\u201d). Nevertheless, defendant contends that the court committed plain error, and he asks us to exercise our discretion to correct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">As the Oregon Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">\u201cDetermining whether a trial court committed plain error involves a two-step analysis. The first step incorporates the following three requirements: (1) the claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>error is an error of law, (2) the claimed error is obvious, not reasonably in dispute, and (3) it appears on the face of the record, i.e., the reviewing court * * * need not go outside the record to identify the error or choose between competing inferences, and the facts constituting the error are irrefutable. If all the requirements of the first step are satisfied, then the court proceeds to the second step, where it must decide whether to exercise its discretion to consider or not to consider the error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><em>State v. Gornick, </em>340 Or 160, 166, 130 P3d 780 (2006) (internal quotation marks, citations, brackets, and footnote omitted). If all three requirements of the first step are not satisfied, the claimed error does not qualify for plain error review, and a court may not review it. <em>See id. </em>at 170 (determining that one of the plain error requirements was not satisfied and concluding that this court should not have considered the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Defendant asserts that the claimed error in this case qualifies for plain error review because it meets all three requirements of the first step of plain error review. As to the first requirement, defendant argues that \u201cthe error defendant identifies \u2014 the trial court\u2019s conclusion that [it] lacked authority to vacate its judgment without determining whether the judgment had been executed \u2014 is a question of law.\u201d As to the second requirement, defendant argues that \u201cthe legal points at issue are not reasonably in dispute.\u201d In defendant\u2019s view, \u201cthe trial court\u2019s implicit legal conclusion that the judgment had been executed was unsupportable\u201d because there was no \u201cevidence that defendant was delivered to the custody of the DOC before the trial court vacated its judgment.\u201d As to the third requirement, defendant argues that \u201cthe facts comprising the error \u2014 the lack of record regarding whether the judgment had been executed \u2014 are apparent from the face of the record.\u201d The state responds that the claimed error does not qualify for plain error review, in part, because it is not \u201cobvious\u201d that the trial court erred as defendant now claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Before considering whether the claimed error qualifies for plain error review, we pause to clarify the nature of the claimed error. As noted, defendant argues that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in concluding that it lacked authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>vacate its judgment without determining whether the judgment had been executed.\u201d By framing the claimed error in those terms, defendant is not arguing that the trial court erred when it determined that it lacked authority to vacate its judgment and then vacated its judgment. Indeed, defendant appears to acknowledge that the court may not have erred in that regard. As noted, defendant states that, if \u201cdefendant had been transported to the physical custody of the DOC before the court vacated its judgment[,] *** the original judgment was executed and was no longer subject to modification.\u201d Defendant\u2019s apparent acknowledgement of that point is well taken; because it is possible that the court\u2019s judgment was, in defendant\u2019s words, \u201cno longer subject to modification\u201d under the provisions of ORS 137.010(6), the court very well may have lacked authority to vacate its judgment. In that event, the court\u2019s conclusion was correct and the court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Rather than assigning error to the court\u2019s substantive decision that it lacked authority to vacate its judgment, defendant assigns error to the court\u2019s procedural failure to make factual findings to support that decision. Stated another way, defendant argues that the court erred in failing to make a factual finding, on the record, as to whether defendant had been delivered to the custody of DOC by the time that the court attempted to vacate its judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is not disputed that the court made no such finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Having clarified the nature of the claimed error, we now consider whether the claimed error qualifies for plain error review. As noted, the first requirement is that \u201cthe claimed error is an error of law.\u201d <em>Gornick, </em>340 Or at 166 (brackets and citations omitted). The claimed error in this case meets that requirement, because, whether a statute obliges a court to make such a finding is a legal,question, and, thus, the failure to fulfill that obligation would be an error of law. <em>See Hickam and Hickam, </em>223 Or App 302, 305, 196 P3d 63 (2008) (stating that it was a \u201clegal requirement\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>for the trial court to make certain findings under ORS 107.105(1) (b) and describing the court\u2019s failure to make those required findings as an \u201cerror of law\u201d). The third requirement is that the claimed error \u201cappears on the face of the record, <em>i.e., </em>the reviewing court *** need not go outside the record to identify the error or choose between competing inferences, and the facts constituting the error are irrefutable.\u201d <em>Gornick, </em>340 Or at 166 (brackets and citations omitted). The claimed error in this case also meets that requirement because, in the words of defendant, \u201cthe lack of record regarding whether the judgment had been executed\u201d \u2014 appears on the face of the record. In other words, we need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to determine that the court made no finding, on the record, as to whether defendant had been delivered to the custody of DOC by the time that the court attempted to vacate its judgment, and the fact constituting the claimed error \u2014 the lack of such a record \u2014 is irrefutable. <em>See State v. Coverstone, </em>260 Or App 714, 716, 320 P3d 670 (2014) (rejecting the state\u2019s argument that the claimed error did not appear on the face of the record where the record was \u201csilent as to defendant\u2019s ability to pay the attorney fees ordered\u201d and concluding, in part, that it was \u201capparent from the record\u201d that the court \u201cfailed to comply with the statutory requirement that, before imposing attorney fees, it find that defendant \u2018is or may be able to\u2019 pay the fees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The remaining question is whether the claimed error meets the second requirement for plain error review\u2014 that is, whether \u201cthe claimed error is obvious, not reasonably in dispute [.]\u201d <em>Gornick, </em>340 Or at 166 (brackets and citations omitted). The text of a statute controls whether a court is required to make factual findings. For example, in determining the disposition in a juvenile delinquency case, a court is guided by ORS 419C.411, which provides that a court \u201cshall consider\u201d certain enumerated factors and \u201cmay consider\u201d other factors. When construing that statute, we have concluded that a court is not required \u201cto make detailed findings on the record to support its dispositional determination.\u201d <em>See State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Rial, </em>181 Or App 249, 256-57, 46 P3d 217 (2002) (stating that ORS 419C.411 did not \u201cexpressly require the court to make detailed findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>on the record to support its dispositional determination\u201d and declining to construe the statute to impose such a requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">As noted, defendant advances his appellate argument under ORS 137.010 (6), which provides that \u201c [t]he power of the judge of any court to suspend execution of any part of a sentence or to sentence any person convicted of a crime to probation shall continue until the person is delivered to the custody of the Department of Corrections.\u201d As we have discussed, by assigning error to \u201cthe lack of record regarding whether the judgment had been executed [,]\u201d defendant now contends that the court was required to make a factual finding, on the record, as to whether defendant had been delivered to the custody of DOC by the time that the court attempted to vacate its judgment. But the statute does not expressly require a court to make a specific finding, on the record, as to whether a judgment has been executed. Indeed, the statute does not require a court to make any findings. Thus, it is not obvious that the court erred as defendant claims, and the claimed error does not meet the second requirement for plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In sum, because the claimed error is not obvious in this case, it does not satisfy all three requirements of the first step of plain error review, and we may not review it. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-8\"> Two judges were involved in this case. The judge who presided over the hearings and signed the initial judgments of revocation was Judge W. Michael Gillette. The judge who signed the amended judgment of revocation was Judge Aubrey J. Broyles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\"> In his brief, defendant frames the first \u201cQuestion Presented\u201d as follows: \u201cAre factual findings regarding whether a criminal defendant was delivered to the physical custody of the Department of Corrections (DOC) required before a sentencing court may conclude that it lacks authority to vacate a previously entered judgment?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
