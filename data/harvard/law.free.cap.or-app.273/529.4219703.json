A general judgment of foreclosure was entered in 2004 and a supplemental judgment for costs and attorney fees was entered in 2005, but the sheriffs sale did not occur until 2011. In the interim period, plaintiff \u2014 a successor to the lender and trust-deed beneficiary \u2014 paid taxes and other expenses on the property while defendant continued to occupy it. At the 2011 sheriffs sale, plaintiff credit bid an amount that included the advances and that was, therefore, an amount larger than had been included in the money awards in the 2004 and 2005 judgments. The trial court concluded the litigation, post-sale, by (1) ordering that plaintiff could not properly include advances in its credit bid, (2) entering a \u201csecond supplemental general judgment\u201d awarding plaintiff the advances it had made for taxes and certain other expenses,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (3) entering an order in which it purported to apply the excess amount of the credit bid to satisfy that newly entered judgment. On defendant\u2019s appeal, we vacate the \u201csecond supplemental general judgment\u201d and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">A. <em>Events Leading Up To, and Including, the Foreclosure Sale</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">For purposes of our review, the pertinent facts are procedural and undisputed. This is a foreclosure action related to residential real property in Portland. In 2003, plaintiff GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc., filed a complaint for judicial foreclosure against defendant Steven Harris, who held title to the property, and others.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>alleged that defendant had executed a note in the amount of $490,000, secured by a deed of trust on the property in favor of plaintiffs predecessor in interest, and had agreed to make monthly payments on the note for a term of 30 years, starting in 1998.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff alleged that defendant failed to make the required monthly payments starting in October 2002. Consequently, plaintiff claimed, it was due several hundred thousand dollars, including over $400,000 in principle and interest, certain escrow advances, foreclosure costs, undetermined amounts of \u201cprejudgment collection costs,\u201d and attorney fees. Plaintiff sought a judgment foreclosing the deed of trust and awarding the amount of money allegedly due to plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant eventually filed an answer that incorporated affirmative defenses and counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The parties entered a stipulated general judgment of foreclosure and money award in December 2004. That stipulated general judgment provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">\u201cBASED UPON THE STIPULATION OF THE PARTIES,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">\u201cIT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that judgment shall be entered in favor of Plaintiff GreenPoint Mortgage Funding (GreenPoint), against Defendants Steven D.

Harris shall be responsible for all outstanding property taxes, and all pro-rata property taxes that accrue up to the date of foreclosure sale. <em>In the event Defendant Steven D. Harris fails to pay the taxes, Greenpoint may advance sums for the payment of taxes, and may add the advance to the amount of Greenpoint\u2019s credit bid or may set forth the amount in Supplemental General Judgment.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">The judgment included a money award in plaintiffs favor with a principal amount of $600,859.73, plus prejudgment and postjudgment interest, plus costs and attorney fees to be determined under ORCP 68 and set forth in a supplemental judgment. Plaintiff later petitioned for attorney fees and costs, and the trial court entered a supplemental judgment for fees and costs in early 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">Several years passed before the property was partitioned, leading to delay of the foreclosure sale. In March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>2011, plaintiff filed a \u201cpraecipe for execution\u201d in the trial court, asking the court \u201cto issue an execution\u201d to the sheriff on the 2004 stipulated general judgment of foreclosure (as amended to reflect the legal description of the property post-partition). In that praecipe, plaintiff averred that the stipulated general judgment entitled it to recover, from proceeds from sale of the property, \u201cthe costs of the sale, *** satisfaction of Plaintiffs Money Award of $600,859.73, together with pre-judgment and post-judgment interest * * *, plus [certain costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, including those associated with partitioning the property], along with costs of this writ, sheriffs fees, sales costs, and all other recoverable costs pursuant to law.\u201d Plaintiff also submitted a \u201cwrit of execution in foreclosure,\u201d later signed by the trial court administrator, which commanded the sheriff to sell the property, and which included similar information about the sums owed to plaintiff. Neither the praecipe nor the writ mentioned the advances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">The sheriff auctioned the property in April 2011. Plaintiff submitted a credit bid for the property, which was the highest bid, and it purchased the property by way of its credit bid of $914,332.81. The sheriff detailed the terms of the sale in a \u201creturn on real property sale\u201d filed in the trial court later that month. Later proceedings revealed that plaintiffs credit bid included $97,692.59 in advances, including $93,761.39 in taxes, amounts that were not included in the money award either in the 2004 stipulated general judgment of foreclosure or in the 2005 supplemental judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">B. <em>Post-Sale Events</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Shortly after plaintiff successfully credit bid for the property, defendant objected to the sheriffs return and asked the trial court not to confirm the sale. In his objection, defendant asserted that, under ORS 18.936, plaintiff properly could credit bid only up to an amount equaling the sum of any money awards, costs and attorney fees, and the costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>of sale. That amount, according to defendant, totaled only $816,640.22. Because plaintiff had successfully credit bid more than that amount \u2014 $914,332.81\u2014defendant argued that the excess $97,692.59 \u201cmust be collected from Plaintiff in cash, and distributed (pursuant to ORS 18.950) to [defendant] and any remaining judgment or lien creditors.\u201d Defendant suggested that, if plaintiff had wanted to recover the money it advanced, it should have obtained a supplemental judgment before the foreclosure sale that included a money award for the amount of the advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">In response to defendant\u2019s objection, plaintiff moved for an order confirming the sale. Plaintiff argued that it had properly included advances in the amount it credit bid at the sheriffs sale because the 2004 stipulated general judgment expressly provided that plaintiff could do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Plaintiff also advanced an alternative argument, in case the trial court determined that plaintiffs inclusion of taxes and insurance in the credit bid had been improper. In that event, plaintiff argued, the court \u201cshould allow Plaintiff to supplement its judgment to include taxes and insurance in the money award, and apply the proceeds of the sale to satisfy the supplemental judgment.\u201d In conjunction with that argument, plaintiff moved \u201cfor entry of a Second Supplemental General Judgment and Money Award,\u201d to include amounts compensating plaintiff for the money it had advanced for taxes and insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">In response to plaintiffs motion, defendant expressed agreement that the circuit court should confirm the sheriffs sale. He took a different view, however, regarding the result of confirmation. According to defendant, \u201c[b]ecause Plaintiff bid more than its Money Award (ORS 18.934(2)), Plaintiff must be ordered to tender the excess amount that the Sheriff should have collected, which amount must be disbursed.\u201d Consistently with that argument, defendant moved for disbursement of funds, seeking an order directing the sheriff to distribute the $97,692.59 by which plaintiff\u2019s credit bid exceeded the amount that defendant argued was permissible. Defendant also opposed plaintiffs motion for entry of a \u201csupplemental general judgment and money award\u201d on several grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>In reply, plaintiff argued that \u201cORS 18.954 allow[ed] the court to order in the Stipulated Judgment that Plaintiff may include advances in the credit bid, even if they are not included in the money award.\u201d Plaintiff also argued that defendant was estopped \u201cfrom taking a position after the execution sale that is inconsistent with the position he successfully asserted in the [2004] Stipulated Judgment.\u201d Finally, plaintiff reiterated its argument that, if the court found that proceeds from the sale existed because plaintiff should not have included taxes and insurance in the credit bid, the court should include those advances \u201cin a supplemental judgment award and apply the proceeds to the award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">The circuit court held an initial hearing on the pending motions in July 2011. At that hearing, defendant acknowledged that ORS 18.936 \u2014 the statute that limits the amounts that creditors can credit bid \u2014 had not been enacted until after the stipulated general judgment was entered in this case, and that the statute had an effective date of January 1, 2006. Nonetheless, he argued, \u201cby virtue of the 2006 legislative change, the procedure that has to be followed on the 2004 judgment is modified and the person holding the judgment can\u2019t rely on the law as it existed in 2004.\u201d Defendant did not dispute plaintiff\u2019s assertion that the stipulated judgment itself contemplated that plaintiffs credit bid could include amounts for property taxes that defendant should have paid, but did not, during the delay attributable to partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">At the end of the hearing, the trial court orally denied defendant\u2019s \u201cmotion on the writ\u201d and ordered that the sale would be confirmed. At some point, plaintiff submitted a proposed form of judgment, to which defendant objected. The court ordered a rehearing on the parties\u2019 motions, which was held in August 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">At that second hearing, defendant again objected to the return of the second amended writ of execution, because the sheriff had accepted a credit bid of \u201ca hundred thousand dollars more than they\u2019re allowed to credit bid under the statute,\u201d which confines the credit bid to the money award, plus certain specified costs and fees. Defendant argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the sheriff should have collected cash making up the difference between the actual bid and sale amount and the credit-bid amount permissible under ORS 18.936.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The trial court orally granted plaintiffs motion to confirm the sale. It sustained defendant\u2019s objection to the sheriffs return of the writ of execution on the ground that \u201cthe second amended writ of execution controls what may be included\u201d in the credit bid. However, the court denied defendant\u2019s motions to disburse the excess $97,692.59. Instead, the court allowed plaintiffs motion for a second supplemental judgment, to include advances \u201cas provided for in the original judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">After that hearing, plaintiff submitted a proposed \u201csecond supplemental general judgment\u201d for the trial court\u2019s consideration. In conjunction with approving that proposed judgment, the court issued an \u201corder on rehearing\u201d that provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">\u201cThe Court, having considered the motions and the record herein, and being fully advised, makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201c1. The Stipulated Judgment did not specify insurance payments as an advance and therefore Plaintiffs insurance payments may not be included in the Second Supplemental Judgment and Money Award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">\u201c2. The Second Supplemental General Judgment and Money Award shall have the priority of the original Stipulated Judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">\u201c3.

The court simultaneously signed and entered the \u201csecond supplemental general judgment,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">\u201cOn December 23,2004, a Stipulated General Judgment of Foreclosure and Money Award was entered herein in favor of <em>plaintiff * * * </em>and against defendants Steven D. Harris, Rebecca J. Harris, and the State of Oregon Department of Revenue. On January 31, 2005, a Supplemental Judgment was entered. Pursuant to the Order of this Court, the Stipulated General Judgment of Foreclosure and Money Award is supplemented as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">\u201cIT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiff is awarded advances in the amount of $114,269.98 (the sum of $93,761.39 for taxes and $20,508.59 for sewer assessments), and attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $10,575 (attorney fees incurred from November 21, 2008 through *** the date of notification to Plaintiffs counsel of the recording of the partition).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">It is that judgment from which defendant appeals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>II. THE PARTIES\u2019 ARGUMENTS ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">In his first assignment of error, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s entry of the October 11, 2011, \u201csecond supplemental general judgment.\u201d Defendant contends that, once the foreclosure sale had occurred, \u201cthere was no legal basis for supplementing that money award with \u2018taxes\u2019 or \u2018insurance.\u2019\u201d Indeed, defendant asserts, once the property was sold, ORS 86.770 \u2014 the statute that generally prohibits entry of deficiency judgments after judicial foreclosure on a residential trust deed \u2014 precluded the trial court from awarding any additional money to plaintiff. In his second assignment of error, defendant asserts that the trial court erred when it denied his motion \u201cto order Plaintiff to deposit $97,692.59 with the Sheriff, and to have the Sheriff disburse those funds to junior lien creditors and/or to Defendant Harris.\u201d Defendant points out that the trial court agreed with him that plaintiff could not properly credit bid an amount exceeding that specified in the second amended writ of execution. Accordingly, defendant argues, ORS 18.936 required plaintiff to tender the excess amount \u2014 $97,692.59\u2014to the sheriff, who should have then distributed those proceeds of sale \u201cto junior lienholders, and/or to [defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">On the merits, plaintiff responds to defendant\u2019s first assignment of error by asserting that it was entitled to include advances in its credit bid under the terms of the 2004 stipulated general judgment. Plaintiff also cites ORS 18.936, arguing that it allows for \u201cflexibility\u201d in credit bids \u201cto encompass recoverable costs\u201d \u2014 like the advances in this case \u2014 despite those amounts not being included in a money award. Alternatively, plaintiff argues that ORS 18.954 gave the trial court discretion to enter the 2011 judgment after the foreclosure sale. In response to defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, plaintiff asserts simply that the two assignments \u201care mirror images of each other,\u201d suggesting that this court should reject the second assignment for the same reasons that plaintiff argues this court should reject the first.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">A. <em>Judgments, Judicial-Foreclosure Proceedings, and Sheriffs Sales</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Before addressing the particular questions presented in this procedurally unusual case, we review some of the general legal principles that gdvern the form and content of judgments (including foreclosure judgments), the execution of those judgments, and foreclosure sales. Our analysis is of the law as it existed in 2011, when the trial court issued its challenged order and judgment. Accordingly, all statutory citations in this opinion are to the 2011 versions of the Oregon Revised Statutes, except as otherwise noted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Because this case involves enforcement of a judgment, as reflected in a judgment document, and the trial court\u2019s entry of a document titled a \u201csecond supplemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>general judgment,\u201d we begin by considering the statutes that specify what judgment documents may \u2014 and may not\u2014 include. A \u201cjudgment document\u201d incorporates a court\u2019s judgment, ORS 18.005(9), that is, its \u201cconcluding decision *** on one or more requests for relief[.]\u201d ORS 18.005(8). In civil actions, a judgment document generally can come in only one of three forms: \u201ca limited judgment, a general judgment or a supplemental judgment.\u201d ORS 18.038(2). As pertinent here, a general judgment \u201cmeans the judgment entered by a court that decides all requests for relief\u2019 except for requests previously decided by limited judgment and requests that may be decided by supplemental judgment. ORS 18.005(7). A supplemental judgment is \u201ca judgment that may be rendered after a general judgment pursuant to a legal authority.\u201d ORS 18.005(17).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">A judgment that awards money to a party creates a judgment lien only if it includes \u201ca separate section clearly labeled as a money award.\u201d ORS 18.042(1). If the judgment awards money but does not include that separate section, the judgment \u201cdoes not create a judgment lien but may be enforced by any other judgment remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The separate \u201cmoney award\u201d section in the judgment must include, among other things, the \u201camount of money awarded in the judgment\u201d and any owed interest, arrearages, costs, or attorney fees. ORS 18.042(2)(d) - (h). Except in circumstances not pertinent here, the separate \u201cmoney award\u201d section of the judgment may not include any other provision. ORS 18.042(4). A trial court may not sign a proposed judgment document that does not comply with those requirements. ORS 18.052(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">We turn to the statutes that more specifically govern judicial foreclosure of trust deeds, starting with ORS 86.705(7), which provides that a trust deed is a deed executed under the Oregon Trust Deed Act (OTDA) \u201cthat conveys an interest in real property to a trustee in trust to secure the performance of an obligation the grantor or other person named in the deed owes to a beneficiary.\u201d <em>See generally Brandrup v. ReconTrust Co., </em>353 Or 668, 676-78, 303 P3d 301 (2013) (discussing the OTDA). That is, the trust deed creates a lien on the property that secures the borrower\u2019s obligation to repay the loan obtained from the beneficiary, <em>i.e., </em>the lender. <em>Hucke v.

Although a sheriff normally accepts payment for property sold at a sheriffs sale by \u201ccashier\u2019s check or cash,\u201d ORS 18.938(1), a practice of \u201ccredit bidding\u201d has developed, by which a creditor \u201cbid[s] for the property using the debt it is owed to offset the purchase price,\u201d <em>RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, </em>_ US _, 132 S Ct 2065, 2069, 182 L Ed 2d 967 (2012). It appears that, before 2006, no Oregon statute expressly authorized creditors to participate in sheriffs sales through credit bids, although \u2014 as the 2004 stipulated general judgment reflects \u2014 credit bidding occurred nonetheless. In 2005, the legislature enacted ORS 18.936(1), which became effective on January 1, 2006, and which specifically governs the credit-bidding practice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">\u201cThe judgment creditor who requested issuance of the writ of execution may make oral bids for property to be sold at an execution sale. If the oral bid of the judgment creditor is the highest bid, the judgment creditor need not make any payment to the sheriff other than for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">\u201c(a) Any unpaid sheriffs fees for the execution sale;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">\u201c(b) The amount of an exemption claimed by the debtor that the judgment creditor agrees to or that a court has determined applies to the property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">\u201c(c) Any amount bid by the judgment creditor that exceeds the full amount owing on the money award, calculated as of the date that the sale is to be conducted, plus the costs of the sale as described in ORS 18.950(2) that have been paid by the judgment creditor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">Thus, a judgment creditor who purchases real property through a credit bid that consists only of \u201cthe full amount owing on the money award,\u201d plus the costs of sale that the creditor already has paid, need not pay the sheriff for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>property by cashier\u2019s check or cash. Rather, the judgment creditor pays the sheriff only for any amount it bid in <em>excess </em>of that amount (as well as for any unpaid sheriffs fees or an exemption of the debtor).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">After the sale has occurred, the sheriff makes a return on the writ of execution to the trial court administrator. ORS 18.872. After deducting certain fees and costs of the sale, \u201cthe sheriff shall deliver all net proceeds from an execution sale to the court administrator with the sheriffs return on the writ.\u201d ORS 18.950(1). Once the sheriff has made the return on the writ, the sale of real property \u201cis conclusively established to have been conducted in the manner [statutorily] required * * * unless the judgment debtor * * * files an objection to the sale no later than 10 days after the filing of the sheriffs return.\u201d ORS 18.948(1). If the judgment debtor objects to the sale, the court schedules a hearing and, after that hearing, \u201cshall grant an order confirming the sale unless the person objecting to the sale establishes that the sale was not conducted in a manner that substantially conformed with the manner required by law, and that as a result it was probable that the person suffered damage.\u201d ORS 18.948(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">If the sheriff has delivered net proceeds from the sale, the court \u201cshall enter an order of distribution for the proceeds.\u201d ORS 18.950(1). Once the underlying judgment has been satisfied, \u201cthe court administrator shall pay the remaining proceeds as directed by the court in the order of distribution.\u201d ORS 18.950(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">B. <em>Application of the Law to the Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">lpmWith that background in mind, we consider defendant\u2019s challenges to the October 11, 2011, \u201csecond supplemental general judgment\u201d and the associated order on rehearing. The complicating factor here is that the 2004 stipulated general judgment included provisions authorizing plaintiff to recover any advances it made for tax payments either by credit bid or through entry of a supplemental judgment. Before addressing the effect of those stipulated provisions, we consider what the trial court properly could have done if this were a more ordinary case, that is, if the general judgment of foreclosure had <em>not </em>included those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>In that hypothetical \u201cordinary\u201d case, if the lender credit bid more than the \u201cfull amount owing on the money award, calculated as of the date that the sale is to be conducted,\u201d plus any sale costs that the lender already had paid, then the lender would be required to pay that excess amount to the sheriff as proceeds of the sale. ORS 18.936. Moreover, the \u201cfull amount owing on the money award\u201d that created a lien subject to foreclosure could not properly include anything other than \u201cthe amount awarded in the judgment,\u201d plus certain specified interest, arrearages, costs and attorney fees. ORS 18.042(1), (2), (4). Thus, if the lender made advances, after entry of the foreclosure judgment and money award, the lender would not be able to recover those advances through a credit bid unless it <em>first </em>obtained a supplemental judgment that included a money award for those advances. If the lender credit bid an amount that included the advances without first obtaining such a supplemental judgment (and including that supplemental judgment in the foreclosure proceedings), the lender would be required to pay the sheriff the amount exceeding the \u201cfull amount owing on the money award,\u201d and that amount \u2014 now proceeds of the sale \u2014 would have to be distributed according to an order of distribution entered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Thus, if this case fit that \u201cordinary\u201d fact pattern, the trial court would have been required to enter an order of distribution and to distribute the $97,692.59 accordingly. That is, although defendant may or may not have correctly identified <em>to whom </em>the proceeds of sale would have to be distributed pursuant to such an order \u2014 a topic on which we express no opinion \u2014 he would have been correct in arguing that the trial court was required to identify the excess $97,692.59 as proceeds of sale and to distribute them by order in accordance with that designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Moreover, the court could not have accomplished its apparent goal of awarding advances to plaintiff by entering a post-sale judgment including that award, even if it were properly labeled as a \u201csupplemental judgment.\u201d True, when plaintiff made the advances by paying taxes, the advances became part of the debt that defendant owed plaintiff and that was secured by the trust deed. <em>See </em>ORS 86.050 (\u201cWhenever a mortgagor fails to pay when due any taxes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>* * * necessary to be paid for the protection of the lien of a mortgagee, the mortgagee may pay the same, and such payments shall be added to the mortgage debt and secured by the mortgage held by the mortgagee * * * \u201d). Moreover, plaintiff could have obtained a second supplemental judgment <em>before </em>the sheriffs sale that included a money award for the advances; had it done so, its credit bid properly could have included that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">However, plaintiff did not do that. Again, we first address the implications of plaintiffs inaction as though this were the hypothetical \u201cordinary\u201d case in which the underlying foreclosure judgment did not include the provisions about future advances. In those circumstances, once the property was sold through the sheriffs sale, the trial court would have had to order disbursement of the amount of plaintiffs credit bid that exceeded the amount of the money award, plus costs, pursuant to an order of distribution. In other words, plaintiff could have recovered only that latter amount \u2014 the money award plus costs \u2014 as a direct result of the sheriffs sale. Because that amount was less than the total amount that defendant owed plaintiff, given his debt to plaintiff for the advances for taxes, the sheriffs sale would have left a \u201cdeficiency\u201d \u2014 it would not have made plaintiff whole. And under ORS 86.770(2), the \u201canti-deficiency statute,\u201d plaintiff could not have recovered that deficiency through entry of a new, post-sale judgment. <em>See </em>ORS 86.770(2) (\u201cExcept in [circumstances not applicable here], * * * after a judicial foreclosure of a residential trust deed, an action for a deficiency may not be brought or a judgment entered against the grantor\u201d on any \u201cobligation secured by the trust deed for the property that was subject to * * * the judicial foreclosure [.] \u201d); <em>Cottage Grove Apartment Investers v. Brandenfels, </em>69 Or App 192, 197-98, 684 P2d 1235 (1984) (where a foreclosed deed of trust provided that the grantor would pay the attorney fees associated with any future foreclosure proceedings, and the proceeds from a later foreclosure sale were insufficient to satisfy an award of those fees, the fees were \u201can obligation secured by the trust deed,\u201d and ORS 86.770(2) precluded the trial court from entering a judgment for those fees that survived the foreclosure sale).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>In sum, if it were not for the provision in the 2004 stipulated general judgment specifying that plaintiff could recover any advances it made for taxes through a credit bid, we readily would conclude that the trial court erred in entering the \u201csecond supplemental general judgment\u201d and in denying defendant\u2019s motion for distribution of sale proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The remaining question, then, is whether that provision of the 2004 stipulated general judgment affects the result of this appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In defending the trial court\u2019s resolution of the case, plaintiff first argues that ORS 18.954 gave the court discretion to enter the second supplemental judgment after the sheriffs sale, to avoid what otherwise would be an inequitable result, given the terms of the 2004 stipulated general judgment. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">\u201cA court, by the terms of a judgment or order, may direct that an execution sale under a specific judgment be conducted in a manner different than the manner specified by ORS 18.860 to 18.993. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may by court rule provide that execution sales be conducted in a manner different than the manner specified by ORS 18.860 to 18.993.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">ORS 18.954.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">That statute, by its terms, relates to the manner in which execution sales are conducted. Entry of a \u201csupplemental general judgment\u201d after the sale is not part of the manner in which the sale is conducted. Moreover, when ORS 18.954 discusses the \u201cmanner\u201d of conducting a sale that the trial court has discretion to change, it refers to ORS 18.860 to 18.993, the statutes that govern writs of execution, the creditor\u2019s instructions to sheriff, the manner in which the sheriff can levy on property, the execution sale itself (including requirements for notice of sale and confirmation of sale), and redemption. None of those statutes relates to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>permissible form or content of the judgment that is being foreclosed or that will be satisfied through proceeds of the sale. We conclude that \u2014 whatever the scope of a court\u2019s discretion under ORS 18.954 \u2014 it does not extend to entering a \u201csupplemental general judgment\u201d \u2014 or even a properly designated \u201csupplemental judgment\u201d \u2014 after a sheriffs sale, awarding the judgment creditor sums to be paid from the proceeds of the sale that has already occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Plaintiff also asserts that, because its credit bid \u201cwas specifically authorized\u201d by the 2004 stipulated general judgment, \u201cthe inclusion of the advances in the credit bid is * * * valid\u201d even without entry of the \u201csecond supplemental general judgment.\u201d Plaintiff does not elaborate on that argument, except to insist that inclusion of that provision in the 2004 judgment means that it would be inequitable for this court to do anything other than affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">To the extent that plaintiff suggests that <em>the trial court </em>had discretion, either under ORS 18.954 or based on some other unidentified equitable principle, to allow the full credit bid to stand, plaintiff\u2019s argument cannot prevail for the simple reason that the trial court did not take that course. To the contrary, the trial court <em>sustained </em>defendant\u2019s objection to the sheriffs return on the writ of execution on the ground that \u201cthe Second Amended Writ of Execution controls what may be included in the credit bid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Plaintiff also appears to assert that, as a matter of law, it was entitled to include the advances in its credit bid pursuant to the terms of the 2004 stipulated general judgment, notwithstanding ORS 18.936 \u2014 which plaintiff suggests should not apply, given the stipulated judgment\u2014 and despite having not included that amount in the writ of execution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In that regard, plaintiff suggests that, \u201ceven if [we determine] that entry of the Second Supplemental Judgment itself was improper,\u201d we should nonetheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>conclude that \u201cinclusion of the advances in the credit bid [was] still valid.\u201d Plaintiff does not, however, explain what <em>result </em>would follow from such a legal conclusion. We assume that plaintiff must be suggesting that \u2014 even if we vacated the \u201csecond supplemental general judgment\u201d \u2014 we should somehow affirm the <em>practical </em>result of the trial court\u2019s order and judgment by holding that plaintiff is entitled to retain the excess $97,692.59 that it included in its credit bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">We perceive at least three problems with any such argument. First, it would amount to a request that, if we agreed with defendant that the trial court erred in entering the October 2011 judgment, we should reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling (made in the context of sustaining defendant\u2019s objection to the sheriffs return of the writ of execution) that plaintiffs credit bid was improper. If plaintiff wished to challenge that intermediate ruling of the trial court, it was required to do so by a cross-assignment of error. It did not.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Second, plaintiff has not explained why the limitations on credit bids set out in ORS 18.936 do not apply to all sheriffs sales that occur after that statute\u2019s effective date, notwithstanding contrary provisions included in earlier judgments. Other than generally appealing to our sense of equity, plaintiff does not engage in any statutory analysis or point to any legal principles explaining why the requirements of ORS 18.936 do not apply to this case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Third, as already noted, plaintiff has not explained what result should follow if we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>agreed that the trial court erred in sustaining defendant\u2019s objection to the return of the writ. The combination of plaintiffs failure to cross-assign error and the lack of any meaningful argument on the applicability of ORS 18.936 leads us to reject any suggestion that we should reverse the trial court\u2019s order on rehearing to the extent that it sustained defendant\u2019s objection to the return of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The trial court lacked authority to enter a \u201csecond supplemental general judgment\u201d both because no such form of judgment can exist, under Oregon law, and because the court lacked authority to enter a judgment after a sheriffs sale awarding plaintiff money to be paid from the proceeds of the sale that had already occurred. Accordingly, we vacate that \u201csecond supplemental general judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We also conclude that, once the trial court had confirmed the sale of the property and sustained defendant\u2019s objection to the sheriffs return of the writ of execution on the ground that plaintiff improperly included advances in its credit bid, the court was required to distribute the excess amount of the bid pursuant to an order of distribution. We reverse the trial court\u2019s contrary ruling, encompassed within its October 2011 order on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Judgment entered on October 11, 2011, vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\"> The exact nature of the other expenses, in addition to taxes, that plaintiff sought to recover has varied to some extent through the course of this litigation. That variance does not matter to our analysis, so we do not describe those other expenses in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-9\"> The complaint also named Rebecca Harris and the Oregon Department of Revenue as defendants, alleging that Rebecca Harris claimed an interest in the property by virtue of a lien for child and spousal support and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Department of Revenue claimed an interest in the property by virtue of several tax liens. Rebecca Harris initially filed an answer, in which she admitted that plaintiff \u201cha [d] a superior lien to hers on the * * * property,\u201d but she did not appear later in the proceedings. By the time the 2011 judgment was entered that is the subject of this appeal, Steven Harris was the only defendant appearing in the case, and he is the only defendant that is a party to this appeal. Accordingly, we refer to defendant Steven Harris simply as \u201cdefendant\u201d throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-10\"> GreenPoint later assigned the judgments it obtained in this case (a 2004 stipulated general judgment of foreclosure and a 2005 supplemental judgment, discussed later in this opinion) to Private Capital Group, LLC.

However, because those earlier filings are not pertinent to our analysis, we do not describe them here, and we refer to the operative documents simply as the praecipe and the writ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b557-10\"> Oregon law does not recognize a \u201csupplemental general judgment.\u201d A judgment may be either a general judgment or a supplemental judgment, but it cannot be both. ORS 18.005(7), (17); ORS 18.038(2). Nonetheless, we have jurisdiction to review defendant\u2019s appeal from that judgment, in which the trial court decided \u201cone or more requests for relief,\u201d ORS 18.005(8) (defining \u201cjudgment\u201d), of a type that \u2014 under ordinary circumstances \u2014 \u201cmay be rendered after a general judgment pursuant to a legal authority.\u201d ORS 18.005(17) (defining \u201csupplemental judgment\u201d). That is, as discussed later in this opinion, a supplemental judgment that follows a general judgment of foreclosure <em>ordinarily </em>may include an award of advances made by the plaintiff after entry of the general judgment, so long as the circumstances of the case provide a basis for that award. <em>See </em>273 Or App at 547. Moreover, the judgment document is \u201cplainly titled as a judgment\u201d and it meets each of the other jurisdictional requirements set forth in ORS 18.245. Thus, the October 11, 2011, judgment is an appealable judgment over which we have jurisdiction, despite being mislabeled. Our jurisdiction over defendant\u2019s appeal from that judgment also gives us authority to review the order on rehearing, which the court entered earlier the same day ORS 19.425.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\"> Plaintiff also argues that this court lacks jurisdiction over defendant\u2019s appeal because parties to a stipulated judgment generally may not appeal that judgment, ORS 19.245(3), and in this case, \u201cthe Second Supplemental General Judgment *** is merely an extension of the original 2004 Stipulated General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Judgment and thus is not appealable.\u201d Based on similar reasoning, plaintiff also argues that the appeal does not present a justiciable controversy, because the 2011 judgment has no effect on plaintiff beyond that of the 2004 stipulated general judgment. We reject those jurisdictional arguments without extended discussion, observing only that defendant has appealed from the 2011 judgment, not from the 2004 stipulated judgment, and it was not until the 2011 judgment and order were entered that any court actually awarded advances to plaintiff and ordered that proceeds of a sale that occurred in 2011 could be applied to satisfy that award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b559-14\"> The 2015 legislature amended some of the statutes related to judicial foreclosure, providing that those amendments \u201capply to foreclosure suits that commence or that are pending on or after the effective date\u201d of the amendments\u2014 that is, June 8, 2015. Or Laws 2015, ch 291, \u00a7 6.

Although the amendments apply to \u201cpending\u201d foreclosure suits, because the amendments relate specifically to acts that occur <em>in the trial courts, </em>we conclude that the legislature intended that the amendments apply only to actions pending in those courts, and not to actions pending on appeal. <em>Cf. Robinson v. Lamb\u2019s Wilsonville Thiftway, </em>332 Or 453, 460, 31 P3d 421 (2001) (concluding that amendments to ORCP 47 C applied \u201conly to actions pending in trial courts\u201d and not to actions pending on appeal, despite a legislative provision stating that the amendments \u201capply to all actions pending on or commenced after\u201d the amendments\u2019 effective date).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b566-9\"><em> </em>The 2004 stipulated general judgment also specified that plaintiff could recover advances through entry of a supplemental judgment.

We reject that argument because, as explained above, the lender can recover, through a credit bid, no more other than \u201cthe full amount owing on the money award\u201d plus costs.
