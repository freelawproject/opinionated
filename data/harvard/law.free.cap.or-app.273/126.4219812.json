N. Equity Sales Company (ONESCO), under ORCP 21 A(8) for failure to state a claim. The trial court determined that ONESCO was exempt from liability by operation of ORS 124.115(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which exempts broker-dealers licensed under ORS 59.005 to 59.541 from liability for civil actions for elder abuse, and was not excepted from the exemption under ORS 124.115(2), which removes the exemption if \u201cthe person is convicted of a crime by reason of the conduct.\u201d The court concluded that ONESCO, as an entity, is a \u201cperson\u201d under the statute but reasoned that, although one of ONESCO\u2019s employees had been convicted of elder abuse, ONESCO itself had not. Without such a conviction, the court concluded that ORS 124.115(2) did not remove ONESCO from the exemption. On appeal, plaintiff argues that \u201cperson\u201d as used in ORS 124.115(2) refers to the people through which an entity acts, not the entity itself.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant responds that \u201cperson\u201d in that section plainly refers to organizational entities. We agree with defendant and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We review a trial court\u2019s dismissal of a claim under ORCP 21 for legal error, assuming the truth of the facts alleged and giving to the nonmoving party the benefit of all inferences that can reasonably be drawn from those facts. <em>Fessler v. Quinn, </em>143 Or App 397, 400, 923 P2d 1294 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The facts are undisputed. Plaintiff brought this action as the personal representative of the estate of Mary Gattuccio. In plaintiffs amended complaint, he alleged that Coleen Averill, who worked for ONESCO selling investment and insurance products, became Gattuccio\u2019s financial and investment advisor and, in that role, wrongfully obtained upwards of $563,851 from Gattuccio. As a result of her conduct, Averill was eventually convicted of 16 criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>offenses. ONESCO was never charged with or convicted of a crime in relation to Averill\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in dismissing his claim because Averill was convicted of crimes resulting from her financial abuse of Gattuccio, and, as an agent of ONESCO, Averill is a \u201cperson\u201d whose conviction causes ONESCO to lose an exemption from liability under ORS 124.115(1). Defendant argues that the trial court did not err because \u201cperson\u201d means only the organizational entities described in ORS 124.115(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Thus, the parties\u2019 dispute on appeal centers on the meaning of the word \u201cperson\u201d as used in ORS 124.115(2). In support of his position that \u201cperson\u201d as used in that section means the people through which an organizational entity acts, plaintiff argues that reading \u201cperson\u201d to mean only organizational entities produces an untenable result because organizational entities are incapable of committing some of the crimes that would be a predicate to liability. The only way to resolve that problem, he contends, is to conclude that \u201cperson\u201d in that section means actual human beings. Moreover, he argues that the legislative history supports that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In response, defendant cites ORS 174.100 for the proposition that the term \u201cperson\u201d includes organizational entities, and ORS 161.170(1) for the proposition that such entities, under certain circumstances, can be convicted of crimes, including those that defendant argues organizational entities are incapable of committing. Ultimately, we agree with defendant that the legislature granted broker-dealers licensed under ORS 59.005 to 59.541 an exemption from actions for elder abuse and that, under the legislature\u2019s scheme, the conviction of such a broker-dealer\u2019s employee for financial abuse of an elderly person would not remove that broker-dealer from that exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">ORS 124.115 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">\u201c(1) Except as provided by subsection (2) of this section, an action under ORS 124.100 may not be brought against:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">\u201c(a) Financial institutions, as defined by ORS 706.008;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u201c(b) A health, care facility, as defined in ORS 442.015;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">\u201c(c) Any facility licensed or registered under ORS chapter 443; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">\u201c(d) Broker-dealers licensed under ORS 59.005 to 59.541.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\u201c(2) An action may be brought under ORS 124.100 against a person listed in subsection (1) of this section if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">\u201c(a) The person is convicted of one of the crimes specified in ORS 124.105 (1); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">\u201c(b) The person engages in conduct constituting financial abuse as described in ORS 124.110, and the person is convicted of a crime by reason of the conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">ORS 174.100 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">\u201cAs used in the statute laws of this state, unless the context or a specially applicable definition requires otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">\u00abHi Hi * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-12\">\u201c(5) \u2018Person\u2019 includes individuals, corporations, associations, firms, partnerships, limited liability companies and joint stock companies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">ORS 161.015 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-14\">\u201cAs used in [the criminal code, <em>et alia,] </em>unless the context requires otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-15\">\u00abH&lt; Hi * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-16\">\u201c\u2018Person\u2019 means a human being and, where appropriate, a public or private corporation, an unincorporated association, a partnership, a government or .a governmental instrumentality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-17\">ORS 161.170(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-18\">\u201cA corporation is guilty of an offense if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-19\">\u201c(a) The conduct constituting the offense is engaged in by an agent of the corporation while acting within the scope of employment and in behalf of the corporation and the offense is a misdemeanor or a violation, or the offense is one defined by a statute that clearly indicates a legislative intent to impose criminal liability on a corporation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>\u201c(b) The conduct constituting the offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty of affirmative performance imposed on corporations by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">\u201c(c) The conduct constituting the offense is engaged in, authorized, solicited, requested, commanded or knowingly tolerated by the board of directors or by a high managerial agent acting within the scope of employment and in behalf of the corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">When interpreting a statute, we apply the methodology set out in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). Under that methodology, we examine \u201cthe text of the statute in its context, along with relevant legislative history, and, if necessary, canons of construction.\u201d <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 75, 261 P3d 1234 (2011). Although we may review the legislative history in the absence of a statutory ambiguity, when the \u201ctext of a statute is truly capable of having only one meaning, no weight can be given to legislative history that suggests \u2014 or even confirms \u2014 that legislators intended something different.\u201d <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 173 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">As mentioned, defendant argues that the plain meaning of ORS 124.115 is dispositive. Defendant begins by noting that ORS 124.115(2) states that \u201c[a]n action may be brought under ORS 124.100 against a person listed in subsection (1).\u201d Turning to ORS 124.115(1), defendant observes that broker-dealers are listed along with other organizational entities and that the applicable definition of \u201cperson\u201d includes organizational entities. Thus, defendant concludes that, under the plain meaning of the statute, \u201ca broker-dealer, as the \u2018person\u2019 listed in [ORS 124.115(1)] cannot be held liable for elder abuse * * * unless <em>it </em>is convicted of one of the enumerated crimes.\u201d (Emphasis in defendant\u2019s brief.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Plaintiffs attack on defendant\u2019s plain meaning argument is two pronged. We reject both prongs before turning to plaintiffs argument regarding the legislative history. First, plaintiff argues that a plain reading of the statute is inadequate because it produces a result that the legislature could not have intended \u2014 namely, that organizational entities would be exempt from liability unless they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>were convicted of crimes of which they are incapable of being convicted. Relatedly, plaintiff argues that both ORS 174.100, which defines \u201cperson\u201d for general purposes, and ORS 161.015, which defines \u201cperson\u201d for the purposes of the criminal code, only require that \u201cperson\u201d means organizational entities where the context does not require otherwise. He argues that here the context requires otherwise because the plain reading leads to the result described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">We reject plaintiffs arguments because plaintiffs premise is incorrect \u2014 under some circumstances organizational entities may be convicted of the relevant crimes. Plaintiff targets the crimes referenced by ORS 124.115(2)(a), which includes crimes such as rape, sodomy, and unlawful sexual penetration, arguing that, although the people who make up an organizational entity may commit such crimes, entities themselves cannot. That is incorrect. Under ORS 161.170(1), at a minimum, all that is required for a corporation, such as ONESCO, to be guilty of an offense listed in the criminal code is that the board of directors or a high managerial agent acting within the scope of employment knowingly tolerate the conduct constituting the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We turn to plaintiffs argument regarding the legislative history of ORS 124.115. Plaintiff cites testimony of attorney Lisa Bertalan, the primary proponent of Senate Bill 943 (SB 943) part of which would become ORS 124.115 once enacted. Or Laws 1995, ch 671, \u00a7 3a. After consulting with representatives from the Oregon Health Care Association, Bertalan suggested amendments to the bill at a Senate Judiciary Committee work session. Among her suggestions was the addition of a section that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201cThis Act shall not apply to owners, employees, and agents of licensed nursing facilities as defined under ORS 442.015 or residential care facilities and licensed assisted living facilities as defined under ORS Chapter 443 unless said persons are convicted criminally for any of the actions set forth in [sections describing physical and financial abuse]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Testimony, Senate Judiciary Committee, SB 943, Apr 12, 1995, Ex F (statement of Lisa Bertalan).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>From the use of the words \u201cowners, employees, and agents\u201d in that suggested amendment, plaintiff draws the conclusion that \u201cthe exception always and at every step in the process hinged on the conviction of an actual human being.\u201d Plaintiffs conclusion does not follow for a number of reasons, but the primary shortcoming in plaintiffs argument is that the passage upon which it depends \u2014 \u201cowners, employees, and agents\u201d \u2014 does not appear in the enacted statute and was not included in amendments to SB 943 proposed days after the work session in which Bertalan presented her suggested amendments. <em>See </em>Proposed Amendments to SB 943, Senate Judiciary Committee, Apr 18, 1995 (containing language materially indistinguishable from the enacted statute). As enacted, ORS 124.115(1) plainly includes licensed broker-dealers within a list of exempted organizational entities. Consequently, we reject plaintiffs argument that legislative history supports his interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">In sum, we conclude that the scheme enacted by the legislature exempts broker-dealers licensed under ORS 59.005 to 59.541 from liability for elder abuse actions by operation of ORS 124.115(1). We cannot conclude that conviction of ONESCO\u2019s employee, Averill, for crimes related to financial abuse of an elderly person removes that exemption, because the legislature required that a corporation itself be criminally convicted for the exception contained in ORS 124.115(2) to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\"> ORS 124.115 is provided below at 273 Or App at 129-30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-8\"> Plaintiff argues that defendant is both directly and vicariously liable. Our discussion of plaintiff\u2019s argument related to defendant\u2019s direct liability obviates the need to discuss his vicarious liability argument because we conclude that broker-dealers licensed under ORS 59.005 to 59.541 are exempt from any action under the elder abuse act regardless of the theory of liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
