Husband and wife were married in August 1996 and separated in November 2011, and dissolution proceedings were initiated on November 30, 2011. The parties had one child, who was four years old. at the time of the separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">At a hearing on November 15, 2012, the trial court stated, \u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that we\u2019re going to put a settlement on the record.\u201d Husband and wife then agreed, on the record, to terms relating to their dissolution, including, as relevant to the issues on appeal, terms relating to custody and parenting time, child support, and property division.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Regarding custody and parenting time, the parties agreed that wife would have \u201cprimary sole legal and physical custody of [the child], subject to [husband\u2019s] parenting time,\u201d and that, with a few specified exceptions for upcoming dates in 2013, husband\u2019s parenting time would be \u201cas recommended in the custody evaluation that was conducted by JMJ Psychological Services [JMJ].\u201d On July 26, 2012, JMJ had offered recommendations for a parenting plan that provided, in part, \u201c[Husband] shall have parenting time with [the child] from Thursday after school until Monday morning before school resumes every other week. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>alternate weeks when [husband] doesn\u2019t have weekend parenting time, he shall have parenting time with [the child] from Wednesday after school until Thursday morning before school resumes.\u201d Thus, the proposed parenting plan provided for husband to have approximately 36 percent of overnight parenting time and for wife to have approximately 64 percent of overnight parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Regarding child support, the parties agreed on a method of determining each parent\u2019s income, and agreed that the court would then use the resulting figures to calculate child support based on the child support guidelines. For purposes of the child support guidelines, the parties agreed that the figure to be used for the number of \u201covernights\u201d with each parent would be \u201cbased on JMJ\u2019s schedule.\u201d The parties further agreed that husband would provide health insurance for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Regarding the property division, wife\u2019s attorney began by stating that \u201cin terms of the proposed distribution of assets and liabilities here, we have a very battle-worn copy of a proposed distribution from [husband], which [wife] has marked up. It represents the parties\u2019 agreement. There are some very specific details that have been thoroughly worked out.\u201d Wife\u2019s attorney further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">\u201c[A]s a generality, each party keeps their primary vehicle. [Wife] keeps the house. [Wife] takes responsibility for the mortgage on the house. Then the parties attempt to equalize from there, using the proposed assets and liabilities distribution. And to the extent that there\u2019s still a resulting disparity at the end of that, it will just \u2014 I think [husband\u2019s] intention is to equalize that out with 401(K). The arithmetic needs to still be clarified based on all the adjustments we\u2019ve made today, but that\u2019s our understanding of what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Husband\u2019s attorney agreed, stating, \u201cYes, Your Honor, that\u2019s correct, from [husband\u2019s] perspective.\u201d Husband\u2019s attorney later added, \u201cI think that that asset sheet will eventually become an exhibit to the judgment. And I think the JMJ Psychological Services custody evaluation should be made an exhibit to the judgment for clarification purposes moving forward with these parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>After the hearing, the parties failed to agree <em>as to </em>the form of the resulting judgment. First, wife submitted a proposed form of judgment, to which husband objected.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Husband later submitted his own proposed judgment to the court, in which he included a revised custody and parenting time evaluation report from JMJ, dated March 19, 2013, and an edited version of the assets and liabilities distribution sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The revised JMJ report began:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">\u201cIt has come to these evaluators [\u2019] attention that the court judgment has given [mother] primary custody of [the child], with restrictions. The custodial evaluation, dated July 26, 2012, determined that it would be in the best interest for this family that there would be 50/50 parenting time to which the court ordered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">\u201cThe question that has come to these evaluators is that the parenting time is not 50/50 with the current schedule. Rather[, husband] is getting * * * 36% parenting time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The report further provided, \u201cIt is highly recommended that based on [the child\u2019s] developmental abilities, a week on week off [schedule] would reflect the true 50/50 parenting-time split originally recommended, and would be more reliable, consistent and easier to follow for these parents.\u201d Based on that revised custody and parenting time report, husband\u2019s proposed form of judgment included a child support calculation based on the presumption that husband and wife would share equal parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The edited version of the assets and liabilities distribution sheet appears to be the result of husband\u2019s attempt to incorporate wife\u2019s annotations into the distribution list that he had originally proposed. On the \u201cbattle-worn copy\u201d of the sheet, husband had proposed values and distributions of the parties\u2019 various items of property and liability, and wife had made handwritten annotations next to the items for which she proposed a different value or distribution. On husband\u2019s edited version, wife\u2019s handwritten annotations have been removed and many of the values and distributions originally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>proposed by husband have been changed. It is unclear from the record to what extent the edited version accurately reflects the actual agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Wife submitted objections to husband\u2019s proposed form of judgment to the trial court, arguing, among other points, that the judgment \u201cmakes a material departure from [the] stipulated parenting time plan for purposes of calculating child support\u201d and \u201cproposes a property schedule that is a material deviation from the parties\u2019 stipulation placed on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">On November 13, 2013, the trial court judge signed and entered husband\u2019s proposed form of judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As noted, the judgment, in its final form, was titled \u201cStipulated General Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage.\u201d Next to the judge\u2019s signature is stamped the phrase \u201cObjections received and considered\u201d; other than that stamped phrase, the record contains no information related to the trial court\u2019s consideration and rejection of wife\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Among the trial court\u2019s findings in the judgment, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">\u201cHusband and Wife acknowledge that the disposition of property herein, whether or not equal, is just and proper in all the circumstances. <em>The parties each warrant to the other and to this court that each has signed this judgment on their own volition </em>and that there has been an accurate, complete, and current disclosure of all their income, assets, debts, and liabilities. The terms of this judgment represent a compromise of disputed issues in some instances. In addition, each party acknowledges that there have been no representations or promises of any kind that have been made to him or her as an inducement to enter into the agreement represented by this judgment other than those expressly set forth here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">(Emphasis added.) The judgment also provided that \u201cHusband and Wife\u2019s signatures on this stipulated judgment evidence their intent that the agreement embodied in this stipulated judgment will be enforceable in the manner described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ORS 107.135.\u201d Although there are spaces for husband\u2019s and wife\u2019s signatures, neither party signed the judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Three provisions in the judgment are critical to our analysis. First, the court ordered that husband and wife would be awarded \u201c[a] 11 property [as] listed on Exhibit [3]\u201d \u2014 the edited version of the assets and liabilities distribution sheet that husband submitted with his proposed form of judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, the court ordered that \u201cHusband shall be entitled to frequent, equal, shared, and unhampered parenting time visitation at such times as the parties may mutually agree, or if the parties do not agree, per the attached and incorporated parenting plan as set forth in the custody study performed by [JMJ].\u201d Third, based on the presumption that husband and wife would share equal parenting time, the court ordered that \u201cHusband will have judgment against Wife for the support of the minor child in the amount of $50.00 per month[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Wife now appeals, arguing that the trial court erred as a matter of law by entering the judgment, because it was inconsistent with the agreement placed on the record by the parties and their attorneys in court, it was not signed by wife or her attorney, and the court was aware that, in fact, wife did not agree to all of the provisions therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In response, husband contends, without detailed explanation, that the terms of the judgment \u201cdo not differ substantially from the agreement that was put on the record.\u201d However, husband also appears to acknowledge that some of the terms incorporated into the judgment were not agreed upon by the parties, and he contends that the trial court, after considering the proposed judgments from both husband and wife, had \u201cbroad discretion\u201d to enter the judgment anyway. Husband suggests that \u201cthe title, \u2018Stipulated General Judgment\u2019 may be incorrect,\u201d but the judgment should nonetheless be affirmed \u201cwith instruction for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>court to strike [the term] \u2018stipulated\u2019 from the document.\u201d (Some capitalization omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">A court\u2019s authority to enter a judgment based on a stipulation of the parties is described in ORCP 67 F, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201c(1) * * * At any time after commencement of an action, a judgment may be given upon stipulation that a judgment for a specified amount or for a specific relief may be entered. The stipulation shall be of the party or parties against whom judgment is to be entered and the party or parties in whose favor judgment is to be entered. If the stipulation provides for attorney fees, costs, and disbursements, they may be entered as part of the judgment according to the stipulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201c(2) * * * <em>The stipulation for judgment may be in a writing signed by the parties, their attorneys, or their authorized representatives, </em>which writing shall be filed in accordance with Rule 9. The stipulation may be subjoined or appended to, and part of, a proposed form of judgment. <em>If not in writing, the stipulation shall be assented to by all parties thereto in open court.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">(Emphases added.) In other words, parties to an action may stipulate that a judgment for specified relief be entered by a court, either by creating \u201ca writing signed by the parties, their attorneys, or their authorized representatives,\u201d or by assenting to the stipulation in open court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Regarding stipulated judgments in marital dissolution proceedings, ORS 107.104 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">\u201c(1) It is the policy of this state:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">\u201c(a) To encourage the settlement of suits for marital annulment, dissolution or separation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">\u201c(b) For courts to enforce the terms of settlements described in subsection (2) of this section to the fullest extent possible, except when to do so would violate the law or would clearly contravene public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">\u201c(2) In a suit for marital annulment, dissolution or separation, the court may enforce the terms set forth in a stipulated judgment signed by the parties, a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>resulting from a settlement on the record or a judgment incorporating a marital settlement agreement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">\u201c(a) As contract terms using contract remedies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">\u201c(b) By imposing any remedy available to enforce a judgment, including but not limited to contempt; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">\u201c(c) By any combination of the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">As relevant to this case, on November 15, 2012, the parties agreed, on the record in open court, that (1) husband\u2019s parenting time would be \u201cas recommended in the custody evaluation that was conducted by JMJ\u201d (at that time, the only report from JMJ recommended a parenting schedule in which husband would have 36 percent parenting time); (2) child support would be calculated using the child support guidelines and, for purposes of the guidelines, the number of \u201covernights\u201d with each parent would be \u201cbased on JMJ\u2019s schedule\u201d; and (3) the \u201cbattle-worn copy\u201d of the assets and liabilities distribution sheet \u201crepresents the parties\u2019 agreement\u201d regarding the division of their property. However, instead of incorporating the original JMJ report and the \u201cbattle-worn copy\u201d of the assets and liabilities distribution sheet referenced by the parties as part of their agreement, husband\u2019s proposed form of judgment incorporated a revised report from JMJ (which recommended a different parenting schedule in which husband would have 50 percent parenting time), presumed that the parties would share equal parenting time for purposes of child support, and incorporated an edited version of the \u201cbattle-worn copy\u201d of the assets and liabilities distribution sheet. It is our understanding that it was because of those differences that wife objected to and refused to sign the proposed judgment. The court should not have entered a purported stipulated judgment knowing that wife had not actually stipulated to the terms contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Thus, we conclude that the court erred when it signed and entered a purported \u201cStipulated General Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage\u201d that was not signed or agreed to by both parties and that incorporated documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>that included terms not agreed upon by the parties on the record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-8\"> Generally, a party may not appeal a stipulated judgment unless that judgment \u201cspecifically provides that the party has reserved the right to appellate review of a ruling of the trial court,\u201d ORS 19.245(3)(a), and, in this case, the stipulated judgment does not reserve such a right. However, the validity of a stipulated judgment can be challenged on appeal on the ground that the party did not consent to it. <em>Brown and Shiban, </em>155 Or App 238, 241-43, 963 P2d 105 (1998), <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 594 (1999); <em>see also Dept. of Human Services v.

We therefore decline to consider that alternative possibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
