Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>322 Or 132, 134, 903 P2d 352 (1995). The T-Girls gather regularly on Friday nights. They began frequenting the P Club on Friday nights around July 2010, when they were asked not to gather at another club where they had previously met. \u201cBetween September 2010 and January 2011, the T-Girls gathered intermittently on Friday nights at the P Club as they explored possible new Friday gathering spots. In January 2011, the T-Girls decided to make the P Club their \u2018regular Friday nightspot.\u2019\u201d \u201cFrom eight to 54 T-Girls gathered at the P Club every Friday night between January 2011 and June 18, 2012.\u201d As BOLI explained in the final order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-5\">\u201cOn June 18, 2012, Penner telephoned C. Lynn and left the following voicemail message:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-6\">\u201c\u2018Hello, my name is Chris, I\u2019m the owner of the P Club Bar and Grill on North Lombard. Um, unfortunately, uh due to circumstances beyond my control I am going to have to ask for you, Cass, and your group not to come back on Friday nights. Um, I really don\u2019t like having to do that but unfortunately it\u2019s the area we\u2019re in and it\u2019s hurting business a lot. If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call ***. Again I\u2019m really sorry about having to do this but yeah give me a call. Thanks, bye.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>\u201cIn response to Penner\u2019s voicemail, C. Lynn telephoned Penner and left a message asking what the \u2018real reason\u2019 was for Penner\u2019s request that the T-Girls not come back on Friday nights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-4\">\u201cOn June 21, Penner telephoned C. Lynn and left the following voicemail message:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-5\">\u201c\u2018Hello Cassandra, this is Chris from the P Club. Sorry it took me awhile to return your phone call. There is no underlying reason for asking you folks not to come back other than money. Um, sales on Friday nights have been declining at the bar for the last 18 months. Uh, about a year ago I was looking at asking you folks not to come in anymore and the girls said, \u201cNo, no, no don\u2019t,\u201d so I gave it a while longer. Um, I own another bar in north Portland; sales are doing great on Fridays, and so I\u2019ve done some investigating as to why my sales are declining and there\u2019s two things I keep hearing: People think that (a) we\u2019re a tranny bar or (b) that we\u2019re a gay bar. We are neither. People are not coming in because they just don\u2019t want to be there on a Friday night now. In the beginning sales were doing fine but they\u2019ve been on a steady decrease so I have to look at what the problem is, what the reason is, and take care of it; that\u2019s my job as the owner. So unfortunately, I have to do what I have to do and that is the only reason. It\u2019s all about money. So I\u2019ll be back in town tonight; if you want to give me a call I should be answering my phone; I\u2019ve been out of town for the past few days. So, there we are, take care. Bye bye.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">\u201cC. Lynn understood Penner\u2019s voicemails to mean that the P Club \u2018wasn\u2019t a tranny bar\u2019 and \u2018we\u2019re not allowed in there.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-7\">\u201cNone of the aggrieved persons [, who are all members of the T-Girls,] visited the P Club after June 18, 2012.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">(Paragraph numbers, footnotes, and citations omitted.) \u201cAfter C. Lynn received the voicemails, she posted a note on the T-Girls\u2019 website stating that Penner had asked the T-Girls not to come back to the P Club. Subsequently, she posted a transcription of the voicemails, [and] then the actual voice-mails!,] on the website.\u201d The 11 aggrieved persons in this case are members of the T-Girls who attended the Friday night gatherings before June 18, 2012, learned of and eventually heard the voicemails through Lynn and the T-Girls\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>website, and did not return to the P Club because of the voicemails.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">On November 18, 2011, after the commissioner filed a complaint against respondents and BOLI\u2019s Civil Rights Unit found substantial evidence to support the complaint, BOLI formally charged both respondents with violating ORS 659A.403(3) and ORS 659A.409, and also charged Penner with violating ORS 659A.406 by aiding and abetting Blachana. BOLI sought damages of \u201cat least $50,000\u201d for each of the aggrieved persons and a civil penalty of $1,000 per violation against each respondent. After resolving discovery disputes that are not relevant to this appeal, an administrative law judge (ALJ) employed by BOLI heard the case in May 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Because our resolution of respondents\u2019 contentions on review turns on their arguments before BOLI, we explain those arguments in some detail. Before doing so, however, we provide some background on the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Article I, section 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">In <em>State v. Robertson, </em>293 Or 402, 649 P2d 569 (1982), the Supreme Court established three categories for analyzing a law under Article I, section 8. The court recently summarized those categories as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-7\">\u201cUnder the first category, the court begins by determining whether a law is written in terms directed to the substance of any opinion or any subject of communication. If it is, then the law is unconstitutional, unless the scope of the restraint is wholly confined within some historical exception that was well established when the first American guarantees of freedom of expression were adopted and that the guarantees then or in 1859 demonstrably were not intended to reach. If the law survives that inquiry, then the court determines whether the law focuses on forbidden effects and the proscribed means of causing those effects include speech or writing, or whether it is directed only against causing the forbidden effects. If the law focuses on forbidden effects, and the proscribed means of causing those effects include expression, then the law is analyzed under the second <em>Robertson </em>category. Under that category, the court determines whether the law is overbroad, and, if so, whether it is capable of being narrowed. If, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>other hand, the law focuses only on forbidden effects, then the law is in the third <em>Robertson </em>category, and an individual can challenge the law as applied to that individual\u2019s circumstances</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-4\"><em>State v. Babson, 355 </em>Or 383, 391, 326 P3d 559 (2014) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">We return to respondents\u2019 arguments before BOLI. In their answer to the formal charges, respondents asserted a constitutional affirmative defense based on Article I, section 8. In their case summary, submitted before the hearing, they argued that they \u201chave a right under Article I, section 8, of the Oregon Constitution to \u2018speak freely * * * on any subject whatever.\u2019 Application of ORS 659A.400, <em>et seq, </em>in this case, violates Respondents\u2019 rights thereunder.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The ALJ allowed the parties to submit memoranda on that defense after the hearing. In its memorandum, BOLI argued that, under the <em>Robertson </em>framework, ORS 659A.403 is directed against causing forbidden effects rather than expressly or obviously proscribing expression, that is, that the statute does not fall into the first <em>Robertson </em>category. Furthermore, BOLI asserted, because the provision does not mention speech, it falls into the third <em>Robertson </em>category and, accordingly, is not subject to facial challenges. BOLI further contended that ORS 659A.403 was not unconstitutional as applied to respondents because respondents were being punished only \u201cbecause [respondents] committed the proscribed act of affirmatively barring the T-Girls from the club on the basis of their sexual orientation.\u201d BOLI explained that respondents\u2019 argument \u2014 that they were being sanctioned based on the content of Penner\u2019s speech \u2014 \u201cmisconstrues the distinction between the content of speech impermissibly forming an element of an offense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>and using the content of speech to prove an element of an offense. The former may be unconstitutional, the latter is not. <em>See State v. Plowman, </em>314 Or 157, 167, [838 P2d 558 (1992)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">In their response, respondents asserted that they \u201chad a right to express their desire \u2014 motivated by business interest \u2014 that the Rose City T-Girls no longer meet at Respondents\u2019 place of business on Friday nights.\u201d Rather than addressing ORS 659A.403, ORS 659A.406, or ORS 659A.409 under the <em>Robertson </em>framework, they argued that Penner\u2019s voicemail messages were less serious than the types of speech \u2014 including threats and demands \u2014 that were prohibited under the coercion statute at issue in <em>Robertson. </em>Respondents contended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-5\">\u201cIt cannot be disputed that Respondents did not demand anything. It cannot be disputed that Respondents did not threaten anything. And while some of the witnesses testified that they interpreted those words as a denial of service, it clearly was not a denial of service \u2014 no one came and attempted to be served. The refusal to return to Respondents\u2019 place of business, as the witnesses described it, was due to their anger at Respondents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-6\">\u201cOr to put it a different way, Respondents did not refuse to provide service to anyone. Respondents\u2019 request that the group not return amounted to the free expression of Respondents\u2019 desire that the group stop coming on Friday nights. Respondents had a constitutional right to express that desire. Unless or until Respondents refused service\u2014 they did not and would not have \u2014 Respondents\u2019 statements cannot be used to punish them, as the Commissioner seeks to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">(Underscoring in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">In its reply, BOLI argued that respondents had misunderstood the holding of <em>Robertson </em>\u2014 specifically, it contended that <em>Robertson </em>\u201cis directed toward statutory construction and facial challenges to laws, not to what types of speech may or may not ever form the basis of an adverse state action.\u201d BOLI also argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-9\">\u201cA review of the key factual disputes in this case illustrates that ORS 659A is constitutional as applied to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>case. Respondents claim that the voice messages were only an \u2018expression of desire.\u2019 The Agency claims that the voice messages were denials of service. A denial of service may be sanctioned under ORS 659A; an \u2018expression of desire\u2019 likely would not be. Sanctioning a denial of service is constitutional; sanctioning an \u2018expression of desire\u2019 is generally not. If a fact finder rules in favor of the Agency that, as a matter of fact, the voice messages were denials of service, ORS 659A may be constitutionally enforced. If a fact finder rules in favor of Respondents that the voice messages were not denials of service, then ORS 659A may not be applied to the case and, therefore, there can be no constitutional issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-4\">\u201cIn short, if the facts are as Respondents say they are, it would be unconstitutional for the state to take adverse action against Respondents. The Agency agrees with Respondents on that point. However, the agency points out that ORS 659A could not (by its own terms) be applied to this case if the facts are as Respondents claim they are. The constitutional issues raised by Respondents only serve to outline the contours of ORS 659A\u2019s application and to frame the factual determination upon which this matter actually hinges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The ALJ issued a proposed order in which it concluded that respondents had violated ORS 659A.403 and ORS 659A.406, but not ORS 659A.409. Both parties submitted objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">BOLI then issued a final order in which it concluded that respondents had violated ORS 659A.403, ORS 659A.406, and ORS 659A.409. It found that \u201c[a]ll of the aggrieved persons listened to the voicemails and understood Penner\u2019s voicemails to be a message that the T-Girls were not welcome in the P Club any night of the week because Penner thought their presence was causing customers to perceive the P Club as a \u2018tranny\u2019 club or gay bar.\u201d It also noted, \u201c[T]he forum interprets Penner\u2019s request for the T-Girls \u2018not to come back\u2019 on Friday nights as a statement that they were not welcome at the P Club on Friday nights, the same conclusion reached by the aggrieved persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Based on that interpretation of the voicemails, BOLI concluded that they constituted a denial of equal accommodations to the aggrieved persons under ORS 659A.403. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>Contrary to respondents\u2019 arguments, BOLI concluded that the aggrieved persons were not required to visit the P Club and request to be served in order to be denied equal accommodations. Rather, Penner\u2019s statements, which meant that the aggrieved persons were not welcome at the P Club on Friday nights, constituted a denial in themselves. BOLI also concluded that the denial was \u201c\u2018on account\u2019 of the T-Girls\u2019 sexual orientation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">As to ORS 659A.409, BOLI concluded that Penner had \u201cissue [d]\u201d a \u201cnotice\u201d and \u201ccommunication\u201d by leaving the voicemails for Lynn. It noted that, although BOLI has been delegated statutory authority to define those terms by rule, it has not done so. After considering dictionary definitions, it concluded that respondents had violated ORS 659A.409.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Finally, BOLI concluded that respondents\u2019 Article I, section 8, defense was conditional \u2014 that is, respondents intended to assert that ORS 659A.403, ORS 659A.406, and ORS 659A.409 were unconstitutional only if the voicemails were merely requests and not a denial of service:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-6\">\u201cIn their post-hearing brief, Respondents make it clear that this defense is based on their contention that Respondents only made a \u2018request\u2019 that the T-Girls not return, that Respondents never refused to provide or denied service to the T-Girls, and that to punish Respondents for making a \u2018request\u2019 violates Respondents\u2019 constitutional free speech rights. In contrast, the forum has concluded that Respondents\u2019 \u2018request\u2019 was not just Penner freely speaking his mind, but an actual denial of service. Respondents do not contend that the constitution protects them from actually denying service. Under these circumstances, neither the state nor [f] ederal constitutions protect Respondents\u2019 actions that the forum has found to violate ORS 659A.403, ORS 659A.406, and ORS 659A.409.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">BOLI ordered respondents to pay damages of $400,000 to the 11 aggrieved persons and imposed $3,000 in civil penalties on Blachana, LLC, and $2,000 in civil penalties on Penner.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Respondents seek judicial review, raising three assignments of error. We review for legal error. ORS 183.482(8)(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>(b)(C) (setting out standards of review for a contested case proceeding for erroneous interpretation of a provision of law and for impermissible exercise of discretion in violation of constitution); <em>Meltebeke, </em>322 Or at 138-39. Below, we discuss, and ultimately reject, their first and third assignments of error. We reject their second assignment of error without further discussion because it is insufficiently developed for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">In their first assignment of error, respondents assert that BOLI erred in \u201cfinding that Mr. Penner\u2019s request that the T-Girls not come to the Bar on Friday nights any longer was discrimination under ORS 659A.403, where there was no finding that Mr. Penner intended to exclude or refuse to serve any person or group on account of their sexual orientation.\u201d Respondents do not dispute that Penner\u2019s conduct was \u201con account of\u2019 the T-Girls\u2019 sexual orientation. Rather, they contend that BOLI failed to make an explicit finding that Penner \u201cintended to exclude the T-Girls, or otherwise suggest that he would refuse them service\u201d and that, in the absence of an intention to deny service, respondents did not violate ORS 659A.403.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">We reject that argument because, as noted above, BOLI expressly interpreted \u201cPenner\u2019s request for the T-Girls \u2018not to come back\u2019 on Friday nights as a statement that they were not welcome at the P Club on Friday nights.\u201d In other words, BOLI found that Penner communicated his intention to exclude the T-Girls on Friday nights by telling them that they were not welcome \u2014 that is, by telling them that they would not be allowed to meet at the P Club on Friday nights because of their sexual orientation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> BOLI\u2019s interpretation of Penner\u2019s statement necessarily includes a finding that Penner intended to exclude the T-Girls from the P Club on Friday nights. Given that factual finding, by which we are bound, ORS 183.482(7); <em>Meltebeke, </em>322 Or at 134, respondents\u2019 argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">We turn to respondents\u2019 third assignment of error, in which they reiterate their contention that, under Article I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>section 8, they \u201chad a right to express their desire to the Rose City T-Girls, that the association no longer use Respondents\u2019 place of business as their Friday night gathering place.\u201d Respondents first assert that ORS 659A.403 and ORS 659A.409 fall in the first <em>Robertson </em>category because they are \u201cboth directed at the substance of a defendant\u2019s communication.\u201d Second, they assert that those provisions are over-broad if they fall in the second <em>Robertson </em>category. Third, they argue that, in any event, under the third <em>Robertson </em>category, the provisions are unconstitutional as applied to respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">We reject respondents\u2019 facial challenge \u2014 their first and second assertions \u2014 without extended discussion. As explained above, before BOLI, respondents did not advance any argument under the <em>Robertson </em>framework. Moreover, on judicial review, in arguing that ORS 659A.403 and ORS 659A.409 fall in the first or second <em>Robertson </em>categories, respondents still do not cite or discuss the text of those provisions; instead, they contend that the purpose of this enforcement action was to punish respondents for Penner\u2019s use of the terms \u201ctranny bar\u201d and \u201cgay bar\u201d rather than for a denial of service. That contention does not address the questions that inform a determination of whether a statute falls within either of the two first <em>Robertson </em>categories: whether the \u201cterms\u201d of the provision are \u201cdirected at the substance\u201d of a communication or whether the law proscribes \u201cspeech or writing.\u201d <em>Babson, </em>355 Or at 391. Rather, respondents\u2019 argument, which focuses not on statutory text but on its application to a set of factual circumstances, informs the <em>Robertson </em>\u201ccategory three\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">We turn to that \u201ccategory three\u201d question, that is, respondents\u2019 as-applied challenge to BOLI\u2019s enforcement of the statutes against respondents in these circumstances. In that challenge, respondents argue that BOLI\u2019s application of ORS 659A.403 and ORS 659A.409 to Penner\u2019s conduct is unconstitutional here because the focus of the case was Penner\u2019s speech. They point out that \u201c[t]he \u2018forbidden effects\u2019 would be whether [the T-Girls] were, in fact, denied service\u201d and assert that \u201c[t]he evidence on that subject was scant, at best,\u201d because, after hearing the voicemails, none of the T-Girls returned to the club.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>That argument is unavailing given BOLI\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusion. As noted above, BOLI determined that \u201c[Respondents\u2019 \u2018request\u2019 was not just Penner freely speaking his mind, but an actual denial of service.\u201d As we understand it, that statement includes a finding that, through the voicemails, Penner was not just stating his opinion, but was actually informing the T-Girls that they would not be served if they came to the P Club on Friday nights. That finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>ORS 183.482(8)(c) (appellate court shall set aside or remand an order that \u201cis not supported by substantial evidence in the record\u201d); ORS 183.482(7) (\u201c[T]he court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to any issue of fact * * *.\u201d). BOLI was not required to believe Penner\u2019s testimony that the voicemails were not intended to, and therefore did not, communicate that the T-Girls would not be served if they came to the P Club on a Friday night. Rather, it could \u2014 and did \u2014 find that the voicemails expressed that the T-Girls would not be served if they came to the P Club on a Friday night.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">We turn to BOLI\u2019s legal conclusion. We agree with respondents that the \u201cforbidden effect\u201d at issue here is a denial of full and equal accommodations \u2014 in this case, a denial of service. <em>See </em>ORS 659A.403. BOLI concluded that Penner\u2019s speech itself constituted that forbidden effect: When Penner left the voicemails for Lynn, he was verbally barring her and the T-Girls from the P Club on Friday nights.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">As noted above, respondents assert that \u201cthe evidence [that the T-Girls were denied service] was scant, at best,\u201d and they place significance on the fact that the T-Girls did not return to the P Club after hearing the voicemails. But, as noted above, BOLI concluded that Penner\u2019s speech\u2014 the voicemails themselves \u2014 constituted the forbidden denial of service. That is, the denial of service was complete when Penner left the voicemails. In light of that legal conclusion, to which respondents raise no preserved challenge, the fact that none of the T-Girls returned to the club after hearing the messages \u2014 that is, after the denial of service took place \u2014 is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">We have considered the remaining arguments that respondents make in support of their third assignment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>error and reject them as unpreserved, not adequately developed for our consideration, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-5\"> In accordance with our rule governing the designation of parties in briefs, ORAP 5.15, we refer to Blachana, LLC, and Penner as respondents because they were respondents in the proceedings below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-6\"> Blachana, LLC, owns the P Club, later known as the Twilight Room Annex.
