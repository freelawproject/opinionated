The petitioners, the non-operating working interest owners of certain leases in the Sarco Creek and West Videuri fields of Texas, contend (1) that the Commission\u2019s actions failed to meet the minimum standards for agency decision-making; (2) that the Commission abused its discretion both by failing to give a rational basis for its denial of relief and by failing to meaningfully address the petitioners\u2019 pleadings and the considerations of equity raised therein; (3) that the Commission\u2019s denial of relief was arbitrary, capricious, and unduly discriminatory; and (4) that the Commission\u2019s unreasonable delay both in investigating the 1958 rate increase filed by the petitioners and in determining that refunds are due and payable is of such magnitude as to excuse all or a portion of their refund obligations. We reject the petitioners\u2019 contentions and affirm the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-16\">As is shown by this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Estate of French v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>603 F.2d 1158 (5th Cir. 1979), petitioners\u2019 first, second, and third contentions are totally without merit. <em>See id. </em>at 1161-67. The Commission dealt with petitioners\u2019 contention, unique to this case: that the operator failed to file for contractually authorized rate increases, improperly dissipated funds held for refund obligation, and then went bankrupt. It was within the broad discretion and wide latitude given the Commission in acting upon individual requests for relief to decide that petitioners were bound by the failure of their operator to file for rate increases and that the operator\u2019s bankruptcy was in no way relevant to the non-operating working interest owners\u2019 obligation to refund. Neither argument contradicts the financial ability of the petitioners to make the refunds. Petitioners\u2019 fourth contention, as it relates to the Commission\u2019s delay in determining the just and reasonable rates for the Texas Gulf Coast area, likewise is without merit. <em>See id. </em>at 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-17\">Petitioners also complain of the Commission\u2019s delay in ordering the disbursement of the excess rates once the base <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>area rates were determined. They note that the Commission set the base area rates in an opinion issued May 6, 1971, see <em>Area Rate Proceeding (Texas Gulf Coast Area), </em>Opinion No. 595, 45 F.P.C. 674 (1971), but did not order the disbursement of refunds until February 23, 1976. <em>See In re Texas Gulf Coast Area, </em>Nos. 64-2, <em>et al. </em>(F.P.C. Feb. 23, 1976) (order directing disbursement of refunds). <em>See also In re Texas Gulf Coast Area, </em>Nos. 64-2, <em>et al. </em>(F.P.C. July 14, 1977) (order directing disbursement of refunds). However, the petitioners fail to recognize that this delay did not result from the Commission\u2019s \u201cslothfulness, lethargy, inertia or caprice.\u201d <em>See Chromcraft Corp. </em>v. <em>United States Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n, </em>465 F.2d 745, 748 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>Estate of French v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>603 F.2d at 1167. Rather, the delay resulted solely from the protracted litigation that surrounded the Commission\u2019s determination of base area rates. <em>See Public Service Comm\u2019n v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>487 F.2d 1043 (D.C.Cir.1973), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>417 U.S. 964, 94 S.Ct. 3167, 41 L.Ed.2d 1136 (1974), <em>on remand, </em>516 F.2d 746 (D.C.Cir.1975). The Commission acted prudently in awaiting a final resolution of that litigation before ordering the disbursement of refunds. The petitioners\u2019 charge of undue delay is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">The petitioners also complain of the Commission\u2019s delay in acting on their request for special relief. Delays by the Commission in acting on such petitions have required this Court in the past to order equitable relief. <em>See Estate of French v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>603 F.2d at 1167-68. Such relief is not required in this case. Unlike the situation presented in <em>Estate of French, </em>which involved a seven year delay after the request for special relief (part of which was due to the Commission\u2019s loss of the file), the instant proceedings indicate no extraordinary delay. Here the Commission acted on both the petitioners\u2019 request for special relief and the intervention of Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company without specific problems and within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-7\">Because we find all contentions raised in the petition for review to be without merit, the July 28, 1979, order of the Commission is</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
