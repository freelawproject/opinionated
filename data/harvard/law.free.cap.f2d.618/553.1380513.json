His conviction was affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant sought certiorari from the Supreme Court. Certiorari was denied and his petition was dismissed,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> citing <em>Molinaro v. New Jersey, </em>396 U.S. 365, 90 S.Ct. 498, 24 L.Ed.2d 586 (1970). During this time defendant was on bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-19\">Appellant did not appear in the district court at the spreading of the remand affirming the judgment of conviction, after his appeal. His bond was forfeited, and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest as a fugitive from justice. Apparently Connolly fled to England; was arrested there; and apparently spent two and a half years in a British prison after conviction of a British crime, which is not named in the record before us, and which conviction was reversed on appeal (R.T., p. 7).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter he voluntarily returned to the United States, and turned himself in.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-20\">On June 1st, 1978, the district judge who originally sentenced Connolly was orally requested by appellant Connolly and his appointed counsel to correct an illegal sentence. (R.T., p. 10).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was represented to the court by counsel for defendant that appellant had served one year in custody in the United States and two and one-half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>years in custody in Great Britain, on a charge of which he was later acquitted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">The trial court stated on June 1st, 1978, it would not <em>change </em>the original sentence of five years, concurrent on two counts of possession with the intent to sell hashish, but would entertain a motion, if made by the prosecution, to <em>correct </em>the 1972 sentence by inserting the mandatory parole specified in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Such a motion was filed on June 2nd, 1978, by the United States Attorney entitled \u201cNotice of Motion for Modification of Sentence under Rule 35\u201d, supported by an affidavit and a Memorandum of Points and Authorities supplied by the Government. The trial court heard this on June 9th, 1978, and the following order was made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">HEARING plaintiffs motion for modification of sentence pursuant to Rule 35: COURT AND COUNSEL CONFER, IT IS ORDERED that the previously imposed sentence is hereby modified to reflect the imposition of Special Parole Term purs to 21 USC 841(b)(1)(A) of 3 yrs on each of counts 3 &amp; 6: IT IS ADJUDGED that the computation of time as to the Special Parole Term, should be as if the sentence had been imposed correctly at the date of sentencing and that the Special Parole Term imposed on each count would run concurrently one with the other: Filed and issued modified judgment: Mde JS-5 Ent. _ (DWW)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The Public Defender\u2019s brief to this Court continues to characterize and assert that the court\u2019s order above quoted made on the government\u2019s motion for modification under Rule 35, was <em>one, </em>a <em>resentencing </em>conducted by the court wherein (a) defendant was not afforded allocution, nor (b) a presentence report, as required by Rule 32 of Fed.R.Crim.P.; <em>two, </em>a resentencing, after an illegal sentence which constitutes a <em>de novo </em>proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">We hold it was neither a resentencing proceeding nor a <em>de novo </em>proceeding, and that neither allocution nor a presentence report was required under the circumstances here existing. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s procedures or order correcting (or modifying) the previously imposed sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">II. <em>A. The Court\u2019s Order of June 9th, 1978.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">The defendant\u2019s sentence is not one where the court lacked jurisdiction. It is not claimed there was any constitutional error.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, there was no basis for a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">This motion made and acted upon did not charge an error in fact, but an error in law. \u201cThe Court has held that an error of law does not provide a basis for collateral attack unless the claimed error constituted \u2018a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u2019 <em>Hill v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 428 [82 S.Ct. 468, 471, 7 L.Ed.2d 417].\u201d <em>United States v. Addonizio, </em>442 U.S. 178, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 60 L.Ed.2d 805 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">Here the court\u2019s action in modifying and correcting an unquestioned illegal sentence can in no way or manner be considered a complete miscarriage of justice. The trial court's order was carefully drawn to avoid such a result. It ordered the sentence imposed \u201cmodified\u201d to add a three year special parole term to the sentence already imposed. This was the minimum special parole term required by law to be part of a lawful sentence. The court had no discretion not to impose it, or to modify it, once it becomes a part of a valid judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>ment. No change or modification was otherwise made in Connolly\u2019s previously imposed sentence. The court then further ordered that \u201c[t]he beginning of the three year period of special parole terms should begin at such time as it ordinarily would have begun had that portion of the sentence been added in 1972.\u201d (R.T., p. 19).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Thus, the action of the court patently was favorable to Connolly. To suggest it even approaches \u201ca miscarriage of justice\u201d is preposterous.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Although Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 has been amended twice since Connolly\u2019s 1972 conviction, it has not been changed to Connolly\u2019s advantage, either in 1976, or on August 1st, 1979 after the modification or correction of his sentence was ordered. As Moore\u2019s Federal Practice states: Rule 35 provides two forms of relief \u2014 (a) \u201cthe court may correct an illegal sentence at any time\u201d; and (b) \u201cthe court may (within certain time limitations) reduce a sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are here concerned only with Rule 35(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">II. <em>B. Allocution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">As soon as the court was advised of the illegality of Connolly\u2019s sentence, by reason of its failure to follow the requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), it was its duty to comply with the statute. No question of double jeopardy is then involved, even if the sentence was increased. <em>Bozza v. United States, </em>330 U.S. 160, 67 S.Ct. 645, 91 L.Ed. 818 (1947); <em>United States v. Kenyon, </em>519 F.2d 1229 (9th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Although Rule 35 does not require the presence of a defendant when there is no disputed issue of fact and a correction of an illegal sentence comes before the court, the record before us clearly shows the presence of Connolly and two attorneys representing him during the entire proceeding on June 1st, 1972; and that Connolly was present with his appointed attorney on June 9th, 1972, <em>i. e., </em>at all times during both procedures. <em>United States v. Hayman, </em>342 U.S. 205, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1950); <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>365 F.2d 500, 502 (3rd Cir. 1966); <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>403 F.2d 963, 964 (6th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">Nothing defendant could say on his own behalf would aid the trial court in modifying and correcting the sentence, when the modification is mandatory by statute and a <em>minimum </em>mandatory sentence is given, as it was here. <em>United States v. Kenyon, supra, </em>p. 1233. Thus appellant was not hurt or prejudiced in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">III. <em>Pre-sentence Report.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-15\">Appellant suggests that a pre-sentence report could perhaps have determined the question as to how much time Connolly had left to serve (R.T., p. 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-16\">This was not a question for the trial court to determine. If it had attempted to do so, it would have exceeded its authority. That determination rests with the parole board.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-17\">But there exists no question, factually, as to whether the defendant had served out his term. He had not. The most claimed below as to his service under the judgment here modified was that he had served one and one-half years (or one year and eight months) on his sentence, while in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-18\">Without citing authority, Connolly\u2019s appointed counsel sought to have the court give him credit for time served in England \u2014 two and one-half years after his conviction there \u2014 while he was a fugitive from the United States after his failure to appear after being released on bail during his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-19\">This is a false hope.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Connolly failed to appear at the time of the filing and spread<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>ing of this Court\u2019s affirmance of defendant\u2019s conviction on July 17th, 1973 (T.T., p. 4). His bail was forfeited, and a bench warrant issued for his arrest. Connolly was not found and the bench warrant was not served on Connolly until May 18th, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The order of the trial judge modifying the judgment of conviction is affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-10\"><em>. </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-11\">(a) Except as authorized by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-12\">(1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance; or . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">We note at this time that the counts on which Connolly was convicted arose from two separate offenses involving possession of two different amounts of cocaine at two locations on two different dates. <em>Cf.
