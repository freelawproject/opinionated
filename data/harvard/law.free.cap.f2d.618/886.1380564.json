CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Yves Beliard was convicted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324 for inducing and encouraging the unlawful entry of aliens into the United States and under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546 for evasion of the immigration laws. Beliard appeals raising a host of issues, none of which we find meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">The first count of the indictment, charging the section 1324 violation, states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHW\">\u201cOn or about January 17, 1979, at the San Juan International Airport, Carolina, Puerto Rico, in the District of Puerto Rico, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, YVES BELIARD, AKA JOSUE C. CHARLES, the defendant herein, did wilfully, knowingly and unlawfully encourage and induce the entry into the United States of at least three (3) aliens not lawfully permitted to enter or reside within the United States . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">Beliard\u2019s main contention apparently is that as much of the evidence introduced at trial focused on preparatory acts performed by him in Haiti or while in transit, prior to his arrival with the aliens in United States territory, there was insufficient proof to provide jurisdiction under section 1324 or to support the specific allegation in the indictment that the crime occurred at the airport in Puerto Rico where Beliard and the aliens were apprehended with false papers. Several circuits have recently confronted and answered affirmatively the question whether a section 1324 conviction may be sustained where defendant\u2019s acts of \u201cinducement or encouragement\u201d took place outside of the United States, <em>United States v. Castillo-Felix, </em>539 F.2d 9, 13 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>464 F.2d 599 (2d Cir. 1972), and we are in agreement with this authority. Furthermore, the evidence in this case shows that Beliard accompanied the three aliens to Puerto Rico <em>(i. e., </em>to the United States), was apprehended with them at the airport in the District of Puerto Rico in the very act of entering illegally, and would have continued with the aliens to New York had his plan not been interrupted. Beliard\u2019s actions at the airport were thus part of a continuing scheme of \u201cinducement and encouragement,\u201d cf. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3237, launched prior to arrival there and not slated to end until the chosen final destination had been reached by all those involved. We think the indictment could reasonably allege that the crime occurred at the San Juan airport \u2014 this was the planned point of impact of Beliard\u2019s unlawful conduct and the place where he was apprehended; and further, venue was properly in the District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. <em>See Castillo-Felix, supra, </em>539 F.2d at 13; <em>Williams, supra, </em>464 F.2d 599; Fed.R.Crim.P. 18; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3237, 3238.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">Beliard argues that at any rate there was insufficient evidence to prove that he encouraged or induced the three aliens to enter the United States unlawfully or that, as alleged in the second count of the indictment, he attempted to evade the immigration laws by appearing for entry under an assumed name. We have reviewed the record and find this argument to be completely without foundation. Beliard\u2019s contentions that some of the evidence used to support his conviction under the second count was the product of an unlawful search, and that there was an unreasonable delay between the time he was first questioned by Immigration Officials and later searched by them are also without substantial merit. <em>See Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, </em>413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357. <em>Cf. United States v. Edwards, </em>415 U.S. 800, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-12\">Beliard contends that he was unfairly surprised by the introduction at trial of three visa applications obtained by the government from the American Consulate in Haiti. Beliard claims that he was not made aware of the existence of these documents until the day prior to their introduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>tion, and that such behavior by the government contravened its grant to the defense of full discovery. The government countered that it had alerted Beliard the moment that it found the papers in an Immigration Department file. Even were we to assume some sort of surprise from the introduction of the documents, although the district court found none, the evidence was cumulative and of limited import. We find no error or abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s ruling to admit these documents and in no event was their admission so prejudicial as to mandate reversal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Beliard challenges the district court\u2019s failure to be swayed by certain facts in considering his eligibility for a Youth Act Sentence, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5005 <em>et seq., </em>and its refusal to impose a more lenient adult sentence. These arguments present no grounds for reversal. The factors relied upon (or ignored) by a district court in refusing to grant a Youth Act disposition are, practically speaking, beyond review. <em>Dorszynski v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 424, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 41 L.Ed.2d 855 (1974). Likewise, we are without authority to reverse this adult sentence which was imposed within statutory and constitutional limits. <em>Gore v. United States, </em>357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 1284, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958); <em>Dorszynski, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 431-32, 94 S.Ct. at 3047.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Beliard states in his brief that the district court, after the jury retired, improperly responded to a jury request for additional instructions on the concepts of . \u201cencouraging and inducing\u201d out of the presence of the defendant or his counsel. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(a). The judge is said to have advised defense counsel of this occurrence when counsel.returned from lunch. There is, however, no indication in the record that the judge announced that such an occurrence had transpired, nor of the purported judge-jury interchange itself.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Nowhere does it appear, moreover, that Beliard\u2019s counsel ever objected to the court\u2019s purported action or moved for a mistrial, or a new trial, although, as indicated in appellant\u2019s brief, he was purportedly made aware of the matter before the jury brought in its verdict. In these circumstances, where we have no inkling from the record as to the nature, substance or even occurrence of the court\u2019s supposedly improper conduct, we are unable to consider the issue raised. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 10(b) and (c); 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice H 210.05[1] at 1618-19, 1210.-06[1] at 1630, 1979-80 Cumulative Supplement at 190; <em>United States v. Dunham Concrete Products, Inc., </em>475 F.2d 1241, 1251 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 832, 94 S.Ct. 65, 38 L.Ed.2d 66 (1973). <em>Cf. United States v. Payton, </em>615 F.2d 922, at 925 (1st Cir. 1980). We have reviewed all of Beliard\u2019s contentions and find no grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">The record does contain a handwritten note from the jury foreman, stating in its entirety, \u201cWe have different opinions about the definition of the first accusation.\u201d What was done by the court, if anything, in response to this note is, however, not indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
