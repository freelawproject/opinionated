JONES, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1221-15\">Southern Packaging and Storage Company, Inc., has for over thirty-five years assembled various component parts of the \u201cMeal Combat Individual\u201d (MCI) field rations (formerly C rations) pursuant to government contracts. Those contracts were issued subsequent to bid solicitations prepared by the Defense Logistics Agency and the Defense Personnel Support Center. The solicitation contained a wage determination prepared by the Employment Standards Administration of the Department of Labor which indicated that the Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 351, was applicable,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the locality for the minimum wage determination was \u201cnationwide\u201d and the job description was \u201cassembly of field rations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-16\">The district court determined, after a trial without a jury, that the Service Contract Act was indeed applicable to the work performed by Southern Packaging. <em>Southern Packaging and Storage Company, Inc. v. United States of America, </em>458 F.Supp. 726, 731-32 (D.S.C.1978). The court also held that the term \u201clocality\u201d as used in the Service Contract Act and as applied in this bid solicitation referred to \u201cthe standard metropolitan statistical area, if available, or the specific county, where the bidding party\u2019s plant or facility is located.\u201d 458 F.Supp. at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-17\">The Department of Labor appeals, contending that in the context of this solicitation it did not err in determining nationwide minimum wage rates. Southern Packaging cross-appeals, asserting that the district court erred in not construing its assembly operations as manufacturing within the Walsh-Healey Act and regulations, 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 50-206.52 (1979), which would have rendered the provisions of the Service Contract Act inapplicable, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 356(2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>We find that the district court was correct on both questions and we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">The Service Contract Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides \u201cprotection of employees of contractors and subcontractors furnishing services to or performing maintenance service for Federal agencies.\u201d 1965 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 3737, 3737; 1972 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 3534. Southern Packaging contends that it is a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d within the Walsh-Healey Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the MCI procurements or, in the alternative, furnishes supplies, which also comes within the ambit of Walsh-Healey.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">The district court described in detail the functions of Southern Packaging once it received the component parts shipped by the United States. The final end product is composed, for all practical purposes, from the material delivered to Southern Packaging. As the district court found, it is clear that Southern Packaging packages and assembles these component parts into the final product -the MCI ration kit. The regulations define manufacturer as a \u201cperson who owns, operates, or maintains a factory or establishment that produces on the premises the materials, supplies, articles, or equipment required under the contract and of the general character described by the specifications.\u201d 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 50-201.-101(a)(1) (1979). In light of the fact that Southern Packaging does not produce any of the materials required under the contract, it cannot be construed as a manufacturer within the regulations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-10\">Southern Packaging alternatively seeks to bring itself within the definition of \u201cassembler.\u201d 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 50-206.52 (1979).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4m\">\u201cAssembly\u201d means piercing or bringing together various interdependent or interrelated parts or components so as to make an operable whole or unit .... A firm which produces final items on its premises by assembling component parts, all or some of which have been purchased from others, will generally be considered to be a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d where it performs a series of assembly operations utilizing machines, tools and workers which constitute substantial and significant fabrication or production of the desired product. \u00a7 50 \u2014 206.52(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-11\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1222-12\">Thus, the determination of whether a bidder proposing to assemble a final product from component parts is an eligible manufacturer must rest on whether the bidder has demonstrated an independent ability, with its plant, equipment and personnel, to perform a significant or substantial portion of the manufacturing operations and efforts required in producing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>the final product for which the government contracted. \u00a7 50 \u2014 206.52(b)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABU\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-4\">Firms which only perform minimal operations upon the item being procured cannot qualify as manufacturers. To allow any such bidder to do so would obviously frustrate the purpose of the [Walsh-Healey] Act. \u00a7 50-206.52(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1223-6\">Packaging by itself does not constitute \u201cassembly.\u201d \u00a7 50-206.52(d) (and examples cited therein).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">All these facts were before the district court which held that Southern Packaging\u2019s operations were not sufficient to constitute manufacturing within the Walsh-Healey Act, that the products remained virtually unchanged but for the packaging process, and that any manufacturing done by Southern Packaging was of a <em>\u201cde minimis </em>character.\u201d 458 F.Supp. at 732. Thus, the principal purpose of this contract was to furnish services within the meaning of the Service Contract Act. The regulations issued pursuant to this Act give credence to this finding. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.111 (1979). 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.130 lists examples of types of service contracts, one of which is \u201cpacking and crating.\u201d <em>See Descomp, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>377 F.Supp. 254, 261 (D.Del.1974). Based on the totality of the record, legislative history and statutory construction, we hold that the district court was correct in finding that Southern Packaging was not a manufacturer within the provisions of the WalshHealey Act, and thus not exempt from the Service Contract Act. 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 356(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">As stated earlier, the Service Contract Act requires a provision indicating that minimum wages be paid \u201cin accordance with prevailing rates for such employees in the locality . . . .\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(a)(1). The Department of Labor asks this Court to allow it the flexibility to use nationwide data through a composite locality approach, thus necessitating only one wage determination, in compiling data on the prevailing minimum wage. The Department of Labor contends that such an approach is fairer in a solicitation of bids where, as in the present case, the bidding agency does not know, or care, where the contract will be performed. We are not persuaded in law or by common sense that the district court\u2019s interpretation of locality with regard to the contract <em>sub judice </em>was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-11\">Essentially, there are three reasons for this finding. First, as the Department of Labor indicates, in ninety-eight percent of the requested determinations, the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area provides an appropriate base in determining the mean average of wages. It is only in one-half of one percent that the Department of Labor has used a nationwide minimum wage rate. There would not appear to be such an undue burden on the Employment Standards Administration to provide individual locality wage determinations in the one-half of one percent of the cases where the Department of Labor claims their composite approach is more expeditious. Second, locality has been defined as a \u201cparticular spot, situation or location.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such a description, by common sense, hardly seems synonymous with nationwide. Third, the cases which construe the Walsh-Healey Act upon which the Department of Labor relies for the proposition that the district court should have interpreted locality herein as nationwide in scope are readily distinguishable. Locality as used in the Walsh-Healey Act, <em>Mitchell v. Covington Mills, Inc., </em>229 F.2d 506, 508 (D.C.Cir. 1955), <em>cert. denied, </em>350 U.S. 1002, 76 S.Ct. 546, 100 L.Ed. 865 (1956), is not synonymous with locality as used in the Service Contract Act. This is clear on the face of the two statutes. <em>United States v. Deluxe Cleaners and Laundry, Inc., </em>511 F.2d 926, 928-29 (4th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-12\">Finally, the district court weighed the testimony of Mr. Camrath of the Service Wage Determination Division, who urged a flexible meaning of the term \u201clocality\u201d and rejection of the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area usage. The district court rejected this testimony and gave locality its ordinary and common meaning. It adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>the reasoning of the District Court for the District of Delaware in <em>Descomp, Inc. v. Sampson, </em>337 F.Supp. 254 (D.Del.1974). In <em>Descomp, </em>the court held that keypunch operators were not \u201cservice employees within the meaning of the Act,\u201d despite the fact that Descomp provided a service. Thus, the Service Contract Act was not applicable. <em>Id. </em>at 264. The <em>Descomp </em>court stated that even if the Act did apply, the locality in which wage determinations should be made is where the work is to be performed. <em>Id. </em>at 265-66. It placed emphasis on the testimony of then Solicitor of Labor Charles Donahue, who testified in hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on Labor concerning the Service Contract Act that the term \u201clocality\u201d was to have a limited nature similar to the strict provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act (city, town, village).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While such restrictive construction of locality under the Service Contract Act would be untenable, the construction proposed by the Department of Labor is too expansive, too unwieldy, and too unfair. We agree with the district court\u2019s construction of locality under the facts of this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are aware of <em>Kentron Hawaii, Ltd. v. Warner, </em>480 F.2d 1166, 1178-80 (D.C.Cir. 1973) and find it factually inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">We find the remaining contentions to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1221-18\">. Prior to the bid solicitation in question, the Department of Labor had issued wage determinations for MCI contracts under the Walsh-Healey Act, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 35.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">. We, as did the district court, realize that the Department of Labor\u2019s interpretation of the Service Contract Act and the Walsh-Healey Act is to be accorded some deference. However, \u201cthis deference is constrained by our obligation to honor the clear meaning of a statute, as revealed by its language, purpose and history.\u201d <em>Southeastern Community College v. Davis, </em>442 U.S. 397, 411, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 2369, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979) (quoting <em>Teamsters v. Daniel, </em>439 U.S. 551, 566 n. 20, 99 S.Ct. 790, 799 n. 20, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">. 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 351.

Although we affirm the district court\u2019s construction of locality under the facts of this case, we do not accept Southern Packaging\u2019s contention that national wage rates are never permissible under the Service Contract Act. A careful reading of the testimony of Solicitor Donahue suggests that neither the Solicitor of Labor nor Congress anticipated that nationwide competition for service contracts, which, unlike manufacturing contracts under the Walsh-Healey Act, are performed at predetermined sites in the vast majority of cases, would occur. We postulate that there may be the rare and unforeseen service contract which might be performed at locations throughout the country and which would generate truly nationwide competition. In such a case, national wage rates may be permissible, although we do not decide the point. This is not such a case, however. Although an invitation to bid was mailed to fifty-eight firms throughout the country, the Defense Personnel Support Center, based on past experience, was able to predict that the successful bid would come from one of twelve firms. As the district court reasonably found, the Department of Labor could easily have issued the twelve individual wage determinations originally requested.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
