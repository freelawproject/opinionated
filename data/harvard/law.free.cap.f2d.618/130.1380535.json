No. 78-195.</p>\n<p id=\"A9I\">DECISION AND ORDER</p>\n<author id=\"b264-12\">TORRUELLA, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">Plaintiff is a native born Puerto Rican who sought promotion to position of Fire Chief, Naval Security \"Group Activity, Sabana Seca, Puerto Rico. Plaintiff was not promoted and instead a former Fire Chief, a continental born American, was repromoted to this vacant position. Plaintiff claims the action in not promoting him was discriminatory in nature and grounded solely on the basis of national origin. This action is brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000e-17, as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, Pub.L. No.92-261, 86 Stat. 103. Jurisdiction is founded on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(3) and \u00a7 2000e-5. It is now before us on Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff\u2019s opposition also prays for Summary Judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">Plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is predicated on the theory that he was denied appointment to the position of fire chief solely because he is a native born Puerto Rican. The thrust of his argument, and indeed the basic premise of his cause of action, is that he was in fact the better qualified candidate but that the appointment was conferred on someone else taking into consideration factors other than qualification and ability. The Defendant counters that Plaintiff initially failed to establish his qualifications. Even accepting that Plaintiff was fully qualified, the Defendant contends that applicable federal statutes and regulations mandated that another applicant be accorded priority consideration and it is on this basis that Plaintiff was not appointed. Defendant emphatically denies that its action in not promoting Plaintiff was in any way tainted with a discriminatory animus. Our inquiry turns to whether Plaintiff\u2019s allegations or proffered evidence can sustain a Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-17\">Section 2000e-2(a)(l), 42 U.S.C., provides that it shall be unlawful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-18\">\u201c(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-19\">In similar fashion Section 2000e-16(a) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-20\">\u201c(a) All personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment in military departments as defined in Section 102 of Title 5, . shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-21\">When faced with a claim of employment discrimination a Court\u2019s inquiry into the merits of a claim, i. e., the order and nature of proof required for relief, must necessarily be scrutinized under the guidelines established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Under <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>a plaintiff bears an initial burden of establishing at the outset a prima <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>facie case of illegal discrimination. To do so he must in general terms first demonstrate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">(1) that he belongs to a protected class (here national origin)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">(2) that he applied and was qualified for the promotion for which the vacancy was announced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">(3) that despite these qualifications he was rejected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">(4) that after his rejection the position remained open; or in our particular setting, that a lesser qualified person was hired before him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(See: McDonnell Douglas, </em>supra, p. 802, 93 S.Ct., p. 1824.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Once a Plaintiff meets this initial burden the inference is presented that an illegal discrimination has occurred. See: <em>Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, </em>438 U.S. 567, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978). But a prima facie showing is not the end but the beginning of the inquiry. \u201cA prima facie under <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>raises an inference of discrimination only because we presume these acts, if otherwise unexplained, are more likely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors.\u201d <em>Furnco Construction, </em>supra, at p. 577, 98 S.Ct., at p. 2949.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">The second step of a <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis is activated after a prima facie case has been presented. At this point the burden shifts to the employer and he must then \u201carticulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u201d <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at p. 802, 93 S.Ct. at p. 1824. It is vital to note that the burden resting on the employer is not that of proving a total absence of discriminatory motive in not hiring or promoting, see: <em>Bd. of Trustees of Keene State College v. Sweeney, </em>439 U.S. 24, 99 S.Ct. 295, 58 L.Ed.2d 216, vacating <em>Sweeney v. Bd. of Trustees of Keene State College, </em>569 F.2d 169 (C.A. 1, 1978), \u201c. . . rather it is a burden of production\u201d, <em>Loeb v. Textron, Inc., </em>600 F.2d 1003, 1011 (1st Cir. 1979). \u201c[U]nder <em>Furnco </em>and <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>the employer\u2019s burden is satisfied if he simply \u2018explains what he has done\u2019 or \u2018produc[es] evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons.\u201d <em>Sweeney, </em>supra, 439 U.S. at 25 n.2, 99 S.Ct. at 296; see also: <em>Loeb v. Textron, Inc., </em>supra, at p. 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">The third step of the <em>McDonnell </em>analysis affords the Plaintiff a \u201cfair opportunity to show that [the employer\u2019s] stated reason for [plaintiff\u2019s] rejection was in fact pretext.\u201d <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at p. 804, 93 S.Ct. at 1825. With respect to final adjudication of relief: \u201cThe ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue of discrimination remains with the Plaintiff, who must convince the Court by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she has been the victim of discrimination.\u201d <em>Sweeney, </em>569 F.2d at 177. See: <em>Loeb, </em>supra; <em>Blizard v. Fielding, </em>572 F.2d 13, 15 (C.A. 1, 1978). Against this background of shifting burdens and order of proof we proceed to analyze the pending Motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">We first examine those material facts not generally in dispute. On February 6, 1976 Vacancy Announcement Number 76-008 was issued on the position of Fire Chief, Naval Security Group Activity, Sabanea Seca. Certain qualification requirements were listed, which included: general experience \u2014 1 year, firefighting experience \u2014 2V2 years, supervising experience \u2014 V2 year. This position was classified as Fire Chief GS-081-07. Plaintiff, who at the time was a firefighter, believed he met these requirements and applied for the promotion. Three other persons also filed applications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>under this vacancy announcement. Of these applicants three were continental born Americans and one, Plaintiff, was a native born Puerto Rican. Three of the applicants were found disqualified because they did not meet the specialized qualification requirements, to wit, six months of supervisory experience. See Exhibit C, pgs. \u25a0 7-17. On this vacancy John Q. Massey was selected because of the ineligibility of the other applicants. Thereafter Plaintiff filed a request that John Q. Massey\u2019s promotion be revoked because he did not meet the physical requirements for the job and because Plaintiff felt himself to be the superi- or candidate. No action was taken on this request because immediately thereafter the original announcement was cancelled and a new Vacancy Announcement issued which eliminated the requirement for supervisory experience.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On this second vacancy the Personnel Office of the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station certified John Q. Massey\u2019s name as a priority referral. The basis for this priority was because John Q. Massey had served as Fire Chief during 1960-1973. In accordance with the Federal Personnel Manual, Subchapter 4-3-c(2) such demotion without personal cause entitled Mr. Massey for special consideration for repromotion. See: Appendix to Answers to Defendant\u2019s Interrogatory.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant states that Mr. Massey was selected in observance of this directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">On the basis of the record before us it is difficult to find that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of illegal discrimination under <em>McDonnell Douglas. </em>There is no dispute that Plaintiff is a native born Puerto Rican and as such this is distinguishable from other ethnic nationalities, so as to constitute a definable class. But this is the only requirement that Plaintiff has fully met. The second <em>McDonnell </em>requirement compels a Plaintiff to show that he was qualified for the position sought. Plaintiff\u2019s first application for the promotion failed to state the requisite supervisory experience.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Insomuch as he failed to show he was qualified he has, <em>a fortiori, </em>failed to show that he was rejected despite being qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Plaintiff had in fact presented a prima facie case of discrimination,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s explanations for the rejection and the promotion of John Q. Massey present a sufficient rebuttal under the second step of a <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">First, John Q. Massey was promoted under a facially neutral seniority system: Subchapter 4-3 c(2) of the Federal Personnel Manual. Title VII exempts such systems from constituting discrimination. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(h) \u201cit shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different standards of compensation, or different terms, conditions, or privileges of employment pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>to a bona fide seniority or merit system, . provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate . . . \u201d Nowhere has Plaintiff presented or argued that there is any discriminatory animus in the federal government\u2019s policy of according special priority in repromoting those who were initially demoted for such reasons as a reduction in force. This is a neutral seniority objective. Cf. <em>Watkins v. United Steelworkers of Amer. Local No. 2369, </em>516 F.2d 41, 45-49 (C.A. 5, 1975). Defendant Navy was therefore justified in utilizing it in filling vacancies. See gen.: <em>Teamsters v. United States, </em>supra.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Once the Defendant has justified or explained his actions, a Plaintiff must show that the \u201creason so articulated or stated is a mere pretext or \u2018cover up\u2019 for what was in truth a discriminatory purpose.\u201d <em>Loeb v. Textron, Inc., </em>supra, p. 1012. On a Motion for Summary Judgment this justification would best be placed in issue by an adequate offer of proof that the justification was in fact pretext. In the case at bar Plaintiff makes no mention of a <em>McDonnell </em>analysis. There is, however, lengthy argument on the qualifications of the applicant promoted instead of Plaintiff. It is presented that John Q. Massey is a disabled veteran with a 30% disability pension from the Veterans Administration. The record contains a Medical Report dated July 18, 1962, Dr. Luis Pagan, that found John Q. Massey physically disqualified for a fire fighter position.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The record further contains an accident report by Dr. Rodriguez Taveras, June 11, 1974, which reveals that Massey suffered a hand fracture which has caused a ten percent disability in its use. Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 10-A. Lastly, Plaintiff draws the Court\u2019s attention to the United States Civil Service Commission Regulations on the physical requirements for firefighting personnel. These read thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">\u201cThe duties of these positions require arduous physical exertion under rigorous and unusual conditions. Persons appointed will be subject to extreme physical danger and to irregular and protracted hours of work. Any structural or functional limitation or defect which tends to interfere materially with a high degree of physical activity will disqualify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-12\">\u201cExcept where there is clear medical evidence of complete recovery, current receipt of disability retirement compensation from any source, or of a Veterans Administration non-service pension, for any physical condition which is disqualifying in the physical requirement statement will be considered prima facie evidence of failure to meet the physical standards for these positions.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">From these factors Plaintiff would purport to show that pursuant to Subchapter 4-3 c(2) of the Federal Personnel Manual Defendant could, and should, have rejected Massey because these were \u201cpersuasive reasons for doing so.\u201d Plaintiff would attribute a discriminatory animus in not so rejecting Massey.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">Contrary to Plaintiff\u2019s position, and irrespective of the excerpts from the record which Plaintiff highlights, the record does not establish that John Q. Massey was unfit to perform the duties of fire chief.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The most recent medical report of record, Dr. Payne, April 12, 1977 found Massey\u2019s impairments \u201cnot sufficient to interfere with normal performance of duties as fire chief.\u201d See: Appendix to Interrogatories, Exhibit A, p. 7. The Report recommended that Massey be accepted as fit for duty. With respect to Dr. Pagan\u2019s report on disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Plaintiff has conveniently overlooked the fact that the Bureau of Retirement and Insurance of the United States Civil Service Commission ruled that Massey was not disabled for his position. This was reaffirmed by a Report dated June 21, 1963. It should further be noted that when Massey did retire it was for having reached the mandatory retirement age and not for any physical disabilities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The conclusions of Dr. Pagan were thus rejected and overruled by the Commission and therefore do not reflect the true meaning of Massey\u2019s medical record.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are reminded that the present action is a claim of illegal discrimination not a judicial review of an administrative finding on Massey\u2019s disability.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">With respect to the other arguments raised by Plaintiff two factors are worth noting. First, insofar as the medical reports of record reveal Massey to be \u201cfit for duty\u201d they rebut any presumption of disability created by the Civil Service Manual. Second, since John Q. Massey was a veteran these requirements are generally waived, see: 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3312, 3351, 3363, cf. also: <em>Massachusetts v. Feeney, </em>434 U.S. 884, 98 S.Ct. 252, 54 L.Ed.2d 169 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We make one last observation. Defendant has presented evidence to show what amounts to a prima facie case of nondiscrimination within this agency. The \u201cManpower Listing and Analysis of National Origin of All Civilian Employees at Naval Security Group Activity, Sabana Seca,\u201d reveals that of 60 civilian employees 56 or over 93% are Puerto Rican, 3 or 5% are Continental born American and 1 is of a different national origin. In <em>Teamsters v. United States, </em>supra, the Court stated: . . it is unmistakably clear that \u2018[statistical analyses have served and will continue to serve an important role\u2019 in cases in which the existence of discrimination is a disputed issue.\u201d <em>Id., </em>431 U.S. at 339, 97 S.Ct. at 1856 (citations omitted). And while statistics are \u201cnot irrefutable\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 340, 97 S.Ct. at 1856, Plaintiff has presented nothing along these lines which would allow the Court to question their validity, accurateness, or relevance to a claim of discrimination in this agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">For all the above cited reasons we find that Plaintiff has failed to meet the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test at two junctures. First, Plaintiff has not proved, nor presented evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact, to establish that he presented himself as qualified when he first applied for the promotion. At another level, when Defendant set forth a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the nonpromotion, Plaintiff failed to adduce sufficient facts that would put in factual issue the question of \u201cpretext or coverup.\u201d In reaching the above conclusions we are not unmindful that summary judgment is affordable only \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with.the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Rule 56, Fed.R.Civ.P. See gen.: <em>Thyssen Plastik </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>Anger KG v. Induplas, Inc., 576 </em>F.2d 400 (C.A. 1, 1978); <em>Hahn v. Sargent, </em>523 F.2d 461 (C.A. 1, 1975); <em>Redman v. Warrener, </em>516 F.2d 766 (C.A. 1, 1975). When a Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence \u201cto permit a trier of fact to draw an inference of [racial] discrimination\u201d summary judgment is appropriate. See e. g.: <em>Mosley v. United States, </em>425 F.Supp. 50, 60 (N.D. Cal.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is Granted. The Clerk of the Court shall enter Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">It Is So Ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In San Juan, Puerto Rico, this 22nd day of July, 1979.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-22\">. Plaintiff\u2019s employer, the Department of the Navy is a military department listed under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 102.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b265-11\">. The wording of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test has been slightly altered to better reflect the factual setting before us. <em>McDonnell </em>dealt with racial discrimination. The present action deals with alleged discrimination based on national origin. The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test is not an \u201cinflexible formulation.\u201d <em>Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 358, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1866, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1976). It will necessarily vary according to the factual situation presented. <em>McDonnell. Douglas, </em>411 U.S. p. 802, 93 S.Ct. p. 1824. The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis \u201cis merely a sensible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination.\u201d <em>Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, </em>438 U.S. 567, 577, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2949, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b266-4\">. Defendant, in its Motion for Summary Judgment, explains this cancellation as an attempt by the Navy Agency to widen the area of consideration and include more names in the list of eligibles. The second Announcement was for appointment at a lower level, with promotion to the higher level to come within twelve months upon demonstrating ability to perform at this higher level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AP4j\">. Said section reads thus: \u201c(2) <em>Special consideration for repromotion. </em>An employee demoted without personal cause is entitled to special consideration for repromotion in the agency in which he was demoted. Although he is not guaranteed repromotion, ordinarily he should be repromoted when a vacancy occurs in a position at his former grade (or any intervening grade) for which he has demonstrated that he is well-qualified, unless there are persuasive reasons for not doing so. Consideration of an employee entitled to special consideration for repromotion must precede efforts to fill the vacancy by other means . \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AK-\">. As stated before the Announcement called for six months of supervisory experience. Plaintiff\u2019s resume states only that: \u201cIn 1961 I was promoted in grade, and in my new position occasionally I assume higher responsibilities including Acting Fire Chief.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Exhibit C, p. 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"APA\">. That is accepting his contention that a properly presented resume would have shown him to have the required experience. We further examine Plaintiff\u2019s claims in light of the second announcement which required no supervisory experience.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\">. We find that even if a prima facie case existed it has been successfully rebutted under the second step of a <em>McDonnell </em>analysis. This does not, however, mean that the first step could have been bypassed. See: <em>Blizard v. Fielding, </em>572 F.2d 13 (C.A. 1, 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"AQq\">. The Report lists John Q. Massey as suffering from Chronic Sinusitis, multiple sclerosis, infantile paralysis in childhood, ulcer. This disability determination was successfully appealed by Massey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"Aig\">. For reasons discussed above we find that they are not sufficient to raise an issue of fact on disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\">. Massey retired on January 31, 1978. See: Def\u2019s Exh. A. Num. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"A2d\">. The extreme weakness of Plaintiff\u2019s argument is also manifested by the fact that he purports to show John Q. Massey\u2019s disqualification for promotion in 1976 with Medical reports over fourteen years old and after having done so reaches the wrong conclusion with them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"A9Y\">. In reversing Dr. Pagan\u2019s findings the Bureau of Retirement and Insurance relied in part on the reports of: Dr. Diaz Cruz, October 13, 1962 which concluded: \u201cMr. Massey enjoys very good health and has always been able to do ordinary work, including jobs that require considerable physical effort\"; Dr. Vicens, September 9, 1962, which stated: \u201c. . .1 find no active disease in the system. It is my opinion that he can perform his present duties at full capacity\u201d; Dr. Quilichini, September 7, 1962, which states: \u201cHe has enjoyed very good health and has always been able to do ordinary work, including jobs that require considerable physical effort.\u201d Also of relevance is the report of Massey\u2019s superior officer during this period of time: \u201cMr. Massey has capably performed these duties and I am anxious to have him continue in this capacity.\u201d See: Copy of John Q.
