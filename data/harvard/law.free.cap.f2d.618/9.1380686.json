Chapter XI provides for an arrangement proceeding, that is, any plan of a debtor for the settlement, satisfaction, or extension of time for payment upon any terms of his unsecured debts. Upon the filing of the petition, a receiver was appointed to take charge of the property and to operate the business of the corporate debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">On December 21, 1978, the Board timely filed a notice of appeal to the district court. On May 17,1979, the district court affirmed the order of the bankruptcy court, supporting its judgment with a memorandum decision and holding that Bankruptcy Rule 11-44 effectively prevented the Board from pursuing the unfair labor practice proceeding. The Board then appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">Bankruptcy Rule 11-44 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\">A petition filed under . . . [Chapter XI] shall operate as a stay of the commencement or the continuation of any court or <em>other proceeding </em>against the debtor</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-17\">Bankruptcy Rule ll-44(a) [emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b142-18\">The district judge pointed out that the above-quoted portion of the Chapter XI automatic stay provision is identical to the language of the Chapter X automatic stay provision. See Bankruptcy Rule 10-601. Chapter X pertains to corporate reorganizations, however, and is subject to certain other provisions, such as 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 672 (now repealed with the rest of the 1898 Bankruptcy Act):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-19\">The right of employees or of persons seeking employment on the property of a debtor under the jurisdiction of the court to join a labor organization of their choice, or to refuse to join or remain members of a company union, shall be free from interference, restraint, or coercion by the court, a debtor, or trustee. It shall be the duty of a debtor or trustee to report to the judge any agreement restricting or interfering with such right, and the judge shall thereupon enter an appropriate order for the termination of such agreement and for notice to the employees that the same is no longer binding upon them. No funds of the estate shall be used by a debtor or a trustee for the purpose of maintaining company unions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-20\">The National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq., </em>expressly provides that it takes precedence over 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 672:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az\">Wherever the application of the provisions of section 672 of Title 11 conflicts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>with the application of the provisions of this subchapter, this subehapter shall prevail: <em>Provided, </em>That in any situation where the provisions of this subchapter cannot be validly enforced, the provisions of such other Acts shall remain in full force and effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">As the district court correctly noted, the fact that Congress did not provide in like manner for the National Labor Relations Act to take precedence over Chapter XI proceedings distinguishes cases which hold that the Labor Board matters are not stayed by Chapter X proceedings. It does not necessarily follow, however, as the district judge concluded, that Board proceedings <em>are </em>stayed by Chapter XI proceedings. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 165 may simply be the response of Congress to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 672. Not finding an analogous provision in Chapter XI, Congress may have seen no need to determine whether or not the National Labor Relations Act took precedence over Chapter XI proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">After the district court\u2019s decision in this case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the Board\u2019s regulatory proceedings \u201ccannot be subject to the automatic stay provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 11-44.\u201d <em>In re Bel Air Chateau Hospital, Inc., </em>611 F.2d 1248, 1250-51 (9th Cir. 1979). The court held that such result was \u201cstrongly suggested\u201d by <em>Nathanson v. National Labor Relations Board, </em>344 U.S. 25, 73 S.Ct. 80, 97 L.Ed. 23 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">In <em>Nathanson, </em>the Board had ordered a company to pay certain employees back pay. Thereafter, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against the company. The Board filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding for the back pay. The Supreme Court held that the Board was a creditor and that the back pay order was a provable claim, but that the claim was not a debt due to the United States and therefore not entitled to priority. The Court further held that the computation of the amount of the award was properly referred back to the Board by the bankruptcy court. In that connection, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE0\">[W]here the matter in controversy has been entrusted by Congress to an administrative agency, the bankruptcy court normally should stay its hand pending an administrative decision. . . . It is the Board, not the referee in bankruptcy nor the court, that has been entrusted by Congress with the authority to determine what measures will remedy the unfair labor practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">344 U.S. at 30, 73 S.Ct. at 83-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">However, the Supreme Court, in discussing the priority question, also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-14\">The Board argues that the interest of the United States in eradicating unfair labor practices is so great that the back pay order should be given the additional sanction of priority in payment. Whether that should be done is a legislative decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 28, 73 S.Ct. at 82-83. Bankruptcy Rule 11-44 was transmitted to Congress along with the other Chapter XI rules by Supreme Court order dated March 18, 1974, and, to the extent it was not disapproved, constitutes a \u201clegislative^decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">The <em>Bel Air </em>court also considered its result harmonious with the 1978 Bankruptcy Law. A petition filed under the new act automatically operates as a stay of \u201cthe commencement or continuation of a judicial, <em>administrative, or other proceeding </em>against the debtor . . . .\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)(1) [emphasis added]. The legislative history expands somewhat on the automatic stay provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-18\">The scope of this paragraph is broad. All proceedings are stayed, including arbitration, administrative, and judicial proceedings. Proceedings in this sense encompasses civil actions and all proceedings even if they are not before governmental tribunals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-19\">However, the automatic stay does not operate in regard to \u201cthe commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit\u2019s police or regulatory power . . . 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(b)(4). This provision is also explained in the legislative history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">Thus, where a governmental unit is suing a debtor to prevent or stop violation of fraud, environmental protection, consumer protection, safety, or similar police or regulatory laws, or attempting to fix damages for violation of such a law, the action or proceeding is not stayed under the automatic stay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Neither the <em>Nathanson </em>case nor the 1978 Bankruptcy Act gives a crystal clear answer to whether or not Labor Board proceedings are automatically stayed by the institution by bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The <em>Bel Air </em>court found it unclear whether the stay involved there was based upon Bankruptcy Rule 11 \u2014 44 or was issued as an exercise of discretion. The court held that even if performed as a discretionary act, the stay was erroneously issued, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH0\">We think the court erred in issuing a stay solely on the basis of its determination that the Receiver was not an alter ego of the business\u2019s former operators. Whether a new employer is an \u201calter ego\u201d or a \u201csuccessor\u201d to an earlier employer is a question of substantive federal labor law, the resolution of which is committed to the Board and the courts that review its determinations. <em>See, e. g., Golden State Bottling Co. v. NLRB, </em>414 U.S. 168, 94 S.Ct. 414, 38 L.Ed.2d 388 (1973); <em>Southport Petroleum Co. v. NLRB, </em>315 U.S. 100, 62 S.Ct. 452, 86 L.Ed. 718 (1942). It is by no means clear in the event that the Board should determine that Bel Air committed unfair labor practices that it cannot enforce a remedial order against the Receiver, <em>see, e. g., NLRB v. Coal Creek Coal Co., </em>204 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1953), especially in light of established policy against allowing employers to change their legal form as a means of evading their responsibility under the Act. <em>See Southport Petroleum Co., </em>315 <em>U.S. </em>at 106, 62 S.Ct. at 455. The bankruptcy court erred in issuing a stay on the basis of an unresolved issue of federal labor law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">611 F.2d at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">This reasoning can be applied as well in determining whether a Labor Board proceeding is subject to an automatic stay and probably presents a firmer basis in support of the <em>Bel Air </em>result than <em>Nathanson </em>or the 1978 Act. In <em>Southport Petroleum Co. v. N. L. R. B., </em>315 U.S. 100, 62 S.Ct. 452, 86 L.Ed. 718 (1942), the Supreme Court, although not dealing with the impact of bankruptcy at all, drew a distinction between liquidation and reorganization in applying Labor Board proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-14\">Whether there was a <em>bona fide </em>discontinuance and a true change of ownership\u2014 which would terminate the duty of reinstatement created by the Board\u2019s order\u2014 or merely a disguised continuance of the old employer, does not clearly appear, and accordingly is a question of fact properly to be resolved by the Board on direct resort to it, or by the court if contempt proceedings are instituted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 106, 62 S.Ct. at 456 [footnote omitted]. In <em>N. L. R. B. v. Coal Creek Coal Co., </em>204 F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1953), a similar distinction was drawn where a \u201cfederal receivership\u201d rather than bankruptcy was involved.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Finally, if \u201cthe debtors\u2019 position were to be adopted, Chapter XI would provide an instantly available, cheap and easy sanctuary from all state regulatory enforcement proceedings\u201d and from all federal regulatory proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">On balance, we agree with <em>Bel Air </em>that \u201c[i]f regulatory proceedings threaten the assets of the estate, the decision to issue a stay can then be made on a discretionary basis.\u201d 611 F.2d at 1251. But where, as here, it appears that the assets of the estate are not threatened and the company is being reorganized rather than liquidated, Bankruptcy Rule 11-44 shall not apply and regulatory proceedings of the National Labor Relations Board are not subject to the automatic stay provisions of that bankruptcy rule. This does not preclude imposition of a stay where a proper showing was made that the regulatory proceedings threatened the estate assets or that the bankruptcy or other proceedings would result in the liquidation of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Judgment reversed and case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\">. 95th Cong., 2d Sess., Sen.R.
