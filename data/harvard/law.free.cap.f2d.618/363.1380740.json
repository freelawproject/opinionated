Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a Texas corporation with its principal place of business in Dallas, is a commercial real estate broker. In August, 1978, Texas Instruments, Inc., informed Cushman &amp; Wakefield that it wished to lease additional office space in north central Dallas. Cushman &amp; Wake-field, aware that Equitable had such space available in a building known as \u201cPark Central VI,\u201d arranged for information about Park Central VI to be brought to the attention of Texas Instruments. Pursuant to this arrangement, Equitable and Cushman &amp; Wakefield signed the following agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-19\">CUSHMAN &amp; WAKEFIELD of Texas, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-20\">Commonwealth Plaza,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-21\">2964 LBJ Freeway, Suite 301;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-22\">Dallas, Texas 75234 (214) 247-9093</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKl\">Mr. Piers Chance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhN\">Building Manager</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVp\">Park Central</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-23\">7616 LBJ Freeway, Suite 616</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_K\">Dallas, TX 75251</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-24\">Re: Proposed Lease between The Equitable Assurance Society of the United States, as Landlord, and Texas Instruments, as Tenant, in Park Central VI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar-\">Gentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvK\">This letter, when agreed to by you, will confirm our agreement with respect to the compensation to be paid to Cushman &amp; Wakefield of Texas, Inc.

Mgr.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Three months later Texas Instruments executed a written lease agreement with Equitable for office space in Park Central VI. Cushman &amp; Wakefield demanded that Equitable pay it a commission in accordance with the commission agreement. Equitable refused and in March, 1979, filed this suit for a declaratory judgment. Cushman &amp; Wakefield counterclaimed for the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">In October, 1979, Equitable filed a motion for summary judgment contending that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law (1) because the commission agreement relied on by Cushman &amp; Wakefield was void by reason of a provision of the Texas statute of frauds and (2) because Cushman &amp; Wakefield was not the \u201cprocuring cause\u201d of the Equitable-Texas Instruments lease. On the basis of Equitable\u2019s statute of frauds claim, the district court granted the motion and ordered that Cushman &amp; Wakefield take nothing on its counterclaim. Because the issue was one inappropriate for disposition on summary judgment, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">Under the relevant Texas statute of frauds, a real estate brokerage commission agreement is enforceable only if the real estate that is the subject of the agreement may be identified with \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d <em>E. g., Chisholm </em>v. <em>Hipes, </em>552 S.W.2d 519, 521 (Tex.Civ.App.1977). <em>See </em>Real Estate License Act, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 6573a, \u00a7 20(b) (Vernon Supp.). Rejecting Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s offer of extrinsic evidence allegedly identifying the location of \u201cPark Central VI,\u201d the district court held that, as a matter of Texas law, real estate is identifiable with reasonable certainty only if specific reference to its location is made in the writing itself. The court found that such was not the case here. After noting that the agreement gave \u201cno address (street, city or state) or legal description (lot, plat, addition, etc.)\u201d for Park Central VI, the court concluded that, despite the Dallas letterhead on the agreement and the agreement\u2019s Dallas address, \u201c \u2018Park Central VI\u2019 could be in another city or state; one simply cannot discern the location of \u2018Park Central VI\u2019 with reasonable certainty from the face of this agreement.\u201d It thus held the agreement void under the Texas statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">As Cushman &amp; Wakefield argues, the district court misconstrued Texas law. The Texas courts have observed on a number of occasions, quoting Corpus Juris, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>Oak Cliff Realty Corp. v. Mauzy, </em>354 S.W.2d 693, 694 (Tex.Civ.App.1962) (holding sufficient description of land by particular name by which it is known in locality: \u201cJefferson Tower\u201d); <em>Krueger v. W. K. Ewing Co., </em>139 S.W.2d 836, 839 (Tex.Civ.App.1940) (holding sufficient description of property by common or particular name by which it is known in locality where situated: \u201cSan Gabriel Apartments\u201d). <em>See, e. g., Wilson v. Fisher, </em>144 Tex. 53, 188 S.W.2d 150, 152 (1945); <em>Chisholm </em>v. <em>Hipes, </em>552 S.W.2d at 521; <em>Mauro v. Wildwood Co., </em>426 S.W.2d 322, 324-25 (Tex.Civ.App.1968); <em>Manning v. Barnard, </em>277 S.W.2d 160, 164 (Tex.Civ.App.1955). Cushman &amp; Wakefield contends that a party familiar with the Dallas, Texas, area could, with reasonable certainty, identify and locate the real estate at issue in the agreement from the agreement\u2019s \u201cPark Central VI\u201d description. <em>See, e. g., Riebe v. Foale, </em>508 S.W.2d 175, 178 (Tex.Civ.App.1974). Because we cannot say that this contention is false as a matter of law, Cushman &amp; Wakefield is entitled to a remand for an opportunity so to prove. See, e. <em>g., Walker Barnebey Co. v. Schmidt, </em>374 S.W.2d 277, 278-79 (Tex.Civ.App.1963).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>The office of a description is not to identify the land, but to afford the means of identification, and when this is done, it is sufficient. Generally, therefore, any description is sufficient by which the identity of the premises can be established, or which furnishes the means of identification. A conveyance is also good if the description can be made certain within the terms of the instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Leaving aside the substantial question of whether or not the .commission agreement made \u201cprocuring cause\u201d a prerequisite to Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s right to a commission, our perusal of the record in this case also leads us to observe that whether Cushman &amp; Wakefield was the procuring cause of the lease agreement reached between Equitable and Texas Instruments is a question involving genuine issues of material fact that would also be inappropriate for disposition on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The case is REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-7\">. We agree with Cushman &amp; Wakefield that, contrary to Equitable\u2019s contention, it is not necessary under the Texas statute of frauds for a written commission agreement concerning the lease of space in an unfinished office building to specify the exact boundaries of the space.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
