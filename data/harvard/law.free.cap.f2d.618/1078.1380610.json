Underlying all of these allegations is the claim that 1-66 is being constructed in violation of the special restrictions imposed by the Secretary of Transportation in the administrative proceedings required by <em>Arlington Coalition on Transportation v. Volpe, </em>458 F.2d 1323 (4th Cir. 1972).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After an extensive evidentiary hearing, the district court found that the highway was being constructed in accordance with the Secretary\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-8\">The court\u2019s factual findings are amply supported by the record, and its conclusions reflect a correct understanding of the law. We find no cause for reversal in the numerous assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1211-10\">. See <em>also District of Columbia Federation of Civic Associations v. </em>Adams, 571 F.2d 1310 (4th Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1211-11\">. The Secretary\u2019s Decision on Interstate Highway 66, Fairfax and Arlington Counties, Virginia, at 8, 9, 58 (Jan. 5. 1977), contained eight conditions. At issue in this case are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1211-12\">Not construct any highway lanes in the 1-66 right-of-way beyond the four which I am now approving;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1211-13\">Include the design elements and other features intended to minimize and compensate for adverse social and environmental impacts of the highway as set forth in the Final Four Lane Supplemental EIS, and this document, including specifically those set forth in Section V of this document (in other words, so far as possible, construction should be similar to the George Washington Parkway);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWV\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1211-26\">The highway has been reduced from eight lanes, as originally proposed, to four lanes. The highway will be designed so that all bridges and overpasses will accommodate four lanes of traffic, and \u201cno provision is included that would facilitate future widening\u201d of the roadway.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
