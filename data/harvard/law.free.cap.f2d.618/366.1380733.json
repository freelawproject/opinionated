Our inquiry, of course, is not whether we \u2014 sitting as a jury \u2014 would conclude that defendant Robert Atkins is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt but whether in our judgment a reasonable-minded jury could do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The critical evidence in the case focuses on Atkins\u2019 relationship with one Andy Inglet, a resident of Houston and a member of a cocaine conspiracy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is not disputed here that Inglet was in the cocaine \u201cbusiness\u201d and that one of his associates in crime was Garland Atkinson, a witness at Atkins\u2019 trial, of whom more later. Nor is it disputed that Atkins was a long-time friend of Inglet, that he knew Inglet was a cocaine dealer, and that whenever Inglet visited Miami to obtain cocaine from his source there he stayed with Atkins at his residence. All of the above was admitted by counsel for Atkins either in his opening statement to the jury or in his summation, most of it in both. It was Atkins\u2019 contention that despite this he was not involved in Inglet\u2019s crimes and, of course, the above\u2014 while reflecting severely on his taste in friends \u2014 does not show that Atkins was a criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">At trial, the prosecution sought to bridge the gap between Atkins\u2019 mere presence, knowledge and friendship with Inglet and his claimed participation in Inglet\u2019s crimes with evidence of several taped telephone conversations between the two during a two-week period in late November and early December of 1977. Before examining these conversations in detail, we note a few other items of relevant evidence that bear upon them. The record indicates that Inglet processed, or \u201ccooked\u201d his cocaine in a microwave oven, which had the effect of converting it from a powder into a rock-like cake. For some reason this increased its value and merchantability. Garland Atkinson, a confederate of Inglet who turned state\u2019s evidence, testified that within the conspiracy this process was referred to as \u201ctaking pictures,\u201d and the cake so produced was the \u201cpicture.\u201d He also testified that \u201cweather\u201d was a code term for cocaine. Finally, the evidence indicates that when Inglet visited Miami and stayed with Atkins, he customarily notified Atkins of his times of arrival, was met by him at the airport and returned by him to it at the end of his visit, and was usually the recipient of a follow-up call or calls from Atkins on his return to Houston. With this background, we turn to the taped conversations and their context, set out at length in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">Examining this sequence of conversations in the context of their relationship to In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>glet\u2019s cocaine-procuring trips to Florida, we conclude that the jury could reasonably have believed that they establish Atkins\u2019 participation in Inglet\u2019s cocaine scheme. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Despite their veiled language and Delphic references, a clear pattern emerges from these conversations of Atkins\u2019 concern with Inglet\u2019s goings and comings, with how his activities progressed after he returned with cocaine, and with the reaction of persons dealing with Inglet. Particularly revealing is Atkins\u2019 expression of regret in the conversation of November 28 that he had not \u201ckept some\u201d since it was so good, an indication that Atkins at one time had dominion over what Inglet received, with the right to retain what he wished. If the jury believed witness Atkinson\u2019s glossary of code terms, as under <em>Glasser </em>we presume they did, doubt vanishes: when \u201cweather\u201d refers to cocaine, \u201ctaking pictures\u201d to cooking it to hardness, and so forth, the conversations become frank discussions of drug trafficking.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>In addition to attacking the sufficiency of the evidence, Atkins raises numerous other challenges to his conviction. He charges that the court below erred in failing to suppress certain wiretap evidence and co-conspirators\u2019 statements, in refusing to admit allegedly exculpatory statements contained in Inglet\u2019s prior testimony and in letters written to him by Inglet, and in refusing to give the jury an instruction he requested. He also attacks his sentence as unfairly severe in comparison with those given others convicted of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\n<em>The Motion to Suppress Wiretap Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The defendant filed a pretrial motion to suppress evidence of the telephone conversations monitored by authority of a federal district court wiretap order in Houston. He also moved to adopt his codefendants\u2019 motions to suppress conversations monitored by authority of a Florida state court wiretap order. The motions were denied. Defendant argues on appeal that his suppression hearing was impermissibly curtailed. He also argues that because much of the probable cause for the Houston (federal) wiretap was supplied by information resulting from the Jackson (state) wiretap, he is entitled to attack the validity of the state wiretap. Atkins further contends that the state and federal wiretaps were infirm because investigative techniques other than the wiretap were not pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\"> The scope of cross-examination in evidentiary hearings is committed to the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>United States v. Brunson, </em>549 F.2d 348, 360 (5th Cir. 1977); and the decision of the judge below to curtail some of the defendant\u2019s cross-examination during the four-day suppression hearing was not an abuse of discretion denying him a \u201cmeaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">In holding the wiretap evidence admissible, the judge below ruled that the validity of the Florida wiretap was determined by Florida law, provided that the statutory authorization comported with constitutional standards, including probable cause. He therefore followed the decision of the Florida judge authorizing the wiretap order in finding that the statutory requirements had been met. He also ruled that the federal wiretap order was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">We agree with the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the wiretaps\u2019 legality. The Florida wiretap law has been held to be constitutional by this court. <em>United States v. Hyde, </em>574 F.2d 856, 862 n. 3 (5th Cir. 1978). The Florida judge correctly found that the affidavit supporting the Florida wiretap order supplied probable cause: the affidavit included detailed information as to the suspected conspirator \u201cEddie,\u201d whose phone was to be tapped, as well as information based on a tip from a confidential informant and verified by subsequent police investigation. Moreover, the affidavit avowed, and the trial judge found, that investigative techniques such as surveillance, further use of confidential informants, immunity for known conspirators, and interviews with known associates of Eddie were likely to be unsuccessful in uncovering the rest of the conspirators. The \u201cother investigative procedures\u201d requirement was thus met. This requirement is to be read in a common-sense fashion and is intended simply to assure that law enforcement officers do not resort to wiretapping in situations where traditional investigative techniques would adequately expose the crime. <em>See United States v. Hyde, </em>574 F.2d at 867 (interpreting \u201cother investigative procedures\u201d requirement of federal wiretap statute).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-12\">Courts will not invalidate a wire-tap order simply because defense lawyers are able to suggest <em>post factum </em>some investigative technique[s] that might have been used and [were] not. It is enough if the affidavit explains the prospective and retrospective failure of several investigative techniques that reasonably suggest themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>Id. </em>The Florida state court order and supporting affidavits indicate that the feasibility of other investigative techniques was examined and establish the validity of the Florida wiretap.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Much the same analysis and the same result applies to the federal wiretap order. The federal wiretap statute, too, has been held constitutional by this court. <em>United States v. Sklaroff, </em>506 F.2d 837, 840 (5th Cir. 1975). The wiretap order complied with the requirements of this statute. An affidavit, submitted by DEA Agent Gospadarek, relied in part on the information uncovered by the Florida wiretap and established probable cause. Moreover, the DEA agents used other investigative techniques, including surveillance, a pen register on Inglet\u2019s phone, and drug purchases by undercover agents. Therefore, defendant\u2019s attack on the denial of his motions to suppress wiretap evidence is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\n<em>Admission Of Coconspirators\u2019 Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The introduction of coconspirators\u2019 statements in this case is governed by the rule of <em>United States v. Apollo, </em>476 F.2d 156 (5th Cir. 1973), and <em>United States v. Oliva, </em>497 F.2d 130, 132-33 (5th Cir. 1974), because <em>United States v. James, </em>590 F.2d 575 (5th Cir. 1979) (en banc), was handed down after the trial and was made prospective in application. The applicable case law required the government to prove prima facie, by evidence independent of the hearsay statements of coconspirators, the existence of a conspiracy and the defendant\u2019s knowledge and participation in its before admitting hearsay statements by coconspirators. The independent evidence in the present case, as we have held above, was sufficient to support admission of coconspirators\u2019 statements. The taped conversations between defendant Atkins and defendant Inglet sufficiently established the existence of a drug conspiracy and Atkins\u2019 participation in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\n<em>Refusal To Admit Inglet\u2019s Prior Testimony And Letters</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">After the first trial, where a jury deadlocked on the issue of Atkins\u2019 guilt but convicted Inglet, Inglet allegedly wrote letters to Atkins expressing his regret that Atkins had been ensnared in the ongoing legal troubles because of his friendship with Inglet. The letters contained statements indicating that Atkins was only Inglet\u2019s friend and not a coconspirator and tending to support Atkins\u2019 innocent interpretations of some of the taped phone conversations between them. Before the second trial began, Inglet was declared an unavailable witness because he refused to testify when his family was threatened with reprisals if he did so. Atkins then sought to introduce Inglet\u2019s letters and his prior testimony from an earlier <em>James </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">The trial court denied admission of Inglet\u2019s letters and prior testimony. It ruled that the letters were not admissible because \u201cthe interests of justice would not be served\u201d and because \u201cthe government had no opportunity to cross-examine the letters.\u201d It also ruled that the prior testimony was not admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1). The defendant claims that the letters should have been admitted in the interests of justice under Fed.R.Evid. 803(24), 804(b)(5), and as statements against penal interest under 804(b)(3). He also urges that the <em>James </em>hearing testimony qualified for admission under Rule 804(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">The judge\u2019s refusal to admit the letters was not an abuse of discretion. The defendant did not provide the government with notice of his intention to offer the letters in advance of his attempt to do so, as Fed.R.Evid. 803(24) and 804(b)(5) require. <em>See, e. g. United States v. Ruffin, </em>575 F.2d 346, 358 (2d Cir. 1978) (Congress intended notice requirement to be rigidly enforced, and evidence can be admitted under Fed.R. Evid. 803(24) only if notice of an intention to rely upon it is given in advance to trial). Moreover, the letters lacked circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness equivalent to the 'specific hearsay exceptions listed in Rules 803 and 804 and were not against penal interest as required by 804(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">After the first trial, in which Inglet was convicted and sentenced to 43 years, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>before Atkins\u2019 second trial began, Inglet agreed to testify for the government in exchange for a reduction of his sentence to ten years. Inglet wrote all of the letters after his conviction, one eight days before his sentence was reduced, when it may be assumed that he was contemplating making a pact with the government to lessen his sentence, and two others after sentencing. Therefore, Inglet\u2019s \u201cpenal interest\u201d was no longer at stake when the letters were written, and they did not derive reliability from tending to be against his penal interests. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>559 F.2d 1271, 1273 (5th Cir. 1977) (statements after conviction immunity not against penal interests).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In addition, Inglet\u2019s relationship to Atkins tended to make the letters unreliable. Assuming that Inglet was Atkins\u2019 friend, as Atkins claimed, Inglet could well have been motivated by his friendship to fabricate statements in order to provide Atkins with exculpatory evidence. Also, the letters were written a year after the defendants\u2019 apprehension and first trial, in which Inglet was convicted, and this long delay after the beginning of the troubles they addressed would also cast doubt upon their reliability and spontaneity. They were thus properly excluded. <em>See United States v. Satterfield, </em>572 F.2d 687, 693 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Admission of Inglet\u2019s testimony, given during government cross-examination of him in a December 19,1978, <em>James </em>hearing, also was not erroneously denied. Fed.R. Evid. 804(b)(1) permits admission of former testimony if the declarant is unavailable at trial and \u201cif the party against whom the testimony is now offered . . had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.\u201d The defendant sought to use Inglet\u2019s testimony that his source of cocaine in Miami was a man named Robert, whose last name he did not know, in order to establish that Inglet was dealing with someone other than Robert Atkins, whose name was known to Inglet. Defense counsel for Atkins did not participate in the <em>James </em>hearing, and the hearing did not concern Atkins but only some of his codefendants. In addition, the government did not contend that Atkins was the Miami supplier being discussed by Inglet in the <em>James </em>hearing but rather that he was the contact man. Thus, the government did not have the motivation to question Inglet in order to make him acknowledge that the Robert of whom he spoke in the James hearing was in fact Atkins. Accordingly, Inglet\u2019s former testimony did not meet the requirements of 804(b)(1) for admission, and his challenge to its exclusion by the judge is without merit. <em>See, e. g., Peterson v. United States, </em>344 F.2d 419, 425 (5th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">\n<em>Jury Instructions on Circumstantial Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">, Defendant protests the court\u2019s failure to include in its jury charge an instruction that \u201cthe inferences to be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis of his innocence.\u201d This court has specifically held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">the \u201creasonable hypothesis\u201d test applied to circumstantial evidence, i. e., that such evidence must not only be consistent with guilt but must also be inconsistent with innocence, is employed by the <em>court </em>in assaying such evidence, but it is not necessary to so instruct the jury when they are instructed properly on \u201creasonable doubt . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-12\"><em>United States v. Cortez, </em>521 F.2d 1, 4 (5th Cir. 1975). In the present case, the district court clearly gave a more than sufficient instruction on reasonable doubt, and the defendant\u2019s challenge to the jury instruction must therefore be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"A92\">\n<em>Length of Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">The defendant challenges the length of his sentence compared to that of coconspirators Inglet and Atkinson. Atkins was convicted of seven counts and sentenced to fifteen years. The maximum possible sentence to which he was exposed by his conviction was 40 years. Inglet and Atkinson were each sentenced to ten years.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>[I]t is well settled that a federal district judge has wide discretion in determining what sentence to impose, and such a sentence will not be questioned on appeal as long as the sentence is within statutory limits and there is no showing of arbitrary or capricious action amounting to a gross abuse of discretion. ... A defendant cannot rely upon the sentences which other defendants receive as any yardstick for his sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><em>United States v. Hayes, </em>589 F.2d 811, 826-27 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\">. <em>Glasser v.
