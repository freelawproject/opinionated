In our previous decision we affirmed, per <em>curiam, </em>the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, M. Joseph Blumenfeld, Judge, that inmates serving life sentences in Connecticut prisons have a due process right to written statements from the state Board of Pardons explaining the denial of their applications for pardon. <em>See </em>593 F.2d 165 (2d Cir. 1979). The Supreme Court vacated our judgment, 442 U.S. 926, 99 S.Ct. 2854, 61 L.Ed.2d 294 (1979), and remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Upon reconsideration, we affirm our earlier conclusions that (1) the consistent issuance of pardons to inmates serving life sentences in Connecticut has given them a protected \u201cliberty\u201d interest in the pardons process,, and (2) the due process rights which attend this protected interest require that life inmates receive written explanations of adverse decisions by the Board of Pardons. We remand to the district court to determine at what point in an inmate\u2019s incarceration the likelihood of his receiving a pardon becomes sufficiently great to vest him with a protected \u201cliberty\u201d interest and due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">This action was commenced by plaintiff David Dumschat in February 1976. Dumschat was serving a life sentence following a 1964 homicide conviction, and, under state law, he was not eligible for parole until December 1983. Dumschat had appeared several times before the Connecticut Board of Pardons, which is empowered by statute to grant a life inmate his immediate release or to accelerate his eligibility for parole. Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 18-26.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On each occasion, the board rejected Dumschat\u2019s application without written or oral explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">After rehearing testimony from officials of the pardon and parole boards, Judge Blumenfeld concluded that Dumschat had a protected liberty interest in the pardons process. <em>See </em>432 F.Supp. 1310 (D.Conn. 1977). Accordingly, he issued a declaratory judgment holding that the Board of Parole violated Dumschat\u2019s due process rights when it failed to provide a written statement of reasons explaining its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">On the very date that Judge Blumenfeld issued his decision, June 16,1977, the Board of Pardons commuted Dumschat\u2019s sentence to time served, thereby granting him his immediate release. Nevertheless, Judge Blumenfeld denied the defendants\u2019 motion to vacate his judgment as moot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, he allowed three other life inmates to intervene and to consolidate their pending suit against the Board of Pardons with Dumschat\u2019s. The judge also granted the intervenors\u2019 motion to certify the consolidated suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>as a class action, brought on behalf of all inmates serving life sentences in Connecticut state prisons. After a new round of hearings, Judge Blumenfeld expanded his original decision to encompass the new plaintiff class. The Board of Pardons, he ruled, must furnish a written statement of reasons whenever a life inmate is denied a pardon. 462 F.Supp. 509 (D.Conn.1978). This court affirmed his decision in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion. Our affirmance was then vacated by the Supreme Court and remanded with instructions to reconsider in light of the Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In <em>Greenholtz, </em>the Supreme Court held that Nebraska state inmates were not constitutionally entitled to formal hearings before the Nebraska Board of Parole or to detailed written explanations of adverse parole decisions. The Court declared, first, that a state does not create a constitutionally cognizable liberty interest in parole release simply by establishing the possibility of parole. The \u201cmere hope\u201d of future freedom, without more, was deemed insufficient to invoke due process. <em>See </em>99 S.Ct. at 2103-05. Analogizing to the standards for determining the existence of a protected property interest, as articulated in Board <em>of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 576-78, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2708-09, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), the Court indicated that the existence of a protected liberty interest in parole depends on whether inmates enjoy a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d of parole release. 99 S.Ct. at 2103-05. The Court found that such an expectation was generated by Nebraska\u2019s statutory parole scheme and that \u201cthe expectancy of release provided in this statute is entitled to some measure of constitutional protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2105-06. The Court held, however, that this protection did not extend so far as to mandate formal hearings before the parole board or detailed explanations of parole rejections. <em>Id. </em>at 2106-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Our first task is to consider, in the wake of <em>Greenholtz, </em>whether Connecticut\u2019s life inmates have a protected interest in the pardons process. In <em>Boothe v. Hammock, </em>605 F.2d 661 (2d Cir. 1979), this court embraced the Supreme Court\u2019s declaration in <em>Greenholtz </em>that the establishment of a parole system does not in itself give rise to due process rights in parole procedures. Similarly, in <em>Pugliese v. Nelson, </em>617 F.2d 916, (2d Cir. 1980), we acknowledged that <em>Greenholtz </em>required us to overrule our decision in <em>Cardaropoli v. Norton, </em>523 F.2d 990 (2d Cir. 1975), which held that simply the threat of \u201cgrievous loss\u201d was sufficient to trigger due process protection. Thus, we held that no liberty interest was implicated in a classification scheme that hindered an inmate\u2019s ability to participate in social furlough, work release, and halfway house programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">An inmate\u2019s stake in the pardons process is essentially the same as his stake in parole, furlough, or work release: early release from incarceration. A state no more creates a protected interest by holding out the possibility of pardon, absolute or conditional, than it does by offering the possibility of parole or furlough. To prevail, therefore, Connecticut\u2019s life inmates must show more than a \u201cmere hope\u201d or subjective anticipation of pardon; they must, instead, show an expectation with some concrete, objective basis. <em>See Greenholtz, supra, 99 </em>S.Ct. at 2103-05; <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 576-78, 92 S.Ct. at 2708-2709. As we stated in <em>Pugliese, supra, </em>at 922, to \u201cqualify as constitutionally protected \u2018liberty\u2019, the prisoner\u2019s interest must be . one that he would normally expect to have as a matter of custom and practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">In <em>Greenholtz, </em>the Supreme Court found that a constitutionally significant expectation of parole was created by the language of the Nebraska parole statute. It provided that the parole board \u201cshall order\u201d an inmate\u2019s release when he becomes eligible for parole in the absence of specific disqualifying conditions. <em>See </em>Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 83-1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>114(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In marked contrast, Connecticut\u2019s pardons statute contains neither a presumption in favor of pardon nor a list of factors to be considered by the Board of Pardons. Instead, the statute grants the board unfettered discretion in the exercise of its power. <em>See </em>Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 18-26.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The statute offers only the \u201cmere hope\u201d of pardon; it does not create a legitimate expectation of freedom and therefore does not implicate due process. <em>See Pugliese, supra, </em>slip op. at 1608; <em>Boothe, supra, </em>605 F.2d at 664; <em>Wagner v. Gilligan, </em>609 F.2d 866 (6th Cir. 1979). <em>Compare Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) (inmates had protected liberty interest in \u201cgood-time\u201d credits where statute provided that such credits were to be forfeited only for serious misbehavior).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Statutory or constitutional language, however, is not the only ground upon which a legitimate expectation of liberty or property may rest. Such an expectation, with attendant due process rights, may also be based on regulations, policies, understandings, contractual arrangements or institutional practices. <em>See Perry </em>v. <em>Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 601-03, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2699-2700, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972); <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 577-78, 92 S.Ct. at 2709; <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 480-82, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2599-2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). As we emphasi:zed in <em>Pugliese, supra, </em>at 922:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-14\">Considerable weight is given to whether the alleged liberty interest is in the nature of a \u201cbird in the hand\u201d rather than one in the bush. A protected liberty interest is created, for example, where the inmate currently enjoys or may reasonably expect to enjoy an important and substantial benefit upon his compliance with or the occurrence of certain conditions, which may be withdrawn only for good cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-15\">Connecticut\u2019s life inmates contend that they have a legitimate expectation of pardon and release \u2014 and due process rights in pardon proceedings \u2014 by virtue of the regularity with which the Board of Pardons grants them relief. Though the statistical evidence provided below by state officials was not, as Judge Blumenfeld noted, \u201cas extensive as might be desired,\u201d 432 F.Supp. at 1314, it was sufficient to establish that pardons are granted to Connecticut\u2019s life inmates with compelling frequency. Bernard Gates, then chairman of the Board of Parole, testified that more than 75 percent of Connecticut\u2019s \u201clifers\u201d have their eligibility for parole accelerated by the Board of Pardons. Ninety percent of these inmates are then granted parole within their first year of eligibility, and all are paroled after no more than a few years\u2019 wait. In addition, the board grants immediate release to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>a number of other life inmates by commuting their sentences to time served.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">After reviewing these statistics, Judge Blumenfeld concluded that \u201cthe long-term inmate\u2019s expectation of pardon is a justifiable one rooted in state practice [and] implicates a liberty interest requiring due process protections.\u201d 432 F.Supp. at 1314. We affirmed this conclusion on appeal, holding that \u201c[t]his almost invariable practice creates ... a liberty interest in the pardons process,\u201d 593 F.2d at 166, and we reaffirm it now. The overwhelming likelihood that Connecticut life inmates will be pardoned and released before they complete their minimum terms gives them a constitutionally protected liberty interest in pardon proceedings. <em>See Perry v. Sindermann, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 602-03, 92 S.Ct. at 2700 (state university professor had protected interest in continued employment if he could show that \u201cthe policies and practices of the institution\u201d created an unwritten \u201ccommon law\u201d of tenure); <em>Phillips v. Bureau of Prisons, </em>192 U.S.App.D.C. 357, 362, 591 F.2d 966, 971 (D.C.Cir.1979) (\u201cconsistent, positive action of government officials\u201d allowing paralegals to visit prisoners gave paralegals a protected interest in such visits); <em>Stretten v. Wadsworth Veterans Hospital, </em>537 F.2d 361, 367 (9th Cir. 1976) (\u201cwe believe <em>Roth </em>recognized that rehire rates under some circumstances may evidence a \u2018common law of employment\u2019 to support the finding of a property interest\u201d); <em>Schwartz v. Thompson, </em>497 F.2d 430, 433 (2d Cir. 1974) (\u201c[n]or is there any suggestion that the vast majority of staff attorneys are promoted to supervisory positions so as to create <em>de facto </em>\u2018right\u2019 to such advancement\u201d). We find nothing in <em>Greenholtz </em>that precludes this holding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, our opinion in <em>Pugliese </em>appears to contemplate this precise result. See <em>Pugliese, supra, </em>at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">A finding that life inmates have a legitimate expectation of pardon and release pri- or to the expiration of their minimum terms does not mean, however, that they have a legitimate expectation of pardon after a year in prison, or two years, or ten. Connecticut\u2019s life inmates may apply for relief from the Board of Pardons after serving a year in prison and may apply annually thereafter. To determine how many years an inmate must serve before his application is entitled to due process protection, it is necessary to determine at what point inmates are vested with a protected interest in the pardons process, <em>i. e., </em>when the probability that they will receive pardon and release becomes constitutionally significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">Judge Blumenfeld twice explicitly declined to reach this question. In his first opinion, he saw no need to fix a precise point at which due process was implicated because the suit involved a single plaintiff, Dumschat, who had already served more than two-thirds of his minimum sentence and who, therefore, clearly had a legitimate expectation of pardon based on state practice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In his second opinion, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>court judge again found it unnecessary to reach the question because he held the mere possibility of pardon generated due process rights. This conclusion, of course, is no longer tenable in light of <em>Greenholtz, Boothe, </em>and <em>Pugliese. </em>We therefore remand to the district court to determine how many years life inmates must serve before the probability of pardon becomes so significant as to give rise to a protected liberty interest. Only after this period has elapsed are lifers entitled to due process safeguards in the pardons process.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">We turn, finally, to consider what procedural protection is due those life inmates in whom a liberty interest has vested. Specifically, we review, in light of <em>Greenholtz, </em>the district court\u2019s decision that a life inmate\u2019s due process rights require the Board of Pardons to provide a written explanation when it rejects his application for relief.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Due process is a highly flexible doctrine. To determine what process is due in a particular case, a court must consider \u201cthe need for and usefulness of the particular safeguard in the given circumstances,\u201d Friendly, <em>Some Kind of Hearing, </em>123 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1267, 1278 (1975), and its effect on governmental and private interests. <em>See, e. g., Greenholtz, supra, </em>99 S.Ct. at 2106-08; <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333\u201449, 96 S.Ct. 893, 901-909, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976); <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 560-72, 94 S.Ct. at 2976, 2982; <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 483-89, 92 S.Ct. at 2601-2604. As we held in our previous opinion in this case, the record amply supports Judge Blumenfeld\u2019s conclusion that a mandatory statement of reasons has a number of salutary consequences. The need to give reasons encourages fair and thoughtful deliberations by the board, thus protecting against arbitrary and constitutionally impermissible decisions. Moreover, it promotes consistency, an important consideration in light of the board\u2019s frequent changes in personnel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, it helps inmates to correct misunderstandings by the board or to remedy 'their own behavioral or other problems which influenced the board\u2019s denial of relief.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">The record also supports Judge Blumenfeld\u2019s finding that a reasons requirement does not unduly burden the Board of Pardons. Indeed, the requirement involves only a small number of applicants before the board.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Further, the statements provided by the board need not be lengthy or detailed \u2014 the board should be able to summarize the grounds for its decision sufficiently in a sentence or two. Board chairman Paul McQuillan himself testified below that the reasons requirement would be workable and would present no great administrative difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">Nothing in <em>Greenholtz </em>requires us to overrule Judge Blumenfeld\u2019s determination regarding the requirements of due process in this case. In fact, dicta in <em>Greenholtz </em>suggests support for Judge Blumenfeld\u2019s conclusion. The <em>Greenholtz </em>plaintiffs al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>ready were entitled to brief statements of reasons from the Nebraska parole board. They contended that due process required more detailed statements outlining the evidence relied on by the board in reaching its decision. The Supreme Court held that a brief statement of reasons was sufficient under the due process clause, further suggesting that a brief statement was not only constitutionally sufficient but also constitutionally <em>necessary:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">[W]hen parole is denied [the board] informs the inmate in what respects he falls short of qualifying for.parole; <em>this affords the process that is due under these circumstances.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">99 S.Ct. at 2108 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">We hold that Connecticut life inmates who have a protected interest in the pardon process are entitled to the procedural safer guard which the Supreme Court considered \u201cdue\u201d in <em>Greenholtz </em>\u2014 short statements of reasons explaining why they have been denied relief. We remand to the district court to determine at what point in their incarceration life inmates acquire a protected liberty interest in pardons.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\">. The board is authorized to grant pardons \u201cconditioned or absolute.\u201d Its members testified below that the board has never to their knowledge granted an inmate an absolute pardon, <em>i. </em>e., a pardon releasing him unconditionally and absolving him of guilt in the crime for which he was imprisoned. (Such slate-cleaning pardons are occasionally issued to former inmates.) The board occasionally pardons an inmate on time served. Such a commutation of sentence gives the inmate immediate, unconditional freedom but does not erase the underlying conviction. Favorable action by the board usually takes the form of a reduction in the inmate\u2019s minimum term. This type of \u201cpardon\u201d simply hastens the inmate\u2019s eligibility for parole: his release requires a favorable ruling by the Board of Parole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-16\">. The defendants appealed the original <em>Dumschat </em>decision to this court, then moved for us to vacate the district court judgment as moot and remand to Judge Blumenfeld with instructions to dismiss the complaint. We chose simply to remand without further comment or instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b351-5\">. The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3j\">Whenever the Board of Parole considers the release of a committed offender who is eligible for release on parole, it shall order his release unless it is of the opinion that his release should be deferred because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWJ\">(a) There is a substantial risk that he will not conform to the conditions of parole;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9y\">(b) His release would depreciate the seriousness of his crime or promote disrespect for law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQB\">(c) His release would have a substantially adverse effect on institutional discipline; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABF\">(d) His continued correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in the facility will substantially enhance his capacity to lead a law-abiding life when released at a later date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah9\">It was apparently the presumptive \u201cshall order . . unless\u201d construction of the Nebraska statute which led the Supreme Court to conclude that its \u201cunique structure and language\u201d gave rise to due process rights in parole proceedings. <em>Greenholtz </em>v. <em>Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 11, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 2106, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979). <em>See Boothe v. Hammock, supra, </em>605 F.2d at 664.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b351-17\">. The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-18\">(a) Jurisdiction over the granting of, and the authority to grant, commutations of punishment or releases, conditioned or absolute, in the case of any person convicted of any offense against the state and commutations from the penalty of death shall be vested in the board of pardons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-19\">(b) Said board shall have authority to grant pardons, conditioned or absolute, for any offense against the state at any time after the imposition and before or after the service of any sentence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b352-5\">. See note 1 supra. Gates also testified that \u201cno more than 10 or 15 percent\u201d of Connecticut\u2019s life inmates serve their minimum terms. This may mean that the Board of Pardons grants relief to 85 or 90 percent of the inmates; on the other hand, the figure may include those who have died in prison or who for some other reason served less than their minimum terms without the board\u2019s assistance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b352-6\">. The defendants-appellants point out that the Supreme Court in <em>Greenholtz </em>had before it figures showing that the Nebraska parole board awarded discretionary parole to nearly 60 percent of eligible inmates. If statistical probability were enough to create a protected interest in prison release, they assert the Supreme Court would have so found in <em>Greenholtz. </em>The Court\u2019s failure to do so, they submit, means that probability alone is insufficient to invoke due process. This argument must be rejected. <em>Greenholtz </em>held that Nebraska inmates had a protected interest in parole proceedings because of statutory language. The Court, therefore, did not consider whether Nebraska\u2019s historical pattern of parole might also give rise to due process rights. The Court\u2019s silence on this issue \u2014 an issue which it had no need to reach and which had not been raised by the parties\u2014 is of no significance in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b352-12\">. Judge Blumenfeld remarked in a footnote that \u201cit is not clear at exactly what point in their incarceration lifers generally receive a form of pardon.\u201d 432 F.Supp. at 1314 n.12. He then noted Bernard Gates\u2019s testimony that \u201cI can\u2019t speak of it recently, but the bulk of commutations [for life inmates] over past years appeared to come between 14 and 17 years\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>imprisonment. This was the only testimony below concerning the timing of pardons. Accordingly, we remand to Judge Blumenfeld who can obtain additional information on this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b353-9\">. In his complaint, Dumschat sought not only a statement of reasons from the board but also access to all information available to the board in its consideration of his applications. This additional relief was not granted by Judge Blumenfeld. The claim to access was dropped in the consolidated suit and class action and is no longer at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b353-10\">.
