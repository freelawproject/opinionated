The accident occurred when a shotgun being held by James Bergerud, Jr., an insured under a farm liability policy issued by Farm Bureau, discharged and injured another member of a deer hunting party. At the time of the accident, the hunting party was in the box of a pickup truck operated by Gary Jacobson, an insured under an automobile liability policy issued by Crum &amp; Forster. The injured hunter filed suit against both Bergerud and Jacobson. A settlement was negotiated, with Farm Bureau paying its policy limits of $25,000, and Crum &amp; Forster contributing $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-26\">Farm Bureau then filed suit for indemnity against Crum &amp; Forster. The facts were stipulated. The District Court,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> applying Minnesota law, concluded that the hunting accident had not arisen out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the motor vehicle insured' by Crum &amp; Forster, and judgment was entered dismissing the complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The judgment is affirmed on the basis of Judge Devitt\u2019s well-reasoned opinion. See 8th Cir. Rule 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b171-16\"> The Honorable Edward J. Devitt, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
