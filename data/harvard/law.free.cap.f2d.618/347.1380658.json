The district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Because we interpret the disclosure aspects of the regulation to be discretionary and find no basis for jurisdiction, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Taxpayers are David Einhorn, the major shareholder in the following taxpayer corporations, and Avcon International Corp. and Hemisphere Distributors, Inc. All were the subject of a criminal investigation by the Internal Revenue Service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the course of the investigation, they demanded that the Internal Revenue Service comply with 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.107(b)(2), which establishes the following procedure for pre-indictment conferences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">A taxpayer who may be the subject of a criminal recommendation will be afforded a district Criminal Investigation conference when he requests one or where the Chief, Criminal Investigation Division, makes a determination that such a conference will be in the best interests of the Government. At the conference, the IRS representative will inform the taxpayer by a general oral statement of the alleged fraudulent features of the case, to the extent consistent with protecting the Government\u2019s interests, and, at the same time, making available to the taxpayer sufficient facts and figures to acquaint him with the basis, nature, and other essential elements of the proposed criminal charges against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">At the conference, the Service\u2019s representatives only told the taxpayers\u2019 attorney the taxable years involved, the tentative civil taxes and penalties due, the charges to be recommended, and that the method of proof would be by \u201cspecific item.\u201d The Internal Revenue Service representatives refused to give requested additional information. The taxpayers sought injunctive and mandamus relief. The district court determined the regulation to be discretionary and, therefore, found that it lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">The critical issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">(a) Does 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.107(b)(2) allow discretion in disclosing requested information; and if so,</p>\n<p id=\"b480-15\">(b) Does its discretionary nature preclude district court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-16\">We hold that the regulation is discretionary as to disclosures, and that federal courts have no jurisdiction to hear claims arising thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b480-18\">Taxpayers argue that federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, exists, because the regulation is mandatory concerning disclosure; and that the refusal of the Internal Revenue Service representatives to disclose the requested information at the conference constitutes a denial of procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-19\">This argument necessarily fails, because we agree with the Sixth Circuit\u2019s interpretation in <em>Short v. Murphy, </em>512 F.2d 374 (1975) that 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.107(b)(2) is discretionary concerning the furnishing of information from tax investigations. The only mandatory aspect of the regulation is that taxpayers under criminal investigation have a right to a conference, if they so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>request. This right results from the first sentence of 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.107(b)(2) which provides: \u201c[a] taxpayer who may be the subject of a criminal recommendation will be afforded a District Intelligence conference when he requests one or where the Chief, Intelligence Division, makes a determination that such a conference will be in the best interests of the Government.\u201d The conference, however, is primarily for the convenience of the Internal Revenue Service so that it may orderly process potential criminal cases and segregate those not warranting prosecution. An inevitable byproduct of the conference that benefits taxpayers is that taxpayers can rebut false accusations. Cf. <em>Short v. Murphy </em>(although <em>Short v. Murphy </em>states that 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.107(b)(2) is for the benefit of both the Internal Revenue Service and taxpayers, its holding implies that the regulation is primarily for the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s benefit). It is clear that \u201c[t]his Rule was never meant to be an instrument for pre-trial discovery such as provided by Fed.R.Crim.P. 16, or the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500. Those rights accrue after indictment.\u201d <em>Short v. Murphy, </em>at 377. Our interpretation of 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.107(b)(2) is that the Internal Revenue Service representative, if he so chooses, need not give taxpayers any details concerning the criminal investigation, if it is felt that to do so would not be \u201cto the extent consistent with protecting the Government\u2019s interests.\u201d Further, the regulation, regarding disclosures, conveys no substantial rights to taxpayers and imposes no substantial duties upon the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s representative. This interpretation is buttressed by the fact that the Internal Revenue Service amended in 1973 the first sentence of 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.107(b)(2), which, deals with the right to a conference, but left untouched the substantive disclosure provisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Sincera writ of mandamus cannot compel a discretionary action, taxpayers\u2019 contention that the Federal Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, conveys jurisdiction is without merit. <em>Short v. </em>Murphy; <em>Roots v. Callahan, </em>475 F.2d 751 (5th Cir. 1973). Additionally, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 says \u201c[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a <em>duty owed </em>to the plaintiff.\u201d Here, there is no duty owed to the taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">Taxpayers also assert that jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1340, which provides that \u201c[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress providing for internal revenue . . .\u201d We, however, agree with the district court that this action arises from an Internal Revenue Service regulation and not an Act of Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>gress. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.107(b)(2) is a part of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Statement of Procedural Rules promulgated under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301, 552. Their purpose is to govern the internal affairs of the Internal Revenue Service. They do not have the force and effect of law. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>593 F.2d 615 (5th Cir. 1979). <em>Luhring v. Glotzbach, </em>304 F.2d 560 (4th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Lastly, taxpayers argue that the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706, gives jurisdiction in conjunction with any of the other asserted bases of jurisdiction. Taxpayers admit that the Administrative Procedure Act does not provide an independent source for jurisdiction. Their argument fails, since we find no other jurisdictional basis. Moreover, the Administrative Procedure Act only applies to a final agency decision where there is no other adequate remedy. <em>Alabama Rural Fire Ins. Co. v. Naylor, </em>530 F.2d 1221 (5th Cir. 1976). This action does not involve a final agency decision. Further, an adequate legal remedy exists in that, if taxpayers had been indicted, they could have made full use of criminal discovery procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In conclusion, we interpret the disclosure aspects of 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.107(b)(2) as discretionary and find no basis for jurisdiction. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-20\">. The Department of Justice made a final determination not to bring criminal tax charges against the taxpayers on April 16, 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-5\">. Prior to the amendment, 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.-107(b)(2) read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amy\">Every person who may be the subject of a recommendation for prosecution shall be given an opportunity to explain his participation in the alleged criminal violation prior to the submission of the case to Regional Counsel, unless compelling reasons exist to the contrary. At this interview the principal will be informed, by a general oral statement, of the alleged fraudulent features of the case, to an extent consistent with protecting the Government\u2019s interests and, at the same time, making available to the taxpayer sufficient facts and figures to acquaint him with the nature, basis and other essential elements of the proposed criminal charge against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-13\">The amendment changed the first sentence to \u201c[a] taxpayer who may be the subject of a criminal recommendation will be afforded a district Criminal Investigation conference when he requests one or where the Chief, Intelligence Division, makes a determination that such a conference will be in the best interest of the Government.\u201d Essentially, the amendment replaced \u201cshall be given\u201d with \u201cwill be afforded\u201d and made such a conference mandatory, upon taxpayer request. The amendment, however, changed in no substantive way the disclosure aspects. Thus, both before and after the amendment, the disclosure of information was and is discretionary.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
