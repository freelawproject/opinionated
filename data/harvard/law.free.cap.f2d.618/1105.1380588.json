On that date the hospital summarily revoked Dr. Waters\u2019 privileges and notified the Florida Board of Medical Examiners of the action. An appeal of the revocation action was granted before an <em>ad hoc </em>committee at the hospital which ultimately suggested that Dr. Waters\u2019 privileges be reinstated in full force. Despite that recommendation the Executive Committee of the Hospital chose to stand by the revocation. Dr. Waters appealed that decision to the board of directors of the hospital. The Board agreed to restore Dr. Waters\u2019 privileges but Dr. Waters contends that the restoration was coupled with so many conditions that no meaningful restoration of privileges occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-16\">Dr. Waters then filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 seeking injunctive and monetary relief against St. Francis Hospital and its board of directors. The defendants responded with a motion to dismiss which the court denied in April 1977 relying on Fla.Stat. \u00a7 395.065 (1975) which authorizes public and private hospitals to suspend staff privileges for good cause. The court found this statute to represent an effort by the state to influence internal hospital policy; an effort which constituted state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-18\">After the court\u2019s pre-trial order was filed in July 1977 the defendants filed another motion to dismiss. The district court granted this motion based on insufficient allegations in Dr. Waters\u2019 complaint of property interests in the staff privileges. Dr. Waters amended the complaint in October 1977. The defendants responded with a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on October 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-19\">On December 21, 1977 the district court dismissed the action based on an insufficient nexus between the State of Florida and the challenged action of defendants to satisfy the requirement of \u201cstate action.\u201d Dr. Waters filed a timely notice of appeal to this court contending that Fla.Stat. \u00a7 395.065 (1975) delegated to the hospitals authority previously reserved to the state and authorized the hospital\u2019s exercise of this authority. Appellant contends on this appeal that the action taken by the hospital must then be considered to be action taken \u201cunder color of state law.\u201d We are constrained, however, by the view of state action taken by the Supreme Court in the decision which led the district court ultimately to dismiss Dr. Waters\u2019 complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as by the Court\u2019s decision in a case announced subsequent to the dismissal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, believing as we do that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>istrict court correctly interpreted controlling case law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\">The Florida statute relied on by ap-. pellant to indicate state action in this case actually only \u201cauthorizes\u201d hospitals, public and private, to revoke staff privileges for good cause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">This is a right which private hospitals clearly had at common law; the statute delegates no authority previously exclusively held by the state. <em>See Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 354 n. 11, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974). The state has no role in the discipline of private hospital staffs in Florida beyond statutorily authorizing actions hospitals already had a legal right to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">Since the filing of the appeal in this case, the United States Supreme Court has announced its decision in <em>Flagg Brothers, Inc. v. </em>Brooks, 436 U.S. 149, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978). In that case the Court made the following statement regarding whether enactment of a statute which merely authorizes a previously legal private action constitutes \u201cstate action\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-7\">Our cases state \u201cthat a State is responsible for the . . . act of a private party when the State, by its laws, has compelled the act.\u201d <em>Adickes [v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co.], </em>398 U.S. [144], 170, 26 L.Ed.2d 142, 90 S.Ct. 1598 [(1970)]. This Court, however, has never held that a State\u2019s mere acquiescence in a private action converts that action into that of the State. The Court rejected a similar argument in <em>Jackson [v. Metropolitan Edison Co.], </em>419 U.S. [345], 357, 42 L.Ed.2d 477, 95 S.Ct. 449 [(1974)]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-15\">\u201cApproval by a state utility commission of such a request from a regulated utility, where the commission has not put its own weight on the side of the proposed practice <em>by ordering it, </em>does not transmute a practice initiated by the utility and approved by the commission into \u2018state action\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1239-16\"><em>Flagg Brothers, </em>436 U.S. at 164, 98 S.Ct. 1737-1738, 56 L.Ed.2d 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-17\">The pronouncements of the Supreme Court in <em>Flagg Brothers </em>and <em>Jackson </em>are quite clear. Unless a state statute <em>compels </em>a private party to act in a certain way, that party\u2019s action will not constitute \u201cstate action\u201d for purposes of invoking the subject matter jurisdiction of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Unfortunately for Dr. Waters, Fla.Stat. \u00a7 395.065 does not <em>compel </em>the staff discipline taken in this case and consequently does not amount to \u201cstate action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1238-13\">. <em>Jackson v.
