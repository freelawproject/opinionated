Comprising six counts of his conviction were violations of 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) (1976),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which proscribes possession of firearms by a convicted felon. Notwithstanding the incontrovertibility of his prior felony conviction, Arrington claims that at the time of his arrest he no longer bore the onus of that conviction and consequently should not have been charged. He reasons that his prior conviction was automatically expunged upon completion of the sentence given him under the Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5005-5026 (1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find that Arrington\u2019s rationale comports with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>the policy and purposes of the Youth Corrections Act, and therefore reverse his conviction of those six counts framed under 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">Arrington also challenges on several grounds the remaining two counts, which involved unlawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), (i) (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, Arrington challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to mandate disclosure of the identity and whereabouts of the government informant whose confidential tip established probable cause for an incriminating search of Arrington\u2019s house. Second, he suggests that charging both possession of an unregistered firearm and also possession of a firearm without a serial number was multiplicitous, since a firearm without a serial number cannot be registered. Third, Arrington claims that punishing him for possessing a firearm without a serial number was contrary to statutory purpose, when obtaining a serial number was impossible. Finally, Arrington claims that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the utility bills found in the search of Arrington\u2019s house, which were later offered to prove Arrington\u2019s residence in the house at the time of the search. Finding no reversible error in any of these claims, we affirm Arrington\u2019s conviction on the two counts under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), (i) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">On April 19, 1971, Arrington pled guilty to a federal charge of failing to pay a transfer tax on marijuana, in violation of Law of August 16, 1954, ch. 736, 68A Stat. 562 (repealed 1970); Law of July 18, 1956, ch. 629, Title I, \u00a7 101, 70 Stat. 567 (repealed 1970).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Government\u2019s Exhibit 9. He received an indeterminate sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) (1976), served some prison time at Seagoville, Texas, and gained parole early in 1975. Record, vol. Ill at 127. Arrington completed his sentence in April, 1977, without any interruption of his status as a youthful offender. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-15\">On December 19, 1978, police procured a warrant to search Arrington\u2019s house in San Antonio, Texas, based on an informant\u2019s confidential tip that he had seen Arrington there with amphetamines on the previous day. The officers executed the warrant on December 20,1978, arresting Arrington and seizing six registered rifles and pistols and an unregistered sawed-off shotgun bearing no serial number. Arrington subsequently admitted ownership of the registered firearms but denied any knowledge of the shotgun, which had been discovered in a bedroom of the house. Besides the firearms, the officers also collected several water and utility bills addressed to Arrington at that residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-16\">\n<em>Federal Youth Corrections Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-17\">Arrington now appeals his conviction of the six counts framed under 18 U.S.C. Appi \u00a7 1202(a)(1) (1976). He con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>tends that merely completing the sentence given him under the Federal Youth Corrections Act lifted all the disabilities of felony conviction, including the bar to firearm possession. The government disputes his contention, claiming that without an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021(a) certificate setting aside his conviction, Arrington still labored under those disabilities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the dispute centers around what event lifts the disadvantages of a criminal record from a youthful offender who has completed the maximum sentence of the Youth Corrections Act section under which he was sentenced. Pertinent here as a practical facet of that issue is what evidentiary burden the government must shoulder to prove that a youthful offender is subject to a convicted felon\u2019s disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-4\">Clearly, a prior unexpunged felony conviction is an integral element of the crime of which Arrington stands convicted. 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) (1976). <em>See United States v. Barfield, </em>527 F.2d 858, 861 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Marzett, </em>526 F.2d 277, 278. (5th Cir. 1976). Accordingly, the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the fact of Arrington\u2019s prior conviction. <em>See In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1072, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">Citing <em>Lewis v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 915, 63 L.Ed.2d 198 (1980), government counsel contends on appeal that producing a certified copy of the judgment against Arrington carried the government\u2019s burden of proving him a convicted felon. Arrington\u2019s affirmative responsibility, counsel asserts, is to rebut that evidence with concrete proof of his sentence, treatment, and unconditional discharge under the Youth Corrections Act. Government counsel further contends that a youthful offender asserting his unconditional discharge and his conviction\u2019s expunction must show proof by a certificate issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021(a) (1976). Conversely, Arrington argues that his unconditional discharge and his conviction\u2019s expunction were automatic upon completion of the maximum sentence of the section under which he was sentenced, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-12\">Because of the Youth Corrections Act\u2019s unique import, the government\u2019s citations are inapposite and its position erroneous. In the present case, as with other youth offender convictions, the very judgment and commitment order presented by the government to establish Arrington\u2019s initial conviction also revealed that he was sentenced under section 5010(b) of the Youth Corrections Act. Government\u2019s Exhibit 9. The only resolution of a section 5010(b) sentence provided by the Act is unconditional discharge pursuant to section 5017(c). Under that section, unconditional discharge may come early to deserving young offenders, but in any case is mandatory after six years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017(c) (1976).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-13\">Having a broad range of sentencing options available, the trial court in Arrington\u2019s case would have taken into account the mandatory discharge provision before choosing the appropriate sentence. As a matter of discretion, the judge could have sentenced Arrington to probation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a) (1976). Alternatively, he could have sentenced him under section 5010(c) to treatment for longer than six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>years, up to the <em>maximum </em>adult offender sentence for the offense charged. Finally, the trial court could have chosen not to sentence Arrington under the Youth Corrections Act, but rather as an adult offender. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(d) (1976).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial judge considered all these options and chose to sentence under section 5010(b), which has a maximum sentence of six years. Accordingly, the government cannot second-guess the trial court now, trying to lengthen Arrington\u2019s sentence because no section 5021(a) certificate had issued. Expunction of Arrington\u2019s conviction was clearly automatic upon his unconditional discharge at the end of six years. <em>See Minshew v. United States, </em>410 F.2d 396, 397 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">Having indisputably completed the maximum term of a section 5010(b) sentence, Arrington had reached unconditional discharge before he was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) (1976). The statutory language of the Youth Corrections Act, automatically setting aside his conviction, mandates reversal of the six counts of his conviction under 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) (1976). <em>Accord, United States v. Purgason, </em>565 F.2d 1279, 1280 (4th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Fryer, </em>545 F.2d 11 (6th Cir. 1976). <em>See also United States v. Vice, </em>562 F.2d 1004 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 951, 98 S.Ct. 1578, 55 L.Ed.2d 801 (1978) (citing <em>Fryer </em>with implicit approval).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">Not only does the clear statutory language command this result, but so also does the policy underlying the Youth Corrections Act. Government counsel correctly cites the general rule that only by permission in accord with statutory scheme can any person who has been convicted of a felony possess a firearm. 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1203 (1976); <em>Lewis v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 915, 63 L.Ed.2d 198 (1980). The Youth Corrections Act, however, actually operates to remove certain youthful offenders from the realm of those persons who have been convicted of a felony. The Act\u2019s import is to remove the taint of youthful indiscretions, giving a youthful offender a second chance to live free of the lifelong ignominy of a criminal record. <em>Dorszynski v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 424, 432-35, 94 S.Ct. 3042, 3047-3048, 41 L.Ed.2d 855 (1974); <em>United States v. Doe, </em>556 F.2d 391, 392 (6th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. McMains, </em>540 F.2d 387, 388 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>Mestre Morera v. United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>462 F.2d 1030, 1032 (1st Cir. 1972); H.R.Rep. No. 2979, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. (1950). If a youthful offender has been unconditionally discharged, the disabilities of a criminal conviction are completely and automatically removed; indeed, the conviction is set aside as if it had never been.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021 (1976); <em>Dorsyznski v. United States, </em>418 U.S. at 434-35, 94 S.Ct. at 3048; <em>Minshew v. United States, </em>410 F.2d at 397. <em>See also United States v. Vice, </em>562 F.2d at 1005; <em>Tatum v. United States, </em>310 F.2d 854, 856 (D.C.Cir.1962). Issuing the section 5021(a) certificate to a youthful offender who has completed his sentence is a ministerial act which merely certifies what has already been accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-12\">Therefore, to require Arrington to rebut evidence of his conviction by producing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>certificate whose issuance is pro forma and controlled by the federal government, his accuser, would elevate form over substance to an unconstitutional degree. Indeed, placing on Arrington the burden of proving his conviction\u2019s expunction would be analogous to placing upon a person never before convicted the burden of proving his clear record. To allocate the evidentiary burden in such a way obviously would be wrong, since the task of proving the previous conviction element of 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) (1976) is always the government\u2019s. Because the government failed in this case to prove that element, we reverse Arrington\u2019s conviction of the six counts of unlawful firearm possession in violation of 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-4\">\n<em>The Confidential Informant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">Arrington next maintains that reversible error occurred when the trial court refused to' order disclosure of the identity and whereabouts of the confidential informant whose tip authorized the search of Arrington\u2019s house. Disclosure, Arrington contends, would have facilitated his attack on the probable cause police offered to obtain the search warrant. According to the affidavit supporting the warrant, the informant claimed to have seen Arrington with methamphetamines at Arrington\u2019s house on-December 18, 1978. Prior to trial, Arrington requested disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity, and filed a motion to suppress evidence for lack of probable cause to issue the search warrant. With his motion he filed affidavits flatly contradicting the informant\u2019s affidavit. Before trial, the court held a motion hearing, allowing both sides to bolster the affidavits with testimony. Police officers testified at the motion hearing that they had driven by Arrington\u2019s house on the day of the tip and had seen him there. Arrington\u2019s witnesses, however, swore that he had been out of town with them on the day he supposedly was seen at home. After the hearing, the court questioned <em>in camera </em>the officer to whom the informant had reported. The trial court then denied the motion to suppress and refused to order disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity or whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">Clearly, even proof that the informant\u2019s information was false would not have vitiated probable cause for the warrant. According to <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), a successful attack by Arrington on the asserted probable cause would have had to show that the affiant police officers repeated the informant\u2019s tip with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard for the truth. Nothing in the record casts any doubt on the veracity or reliability of the attesting officers. Arrington nonetheless claims that contradicting the informant\u2019s statements drew the informant\u2019s credibility into issue. By generous inference, we can consider his claim an attack on the reliability of the officers who used the informant\u2019s tip to obtain a warrant. Accordingly, we consider whether Arrington should have had greater opportunity to question the informant to establish lack of probable cause to issue the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-7\">The seminal case governing disclosure of informant\u2019s identities, <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957), requires disclosure if the informant\u2019s identity would be \u201crelevant and helpful to the defense of an accused . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 77 S.Ct. at 628. In balancing the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the defendant\u2019s interest in preparing his defense, the trial court must consider \u201cthe crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informer\u2019s testimony, and other relevant factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 77 S.Ct. at 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-9\">This court developed the balancing analysis even further in <em>Suarez v. United States, </em>582 F.2d 1007 (5th Cir. 1976). That case mandates disclosure if the informant\u2019s role was crucial to the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct, excuses disclosure if the informant\u2019s role was merely that of a tipster, and, finally, leaves to the trial court in all the intermediate cases the task of balancing public interests against the defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-10\">Nothing in the record suggests that the informant in the present case played even a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>peripheral role in Arrington\u2019s criminal conduct. He reported having seen a narcotics violation; Arrington was convicted of illegal firearm possession. The informant\u2019s remarks merely led to a search which uncovered apparently unexpected illicit bounty. As a mere tipster, he could have offered little information \u201crelevant and helpful\u201d to Arrington. Accordingly, the trial court properly refused to order disclosure of his identity and location. <em>Compare United States v. Gonzales, </em>606 F.2d 70 (5th Cir. 1979) <em>and United States v. Alonzo, </em>571 F.2d 1384 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 847, 99 S.Ct. 147, 58 L.Ed.2d 149 (1978) <em>and United States v. Mendoza, </em>433 F.2d 891 (5th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 943, 91 S.Ct. 953, 28 L.Ed.2d 225 (1971) <em>with United States v. Silva, </em>580 F.2d 144 (5th Cir. 1978) <em>and Gilmore v. United States, </em>256 F.2d 565 (5th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">Even should the informant\u2019s role be deemed more integral to Arrington\u2019s crimes, however, the district court need not have ordered disclosure. None of the factors listed in <em>Roviaro </em>called for disclosure. <em>See Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. at 62, 77 S.Ct. at 628. The informant\u2019s tip did not relate to the crime charged. Moreover, Arrington does not even relate what defenses he would have pursued given opportunity to question the informant. Accordingly, he certainly cannot reveal how the informant\u2019s testimony would have aided him in presenting those defenses. Such ethereal interests count little when balanced against the governmental interest in protecting its informant\u2019s welfare. They cannot command reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">\n<em>Multiplicitous Charge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">Appellant Arrington next challenges his convictions under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), (i). He suggests that charging both possession of an unregistered firearm and also possession of a firearm without a serial number was multiplicitous, since a firearm without a serial number cannot be registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-7\">Arrington\u2019s assertion is erroneous. Each subsection required proof of facts that the other did not, and therefore constituted an offense different from the other. <em>See Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). Moreover, this court has on several occasions approved concurrent sentences for separate convictions under these two provisions. <em>Rollins v. United States, </em>543 F.2d 574 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Gamboa, </em>543 F.2d 545 (5th Cir. 1976). <em>See also United States v. McDaniel, </em>550 F.2d 214, 219 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-9\">\n<em>Statutory Purpose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-10\">Arrington next claims that punishing him for possessing a firearm without a serial number was contrary to statutory purpose, when obtaining a serial number was impossible due to the nature of the firearm. His counsel therefore maintains that a \u201clegal impossibility\u201d prevented Arrington\u2019s compliance with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(i) (1976). The assertion is patently erroneous. One of the statutory purposes behind requiring identification of firearms by serial number is to prevent possession of firearms such as the sawed-off shotgun found in Arrington\u2019s house. <em>See United States v. Ranney, </em>524 F.2d 830, 832 (7th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 922, 96 S.Ct. 1130, 47 L.Ed.2d 330 (1976); <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>475 F.2d 806, 810 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 846, 94 S.Ct. 111, 38 L.Ed.2d 93 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-11\">\n<em>Admissibility of Utility Bills</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-12\">Finally, Arrington complains that utility bills garnered in the search of his home were inadmissible to prove his residence at the house searched. In claiming that the bills were hearsay, he errs. The bills were not proffered to prove the truth of their contents and accordingly were admissible. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>606 F.2d 70, 77 (5th Cir. 1979); Fed.R.Evid. 801(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-13\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-14\">Arrington was not a convicted felon at the time of his arrest for possessing firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>\u00a7 1202(a)(1) (1976). Accordingly, his convictions on counts one through six are REVERSED. The remaining assertions of error having no merit, his convictions on counts seven and eight under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), (i) are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1253-11\">. 18 U.S.C.

Significantly, Arrington launches no collateral attack on the validity of his prior conviction. The recent case of <em>Lewis v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 915, 63 L.Ed.2d 198 (1980), would likely bar such a collateral attack. Nonetheless notable is the questionable constitutional validity of the marijuana transfer tax statute after <em>Leary v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969), and up until the effective date of the repealer. This court noted in <em>Frey v. United States, </em>558 F.2d 270, 273 n. 5 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. <em>denied, </em>435 U.S. 923, 98 S.Ct. 1487, 55 L.Ed.2d 517 (1978), that <em>\u201cLeary </em>did not hold the Marijuana Tax Act unconstitutional. Rather, it held that a timely and proper assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination should have provided <em>Leary </em>a complete defense to prosecution under the statute making it unlawful to acquire, transport or conceal untaxed marijuana, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4744 . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">. The government urges that the concurrent sentence doctrine would excuse our consideration of the conviction expunction claim if the other counts of Arrington\u2019s conviction are affirmed, since ten-year and eight-year sentences were imposed to run concurrently with the shorter two-year sentences given for each of the other six counts. We disagree. Setting aside six different felony counts presumably would greatly affect Arrington\u2019s opportunity to gain earlier parole. See <em>United States v. Rubin, </em>591 F.2d 278, 281 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 133, 62 L.Ed.2d 87 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1255-14\">. Of course, the period before unconditional discharge must be spent in the Attorney General\u2019s custody. Courts have logically inferred that escape tolls the running of the maximum term under the applicable section. <em>See, e. g., Suggs v. Daggett, </em>522 F.2d 396, 397 (10th Cir. 1975); <em>Hartwell v. Jackson, </em>403 F.Supp. 1229, 1230 (D.D.C.1975), <em>aff'd, </em>546 F.2d 1042 (D.C. Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">. A judge who sentences a youthful offender under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(d) (1976) must make an explicit finding that the offender would not benefit from treatment under section 5010(b) or section 5010(c). Although in some instances the adult sentence is actually shorter than the maximum terms of Youth Corrections Act sentencing options, it does not carry with it the advantage of conviction expunction. That advantage of Youth Corrections Act permits a longer sentence for rehabilitative treatment without violation of due process precepts. <em>Guidry v. United States, </em>433 F.2d 968 (5th Cir. 1970); <em>Abernathy v. United States, </em>418 F.2d 288 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1256-13\">. We do not need to decide now if 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021(a) (1976) also serves to expunge even the record of Arrington\u2019s previous conviction. For the purposes of this appeal, defining ex-punction to include at least setting aside his conviction is a satisfactory resolution. <em>See generally United States v. Purgason, </em>565 F.2d 1279, 1280 (4th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Doe, </em>556 F.2d 391, 393 (6th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. McMains, </em>540 F.2d 387 (8th Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
