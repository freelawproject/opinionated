The Deregulation Act was designed \u201cto encourage, develop, and attain an air transportation system which relies on competitive market forces to determine the quality, variety, and price of air services . . ..\u201d P.L. 95-504, 92 Stat. 1705, 1705 (1978). Effective October 24, 1978, the Deregulation Act substantially altered the Board\u2019s role in regulating such matters as airline fares and routes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">In December 1978, relying on provisions of the Deregulation Act, Eastern Air Lines and the Allegheny Airlines gave notices that 90 days hence they would terminate their service at New Haven, Connecticut. The City of New Haven sought unsuccessfully to have the Board order Eastern and Allegheny to continue providing such service. The Board determined (Order No. 79-3-98, dated March 15, 1979 (hereinafter \u201cMarch order\u201d)) that as a result of the Deregulation Act, prior restraints on unilateral termination of service by an airline had been substantially removed and that an airline could terminate service at a community merely by giving 90 days\u2019 notice of its intent to do so, provided that it did not thereby deprive that community of \u201cessential air transportation.\u201d The Board found, pursuant to \u00a7 419(a)(10) of the Deregulation Act, that in light of other air service currently offered at New Haven, the proposed suspensions did not \u201creasonably appear[] to deprive\u201d New Haven of \u201cessential air transportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-12\">New Haven has petitioned this Court to review the CAB order refusing to prohibit Eastern and Allegheny from terminating service to New Haven. It challenges the substantive determinations of the March order and the procedures used by the Board. Finding none of New Haven\u2019s arguments persuasive, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-13\">I. <em>Background of the Deregulation Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-14\">From 1938, when the first comprehensive statute governing regulation of civil aviation was passed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> until 1978, the domestic air transportation industry was subject to stringent control by the CAB. The principal airlines \u2014 i. e., major airlines, or \u201ctrunk\u201d carriers, such as United Air Lines, American Airlines, and Eastern, and regional airlines, or \u201clocal service\u201d carriers, such as Allegheny, Ozark Air Lines and Hughes Airwest \u2014 operated pursuant to certificates of \u201cpublic convenience and necessity.\u201d The Board could permit a certificated carrier to enter a new market only if the carrier showed that the service it proposed was \u201crequired\u201d by the public convenience and necessity. Market exit was similarly restricted. Under \u00a7 401(g), a carrier\u2019s certificate could be amended to permit the carrier to terminate service at a given point upon a showing that the amendment was required by the public convenience and necessity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>Alternatively, \u00a7 401(j) provided that a carrier could \u201cabandon\u201d a route or part thereof upon showing that the abandonment was required by the public interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, in the markets they were serving, the carriers were required by \u00a7 404(a)(1) to provide \u201csafe and adequate service.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A63\">The Deregulation Act was designed to phase out government regulation of the industry, while protecting, by federal subsidy if necessary, smaller communities from such withdrawals of services as would result in their loss of \u201cessential air transportation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 419(a) of the Deregulation Act required the CAB to determine by October 24, 1979, what constituted \u201cessential air transportation\u201d for each community served by no more than one certificated air carrier;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>Deregulation Act established as the minimum that could be determined by the Board, two daily round-trips five days per week, or the carrier schedules for 1977, whichever was less.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">The Deregulation Act substantially reduced barriers to entry of airlines into new markets, by, <em>inter alia, </em>allowing automatic entry in some circumstances, and replacing the former standard that the public interest \u201crequire\u201d a service, with a more liberal policy under which the CAB must allow entry if it is not shown to be inconsistent with the public convenience and necessity. <em>\"See, e. g., </em>\u00a7 401(d)(1)(A), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1371(dXl)(A) (Cum.Supp.1979). With respect to exit from a given market, \u00a7 401(j), dealing with abandonment of routes by the carrier, was replaced by a new provision which forbids a carrier to terminate all service to a point unless it has provided 90 days\u2019 notice to the Board and to the concerned state and .local authorities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 401(g), which permits certificate amendments upon a showing of public convenience and necessity, was not substantively changed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>II. <em>The Present Controversy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">Eastern Air Lines was certificated to provide air service to New Haven in 1946. Eastern formerly offered service between New Haven and Boston, Baltimore, Atlanta, and Jacksonville and Pensacola, Florida. In 1974, however, the Board granted Eastern authority to suspend service for a five-year period ending March 22, 1979. On December 21, 1978, Eastern filed notice with the Board \u201cpursuant to \u00a7 401(j)(l)\u201d of the Act that it intended \u201cto suspend all service at New Haven\u201d on March 22, 1979.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The proposed 1979 suspension would not have caused a reduction in actual service; rather, it would have relieved Eastern of the obligation to resume service at New Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">Allegheny Airlines was certificated to serve New Haven in 1959. At one time Allegheny offered service from New Haven to Boston and Washington. By 1978, however, Allegheny was providing service only between New Haven and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, via New York, to the extent of two round-trip flights on weekdays and one round-trip flight a day on weekends, using 25-seat aircraft. On December 29, 1978, Allegheny filed a notice \u201cunder Sections 401(j)(l), 401(j)(2) and 419(a)(3)\u201d of the Act that it intended to suspend all service at New Haven as of March 29, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">When they filed their notices of intent to suspend service, Eastern and Allegheny were the only carriers certificated by the Board to provide air service at New Haven. Several non-certificated commuter airlines were also providing such service, however. Pilgrim Aviation and Airlines, Inc., (\u201cPilgrim\u201d), using 19-seat aircraft, offered ten or more nonstop flights per weekday in each direction between New Haven and New York and six or more nonstop flights per day in each direction on weekends. Pilgrim also provided four round-trips each weekday and one round-trip per day on weekends between New Haven and Boston, and offered additional service between New Haven and New London, Connecticut. In addition, Business Aircraft Corporation and New Haven Airways, using six- and eight-seat aircraft, offered weekday flights to Albany, White Plains, and Islip, New York, Hartford and Bridgeport, Connecticut, Philadelphia and Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-12\">On March 8, 1979 the Board announced that it would consider the notices of suspension filed by Eastern and Allegheny at a public meeting on March 15. On March 12 the City of New Haven, the New Haven Board of Airport Commissioners and the New Haven Economic Development Commission petitioned the Board to prohibit the proposed suspensions of service. The New Haven parties contended first, that \u00a7\u00a7 401(g) and 404(a) of the Act prohibit carriers from suspending service merely on notice, and that prior Board approval upon a showing of \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d is required; and second, they contended that \u00a7 419(a)(10) of the Act required the Board to block the instant suspensions because they would deprive New Haven of \u201cessential air transportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-13\">The Board received the submissions of the New Haven parties but did not hold a hearing. In its March order, the Board rejected both of New Haven\u2019s positions. On the question of suspension of service on notice, the Board stated that it was \u201cnot persuaded\u201d by New Haven\u2019s argument, but deferred \u201cdetailed\u201d consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>question until its decision in another pending case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Board simply asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-4\">For now it is sufficient to observe that the New Haven Parties (1) ignore the central change in section 401(j) of the new Act \u2014 the elimination of the requirement of prior Board approval before a carrier may \u201cabandon any route, or part thereof\u201d; and (2) ignore the legislative history of the Senate version of the new termination/suspension provision (the primary predecessor of the final bill), which clearly indicates that the Senate intended to give carriers the flexibility to withdraw from points without our permission if they provide the necessary notice and their withdrawal does not affect \u201cessential air transportation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-5\">Moreover, our interpretation of the Act \u2014 that notice and the essential air transportation obligations are the only prerequisites to suspending at a point \u2014 is more clearly in harmony with the Congressional policy favoring maximum reliance on market forces and on actual and potential competition to provide needed transportation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">On New Haven\u2019s second point, the Board concluded that it was not required to block the suspensions of service at New Haven under \u00a7 419(a)(10), because it found that these suspensions would not deprive New Haven of \u201cessential air transportation.\u201d In making this determination, the Board relied principally on the service being provided by Pilgrim, finding that Pilgrim was \u201cfit, willing and able to provide essential air transportation\u201d and that Pilgrim met the safety requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration. The Board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-8\">We believe the level of air service being provided at New Haven by Pilgrim reasonably appears to meet the essential air transportation requirements of New Haven. This, as supplemented by the service of Business Aircraft and New Haven Airways, affords New Haven passengers access to points throughout the nation. In addition, we note that the level of service provided by Pilgrim is substantially above the legal minimum for essential air transportation defined in section 419(f)(1) of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-9\">Thus, the Board entered the March order declining to block the proposed suspensions of service, and Eastern and Allegheny suspended service as planned in March, 1979. Currently, the only service in and out of New Haven is that provided by the commuter airlines. Following the March suspensions, New Haven filed this petition for review, which was argued on October 3, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-10\">On October 24, 1979, the Board issued Order No. 79-10-134, in which it made its determination, pursuant to \u00a7 419(a)(2)(A) of the Act, of what constitutes \u201cessential air transportation\u201d for New Haven. The level set by the Board as \u201cessential\u201d is significantly below the level of service currently provided to New Haven by the commuter airlines serving it. The correctness of the October determination is not involved in this petition, although the Board contends that the fact of that determination moots New Haven\u2019s petition for review of the March order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-11\">III. <em>Method of Terminating Service</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKR\">New Haven\u2019s first substantive contention<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is that the Act prohibits a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>carrier from suspending service to a certificated point unless it has obtained Board approval upon a showing that \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d required the suspension. It argues that the airlines could not suspend service merely by giving notice under \u00a7 401(j)(l), but were required to seek a certificate amendment under \u00a7 401(g), deleting their authority to serve New Haven.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The question is whether the 1978 amendments \u2014 and specifically, the amendment to \u00a7 401(j) \u2014 altered the substantive requirements of the Act with respect to service suspensions. The Board concluded that the 1978 amendments did effect such a change, and for the reasons that follow, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Prior to the 1978 amendments, a carrier could be relieved of its obligation to serve a certificated point in one of three ways. First, \u00a7 401(g)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> authorized the Board, either on the filing of a petition'or on its own initiative, to suspend or terminate a carrier\u2019s authority at a point by amending its certificate, if the Board found the amendment to be required by \u201cthe public convenience and necessity.\u201d Second, \u00a7 401(j)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> permitted a carrier to abandon a route for which it was certificated if, upon the carrier\u2019s application, the Board found the abandonment to be \u201cin the public interest.\u201d Finally, the last sentence of \u00a7 401(j) permitted the Board, \u201cby regulations or otherwise, [to] authorize such temporary suspension of service as may be in the public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\">Thus, before the 1978 amendments, a carrier could permanently halt service to a certificated point only upon prior Board approval. And as to any certificated point, \u00a7 404(a)(1) required a carrier \u201cto provide . safe and adequate service.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-10\">The 1978 amendments did not alter \u00a7 404(a)(1), nor did they materially change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>\u00a7 401(g).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The termination provision of old \u00a7 401(j), however, was replaced in its entirety. The new \u00a7 401(j)(l)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> provides that a certificated carrier shall not terminate or suspend all service to a point \u201cunless such air carrier has first given the Board [and the concerned local authorities] at least 90 days notice of its intent to so terminate [or] suspend\u201d service. The final sentence of \u00a7 401(j)(l), like the final sentence of the old \u00a7 401(j), provides that the Board may authorize temporary suspensions of service by regulation or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">In the Board\u2019s view, the enactment of new \u00a7 401(j)(l) provided a new means by which a carrier may be permanently relieved of service obligations: the carrier may suspend service simply by giving 90 days' notice of its intent to do so. New Haven points out that the language of new \u00a7 401(j)(l), read literally, does not directly authorize suspensions on notice, but rather bars a carrier from suspending service <em>unless </em>it has given notice. It argues that the amendment to \u00a7 401(j) merely imposed an additional notice requirement on carriers seeking permission to suspend service in \u00a7 401(g) proceedings. New Haven\u2019s construction of \u00a7 401(j)(l), however, cannot be reconciled with other provisions added by the 1978 amendments, and it is inconsistent with the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">The clearest indication in the statute that Congress intended the amended \u00a7 401(j)(l) to authorize suspensions on notice is found in \u00a7\u00a7 419(a)(6) and (a)(7), which were also added to the Act by the 1978 amendments. Section 419(a)(6) provides that \u201c[notwithstanding section 401(j),\u201dif a carrier serves notice of its intent to reduce service to a point below the \u201cessential air transportation\u201d level, and if the Board does not find a replacement carrier within the notice period, the Board shall \u201crequire\u201d the original carrier to continue service for additional 30-day periods. Section 419(a)(7) provides that where the Board requires a carrier to continue service \u201cbeyond the date on which such air carrier would, but for paragraph (6) of this subsection, be able to suspend . service to such point,\u201d the Board must compensate the carrier for any resulting losses. These provisions clearly contemplate that 90 days after a carrier serves notice under \u00a7 401(j)(l), the suspension will go into effect unless the Board prevents it; and the touchstone as to whether or not the Board should prevent it is the \u201cessential air transportation\u201d level, not the \u201cpublic convenience and necessity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-10\">New Haven nonetheless contends that a construction of \u00a7 401(j)(l) to permit suspension on notice is inconsistent with \u00a7 401(g), taken alone or in conjunction with \u00a7 404(a)(1). It argues that Congress evidenced its intention that \u00a7 401(g) retain its vitality by amending the section merely to include reference to simplified procedures and leaving it otherwise unchanged. New Haven contends that the Board\u2019s construction of \u00a7 401(j)(l) renders \u00a7 401(g) meaningless. This is hardly so, however, since \u00a7 401(g) remains the only means by which a carrier can be eliminated from a market at the instigation of the Board or third parties.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-11\">As to \u00a7 404(a)(1), which requires that a carrier provide safe and adequate service at any place for which it is certificated,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>Haven points out that Congress provided that \u00a7 404(a)(1) would cease to be effective on December 31, 1981, and argues that the section continues in full force and effect until that date.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, the argument goes, Eastern and Allegheny must provide service to New Haven as long as they are certificated for New Haven, and their certificates can be amended only pursuant to \u00a7 401(g). While this argument may have some technical appeal, we do not believe it is persuasive or that our rejection of it eviscerates \u00a7 404(a)(1). The Board\u2019s construction of \u00a7 401(j)(l) does not give a carrier complete freedom to evade its \u00a7 404(a)(1) obligation to provide service; the carrier must still wait at least 90 days until its notice of suspension becomes effective, and there are circumstances in which suspension could be delayed indefinitely (see Part IV A, infra). In any event, we believe . New Haven\u2019s \u00a7 404(a)(1) argument must yield to the clear indications in \u00a7\u00a7 419(a)(6) and (7), described above, that Congress intended \u00a7 401(j)(l) to allow termination of service on notice.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">Our conclusion is reenforced by a reading of the legislative history. The new \u00a7 401(j)(l) was put into its final form by the Conference Committee. The section as enacted, however, is in large part the same as \u00a7 401(h)(1) passed by the Senate in S.2493, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978). <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No.1779, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 61, 67 (1978) (Conference Report).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Section 401(h)(1) of the Senate bill, like \u00a7 401(j)(l) as enacted, was framed in negative terms as prohibiting suspensions unless the carrier has given notice, rather than as an explicit affirmative authorization of suspensions on notice. The sponsor of S. 2493, Senator Cannon, clearly expected his bill to permit suspension of service on notice, absent Board action to block the suspension:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-15\">Under sections 401 and 419, exit is permitted after notice of 90 days, unless the carrier is the last one serving the community in which case extensions are required if no replacement carrier has been found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1097-16\">124 Cong.Rec. S5850 (daily ed. Apr. 19, 1978) (remarks of Sen. Cannon). The Senate Report reflects the same understanding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao8n\">While carriers certificated under this section [401] will be permitted to exit communities under the notice requirements provided[,] if the carrier\u2019s termination will result in the communities\u2019 \u201cessential\u201d air transportation needs being unmet, the Board will require the carrier to continue service until a replacement carrier is found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1098-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>S.Rep.No.631, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 61 (1978). These explanations persuasively support the Board\u2019s construction of \u00a7 401(j)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">New Haven relies on a comment by Representative Anderson, to the effect that the House version of the 1978 amendments, H.R. 12611, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978), would not affect the Act\u2019s requirement that a carrier obtain prior Board approval before terminating all service to a point. 124 Cong.Rec. H10320 (daily ed. Sept. 21,1978). The pertinence of Representative Anderson\u2019s comment, however, is diminished by the fact that H.R. 12611 did not provide any modification of the old \u00a7 401(j). <em>See </em>H.R. Rep.No.1211, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 49 (1978) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 3737. The Conference Committee followed the Senate bill on this point, replacing the old \u00a7 401(j) with a version which resembled \u00a7 401(h)(1) of the Senate bill. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No.1779, <em>supra </em>at 61, 67. Thus Representative Anderson\u2019s comments were not directed to the provision finally enacted, and do not affect our reading of the new \u00a7 4010X1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">Finally, we note that the Board\u2019s construction of \u00a7 401(j)(l) is more closely attuned to the Congressional concern, in passing the 1978 amendments, with promoting free competition in the airline industry, <em>see </em>S.Rep.No.631, <em>supra </em>at 5-6; H.R.Rep.No. 1211, <em>supra </em>at 3-4, and with \u201c[t]he placement of maximum reliance on competitive market forces and on actual and potential competition ... to provide the needed air transportation system.\u201d \u00a7 102(a)(4), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1302(a)(4) (Cum.Supp.1979). The effectiveness of freer entry, as a means of fostering competition, would be substantially undercut by a construction of \u00a7 401(j)(l) which did not allow correspondingly free exit from markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">Thus, we agree with the Board that the new \u00a7 401(j)(l) conditionally permits a carrier to suspend service to a point upon giving 90 days\u2019 notice of its intent to do so. Allegheny and Eastern were entitled to suspend service at New Haven, unless the suspensions \u201creasonably appear[ed] to deprive\u201d New Haven of \u201cessential air transportation.\u201d \u00a7 419(a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-12\">IV. <em>The March Determination as to Essential Air Transportation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-13\">New Haven\u2019s second substantive claim is that the Board should have blocked these suspensions in March 1979 under \u00a7 419(a)(10) because they deprived New Haven of \u201cessential air transportation.\u201d The Board contends that the March order is now moot and was, in any event, correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-14\">A. <em>Mootness of the March Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"AY5D\">The Board argues that its \u201cinterim\u201d determination of \u201cessential air transportation\u201d under 419(a)(10) has been superseded by the \u201cfinal\u201d determination of \u201cessential air transportation\u201d under \u00a7 419(a)(2)(A), and that as a result, nothing turns on the correctness of the former order. We disagree. Since the Board\u2019s \u00a7 419(a)(2)(A) determination of \u201cessential air transportation\u201d for New Haven was made <em>after </em>the Eastern and Allegheny suspensions, we conclude that a successful challenge to the \u00a7 419(a)(10) determination (in the event that New Haven also prevails on its challenge to the \u00a7 419(a)(2)(A) determination) could result in a practical benefit to New Haven \u2014 arising from the operation of other provisions of \u00a7 419(a) \u2014 that would not be available from a successful challenge to the \u00a7 419(a)(2)(A) determination alone.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-15\">The relevant elements of the \u00a7 419(a) \u201cguaranteed essential air transportation\u201d program, designed to protect small communities from service reductions following the introduction of free competition to the airline industry, are as follows. The program applies to all points which a certificated carrier was serving or was authorized to serve on the date of enactment, October 24, 1978. \u00a7 419(a)(1). Within one year after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number><em>enactment </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>by October 24, 1979 \u2014 the Board was required to \u201cdetermine what is essential air transportation\u201d for points, such as New Haven, which were being served by no more than one certificated carrier on the enactment date. \u00a7 419(a)(2)(A). During this one-year interim period, the Board, upon receiving notice of a carrier\u2019s intent to suspend service, was required to prohibit any service reduction \u201cwhich reasonably appears to deprive such point of essential air transportation, until the Board has completed [the \u00a7 419(a)(2)(A)] determination.\u201d \u00a7 419(aX10).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As noted above, New Haven\u2019s substantive claim rests upon this last provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">Once the Board has made its \u00a7 419(a)(2)(A) determination, other provisions governing service reductions may come into play. If a carrier wishes to effect a reduction or termination of service that will have the effect of reducing service below the level set by the Board as \u201cessential,\u201d the carrier must give 90 days\u2019 notice pursuant to \u00a7 419(a)(3)(A).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> If by the end of the 90-day notice period the Board has not found another carrier to provide service at the level deemed \u201cessential,\u201d the Board must require the carrier that gave notice to continue serving the point for successive 30-day periods until the Board finds a substitute carrier. \u00a7 419(a)(6). While the carrier is being compelled to provide service beyond the notice period, the Board must compensate it for resulting losses, \u00a7 419(a)(7)(B), and \u201cshall continue to make every effort to secure\u201d a substitute carrier. \u00a7 419(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">Apart from these obligations which arise when the Board is notified of proposed service reductions, the Board is required, whenever it determines that \u201cessential air transportation\u201d will not be provided to a point without compensation, to seek and entertain applications to provide such service for compensation. \u00a7 419(a)(4). However, nothing in \u00a7 419(a) authorizes the Board to compel a carrier that is not serving a point to commence service to that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-11\">It is clear from the provisions of \u00a7 419(a), therefore, that assuming that the airlines\u2019 terminations would be found under \u00a7 419(a)(2)(A) to deprive New Haven of essential air transportation, New Haven has a very definite stake in obtaining a reversal of the \u00a7 419(a)(10) determination involved in the present case: such a reversal would invalidate the suspensions by Eastern and Allegheny, and require them to resume service; the carriers could very well file new notices of their intent to suspend service, but at that point the Board would be required, under \u00a7 419(a)(6), to search for a replacement carrier and to block the suspensions for successive 30-day periods until it found a replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-12\">If, on the other hand, the Board\u2019s \u00a7 419(a)(10) determination were allowed to stand (or is bypassed as moot), Eastern and Allegheny would not have to resume service to New Haven. Then, even if their withdrawals were found, under \u00a7 419(aX2)(A), to deprive New Haven of essential air transportation, the Board would be required merely to seek applicants to provide New Haven service for compensation, under \u00a7 419(a)(4). The Board could not compel any carrier to provide this service, and until a new carrier was found, New Haven would be without essential air transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-13\">Since a reversal of the \u00a7 419(a)(10) determination could affect the level of service at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>New Haven, we find that New Haven\u2019s petition for review of the March order under \u00a7 419(a)(10) is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">B. <em>The Determination of Essential Air Transportation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">In challenging the Board\u2019s \u00a7 419(aX10) determination, New Haven argues that the Board misanalyzed the issues and misconstrued the statute. We reject both contentions, and therefore uphold the Board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">New Haven first argues that the Board- did not analyze the \u201cessential air transportation\u201d question as required by the statute. Relying on the language of \u00a7 419(f),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> New Haven argues that the Board failed to consider whether the service offered by the commuter airlines would satisfy New Haven\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d for transportation \u201cto one or more communities of interest\u201d and would \u201cinsure[] access to the Nation\u2019s air transportation system\u201d at fair prices. It is true that the Board, in its order, did not specifically undertake to define New Haven\u2019s \u201cneeds,\u201d or its \u201ccommunities of interest,\u201d or what would constitute fair prices. But the Board did explicitly find that \u201cthe level of air service being provided at New Haven by Pilgrim reasonably appears to meet the essential air transportation requirements of New Haven,\u201d Order No. 79-3-98 at 5, and that Pilgrim\u2019s service \u201cis substantially above the legal minimum for essential air transportation defined in section 419(f)(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>In our view, therefore, although the Board did not use the precise words of \u00a7 419(f), it made the finding required by \u00a7 419(a)(10) that the noticed terminations did not \u201creasonably [appear] to deprive [New Haven] of essential air transportation.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-10\">New Haven also appears to be arguing that the Board\u2019s interpretation of \u201cessential air transportation\u201d is unduly narrow. It is clear that New Haven\u2019s view of what constitutes \u201cessential air transportation\u201d is substantially more expansive than that adopted by the Board. Thus, New Haven asserts that the Board should have investigated, in this proceeding, New Haven\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d for service to a number of mid western cities to which New Haven has never had service.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Board, on the other hand, concluded that the present service to New York and Boston was more than sufficient to meet the \u201cessential air transportation\u201d test. The Board\u2019s more modest view of \u201cessential air transportation\u201d seems more in line with Congressional expectations, <em>see, e. g., </em>124 Cong.Rec. S5850 (daily ed. Apr. 19, 1978) (remarks of Sen. Cannon), and in any event is entitled to our deference. <em>See C.A.B. v. Carefree Travel, Inc., </em>513 F.2d 375, 390 (2d Cir. 1975). However, there is no need for this Court precisely to delineate the scope of \u201cessential air transportation\u201d in this case. The only question before us is whether we should uphold the Board\u2019s determination that the instant suspensions did not <em>\u201creasonably appear </em>\u201d to deprive New Haven of \u201cessential air transportation.\u201d Congress committed this determination to the Board, in the first instance, and clearly contemplated that the Board would act quickly and informally, on the basis of its expertise; accordingly, judicial review of the Board\u2019s determination must be a limited one. <em>Cf. S.E.C. v. New England Elec. System, </em>390 U.S. 207, 211, 88 S.Ct. 916, 920, 19 L.Ed.2d 1042 (1968). It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>sufficient to conclude, as we do, that the Board did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Rombough v.

We agree with the Board (which attributed the omission \u201cto clerical error or mere oversight\u201d) that Eastern\u2019s \u201cclear purpose [was] to withdraw all of its service from New Haven.\u201d Order No. 79-3-98 at 4 (Mar. 15, 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">. The reference was to the petition filed by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for reconsideration of the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Northeast Points </em>\u2014 Puerto <em>Rico/Virgin Islands Service Investigation, </em>Order No. 78-12-105 (Dec. 14, 1978). In its Order on Reconsideration, Order No. 79-9-178 (Sept. 17, 1979), the Board adhered to its view-that \u00a7 401(j) of the Act, as modified by the 1978 amendments, permits a carrier to suspend service at a point upon giving 90 days\u2019 notice of its intent to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1094-12\">. We find no merit in New Haven\u2019s contentions that the Board\u2019s procedures denied due process. We note at the outset that New Haven was not entitled to a full hearing in this case. Section 401(j) makes no provision whatever for a hearing. Under \u00a7 419(a)(10), New Haven had the right to petition the Board; but since that provision does not require a hearing, New Haven was not entitled to one. <em>See Nebraska Dep\u2019t of Aeronautics v. C. A. B., </em>298 F.2d 286, 291-93 (8th Cir. 1962), and <em>Springfield Airport Authority v. C. A. B., </em>109 U.S.App.D.C. 197, 285 F.2d 277 (D.C.Cir.1960) (discuss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>ing temporary suspensions under \u00a7 401(j)). The structure of \u00a7 419(a), and the fact that \u00a7 419(a)(10) determinations must (in light of our construction of \u00a7 401(j)(l)) be made within 90 days, indicate that Congress intended the Board to make \u00a7 419(a)(10) determinations quickly and informally. A hearing requirement would directly contradict this clear Congressional design.</p>\n<p id=\"AHLB\">New Haven challenges the role played by the Board\u2019s staff in the decisional process in this case, arguing that the staff was its only \u201copponent,\u201d and that New Haven was not afforded an opportunity to rebut the staff\u2019s presentations to the Board. We think this argument misapprehends the nature of the administrative process, and the relationship of the courts to that process. We would be most reluctant to undertake an examination of the Board\u2019s internal workings. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>313 U.S. 409, 422, 61 S.Ct. 999, 1004, 85 L.Ed. 1429 (1941); <em>Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Train, </em>160 U.S.App.D.C. 270, 275-278, 491 F.2d 63, 68-71 (D.C.Cir.1974). Fortunately, there is no need to do so, because New Haven has not demonstrated that it was prejudiced by the staffs activities. The Board has released copies of the staff memoranda and draft orders presented to it in this case (Joint appendix at 19-27, 85-89), and New Haven has not pointed to any factual inaccuracies in these presentations. And of course, New Haven is not entitled to have the staff agree with its legal positions. We can only conclude that New Haven was not prejudiced by, and is therefore not entitled to complain of, the manner in which the Board obtained assistance from the staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">Finally, New Haven challenges the propriety of certain communications between the staff and the Federal Aviation Administration and various agencies of the State of Connecticut. The staff contacted those agencies in the course of gathering information relevant to this case. New Haven charges that these were unlawful <em>ex parte </em>communications. As the Board points out, however, these communications were not in violation of the Board\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>rule. <em>See </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.2(c)(8), as amended by PR-192, 44 Fed.Reg. 4655 (Jan. 23, 1979). Nor does New Haven assign any other reason why these communications might have been improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1095-13\">. This claim obviously is not mooted by the Board\u2019s October determination pursuant to \u00a7 419(a)(2)(A), whether or not the latter is ' eventually upheld, that the service in question was not \u201cessential air transportation\u201d; if New Haven\u2019s construction of the statute were correct and the Board found that the \u201cpublic convenience and necessity\u201d did not <em>require </em>the amendment deleting the airlines\u2019 authority, the airlines would be required to continue providing service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1095-15\">. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1095-16\">. <em>See </em>note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1095-17\">.

New Haven also argues that Part 205 of the Board\u2019s regulations, 14 C.F.R. Part 205 (1978), required various proceedings before the carriers\u2019 notices of suspension could become effective. These regulations were obviously made obsolete by the 1978 amendments, and the Board has revoked them. 44 Fed.Reg. 20635 (April 6, 1979). Of course, even if the Board had left these regulations on the books, they could not have overridden the Congressional decision to permit airlines to suspend service on notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1096-13\">. The Board argues that the \u00a7 404(a)(1) duty to provide adequate service has in fact proven unenforceable, but New Haven notes that it has been enforced in the past, <em>see Capital Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. C. A. <em>B., </em>108 U.S.App.D.C. 215, 281 F.2d 48 (D.C.Cir.1960); <em>see also Delta-Northeast Merger Case, </em>59 C.A.B. 608, 610, 624-25 (1972), and we note that Congress apparently assumed the enforceability of such a duty at the time of the 1978 amendments. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>\u00a7 1601(a)(1)(F), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1551(a)(1)(F) (Cum.Supp.1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">. Section 1601(a)(1)(F), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1551(a)(1)(F) (Cum.Supp.1979), provides that \u00a7 404(a), \u201cinsofar as that section requires any air carrier to provide air transportation authorized by its certificate,\u201d shall cease to be in effect on December 31, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1097-9\">. For the same reason we conclude that the recitals of the carriers\u2019 service obligations which appear in the carriers\u2019 certificates must be deemed modified by the 1978 amendments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">. Section 401(h)(1) of the Senate bill provided in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-11\">Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), no air carrier, holding a certificate issued under this section, shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-12\">(A) terminate or suspend air transportation which it is required to provide to a point under such certificate; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-13\">(B) reduce any such air transportation below that which the Board has determined to be essential air transportation for that point; unless such air carrier has first given the Board, the community affected, and the State agency of the State in which such community is located, at least 90 days notice of its intent to so terminate, suspend, or reduce such air transportation. If the carrier proposing to so terminate or suspend air transportation is the only air carrier certificated under this section providing scheduled air transportation to the point involved, or, if the air carrier proposing to reduce air transportation is the only air carrier certificated under this section providing essential air transportation to the point involved, then the Board may require such air carrier to continue providing such air transportation for an additional 90-day period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1097-18\">The last-quoted sentence resembles the provision in the enacted \u00a7 419(a)(6) under which the Board can require a carrier to continue serving a point even after the carrier has served notice of its intent to suspend service under \u00a7 401(j).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">. While it appears that no party has yet petitioned for review of Order No. 79-10-134, which contains this determination, there is a request pending for an extension of time to file a petition. It thus appears that the October determination for New Haven pursuant to \u00a7 419(a)(2)(A) is still subject to review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">. Section 419(a)(10), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1389(a)(10) (Cum.Supp.1979), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVs\">Unless the Board has determined what is essential air transportation for any eligible point pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Board shall, upon petition of any appropriate representative of such point, prohibit any termination, suspension, or reduction of air transportation which reasonably appears to deprive such point of essential air transportation, until the Board has completed such determination.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1099-14\">. Section 419(a)(3)(A) thus overlaps \u00a7 401(j)(l)(B), which also requires the carrier to provide notice of a proposed service reduction when its effect is to lower service below the essential air transportation level. We have determined above that \u00a7 401(j)(l) affirmatively authorizes carriers to suspend service on notice. We do not address the question whether \u00a7 419(a)(3)(A), which is framed in terms similar to those of \u00a7 401(j)(l), might also operate as a substantive grant of authority to carriers to suspend service on notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">. <em>See </em>note 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"AX-P\">. New Haven also argues that the reference to \u00a7 419(a)(3)(A) in Allegheny\u2019s notice of intent to suspend service constituted a concession that Allegheny\u2019s suspension would reduce service to New Haven below the \u201cessential air transportation\u201d level. Of course, \u00a7 419(a)(3)(A), by its terms, did not apply to the suspensions in this case \u2014 that section only covers suspensions proposed after the Board makes its \u00a7 419(a)(2)(A) determination of \u201cessential air transportation,\u201d and the suspensions in this case occurred before the Board had made that determination. More to the point, even if Allegheny believed that its suspension deprived New Haven of \u201cessential air transportation,\u201d its view of the matter could not bind the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1100-12\">. In making these assertions, New Haven ignores the language of \u00a7 419(a)(10). The focus of this proceeding is not on what service New Haven might like to have, or even what service it might need; rather, we are concerned with the much narrower question of whether the suspensions at issue in this case \u201cdeprived\u201d New Haven of \u201cessential\u201d service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1101-19\">. We find no merit in the contention that the Board acted arbitrarily because its determination with respect to New Haven did not attempt to distinguish allegedly \u201cinconsistent\u201d determinations in thirteen other cases, in which the Board did block attempted suspensions pursuant to \u00a7 419(a)(10). We do not believe the Board\u2019s prior conclusions can fairly be characterized as inconsistent with the Board\u2019s determination here. In eight of the cases referred to, the carrier that gave notice of intent to suspend service was the <em>only </em>carrier providing service at the point. Orders 79-2-103, 79-3-16, 79-4-127, 79-5-21, 79-5-26, 79-5-138, 79-5-140 and 79-6-95. In the other cases, the level of service provided by the remaining carriers was much lower than that provided to New Haven by Pilgrim alone.
