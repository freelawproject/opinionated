Schatz, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b159-9\">HEANEY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">This is an appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota denying Robin Geiger\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. Geiger, owner of \u201cMak\u2019n Magic,\u201d a store selling, among other things, pipes and smoking accessories, challenges the City of Eagan\u2019s Ordinance No. 71 entitled \u201cAn Ordinance Prohibiting the Sale, Transfer and Possession of Drug-Related Devices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">The challenged ordinance prohibits the \u201cpossession, sale, transfer or display for sale or transfer\u201d of a \u201cdrug-related device,\u201d as defined by the ordinance. Violation of the ordinance is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500.00, imprisonment up to ninety days, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-16\">Geiger commenced the action on July 18, 1979, one day after the initial version of the ordinance was adopted by the Eagan City Council.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 20, 1979, the district court entered an order temporarily restraining enforcement of the ordinance pending a hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction. On August 29, 1979, the district court denied the request for preliminary injunctive relief after oral argument and submission of memoranda and affidavits but without an evidentiary hearing. Thereafter, Geiger\u2019s attorney took depositions of Geiger, Eagan\u2019s mayor and two Eagan police officers in order to demonstrate the ambiguity of the definition of \u201cdrug-related devices.\u201d The deponents disagreed whether some of the objects shown to them were permitted by the ordinance. Geiger then requested a rehearing based on the depositions. Rehearing was denied, but an order enjoining enforcement of the challenged ordinance pending an expedited appeal to this Court was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-17\">In denying Geiger\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction, the district court considered both of the tests discussed by this Court in <em>Fennell v. Butler, </em>570 F.2d 263 (8th Cir. 1978). It held that under either test, the request <em>for </em>injunctive relief should be denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree. In our view, Geiger has met the standards for the issuance of injunctive relief under either test articulated in <em>Fennell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>We consider the ordinance unconstitutionally vague on its face.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The City of Eagan clearly has the power through a properly drawn ordinance to discourage the availability of drugs and the acceptance of drug use by prohibiting the sale of drug-related devices.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is not such an ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The doctrine of vagueness is embodied in the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Due process incorporates notions of fair notice or warning. <em>Smith v. Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 572, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 1246, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974). As the Supreme Court said in <em>Connally v. General Construction Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">[A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axy\">Furthermore, when a criminal statute is involved,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">[n]o one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. All are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\"><em>Lanzetta v. New Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 453, 59 S.Ct. 618, 619, 83 L.Ed. 888 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Due process has two requirements: that laws provide notice to the ordinary person of what is prohibited and that they provide standards to law enforcement officials to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">Vague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-13\"><em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2298, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">There is concern that lawmaking will be entrusted \u201cto the moment-to-moment judgment of the policeman on his beat.\u201d <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>City of Chicago, </em>394 U.S. 111, 120, 89 S.Ct. 946, 951, 22 L.Ed.2d 134 (1969) (Black, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-15\">The language of the Eagan ordinance at issue is the definition of \u201cdrug-related device.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ordinance defines \u201cdrug-related device\u201d as \u201cany pipe or other object suitable to be used for smoking\u201d with one of the following characteristics:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-16\">1. Contains a visible fine wire mesh screen; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-17\">2. Contains a bowl with the interior surface made of metal, glass, acrylic, plexiglass or plastic; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>3. Contains a bowl with an inside diameter of one-half inch or less at the halfway point between the top and the bottom of the bowl; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">4. Contains a chamber; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">5. Contains a flexible tube or tubes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADF\">\u201cChamber,\u201d \u201cbowl\u201d and \u201cpipe stem\u201d are further defined in the ordinance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">\u201cChamber\u201d means an enclosed area suitable for the collection or movement of smoke, other than a bowl, pipe stem, flexible tube, or a tube suitable for holding cigarettes or cigars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">\u201cBowl\u201d means a concave-shaped object suitable for holding a smoking material to be lighted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">\u201cPipe stem\u201d means a non-flexible tube with one end entering directly into a bowl.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">The words of the ordinance do not have a common understanding developed at law. We focus first on the operative language \u201cany pipe or other object suitable to be used for smoking.\u201d The common understanding of these words is that they describe tobacco smoking accessories, not drug paraphernalia. We are, therefore, left with the language of the ordinance itself to determine what is prohibited as a \u201cdrug-related device.\u201d It is obvious that there are many types of pipes. Also, an \u201cobject\u201d may be \u201csuitable to be used for smoking,\u201d even if it is not actually so used. Indeed, which objects are \u201csuitable\u201d to be used for smoking controlled substances may depend upon the ingenuity and current practices of drug users.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">The ordinance then enumerates characteristics which the \u201cpipe\u201d or \u201cobject\u201d must possess in order to be prohibited. These characteristics are presented in the form of alternatives, rather than as a cumulative definition, which places the unwary in the position of analyzing each provision. Furthermore, the characteristics are themselves vague. For instance: (1) at what point does an \u201carea\u201d become \u201cenclosed\u201d to become a \u201cchamber;\u201d (2) at what point does a \u201cpipe stem\u201d turn into a \u201cchamber;\u201d (3) at what point does a \u201cbowl\u201d become a \u201cchamber;\u201d (4) is a \u201ctube suitable for holding cigarettes or cigars\u201d prohibited if it is a \u201cflexible tube;\u201d (5) how \u201cfine\u201d must a \u201cwire mesh screen\u201d be to be prohibited, and from what vantage point must it be \u201cvisible# to be prohibited; (6) what kind of visual inspection will be necessary to determine that the \u201cbowl\u201d has \u201can inside diameter of one-half inch or less at the halfway point between the top and the bottom of the bowl\u201d? The characteristics thus fail to provide definiteness as to what makes a \u201cpipe\u201d or \u201cobject\u201d a \u201cdrug-related device.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">Furthermore, the ordinance prohibits private \u201cpossession\u201d as well as commercial \u201csale\u201d of \u201cdrug-related devices.\u201d The ordinance thus reaches the individual in his home as well as sellers in their place of business. Yet the private individual is held to the same standard of knowledge as the owner of a commercial establishment in determining which \u201cpipe\u201d or \u201cother object suitable to be used for smoking\u201d may exhibit the prohibited characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">The ordinance further lacks arrest and search standards for enforcement officials. Under the ordinance, the possession of a \u201cdrug-related device\u201d could be the basis for an arrest even if there was no controlled substance present. Also, seeing \u201cany pipe or other object suitable to be used for smoking\u201d could be the basis for a search to determine if characteristics which turned it into a \u201cdrug-related device\u201d were present. An arrest for possession of a \u201cdrug-related device\u201d could support a search for controlled substances in a vehicle or at a home or on a person. Where definite guidelines for enforcement officials are not present, use of the ordinance to expand arrest opportunities and justify searches magnifies the potential harm from enforcement of the ordinance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-15\">On the basis of this record, we have no alternative but to reverse and remand with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>directions that the district court enter a preliminary injunction until trial, at which point the merits of the ordinance can be fully weighed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-12\">. The initial version of the ordinance was adopted July 17, 1979, and was to become effective upon publication on July 26, 1979. However, on July 24, 1979, a revised version of the ordinance was adopted. It is this revised version of the ordinance which is now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-18\">. In its Memorandum Order, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-20\">Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that there are \u201csufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation.\u201d A <em>fortiori, </em>he has also failed to make a clear showing of probable success on the merits and his request for the preliminary injunction must be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-21\"><em>Geiger v.
