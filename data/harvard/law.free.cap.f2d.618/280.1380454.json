Smith was indicted and, following a trial by jury, convicted of two counts of violating I.R.C. \u00a7 7203 (relating to the form 1040) and three counts of violating I.R.C. \u00a7 7205 (relating to the forms W-4 and W-4E). The district court sentenced him to two years imprisonment plus five years special parole. Smith appeals, urging reversal on a number of grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-18\">The indictment charged Smith with failing to file returns for the years 1974 and 1975. I.R.C. \u00a7 7203. Smith argues that he did indeed file returns, and that the facts show only that the information contained therein was untrue. This argument is foreclosed by our prior decisions. The bare act of filing a form 1040 does not constitute a tax \u201creturn\u201d under section 7203. <em>See United States v. Radue, </em>486 F.2d 220, 222 (5th Cir. 1973) (per curiam), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>416 U.S. 908, 94 S.Ct. 1615, 40 L.Ed.2d 113 (1974). The statute requires disclosure of \u201cinformation relating to the taxpayer\u2019s income from which the tax' can be computed.\u201d <em>United States v. Porth, </em>426 F.2d 519, 523 (10th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 824, 91 S.Ct. 47, 27 L.Ed.2d 53 (1970). Smith\u2019s 1974 and 1975 \u201creturns\u201d which contained nothing but zeros and constitutional objections, plainly did not even purport to disclose the required information. Smith was thus properly charged with failure to file for those years.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-19\">Contending that Count one of the indictment charged Smith with failure \u201cto supply information,\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7203, he argues that the charge is barred by the general three year statute of limitations, 26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6531. He points out that the only exceptions to the three year period are willfully failing to file and willfully failing to pay, for which the limitation period is six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">We agree with Smith\u2019s construction of the statute, but we disagree with his reading of Count one of the indictment. While the language employed is inartfully drawn the count can only be read to charge Smith with willfully and knowingly failing to make an income tax return by failing to supply the information called for on form 1040. This offense falls within the six year exception to the general three year statute of limitations. <em>See United States v. Porth, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The district court charged the jury that \u201c[i]t is not a defense to the charges that the failure to furnish information required by the Internal Revenue Law as passed by Congress was done for the purpose of protesting Government policies, even if it is done in good faith.\u201d Smith argues that this charge was inconsistent with the statutory requirement that violations of sections 7203 and 7205 be \u201cwillful\u201d. We disagree. To be \u201cwillful\u201d within the meaning of sections 7203 and 7205 the violation must be committed \u201cpurposefully . with an awareness of the action and not just negligently or inadvertently . [T]his concept is simply one which excuses a <em>negligent </em>failure to [comply] . .\u201d <em>United States v. Douglass, </em>476 F.2d 260, 263 (5th Cir. 1973) (emphasis in the original). The district court\u2019s charge properly instructed the jury that knowing noncompliance with the dictates of sections 7203 and 7205 is not saved by \u201cgood\u201d motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Smith\u2019s parole term was granted on the condition that he \u201cdivorce [himself] from any organization advocating the willful disobedience of any local, state or federal law and . . . refrain from making any statements to others advocating any disobedience of any local, state or federal law.\u201d Smith argues that this condition infringes his first amendment rights. <em>Cf. Yates v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 298, 77 S.Ct. 1064, 1 L.Ed.2d 1356 (1957). The question here is whether the condition is \u201creasonably related to the rehabilitation of the probationer.\u201d <em>United States v. Tonry, </em>605 F.2d 144, 147 (5th Cir. 1979). The existence of such a relation must be ascertained in light of \u201c(1) the purposes sought to be served by probation; (2) the extent to which constitutional rights enjoyed by law-abiding citizens should be accorded to probationers; and (3) the legitimate needs of law enforcement.\u201d Tonry, 605 F.2d at 150, quoting <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>561 F.2d 735 (9th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 923, 98 S.Ct. 1486, 55 L.Ed.2d 516 (1978). The district court exceeded its discretion in this case. Although we see no intrinsic infirmity in a parole condition which proscribes \u201cthe inducing of others to violate the law,\u201d <em>Porth v. Templar, </em>453 F.2d 330, 334 (10th Cir. 1971) or associating with persons who do, <em>cf. United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>414 F.2d 630, 636 (5th Cir. 1969), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Schacht v. United States, </em>398 U.S. 58, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970), in this case, even though Smith\u2019s convictions were all for tax offenses, his parole condition extended to advocacy concerning disobedience of <em>any </em>law. So broad a restriction is not \u201creasonably related\u201d to inhibiting income tax rebellion.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">We have considered Smith\u2019s other claimed grounds for reversal and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">The conviction is affirmed and the sentence is modified by striking the phrase \u201cany local, state, or federal law\u201d and substituting therefor \u201cthe Internal Revenue Code.\u201d <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>600 F.2d 1172, 1175 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
