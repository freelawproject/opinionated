The district court held that the authorization cards were not exempt from disclosure under any of the exemption provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. This court recently held that union authorization cards fall within Exemption 6 of the Freedom of Information Act which covers \u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d <em>Maderia Nursing Center, Inc. v.
