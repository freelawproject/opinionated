GIBSON was Chief Judge of the Eighth Circuit at the time this case was submitted and took senior status on December 31, 1979, before the opinion was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b167-13\">HENLEY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">This is an appeal from a decision of the United States Tax Court involving the difficult question whether the proceeds of an insurance policy on the life of the decedent, owned by decedent\u2019s wife but payable to The United States National Bank of Omaha as trustee of decedent\u2019s revocable inter vivos trust, are includible in the decedent\u2019s gross estate for estate tax purposes. The Tax Court, in a well reasoned opinion, held that the proceeds are not taxable to the estate of the decedent because he possessed no \u201cincidents of ownership\u201d with respect to the policy and possessed \u201cno power of appointment\u201d over the policy or proceeds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">Robert B. Margrave died on April 29, 1973 survived by his wife, Glenda Ardelle Margrave, and children. Prior to his death and on June 16, 1966 the decedent had executed a will and established a trust known as the Robert B. Margrave Trust. The will provided in part that all his personal and household effects would go to his wife if she survived him for a period of thirty days and the remainder of his estate would be \u201cpoured-over\u201d into the Robert B. Margrave Trust. The United States National Bank of Omaha was named executor of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-16\">The Bank was also named trustee of the Robert B. Margrave Trust. Under the terms of the trust decedent retained an unqualified right to modify or revoke the trust and was the income beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-17\">The trust agreement also provided for the creation of two other and separate trusts after the death of the decedent. One trust, the Glenda Ardelle Margrave Trust, consisted of approximately half of his estate and was largely for the benefit of the widow who had a general power of appointment. The other trust, the Robert B. Margrave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Residuary Trust, was for the benefit of Margrave\u2019s children. Margrave died leaving as the only assets of the Robert B. Margrave Trust certain insurance policies on his life.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A39\">On January 29, 1970 decedent\u2019s wife applied for an insurance policy on the life of her husband. The policy, a twenty year decreasing term life insurance policy with a $100,000.00 face value, was later issued on March 12, 1970 by the Western Life Insurance Company. Mrs. Margrave was the owner of record of the policy and she paid the premiums with her own funds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the terms of the policy, all benefits, rights, options and privileges available or exercisable during the insured\u2019s life were vested in the owner. Furthermore, the bank, as trustee of the trust created by Robert B. Mar-grave on June 16, 1966 was named primary beneficiary of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"AxL\">Following decedent\u2019s death, the proceeds of the insurance policy in the amount of $84,583.00 were paid to the bank as trustee of the trust. The estate tax returns filed by the bank, however, did not include this amount. The Commissioner, relying largely on 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(2) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2041,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> determined that the insurance proceeds were includible and thus added the amount of the insurance proceeds to the decedent\u2019s gross estate and issued a notice of deficiency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The executor of decedent\u2019s will then petitioned the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiency. The Tax Court by divided vote held that the decedent possessed neither an \u201cincident of ownership\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(2) nor a \u201cpower of appointment\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2041, and concluded that the insurance proceeds were not includible in the gross estate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZt\">On appeal the appellant first argues that the Tax Court erred in finding that the insurance proceeds were not includible in decedent\u2019s gross estate under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 2042 provides that the gross estate shall include the value of life insurance proceeds receivable by other beneficiaries to the extent that the decedent possessed at his death any of the \u201cincidents of ownership.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The appellant argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the decedent possessed at his death \u201cincidents of ownership\u201d as to the insurance policy because of the decedent\u2019s ability to change the beneficiary of the policy through his power to modify or revoke the trust. Appellant claims that the fact that Mrs. Margrave had the ultimate power to change the beneficiary of the policy does not warrant exclusion of the proceeds of the policy under \u00a7 2042(2). Noting that at the time of decedent\u2019s death Mrs. Margrave could no longer deprive Mr. Margrave of his power to change the beneficiary, the appellant concludes the decedent possessed \u201cincidents of ownership\u201d at the time of his death. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"ADj\">We recognize that the term \u201cincidents of ownership\u201d has in many instances been construed broadly. The regulation 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.2042-l(c)(2) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX-\">the term \u2018incidents of ownership\u2019 is not limited in its meaning to ownership of the policy in a technical legal sense. Generally speaking, the term has reference to the right of the insured or his estate to the economic benefits of the policy. Thus, it includes the power to change the beneficiary, to surrender or cancel the policy, to assign the policy, to revoke an assignment, to pledge the policy for a loan, or to obtain from the insurer a loan against the surrender value of the policy ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbO\">Case law similarly indicates broad interpretation of the term. Courts have construed \u201cincidents of ownership\u201d to include the power to change the beneficiary, see, e. <em>g., Chase Nat\u2019l Bank v. United States, </em>278 U.S. 327, 49 S.Ct. 126, 73 L.Ed. 405 (1929); <em>Seward\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner, </em>164 F.2d 434 (4th Cir. 1947); insured\u2019s right to obtain the cash or loan value where the beneficiary has been irrevocably designated, <em>Liebmann v. Hassett, </em>148 F.2d 247 (1st Cir. 1945); or the right to transfer insurance benefits in connection with the sale of other property rights. <em>Commissioner v. Treganowan, </em>183 F.2d 288 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Estate of Strauss v. Commissioner, </em>340 U.S. 853, 71 S.Ct. 82, 95 L.Ed. 625 (1950). Further, courts have held that decedent\u2019s inability to exercise ownership incidents may not make them illusory, see, e. <em>g., Commissioner v. Estate of Noel, </em>380 U.S. 678, 85 S.Ct. 1238, 14 L.Ed.2d 159 (1965). <em>See generally </em>J. Rabkin &amp; M. Johnson, Federal Income, Gift and Estate Taxation, \u00a7 61.-05(2) (1979). We do not believe, however, that decedent\u2019s power to alter or revoke his trust and thus to designate the beneficiary of the proceeds of the life insurance policy constitutes an \u201cincident of ownership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Am1\">We note that there was never an instant when Mr. Margrave possessed more than a mere power over an expectancy. During his life, decedent\u2019s power was subject to the absolute whim of Mrs. Mar-grave<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> who could completely eliminate decedent\u2019s ability to designate the beneficiary through her own power to modify or revoke the insurance policy. At his death, Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Margrave\u2019s power to designate the beneficiary, by the terms of the trust, ceased to exist. In such circumstances we are unable to find \u201cincidents of ownership\u201d sufficient to include the proceeds of the insurance policy in decedent\u2019s gross estate under \u00a7 2042(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Appellant next contends that the Tax Court erred in concluding that the insurance proceeds are not includible in decedent\u2019s gross estate under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2041. That section provides that the gross estate includes the value of all property to which the decedent has at the time of his death a \u201cgeneral power of appointment.\u201d Appellant insists that the decedent\u2019s power to modify or revoke the trust constitutes a \u201cgeneral power of appointment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Again, we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">A \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d is defined by the Code as \u201ca power which is exercisable in favor of the decedent, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate . . 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2041(b)(1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In order for such a power to result in the inclusion of an item in decedent\u2019s gross estate under \u00a7 2041, the decedent must at least (1) possess a power within this definition of \u201ca general power of appointment,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and (2) there must be a property interest to which this \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d attaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">While it is clear that the decedent possessed a \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d by virtue of his ability to modify or revoke the trust, <em>Maytag v. United States, </em>493 F.2d 995 (10th Cir. 1974); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.2041-1(b)(1),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we do not believe that any property interest attached to that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">As the Second Circuit noted in <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. United States, </em>465 F.2d 760 (2d Cir. 1972), \u201cat the very least, property subject to a \u00a7 2041 power of appointment must be in existence prior to the time of decedent\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764. <em>See also Lang v. United States, </em>356 F.Supp. 546 (S.D.Iowa 1973); Rev.Rul. 79-117, I.R.B. 1979, 15, 12; Rev.Rul. 75-126, 1975-1 C.B. 296; Rev.Rul. 75-127, 1975-1 C.B. 297. Pri- or to his death, Margrave possessed only a power over an expectancy because the rights of the trustee to the proceeds were subject to Mrs. Margrave\u2019s power to change the designation of the trustee as beneficiary.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although the death of Mr. Mar-grave caused the trustee\u2019s right to the proceeds to vest and create a property interest to which Mr. Margrave\u2019s power of appoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ment might attach, Mr.. Margrave\u2019s death simultaneously terminated his ability to modify or revoke the trust. Thus, Mr. Mar-grave\u2019s \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d was at all times merely a power over an expectancy. In such circumstances, we do not believe the proceeds of the life insurance policy can be included in decedent\u2019s gross estate under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2041.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ACr\">. Prior to decedent\u2019s death, there were apparently no assets transferred to the trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AIj\">. The decedent as the insured also signed the application for the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A90\">. The Commissioner initially believed that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2038 provided an alternative basis to include the insurance proceeds in the decedent\u2019s gross estate. Later, however, the Commissioner conceded that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2038 was inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"ATH\">. The Commissioner determined an estate tax deficiency in the amount of $11,176.45.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Asr\">. Seven members of the sixteen member Tax Court vigorously objected to Judge Tannenwald\u2019s analysis for the majority in three separate dissenting opinions. Judge Fay, joined by four other judges, contended that the insurance proceeds were in fact includible in decedent\u2019s gross estate because decedent\u2019s unqualified power to modify the trust terms constituted a general testamentary power of appointment under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2041. Judge Chabot concluded that the insurance proceeds were includible reasoning that the decedent\u2019s unqualified power to modify or revoke the trust falls within the ambit of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(1). Judge Quealy took the position that the insurance proceeds are not only includible in decedent\u2019s gross estate under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2041 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042, but also under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(2). He felt that decedent\u2019s power to modify or revoke the trust was an \u201cincident of ownership\u201d and that a decedent\u2019s power need not be vested or absolute to constitute such an \u201cincident of ownership.\u201d Judge Goffe concurred generally agreeing with the Tax Court majority, but emphasized that the present case does not involve a prearranged plan of tax avoidance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AV1\">. The appellant did not argue in the Tax Court that the proceeds should be included in the gross estate under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(1).</p>\n<p id=\"AGL\">The Tax Court, however, briefly addressed this question and concluded that \u201cthere is nothing in the record to indicate that the trust was under a legal obligation \u2018to pay taxes, debts, or other charges enforceable against the estate.\u2019 \u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.2042-l(b)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"ATC\">. Section 2042 specifically reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9G\">The value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap1\">(1) Receivable by the executor. \u2014 To the extent of the amount receivable by the executor as insurance under policies on the life of the decedent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AX_\">(2) Receivable by other beneficiaries. \u2014 To the extent of the amount receivable by all other beneficiaries as insurance under policies on the life of the decedent with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>to which the decedent possessed at his death any of the incidents of ownership, exercisable either alone or in conjunction with any other person. * * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"A3R\">. The Tax Court majority noted that in the present case there was no evidence of the existence of a prearranged plan. The majority observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adc\">Insofar as the record indicates, there was no agreement or understanding between decedent and Mrs. Margrave with respect to the disposition of the policy or of proceeds and respondent has not made any suggestion along these lines. Any' attempt to infer a prearranged agreement or understanding can rest only on an automatic inference based upon the marital relationship, a course which the Court has in the past declined to pursue. <em>Cf. Estate of Gutchess v. Commissioner, </em>46 T.C. 554 (1966).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4a\">Furthermore, Judge Goffe, in his concurring opinion, also could find in the record nothing supporting the existence of a prearranged plan. He noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfV\">To conclude, as the trial judge does in his dissenting opinion, that there was a prearranged plan, he must disregard the testimony of Mr. Schwartz. Where evidence which is competent, relevant and credible is uncontradicted the Tax Court may not arbitrarily discredit or disregard it. <em>Banks v. Commissioner, </em>322 F.2d 530, 537 (8th Cir. 1963). In my view, the testimony of Mr. Schwartz was not improbable, unreasonable or questionable. We are, therefore, bound to accept his testimony as true.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">. Although appellant notes that six of the dissenting Tax Court judges concluded the insurance proceeds were includible in decedent\u2019s gross estate by virtue of \u00a7 2041, appellant in his brief relies primarily on \u00a7 2042.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"ADD\">. As various courts and commentators have noted, the definition is cast in the disjunctive, so that a person is in possession of a \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d if he is able to exercise that power of appointment in favor of any one of the four groups of beneficiaries specified in the statute. See, e. <em>g., Keeter v. United States, </em>461 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>428 F.2d 538 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 829, 91 S.Ct. 59, 27 L.Ed.2d 59 (1970). <em>See generally </em>J. Rabkin &amp; M. Johnson, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 52.08(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"AKn\">. For examples of powers which may constitute \u201cgeneral powers of appointment,\u201d <em>see </em>26 C.F.R \u00a7 20.2041-1(b)(1); J. Rabkin &amp; M. Johnson, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 52.08(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"Ac\">. Courts have consistently held that the right of another to revoke a \u201cpower of appointment,\u201d <em>see, e. g., United States v. Turner, </em>287 F.2d 821, 826-27 (8th Cir. 1961), or even the mere possession of a \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d where decedent lacks the capacity or opportunity to exercise it can constitute a \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d under \u00a7 2041. <em>Estate of Bagley v. United States, </em>443 F.2d 1266, 1267 (5th Cir. 1971); <em>Fish </em>v. <em>United States, </em>432 F.2d 1278, 1280 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"AO\">. Appellant relies on <em>Keeter v. United States, supra; </em>and <em>Terriberry v. United States, </em>517 F.2d 286 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 977, 96 S.Ct. 1484, 47 L.Ed.2d 748 (1976), to support his theory that the fact a power of appointment is \u201cdefeasible\u201d does not reduce its legal effect. But as the Tax Court majority noted, these cases are distinguishable. In <em>Keeter </em>the issue was not whether there was any property to which the \u201cpower of appointment\u201d attached, but rather whether the instrument involved constituted a \u201cpower of appointment.\u201d Furthermore, <em>Terriberry </em>is distinguishable from the present case in that the decedent in <em>Terriberry </em>had direct control of the insurance policies and thus could be said to have \u201cincidents of ownership\u201d in the policies themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
