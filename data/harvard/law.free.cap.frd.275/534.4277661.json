GARY SEBELIUS, United States Magistrate Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">This matter comes before the Court upon Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Compel Discovery and Supporting Memorandum (ECF No. 242). Defendants have filed a response in opposition. For the reasons explained below, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">This is a multidistrict litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) proceeding in which Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves as well as current and former non-exempt retail branch and call center employees, allege Bank of America, N.A. and Bank of America, Corporation (\u201cthe Bank\u201d) violated both federal and state wage-and-hour laws. More specifically, Plaintiffs allege the Bank deliberately failed to pay its retail branch and call center employees their earned wages and overtime compensation in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d) and California and Washington state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The named Plaintiffs seek to represent a nationwide collective action class of non-retail branch and call center employees for alleged violations of FLSA overtime provisions. The California retail branch and call center representatives seek to represent a Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 class of non-exempt California retail branch and call center employees for alleged violations of California state law. The Washington retail branch representatives seek to represent a Rule 23 class of non-exempt Washington retail branch employees for alleged violations of Washington state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">The dispute at issue in the motion to compel concerns the discoverability of the names and contact information of former Bank employees who worked in certain positions. Plaintiffs\u2019 Interrogatory No. 11 seeks, \u201cThe name, address, and phone number for all former Market Managers and Market Executives who were employed by the Defendants during the \u2018retail banking center class period.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Interrogatory No. 12 seeks, \u201cThe name, address, and phone number for all former Branch Managers who were employed by the Defendants during the \u2018retail banking center class period\u2019 for all the branches selected by the Plaintiffs as identified in the Plaintiffs\u2019 February 25, 2011 email to defense counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The e-mail identified thirty percent of the bank\u2019s branches.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a footnote in Plaintiffs\u2019 reply brief, Plaintiffs seem suggest that sampling is no longer appropriate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Generally, the Court will not consider relief requested for the first time in a reply brief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because Plaintiffs originally moved to compel a response to Interrogatory No. 12 that was limited to a thirty-percent sampling, the instant Memorandum and Order addresses that request and does not consider Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that sampling is no longer appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-17\">In response to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel, the Bank asserts that these interrogatories are overly broad, do not seek relevant information, and that the former employees\u2019 privacy rights outweigh the Plaintiffs\u2019 need for discovery. The Court addresses each of these objections in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-18\">II. Discussion<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-19\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1) provides that \u201c[f]or good cause, the court may order dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>covery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action.\u201d When a party fails to make disclosure or discovery, the opposing party may file a motion to compel. When a party files a motion to compel and asks the court to overrule certain objections, the objecting party must specifically show in its response to the motion how each discovery request is objectionable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Objections initially raised but not supported in response to the motion to compel are deemed abandoned.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, if the discovery requests appear facially objectionable in that they are overly broad or seek information that does not appear relevant, the burden is on the movant to demonstrate how the requests are not objectionable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With this standard in mind, the Court turns to the Bank\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">A. Relevance</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Relevant information need not be admissible at trial so long as it is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court broadly construes relevance at the discovery stage of litigation, and \u201ca request for discovery should be considered relevant if there is \u2018any possibility that the information sought may be relevant to the claim or defense of any party.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThere is no presumption in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that a discovery request is relevant.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, relevance is often apparent on the face of the request.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> When it is not, the proponent of the discovery has the burden to show the relevance of the discovery sought.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If a discovery request seeks facially relevant information or if the proponent has demonstrated relevance, the party resisting discovery must establish the lack of relevance by demonstrating the requested discovery either: (1) is outside the scope of relevance as defined by Rule 26(b), or (2) is of such marginal relevance that the potential harm occasioned by discovery would outweigh the ordinary presumption in favor of broad discovery.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-15\">Plaintiffs argue that the former branch managers, market executives, and market managers (\u201cthe former employees\u201d) have information relevant to claims and defenses in this proceeding. As previously noted, Plaintiffs have proposed a nationwide class pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) of the FLSA. Plaintiffs\u2019 Consolidated Complaint alleges that: the Bank had a company-wide practice of requiring nonexempt bank branch employees to perform work off the clock; Branch Managers were under instructions and pressure from the Bank to restrict overtime to be paid; the Bank did not allow putative class members to record all hours worked; the Bank erased or modified putative class members\u2019 recorded hours or required those employees to modify their own hours; and the Bank required putative class members to work uncompensated during breaks and would offer \u201ccomp time\u201d in lieu of paying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>overtime wages.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Plaintiffs state these former employees likely have information related to the implementation of the Bank\u2019s overtime policies and procedures, and Plaintiffs contend this information could assist them in establishing the parameters of the putative class.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">To obtain conditional certification of the FLSA collective action, Plaintiffs must show that members of the putative class are similarly situated.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Under the Tenth Circuit\u2019s approach, this showing requires \u201csubstantial allegations that the putative class members were together the victims of a single decision, policy, or plan.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It appears reasonably likely that these former employees would possess information about the extent of the alleged policy or plan. Accordingly, the Court finds that the interrogatories, on their face, seek relevant information. Moreover, Plaintiffs have sufficiently explained the relevance of the requested discovery. As such, the Bank bears the burden to support its relevance objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The Bank\u2019s argument is twofold. First, the Bank argues Plaintiffs are already in possession of sufficient information and discovery to support their effort to certify any class in this proceeding. In support of this argument, the Bank details the discovery it has produced or agreed to produce, which the Bank contends should enable Plaintiffs to discover the extent of the Bank\u2019s policies and procedures. The Court is unpersuaded by this argument. The fact that Plaintiffs may possess other information that may aid them in determining whether the Bank had a nationwide policy of failing to pay overtime wages does not lessen the relevance of the information the interrogatories seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">The Bank next argues Plaintiffs\u2019 proffered explanation of relevance is nothing more than speculation because Plaintiffs have not made any showing of any alleged violations occurring at locations other than those where the named and opt-in Plaintiffs worked. Generally, a party is not required to come forward with evidence in support of its claims before the Court will allow discovery of those claims.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although some courts have, at times, required a heightened showing of relevance before allowing certain discovery, the circumstances here do not warrant such a showing.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Importantly, the Bank does not assert it would be unduly burdensome to produce the requested information. It appears this information is reasonably accessible to the Bank, and the information appears facially relevant. For these reasons, the Bank\u2019s relevance objection is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">B. Overbreadth</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">As an initial matter, the Court finds the interrogatories are not facially overly broad. They seek the names and contact information of former managerial-level employees who held specific titles during a specific time period, and as previously explained, this information appears relevant. Because the interrogatories are not facially objectionable, it is the Bank\u2019s burden to support its overbreadth objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-14\">The Bank\u2019s overbreadth objection is largely intertwined with its relevance objection. Essentially, the Bank argues the interrogatories are overly broad because the information sought is not relevant. Currently, the Plaintiffs in this litigation come from eighteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>states covering four percent of the Bank\u2019s retail branches nationwide.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, the scope of the interrogatories encompasses contact information for individuals who worked at branches where no named or opt-in Plaintiffs worked. The Bank states the majority of these individuals have no connection to the named or opt-in Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs argue this information is relevant to the extent of the alleged nationwide policy or practice of the Bank and may help them define the putative class. Therefore, the fact that many of these managerial-level employees may not have had contact with the named or opt-in Plaintiffs does not persuade the Court that this discovery is overly broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The Bank also points the Court to <em>Tracy v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>a 1998 opinion from the District of Colorado, which the Bank contends is instructive on the scope of pre-certification discovery in a potential wage-and-hour class and collective action.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Tracy </em>involved a ruling on whether to allow plaintiffs in a wage-and-hour potential Rule 23 class action/FLSA collective action to obtain discovery from Dean Witter\u2019s offices nationwide. From the time of the scheduling conference with the court, the magistrate judge allowed plaintiffs to conduct discovery only in the Dean Witter office at the Denver Tech Center.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The magistrate judge ruled he would not allow discovery from other offices unless plaintiffs could present facts demonstrating a reasonable likelihood Dean Witter had a policy or practice of denying overtime pay to its employees. Plaintiffs moved to extend the scope of discovery on several occasions, and the court denied each request. Plaintiffs again moved to extend the scope, arguing discovery from other offices was warranted because Dean Witter had a nationwide <em>de facto </em>policy and practice of refusing to pay overtime wages. The court denied the motion because it found plaintiffs had failed to present sufficient evidence that Dean Witter maintained or pursued a national policy that violated the FLSA.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">While recognizing the necessity of \u201csome discovery\u201d prior to certification, the court also noted the need to control, and in some cases limit, pre-certification discovery. Relying on the District of Connecticut\u2019s opinion in <em>National Organization for Women v. Sperry Rand Corp., </em>the court reasoned, \u201cThe discovery which is permitted should be sufficiently broad that the plaintiffs have a fair and realistic opportunity to obtain evidence which will meet the requirements of Rule 23, yet not so broad that the discovery efforts present an undue burden to the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-16\">Indeed, in <em>National Organization for Women, </em>the District of Connecticut focused on the burden imposed on the defendant in responding to plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Plaintiffs sought to represent a Rule 23 class in the employment discrimination action.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In the pre-certification phase of discovery, plaintiffs served interrogatories and requests for production, which they argued were aimed at gathering discovery relevant to the issue of class certification.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The court noted the discovery sought could reach into defendant\u2019s three-hundred plants nationwide, and defendant contended such discovery would cost three-million dollars.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In light of the burden imposed on defendant, the court limited the scope of the discovery requests, including a geographic limitation on information responsive to multiple interrogatories.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-17\"><em>Tracy </em>and <em>National Organization for Women </em>illustrate that it is within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>court\u2019s discretion to limit the scope of pre-certification discovery in certain instances. Nevertheless, there is no bright-line rule that in the pre-certification phase of discovery, plaintiffs must come forward with evidence of a nationwide policy or practice before being allowed to obtain discovery aimed at that very issue.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This is particularly true when the burden imposed on the responding party is minimal. The notion that broad pre-certification discovery could unduly burden defendants is implicit in opinions requiring plaintiffs to show such discovery is likely to produce substantiation of the class allegations.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In <em>National Organization for Women, </em>full compliance with the discovery requests would have imposed an undue burden on defendant, which was the rationale for limiting the scope of the requests. In <em>Tracy </em>the court imposed limitations at the time of the scheduling conference \u2014 presumably to manage discovery so as to avoid imposing an undue burden on the defendant. However, the reasons for the initial limitation are not clear from the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">At the second scheduling conference with the Court, the Bank made clear it does not contend that responding to the interrogato-r\u00edes would pose an undue burden. Similarly, in response to the motion to compel, it has lodged no such objection. Thus, there is no compelling reason to limit the discovery sought. The Bank\u2019s overbreadth objection is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">C. Privacy Interests</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Generally, concerns about confidentiality or the disclosure of private or sensitive information are not a sufficient basis to withhold discovery and are best addressed in the form of a protective order.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Despite this, the Bank argues privacy interests of its former employees outweigh the need for discovery. The Bank states that approximately 1,200 of these former employees reside in California. As such, the Bank argues that California ease law interpreting the state constitution\u2019s right-to-privacy provision prohibits discovery of the former employees\u2019 contact information or requires the Court to adopt a procedure whereby the employees may opt-out of having their identities and contact information disclosed to the Plaintiffs.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>The Bank relies on California case law interpreting Article I, Section I of the California Constitution, which expressly provides an inalienable right to privacy. \u201c[I]n many contexts, the scope and application of the state constitutional right of privacy is broader and more protective of privacy than the federal constitutional right of privacy as interpreted by the federal courts.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> To that end, California courts have interpreted the state constitutional privacy provision as creating \u201ca zone of privacy which protects against unwarranted compelled disclosure of certain private information.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In determining whether compelled disclosure is warranted, the court often weighs the privacy interests against the need for discovery.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">For example, the Bank cites <em>Planned Parenthood Golden Gate v. Superior Court. </em>In that case, Planned Parenthood sought review of the lower court\u2019s order compelling disclosure of the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of nonparty volunteers and staff of Planned Parenthood.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The underlying case involved claims asserted by an anti-abortion picketer against Planned Parenthood and counterclaims and third-party claims Planned Parenthood asserted against the plaintiff and other picketers.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In vacating in part the order compelling disclosure, the appellate court noted the residential privacy interest at stake was \u201cparticularly potent in the context of a dispute relating to the ability of women to seek and obtain lawful services related to pregnancy.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The court found that under these circumstances, \u201cthe consequences of disclosure of the private information are profound.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">The Bank also cites <em>Belaire-West Landscape, Inc. v. Superior Court, </em>a California appellate opinion recognizing putative class members\u2019 privacy interests.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In the pre-certification phase of a wage-and-hour putative class action, plaintiffs sought disclosure of the names and contact information of defendant\u2019s current and former employees.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The trial court allowed disclosure of this information through a procedure whereby putative class members could opt out of having their names and contact information disclosed.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The defendant sought review, and the appellate court upheld the lower court\u2019s ruling, reasoning that the opt-out procedure sufficiently protected the privacy rights of the putative class members<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The Bank argues the former employees at issue here have an even stronger privacy interest than the <em>Belaire-West </em>employees because they are not potential class members who could seek to recover from this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\"><em>Puerto v. Superior Court </em>is more persuasive.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In that case, plaintiffs had requested the names, addresses, and telephone numbers for employees who had knowledge of the alleged incidents giving rise to the wage- and-hour claims.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Defendant Wild Oats provided the names of the employees but objected to providing contact information.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The trial court provided for disclosure by a procedure allowing the employees to consent to having their contact information disclosed. The appellate court reversed, ordering the disclosure of contact information without so-called procedural safeguards.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Among the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>reasons for disclosure, the court noted plaintiffs were entitled to discover contact information for potential witnesses.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Although cited by Plaintiffs in their initial motion and memorandum, the Bank does not attempt to distinguish <em>Puerto </em>(or similar opinions) in its response brief even though <em>Puerto </em>distinguished much of the authority relied upon by the Bank. For example, <em>Puer-to </em>noted \u201csalient distinctions\u201d between discovering potential witness contact information and case law addressing pre-certification discovery aimed at identifying class members \u2014 namely, that witnesses may not opt out of discovery.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>Puerto </em>also distinguished discovery in routine civil litigation from the situation in <em>Planned Parenthood, </em>which involved \u201c\u2018unique concerns of the \u2018emotionally charged and often violent\u2019 abortion debate[.]\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> As <em>Puerto </em>noted, disclosure in <em>Planned Parenthood </em>could have placed the workers in physical danger.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Whereas in <em>Puerto </em>\u201cthe dangers of being \u2018outed\u2019 as individuals who work at a grocery store cannot be equated with the impingement of associational freedom likely to occur when, as in <em>Planned Parenthood, </em>the disclosure identifies the individual as assisting in the operation of an abortion clinic.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> In <em>Puerto, </em>the court ultimately concluded that while individuals may have a legitimate ex-peetation of privacy in their contact information, disclosure of the requested information did not pose a serious invasion of that interest.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Other California state and federal court decisions addressing these issues have reached similar conclusions and have permitted disclosure.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">Although the Bank\u2019s former employees may have a privacy interest in disclosure of their identities and contact information, such disclosure does not pose a serious invasion of privacy in routine civil cases, such as this wage-and-hour MDL proceeding. Moreover, these former employees likely have information about the Bank\u2019s overtime policies, which as previously explained, appears relevant. In short, Plaintiffs\u2019 need for discovery outweighs any minimal invasion of former employees\u2019 privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">For the foregoing reasons, the Bank\u2019s privacy objection is overruled. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel is granted, and the Bank is ordered to supplement its responses to the interrogatories within fourteen (14) days from the date of this Memorandum and Order. In order to address privacy considerations, the Court orders that the Bank\u2019s responses to the interrogatories be deemed \u201cConfidential\u201d under the Protective Order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>previously entered.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Compel Discovery and Supporting Memorandum (ECF No. 242) is hereby granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within fourteen (14) days from the date of this order, the Bank shall supplement its responses to Interrogatories Nos. 11 and 12 of Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Set of Interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-10\">.
