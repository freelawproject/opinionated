Although presented as three issues, the appellant\u2019s sole argument is that a handwriting exemplar, which he voluntarily completed for two officers investigating the check forgery, was admitted at trial in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, since counsel was not made available to him at the time the writing sample was taken. Failure to provide access to counsel here, Snider maintains, runs afoul of the doctrine outlined in United States v. Wade, 1967, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 and Gilbert v. California, 1967, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct.1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178, that \u201can accused is entitled to counsel at any critical stage of the prosecution\u201d, and that evidence obtained at such a \u201ccritical stage\u201d without the presence and assistance of counsel may not be admitted at trial. See Simmons v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 377, 382-383, 88 S.Ct. 967, 970, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247, 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"> The appellant\u2019s struggle to fit his pre-arraignment confrontation within the <em>Wade-Gilbert </em>exclusionary rule is thwarted by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kirby v. Illinois, 1972, 406 U.S. 682, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 32 L.Ed.2d 411, and this Court\u2019s holding in United States v. Ryan, 5 Cir. 1973, 478 F.2d 1008. <em>Kirby </em>instructs that \u201ca person\u2019s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 406 U.S. at 688, 92 S.Ct. 1881, 32 L.Ed.2d at 417. Here, the handwriting exemplar was taken before Snider was even arrested. Yet since he was under suspicion, the appellant argues, this was nonetheless a \u201ccritical stage of the prosecution\u201d. We cannot agree. It is apparent from <em>Ryan, </em>in which we upheld the admission at trial of a post-arrest voice identification, that prearraignment confrontations involving physical exemplars \u201care not \u2018critical stages\u2019 of the prosecution at which the presence of counsel is constitutionally required\u201d. 478 F.2d at 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"Axf\">The conviction appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"AOU\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\">. This is not to say, of course, that to safeguard an accused\u2019s right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment, a right to counsel may not attach immediately upon arrest. See Miranda v. Arizona, 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. But <em>Miranda </em>protects the accused only against compulsory self-incrimination as a result of in-custody interrogation. Handwriting is an \u201cidentifying physical characteristic\u201d; the taking of an exemplar is not interrogation and is patently without <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>ambit. Gilbert v. California, 1967, 388 U.S. 263, 266-267, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 1953, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178, 1183; see Kirby v. Illinois, 1972, 406 U.S. 682, 688, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 1881, 32 L.Ed.2d 411, 416-417; United States v. Ryan, 5 Cir. 1973, 478 F.2d 1008, 1112. Thus, no Fifth Amendment rights are at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
