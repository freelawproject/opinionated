United States Senior Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place of Judge O\u2019Connell, </em>pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28 U.S.O.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b831-21\">WORLEY, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b831-22\">Appellant seeks to register \u201cDanny Boy\u201d for use on fresh tomatoes. Appellee opposes on grounds of long prior registration and use of the trademark \u201cAndy Boy\u201d on a variety of food products including fresh vegetables. Both \u201cDanny Boy\u201d and \u201cAndy Boy\u201d, as used, are accompanied by a picture of a smiling boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-23\">In view of the nature of the goods and priority of use, the sole question is whether concurrent use of the marks would likely result in confusion within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-24\">The examiner sustained the opposition, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-25\">\u201cThe marks \u2018Danny Boy\u2019 and \u2018Andy Boy\u2019 are similar in composition and they are to some extent similar in connotation, in that each thereof is suggestive of a small boy. Moreover, these marks bear a marked resemblance in sound; and aside from any other consideration, it is the opinion of the examiner that the resemblance between them in the latter respect alone is such that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>contemporaneous use for the specified goods would at least be reasonably likely to cause confusion in trade.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">In affirming the examiner\u2019s action, the Commissioner, through the Assistant Commissioner, observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-5\">\u201cThe record shows that opposer\u2019s mark \u2018Andy Boy\u2019 has been used on fresh vegetables and fruit, including tomatoes, for many years; such vegetables and fruit have been sold in large quantities; and the vegetables and fruit have been extensively advertised to wholesalers and jobbers through trade journals and to the consuming public through newspapers and radio. Opposer has at all times used on its labels the picture of a smiling young boy in association with its \u2018Andy Boy\u2019 trademark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-6\">\u201cApplicant\u2019s president was familiar with opposer\u2019s trademark \u2018Andy Boy\u2019 before \u2018Danny Boy\u2019 was adopted for use on tomatoes. Applicant uses on its labels and cartons for tomatoes the picture of a smiling young boy, though not always the same boy. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-8\">\u201cThe mark \u2018Danny Boy\u2019 so resembles \u2018Andy Boy\u2019 as to be likely, when applied to fresh tomatoes, to cause confusion, mistake, or deception of purchasers; and when consideration is given to the \u2018hurly-burly\u2019 of the fresh produce market and the fact that practically all transactions in fresh produce at the jobber level (where trademarks for such products are really important and meaningful) are conducted by telephone, confusion and mistake will be inevitable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">We have given full consideration to appellant\u2019s brief and oral argument but find nothing to disturb the holding below. While there are obviously some dissimilarities between the two marks, their similarities outweigh their differences to such an extent as to result in a likelihood of confusion when applied to the instant goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
