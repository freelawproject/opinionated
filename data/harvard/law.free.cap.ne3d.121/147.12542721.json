(\"Wife\") $ 250.00 for attorney fees incurred in moving to compel discovery responses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [4] Husband and Wife (collectively, \"Parties\") were married on August 14, 2004, and had one child, E.B., born September 28, 2008. Until May of 2012, Parties both worked full-time. In May of 2012, Husband was involved in a serious accident at his place of employment. His injuries required surgery and other treatments and left him unable to work for a period of time. During that time, Husband received Worker's Compensation benefits which he used to pay marital expenses, such as the mortgage on the family home. Husband also received over $ 100,000 in life insurance proceeds when his grandfather died in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [5] On March 10, 2017, Wife filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage. Parties had a final dissolution hearing on March 16 and March 23, 2018. On May 4, 2018, the trial court issued \"Findings of Fact, Conclusions[,] and Decree of Dissolution.\" Appealed Order at 1. The trial court ordered that Parties were to have joint legal custody of E.B., with Mother having primary physical custody. Father was granted parenting time pursuant to the Indiana Parenting Time Guidelines, with additional midweek overnight parenting time. In addition, the trial court made the following relevant findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   44. Wife earns approximately $ 54,000/year gross income, or $ 1,038.00/week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   45. Husband currently has no weekly income. He has not worked full-time since a work-related accident in 2012. He has applied for disability and was denied. However, he never applied for disability until August 2017, after the filing of the Petition in this case. By his own admission, Husband has not actively looked for any work that could accommodate him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   46. Wife provides health insurance and dental insurance for [E.B.] at a cost of $ 23.15 per week. Wife shall continuance [sic] to provide health and dental insurance [for E.B.] for so long as it is offered to her through her employment at a reasonable cost.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   47. In May 2012, Husband was involved in a serious forklift accident at work. The accident left Husband severely injured and Husband had to have several surgeries and treatment over the course of nearly three (3) years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   48. Husband requested spousal maintenance pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 31-15-7-2 of $ 2,000/month. According to Husband, he is unable to work. He testified that he suffers from intense pain and swelling in his left leg, and depression. Husband testified that he feels paralyzed from his knee down. He claims [that he is] having difficulty walking or moving around easily.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   49. Doctor Andrew Campbell is Husband's family medical doctor. He has treated Husband since 2011. He described Husband as having a chronic left sciatic nerve lesion due to a remote injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   50. Husband has a history of deep vein thrombosis. However, this is not a current diagnosis and he is not currently having any symptoms of the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   51. Husband is overweight. As of March 2, 2018, Husband weighed over 400 pounds. Any functional limitations are compounded by Husband's weight. Husband sees a weight specialist to address his weight issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   52. Husband takes multiple medications and sees a psychologist for depression. Husband is currently treating with Dr. Mossbarger for depression. Husband has been cooperative in his treatment for depression and his symptoms are being managed by both medicine and therapy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   53. While Husband has expressed some difficulty with getting himself out of bed due to his depression, there was no indication that he is unable to parent [E.B.].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   54. Husband was able to do some work after his injury when he helped Wife work her second job of data entry in 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   55. Husband told the GAL [Guardian ad Litem] that he did not want to apply for disability and that he preferred to work. He further indicated to the GAL that he only needed minor accommodations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   56. Husband has had the exclusive access to and use of over $ 100,000 from his grandfather's life insurance proceeds that is being apportioned to him in the final division of the marital estate. The proceeds were received just before the date of final separation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   57. As of the final hearing, Husband had $ 6,000.00 in savings and $ 1,000.00 in checking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   58. Considering I.C. \u00a7 31-15-7-2, the Court finds Husband's request for permanent spousal disability maintenance should be denied. Husband's request for $ 2,000/month to be paid is wholly unreasonable. [Wife] only makes $ 54,000.00 per year gross income. Husband's request was for Wife to pay him approximately 44% of her gross income. Moreover, the evidence, including his medical records, does not support a finding of a permanent disability preventing Husband from returning to any form of work. Exhibit 40 provides a detailed summary of Husband's progression from being unable to work when he initially went to Ortho Indy on June 6, 2012 to being \"able to return to full duty work status with no restrictions\" as of May 11, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   59. It is appropriate to impute to Husband minimum weekly gross income of $ 290.00 consistent with full-time minimum wage for purposes of child support.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   60. Application of the Child Support Guidelines results in a recommended $ 50.00 per week obligation to be paid by Wife to Husband.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   However, the Court deviates and orders a $ 0.00 child support obligation at this time because Wife will be paying all controlled expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   61. Wife shall be responsible for the first $ 600.00 in annual uninsured healthcare expenses for [E.B.]. The balance shall be split with Wife paying 78% and Husband paying 22%.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   78. Wife requested that Husband be ordered to pay her $ 250 in attorney fees because of a discovery dispute that resulted in Wife filing a Motion for Order Compelling Discovery on June 24, 2017. The Court finds Wife's requested $ 250.00 in expenses reasonable. Therefore, the Court orders Husband to pay Wife $ 250.00 in 30 days from this order for her filing the Motion for Order Compelling Discovery on June 24, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Appealed Order at 6-8, 13. Husband now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Discussion and Decision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Spousal Maintenance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [6] Husband challenges the trial court order denying his request for spousal maintenance.

Vol. V, Ex. 40. The court also noted that Husband admitted that he has \"not actively looked for any work that could accommodate him\" and that he \"only needed minor accommodations\" to work. Appealed Order at 6, 7. Furthermore, the court found that Husband had, in fact, done some work after his injury when he helped Wife with her data entry job. All of that evidence supports the trial court's finding that Husband does not have \"a permanent disability preventing Husband from returning to any kind of work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. And that finding supports the trial court's conclusion that Husband's request for spousal maintenance should be denied.
