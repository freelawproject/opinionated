Mother's first child (who is not a subject of this appeal) was removed from Mother's care in 2006 because the child tested positive for cocaine at birth, and Mother, subsequently, signed a voluntary termination of her parental rights to this child.\n   <em>\n    Tr.

Children were adjudicated to be children in need of services (\"CHINS\") as a result.\n   <em>\n    Tr. Vol. 5\n   </em>\n   at 2-10, 26-30. On July 15, 2009, Children were placed in relative foster care when Mother's substance abuse counselor believed Children were in danger because of Mother's recent relapse.\n   <em>\n    Tr.

Vol. 3\n   </em>\n   at 17. The report also indicated that Children's father (\"Father\") was homeless and receiving supplemental security income for methamphetamine-induced psychosis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DCS met with Mother, who reported that she had overdosed on heroin on June 20, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. On October 13, 2016, DCS met with Grandmother and observed her home to be organized, but that Grandmother's mobility was limited.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. Mother was released from incarceration on October 17, 2016, but DCS was unable to locate her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On November 10, 2016, DCS again went to Grandmother's home and observed the home to be in \"complete disarray\" and found broken glass in one of the beds, along with food items and a lighter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Grandmother told DCS that Mother was visiting Children in the evenings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She also told DCS that M.M. frequently missed school and would often stay with friends in a different town.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A few days later, DCS again met with Grandmother, who disclosed that, during the last meeting, Mother had been hiding in a closet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [5] After doing an assessment, DCS filed a CHINS petition on November 17, 2016, alleging that Mother was unable to meet the needs of Children.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-36. On November 18, Children were removed from Mother's care and placed with maternal grandfather (\"Grandfather\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40. On December 15, 2016, Mother admitted the allegations in the CHINS petition, which the juvenile court accepted, and Children were adjudicated to be CHINS. In its dispositional order, the juvenile court maintained Children's removal and placement outside of Mother's home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68. The juvenile court ordered Mother to do the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) contact the family case manager (\"FCM\") every week to allow FCM to monitor compliance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (2) allow FCM or other service providers to make announced or unannounced visits;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (3) keep all appointments with any service provider or DCS or provide advance notice with a good cause;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (4) sign any releases necessary for FCM to monitor compliance with the order;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (5) maintain suitable, safe, and stable housing with adequate bedding, functional utilities, adequate food;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (6) secure and maintain a legal and stable source of income;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (7) not use, consume, manufacture, trade, distribute or sell any illegal controlled substances, and only take prescription medications for which a valid prescription exists and only in the doses specified in the prescription, and not permit illegal controlled substances in the home or in the presence of Children;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (8) reimburse DCS expenses for services to benefit Children in the amount as established by court order;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (9) complete a parenting assessment and successfully complete all recommendations developed as a result of the assessment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (10) complete a substance abuse assessment and follow all treatments and successfully complete all treatment recommendations developed as a result of the assessment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (11) complete a psychological evaluation as referred and approved by DCS and successfully complete any recommendations that result from the evaluation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (12) meet all personal medical and mental health needs in a timely and complete manner;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (13) meet all the medical and mental health needs of Children in a timely and complete manner; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (14) attend all scheduled visitations with Children and comply with all visitation rules and procedures set forth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [6] On October 30, 2017, DCS filed a petition to terminate Mother's parental rights to Children. On March 22, 2018, the juvenile court set an evidentiary hearing on the petition for June 1, 2018. On May 25, 2018, Mother filed a motion to continue the hearing, stating that she had been recently accepted into a residential program at the YWCA for substance abuse treatment.\n   <em>\n    Appellant's App. Vol. 2\n   </em>\n   at 89. A hearing was held on the motion, where Mother's counsel requested that the juvenile court give Mother \"a chance to work through that program. It may not change any outcome on this particular matter.... I do feel that the continuance would allow ... her to continue to work with me on a defense on this particular matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Tr. Vol. 2\n   </em>\n   at 4. The juvenile court denied the motion to continue, reasoning that Mother was actually asking for more time to remedy the conditions resulting in removal or continued placement outside the home and that such an inquiry was \"the proper subject of the [termination] hearing itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [7] At the June 1, 2018 evidentiary hearing on the petition to terminate Mother's parental rights, the following evidence was presented. Mother had a significant and lengthy history of substance abuse beginning at the age of twelve when she started using cocaine.\n   <em>\n    Tr. Vol. 2\n   </em>\n   at 98. She began using heroin at the age of seventeen and continued to use drugs thereafter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98-100. By July 2016, Mother was using heroin almost daily.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100. Mother also had a criminal history that included a charge of operating a vehicle while intoxicated on June 21, 2016, convictions for unlawful possession of a narcotic drug and possession of a syringe in September 2016, and a conviction for visiting a common nuisance in April 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-52, 101-02. At the time of the hearing, Mother also had a pending charge of conversion for which she had been arrested in March 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [8] FCM David Mickelson (\"FCM Mickelson\") testified as to Mother's contact with him and stated that there \"wasn't a lot [of communication].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44. There were long periods of time where Mother would not communicate at all with him, even when he attempted to contact her every day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44-45. When FCM Mickelson went to Mother's residence for visits, whether announced or unannounced, Mother would not always answer the door, and she did not keep DCS updated as to where she was staying.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-46. Mother canceled several appointments with the court appointed special advocate (\"CASA\") and did not attend a scheduled meeting with FCM Mickelson's supervisor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46. FCM Mickelson testified that Mother missed thirteen of her scheduled supervised visits with Children, and she gave advanced notice of her absence for only five of those missed visits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [9] FCM Mickelson testified that Mother never obtained suitable and safe housing as required under the dispositional order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She never maintained her own housing and, instead, moved frequently, either living in the homes of Grandmother, her boyfriend, or her boyfriend's mother.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46-47. At the time of the termination hearing, Mother was living at the YWCA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47. Likewise, during the pendency of this case, Mother never obtained a stable source of income as required.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Brandon Duke (\"Duke\"), who worked at Lifeline Youth Services, attempted to work with Mother on obtaining stable employment and homemaking services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17, 19-20. Although Mother participated in the intake session, she told Duke that she was not looking for employment because it was too overwhelming, and she wanted to focus on getting Children back and having visitations with them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Duke also attempted to work on budgeting with Mother, but she refused to participate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mother did not engage in any homemaking services after the initial intake session.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [10] Evidence was also presented regarding Mother's substance abuse, which showed that Mother continued to use illegal drugs after the dispositional order was entered. In 2017, she was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated, possession of narcotics, visiting a common nuisance, and unlawful possession of a syringe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49, 51, 101. Mother admitted that she had a problem with using methamphetamine and heroin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56, 101. Throughout the proceedings, Mother submitted to drug screening, and repeatedly tested positive for different substances, including THC, cocaine, methamphetamine, and amphetamines.\n   <em>\n    Tr. Vol. 5\n   </em>\n   at 57-103, 154-92. Between January 11 and March 22, 2018, Mother failed to submit to any drug screens and did not respond when contacted to do so.\n   <em>\n    Tr. Vol. 2\n   </em>\n   at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [11] Mother completed parenting and psychological assessments, but FCM Mickelson testified that she failed to complete the recommendations resulting from those assessments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-54. Gary Robinson, an addictions specialist at The Bowen Center, conducted a substance abuse assessment in November 2017 and diagnosed Mother with Heroin Use Disorder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. He recommended that Mother attend one substance abuse group and one individual session weekly for sixty to ninety days. Mother did not attend any individual sessions and only attended three group sessions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Mother entered into an intensive out-patient program at the Center for Positive Change but was unsuccessfully discharged from the program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54-55. FCM Mickelson testified that Mother had a pattern of starting treatment and then being unsuccessfully discharged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57. Mother went into the residential program at the YWCA in May 2018, just prior to the termination hearing.\n   <em>\n    Appellant's App. Vol. 2\n   </em>\n   at 89. FCM Mickelson was not able to testify with certainty as to whether Mother was meeting her personal medical and mental health needs and was concerned because Mother had been prescribed Suboxone for her heroin addiction, but the drug did not show up on several of her drug screens.\n   <em>\n    Tr. Vol. 2\n   </em>\n   at 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [12] As for visitations with Children, evidence was presented that visitations were originally scheduled two days per week for two hours, and Duke provided Mother with transportation to those visits and supervised them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18. Duke testified that Children had positive interactions with Mother during most of the supervised visits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. Mother attended the visits regularly at first, but she missed a total of thirteen visits out of approximately forty that were scheduled since the CHINS petition was filed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18, 46. After she missed three or four in a row, her visitation services with Duke were cancelled in accordance with the policy that prohibited missing multiple visits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Visitation services were later resumed, but suspended after December 6, 2017, when Mother came to a supervised visit under the influence of alcohol.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [13] Shannon Johnson (\"Johnson\"), Children's therapist, began providing services in December of 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. Johnson testified that M.M. had a history of engaging in self-harm and had cut herself on several occasions and attempted to overdose on Ibuprofen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. Johnson also testified that M.M. recently started drinking alcohol, using marijuana, and having suicidal thoughts and that, at one point, M.M. was walking on railroad tracks because she \"wanted to try to get hit by a train.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. M.M. told Johnson that she had both positive and negative feelings about Mother and that she was aware that Mother came to a visit while intoxicated and had a bottle of alcohol in her purse and that Mother had used drugs in front of her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, 33. Children's CASA testified that, although she had not questioned Children about their relationship with Mother, both Children informed her that they wanted to stay with their grandparents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [14] Both Johnson and the CASA testified that Children were doing well in their current placement and had bonded with their grandparents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34, 92. Other testimony established that L.M. had been participating in gymnastics and making friends at school and that M.M. had a job at McDonald's, and she was proud to be working and making money.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35. Both FCM Mickelson and the CASA testified that termination would be in Children's best interests because Children needed permanency and stability in their lives, which they were getting from living with their grandparents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64, 92-93. DCS's plan for Children was adoption.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [15] At the conclusion of the hearing, the juvenile court took the matter under advisement. On July 19, 2018, it issued its order terminating Mother's parental rights to Children.

She asserts that the juvenile court should have granted her motion because the brief continuance requested would not have prejudiced DCS, but the denial of her motion was prejudicial to her. Mother argues that the approximately twelve months between the commencement of the CHINS case and the filing of the termination petition was not a lengthy amount of time, and a brief continuance would not have caused undue hardship to Children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [18] In\n   <em>\n    Rowlett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8986201\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/841/615/#p619\">\n    841 N.E.2d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , our Supreme Court found that good cause was shown to grant a continuance in order to provide a parent with an opportunity to participate in services offered by DCS that were directed at reunification.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8986201\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/841/615/#p619\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8986201\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/841/615/#p619\">\n    at 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court found the denial of a continuance particularly harsh because the father had successfully participated in numerous programs offered by the correctional facility while he was incarcerated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8986201\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/841/615/#p619\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8986201\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/841/615/#p619\">\n    at 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [19] Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Rowlett\n   </em>\n   , from the time the dispositional order was issued, Mother had the opportunity to participate in, and benefit from, services directed at reunification. However, contrary to her contentions that she \"was able to show some compliance with services,\"\n   <em>\n    Appellant's Br.\n   </em>\n   at 12, Mother failed to take advantage of these services. Accordingly, Mother has failed to demonstrate a \"good cause\" for granting her motion to continue the termination hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [20] Mother argues that she was prejudiced by the denial of her motion to continue because a continuance would give her the opportunity to complete her residential substance abuse program, and she further asserts that the nineteen-month-period of time since the CHINS petition was filed was an insufficient amount of time to prove her ability to parent Children. However, in the time since the CHINS petition was filed, Mother failed to complete any of the services offered by DCS, failed to consistently attend visits with Children, and continued to use illegal drugs and commit criminal offenses. Although she was in a residential treatment program at the time of the termination hearing, Mother did not begin the program until only a few weeks before the termination hearing occurred. At that time, Mother had already had almost one and a half years to participate and complete services, and she failed to do. We conclude that Mother has not shown good cause for granting her motion to continue, nor has she shown prejudice. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Mother's motion to continue the termination hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Sufficient Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [21] As our Supreme Court has observed, \"Decisions to terminate parental rights are among the most difficult our trial courts are called upon to make. They are also among the most fact-sensitive-so we review them with great deference to the trial courts[.]\"\n   <em>\n    E.M. v. Ind.

Mother contends that evidence was presented that she had mostly appropriate behavior during visits with Children and that the juvenile court chose to ignore the positives in her relationship with Children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   [35] A juvenile court need not wait until a child is irreversibly harmed such that his or her physical, mental, and social development is permanently impaired before terminating the parent-child relationship.\n   <em>\n    In re A.K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7188168\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/924/212/#p224\">\n    924 N.E.2d at 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, a child's need for permanency is an important consideration in determining the best interests of a child.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7188168\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/924/212/#p224\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    McBride v.

At the time of the termination hearing, Children had been removed from Mother's care for over one and a half years, and Mother had failed to make the changes in her life necessary to provide Children with a safe and healthy environment. As discussed above, DCS presented sufficient evidence that there was a reasonable probability that Mother would not remedy the reasons for Children's removal from her care. Additionally, the CASA and FCM both testified that they believed termination of Mother's parental rights would be in Children's best interests.\n   <em>\n    Tr. Vol. 2\n   </em>\n   at 64, 92-93. Based upon the totality of the evidence, we conclude that the evidence supported the juvenile court's determination that termination of Mother's parental rights was in Children's best interests. Mother's arguments to the contrary are a request for this court to reweigh the evidence, which we cannot do.\n   <em>\n    In re H.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7207006\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/915/145/#p149\">\n    915 N.E.2d at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   [36] Based on the record before us, we cannot say that the juvenile court's termination of Mother's parental rights to Children was clearly erroneous.
