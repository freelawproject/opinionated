Whether the trial court erred in dismissing Gourley's motion to remove SVP status as barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   II. Whether the statutory scheme that classified Gourley as SVP by operation of law is unconstitutional.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [3] In October 1997, Gourley sexually molested a child. On December 17, 1997, Gourley and the State entered a plea agreement under which Gourley pleaded guilty to child molesting, a Class B felony. On January 23, 1998, the trial court accepted the plea agreement and sentenced Gourley to twenty years in the Department of Correction (\"DOC\"), with three years suspended to probation. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Gourley agreed to be subject to various sex offender stipulations, including a requirement that Gourley would register as a sex offender for a ten-year period following his release from prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [4] The Indiana Sex Offender Registration Act (\"the Act\") is codified at Indiana Code Section 35-38-1-7.5. In 1998, our General Assembly amended the Act to create the SVP status. In 2007, the General Assembly again amended the Act (\"2007 Amendment\") to provide that a person is an SVP, by operation of law, if the person has committed a qualifying offense\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and if the person was released from incarceration, detention, or probation after June 30, 1994. Indiana Code \u00a7 35-38-1-7.5(b) (2007). As to the underlying child molesting conviction, Gourley was released from incarceration well after June 30, 1994.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [5] On the effective date of the 2007 Amendment, by operation of law, Gourley became an SVP, subject to a lifetime sex offender registration requirement. On December 30, 2011, Gourley moved to remove his SVP status in Cause Number 3302-1112-MI-104 (\"MI-104\"). Gourley argued that the 2007 Amendment was unconstitutional as applied to him. Specifically, Gourley alleged that classifying him as an SVP violated the ex post facto clauses of the Indiana Constitution and the U.S. Constitution as well as the separation of powers clause of the Indiana Constitution. After a hearing on April 16, 2012, the Henry County circuit court denied Gourley's motion to remove SVP status in MI-104. Gourley did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [6] On September 20, 2017, Gourley moved to remove SVP status on the same grounds as asserted in MI-104. On December 29, 2017, the State filed a motion to dismiss, asked the trial court to take judicial notice of court records from MI-104, and argued that Gourley's claim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. On February 27, 2018, the trial court found that \"[Gourley]'s claim was ruled upon by this Court in 2012, under cause [MI-104]\" and granted the State's motion to dismiss on res judicata grounds.

As to the first factor of the intent effects test - whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint - our supreme court found that additional restraints imposed on Harris as an SVP \"lean[ed] in favor\" of treating the 2007 amendment as punitive. The court also deemed the second factor - whether the 2007 amendment imposes sanctions that have historically been regarded as punishment - as punitive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 811 (finding that \"the Act has the effect of increasing shame on an offender\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [17] In weighing the third factor - whether the sanction comes into play only on a finding of\n   <em>\n    scienter\n   </em>\n   - our supreme court concluded that the 2007 amendment was not punitive as to Harris because there is no scienter requirement for the offense of child molesting involving sexual intercourse with a child under age fourteen. Next, regarding whether operation of the 2007 amendment promotes the traditional aims of punishment, the court found that Harris was \"in no different position than before the 2007 Amendment,\" given general similarities between an offender being required to register for ten years versus being required to register for life; thus, on this factor, the court concluded that the 2007 amendment was nonpunitive as to Harris.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 812.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   [18] As to the fifth factor - whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime - the court concluded that the 2007 Amendment was nonpunitive as to Harris because child molesting was a registration-triggering offense when Harris committed his crimes. Regarding the sixth factor - whether an alternative purpose to which the 2007 Amendment may rationally be connected is assignable for it - the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   the Act undoubtedly advances a legitimate, regulatory purpose in that it promotes public safety. To be sure, we have recognized that \"registration systems are a legitimate way to protect the public from repeat offenders.\" This factor clearly favors treating the effects of the Act as nonpunitive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 812 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [19] As to the final factor - whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned - the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, and most importantly, as applied to Harris, the Act's requirements are not excessive in relation to its legitimate, regulatory purpose. [M]any of the Act's registration and disclosure requirements were in place and applied to Harris at the time he committed his offense and at the time he pled guilty to child molesting, well before the 2007 Amendment. Further, like the 2006 Amendment, the 2007 Amendment provides that in ten years from the date of his release from prison-the time frame in which Harris was originally required to register-he may petition the court \"to consider whether [he] should no longer be considered [an SVP].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-38-1-7\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38-1-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .5(g) (Supp. 2007). And, under the 2007 Amendment, the court at that point may determine if Harris presents a future threat-i.e., \"suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes [him] likely to repeatedly commit a sex offense,\" I.C. \u00a7 35-38-1-7.5(a) -after consulting with two psychologists or psychiatrists who have expertise in criminal behavioral disorders. I.C. \u00a7 35-38-1-7.5(g). As we read the 2007 Amendment, if he is not an SVP under this standard, then he no longer has to register as one and his lifetime-registration requirement terminates. But if he is, then the Act requires him to continue to register; he can petition the court again to determine his SVP status in another year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-38-1-7\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   It is clear to us that this provision of the 2007 Amendment advances the Act's legitimate regulatory purpose of public safety-by its terms, only those people who present a future threat are required to register for their lifetimes.

Appellant's Br. p. 11. Citing\n   <em>\n    Goldsberry v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9018004\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/821/447/\">\n    821 N.E.2d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ind. Ct. App. 2005), Gourley contends that (1) because the 2007 Amendment provides that it is an act to amend the Indiana Code concerning criminal law and procedure\"; and because (2) the 2007 Amendment is found in Title 35 of the Indiana Code, the legislature must have intended the 2007 Amendment to be a criminal punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [22] The instant case is much akin to\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   - decided five years after\n   <em>\n    Goldsberry\n   </em>\n   - employed a more detailed intents-effects test than\n   <em>\n    Goldsberry\n   </em>\n   by weighing the above-stated seven factors in determining \"whether the effects of applying the regulatory scheme embodied in the 2007 Amendment [we]re punitive\" as to the offender.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7152387\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/949/803/\">\n    949 N.E.2d at 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [23] Applying the seven factors here to determine whether the 2007 Amendment has a punitive effect as applied to Gourley, we reach the same conclusion as did the\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   court. As to the\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   factor, we find that SVP status imposes additional restraints that warrant treating the 2007 amendment as punitive. Regarding the\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   factor, we find that publicly disseminated and searchable registration leans in favor of a punitive finding. The\n   <em>\n    third\n   </em>\n   factor is nonpunitive because, under the statutory scheme in effect at the time of Gourley's conviction, no scienter requirement existed for the offense of child molesting, a Class B felony, involving sexual intercourse with a child under age fourteen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-42-4-3\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 35-42-4-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [24] The\n   <em>\n    fourth\n   </em>\n   factor is also nonpunitive because, no matter the duration of the reporting obligation, sex offenders who are required to register for a prescribed period are largely similarly-situated. Likewise, the\n   <em>\n    fifth\n   </em>\n   factor is nonpunitive; Gourley was already required to register because his conduct was criminal before the 2007 Amendment. Regarding the sixth factor, we readily find that registration systems serve a legitimate, regulatory purpose in promoting public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   [25] As to the\n   <em>\n    final\n   </em>\n   and most significant factor, we deem it nonpunitive, given the potential to have one's SVP status removed. Stated differently, if a court, in consultation with criminal behavior specialists, determines that Gourley's SVP status should be removed, his lifetime reporting requirement shall terminate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   [26] Based on the foregoing, four of the seven factors lean in favor of the 2007 Amendment having a nonpunitive effect as applied to Gourley. We, therefore, conclude that the 2007 Amendment is not an unconstitutional ex post facto law as applied to Gourley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Further, the supreme court held that the \"by operation of law\" clause actually \"preserves the judiciary's role in determining the status of offenders and their likelihood to reoffend\" by \"leav[ing] to the courts ... the power to determine [upon the SVP offender's petition] the status of offenders and their likelihood of recidivism.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7152387\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/949/803/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7152387\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/949/803/\">\n    at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   [31] Guided by\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the \"by operation of law\" provision of the 2007 Amendment does not violate the separation of powers clause of the Indiana Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   [32] The trial court did not err in granting the State's motion to dismiss on res judicata grounds.
