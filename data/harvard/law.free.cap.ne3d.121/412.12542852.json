PARHAM, Defendant-Appellant.\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  No. 16AP-826\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Court of Appeals of Ohio, Tenth District, Franklin County.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  Rendered on February 5, 2019\n </decisiondate>\n <p id=\"p-5\">\n  DECISION\n </p>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-6\">\n   KLATT, P.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Clemon D. Parham, appeals a judgment of the Franklin\n   County Court of Common Pleas that sentenced him to 18 years to life imprisonment for aggravated robbery and felony murder. For the following reasons, we affirm that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In this case, the state tried Parham for offenses arising from two separate incidents: (1) the robbery and beating death of Kevin Connal, and (2) the kidnapping and shooting death of Jermaine Hill. The jury found Parham guilty of the offenses arising out of the robbery and death of Connal; it found Parham not guilty of the offenses arising out of the kidnapping and death of Hill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The state primarily relied on three witnesses, all former friends of Parham, to prove Parham's involvement in Connal's death. One of those witnesses, Antoine Dotson, admitted to participating in the robbery and killing of Connal. The other two witnesses, Quentin Brown and Gregory Dunson, testified as to what Parham had told them about the crime. All three men testified in order to obtain favorable treatment when sentenced for the criminal charges pending against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Connal was a Florida-based concert promoter who convinced Parham to invest approximately $ 100,000 in a concert series to occur over the Memorial Day weekend in 2011. Dotson, Dunson, and a third friend, Alex Daniels, all testified that the concert series flopped, and Parham lost his entire investment. According to Dunson, Parham lured Connal to Columbus with the intent to recover his money or, if that failed, to kill Connal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Connal flew to Columbus on the afternoon of August 19, 2011, and Parham met him at the airport. Dotson testified that sometime that same afternoon, Parham called him and asked him to rob Connal. Dotson agreed. When Parham picked Dotson up that evening, he had with him Connal and Martin Wallington, another of Parham's friends. Dotson sat next to Connal in the back seat of Parham's car while Parham drove to a remote area of the Bexley Woods Apartments' parking lot. When Parham stopped the car, Dotson pulled a gun and ordered Connal out of the car. Dotson forced Connal to strip, and he took a credit card and cash from Connal's pants pockets. At that point, Parham and Wallington started punching Connal. Connal fell to the ground unconscious, so Dotson kicked him to get him back up. When Connal rose, Parham began punching Connal again and repeatedly asking where his money was. Connal fell twice more during the beating. The third time he fell, Parham jumped on his head twice with both feet. Eventually, Parham, Dotson, and Wallington returned to Parham's car and drove away. They left Connal, unconscious and bleeding, lying naked in the parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Later that night, Brown, one of Parham's friends, received a text from Parham asking Brown to come see him. After Brown finished work at 2:00 a.m. on August 20, 2011, he met with Parham. Parham drove Brown to where Connal lay in the parking lot of the Bexley Woods Apartments. Parham told Brown that the dead man was the \"[d]ude from Florida\" and he did not intend for Connal to die. (Tr. Vol. VI at 53.) Later, Parham told Brown that Wallington and Dotson were involved in Connal's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Another of Parham's friends, Dunson, testified that Parham disclosed to him how Connal's death occurred. According to Dunson, Parham said that he \"drove [Connal] out towards Bexley Woods, got him out of the car, and they proceeded to beat him, * * * [and] all three of them, Martin [Wallington], [Parham], and [Dotson], were just beating him, kicking him, punching him, and that at the end [Dotson] took a rock and hit [Connal].\" (Tr. Vol. VIII at\n   48.) Parham also told Dunson that Dotson \"took the guy's pants and his wallet and credit cards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Parham testified and denied any participation in Connal's death. Parham stated that he was playing video games at his home when Wallington arrived and announced that there was a problem. Wallington then drove him to the Bexley Woods Apartments, where he saw Connal's body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Connal's body was discovered around 7:00 a.m. on August 20, 2011 in the Bexley Woods Apartment's parking lot. The medical examiner ruled Connal's death a homicide caused by blunt force trauma to the head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 10} To prove Hill's kidnapping and murder, the state primarily relied on the testimony of Dunson, who related to the jury what Parham had told him about Hill and his death. According to Dunson, Parham traveled to Atlanta to purchase a kilogram of powder cocaine from Hill. Because the cocaine was heavily diluted, Parham had difficulty selling it and lost money. Parham enticed Hill to fly to Columbus with the promise of purchasing more drugs. Dunson testified that Parham \"told [him] that he ordered Martin [Wallington] to shoot [Hill]. He said Martin shot him several times. He said he had Martin shoot him, because Martin is the one who connected him with the guy. So he wasn't going to do it, but Martin was, and he was there with him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Hill was found shot to death in the basement of an abandoned house. Parham denied any involvement in Hill's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 12} After hearing all the evidence, the jury only found Parham guilty of the two offenses committed against Connal: (1) aggravated robbery, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(3), and (2) felony murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B). In a judgment dated November 2, 2016, the trial court sentenced Parham to three years imprisonment for aggravated robbery and 15 years to life imprisonment for felony murder. The trial court ordered that Parham serve each prison term consecutively, for an aggregate sentence of 18 years to life imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Parham now appeals the November 2, 2016 judgment, and he assigns the following errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. Appellant was deprived of his due process right to a fair trial in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, as a consequence of the trial court's joinder of appellant's two indictments for purposes of conducting a single trial of separate and [unrelated] offenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. Appellant was deprived of his due process right to a fair trial in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, as a consequence of the state's prosecutorial misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3. The trial court erred when it admitted expert opinion testimony and expert reports, in violation of Rule 702 of the Ohio Rules of Evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   4. The trial court erred when it permitted the state to place in evidence, as admissions of a party opponent, the unauthorized and inaccurate hearsay statements made by Appellant's prior attorney during his bond hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   5. The trial court erred when it failed to merge, for purposes of sentencing, appellant's convictions for Aggravated Robbery and Felony Murder arising from the same conduct and with the same animus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} By his first assignment of error, Parham argues that the trial court erred in joining for trial the counts against him arising from Connal's death with the counts against him arising from Hill's death. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Originally, the indictment in this case charged both Parham and Dotson with aggravated robbery and aggravated murder with respect to Connal. In a separate indictment, the state also charged Wallington with aggravated robbery and aggravated murder with respect to Connal. Finally, a third indictment charged Parham and Wallington with kidnapping and aggravated murder with respect to Hill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The state moved to join all three indictments so all three defendants would be tried together for all the offenses allegedly committed against Connal and Hill. Parham opposed that motion and, additionally, moved to sever his trial from Dotson's trial. After an omnibus hearing on the motions, the trial court determined that all defendants would receive separate trials, but Parham and Wallington would each face all charges against them as to both Connal and Hill in their respective trials. Parham later sought reconsideration of this decision, arguing that trial of the offenses he allegedly committed against Connal should be separated from trial of the offenses he allegedly committed against Hill. The trial court denied that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} A trial court has the authority to join two indictments for a consolidated trial pursuant to Crim.R. 13. That rule states, \"The court may order two or more indictments * * * to be tried together, if the offenses or the defendants could have been joined in a single indictment.\" Crim.R. 8(A) describes the circumstances under which multiple offenses may be joined in a single indictment. Under that rule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [t]wo or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment, * * * in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged, whether felonies or misdemeanors or both, are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a course of criminal conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} \" 'The law favors joining multiple criminal offenses in a single trial.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, even if Crim.R. 8(A) and 13 sanction the joinder of indictments for trial, a trial court should nevertheless order separate trials pursuant to Crim.R. 14 if the defendant establishes that joinder prejudices him or her.\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. Importantly, in order to obtain severance under Crim.R. 14, the defendant \"has the burden of furnishing the trial court with sufficient information so that it can weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's right to a fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, it may counteract the alleged prejudice by showing that it could introduce evidence of the joined offenses as \"other acts\" under Evid.R. 404(B) if separate trials occurred.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, however, that standard does not apply because Parham failed to properly preserve his Crim.R. 8(A) and 14 arguments. With regard to Crim.R. 8(A), Parham did not oppose the state's motion to join on the basis that the state could not prove a Crim.R. 8(A) ground for joinder. Parham, instead, argued that Crim.R. 14 barred the trial court from joining the offenses against him because joinder would prejudice him. Given Parham's failure to raise an argument based on Crim.R. 8(A) in the trial court, we must review Parham's challenge to the joinder of the indictments for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, the trial court did not err, much less commit plain error, in denying Parham's motions for severance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 28} In short, we find no error in the trial court's joinder of the two indictments against Parham or the court's denial of Parham's motions for severance. Accordingly, we overrule Parham's first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 29} We next address Parham's third assignment of error, by which he argues that the trial court erred in admitting Detective Robert Moledor's expert testimony and report into evidence. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 30} At the time of trial, Moledor was a police officer with the Columbus Division of Police assigned to the Federal Bureau\n   of Investigation's (\"FBI\") Columbus Metro Violent Crimes Task Force. Moledor was also a member of the FBI's Cellular Analysis Survey Team (\"CAST\"). For this case, Moledor conducted a historical cell-site analysis, in which he used call detail records from cell phones and the locations of cell towers to approximate certain cell phones' locations at particular times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 31} As Moledor explained, cell phones work by communicating via radio frequency with cell towers, also known as cell sites, operated by cell-phone service providers. When a cell-phone user makes a call or sends a text, the phone generally connects with the cell tower with the strongest, clearest signal. Most of the time, that signal will come from the tower closest to the phone because the strength of radio frequency diminishes with distance. However, a phone may connect to a tower farther away if the closest tower's signal is weakened due to obstructions, both natural and man-made; the height of the tower; wattage output; antennae angle and direction; the number of phones connected to the tower; and other factors. Although a phone may connect to a tower further afield than the closest tower, a phone cannot connect to a tower if it is outside of the range of the tower's signal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Generally, each cell tower has a 360-degree coverage area broken into three 120-degree sectors. Each sector is oriented to transmit radio frequency in a particular direction. For a variety of reasons, cell towers in urban areas generally have much smaller coverage areas than cell towers in rural areas. In the fall of 2010, Moledor and another CAST member conducted a drive test in Columbus to determine the coverage area of various cell-tower sectors. Based on the results of a drive test, the approximate geographical coverage area for a sector was three-quarters of a mile to one mile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Each time a cell phone connects with the network the cell-phone service provider retains a record of which cell tower and cell-tower sector the phone connected with at the beginning and end of the call. This record, called a call detail record, also includes the phone numbers of the phones involved in the communication, the date and time of the call, and the duration of the call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Moledor collected the call detail records for cell phones owned by Parham, Connal, and Dotson for August 19 and 20, 2011. Moledor then used the information in the call detail records to plot on maps the locations of the cell towers the phones connected with. Moledor explained to the jury that the phones at issue were in the general vicinity of the designated towers at the times the phones connected with the towers. The prosecutor used Moledor's testimony to argue that the movements of Parham's phone on August 19 and 20, 2011 corresponded with Dotson's and Brown's testimony regarding Parham's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Prior to trial, Parham filed a motion in limine to exclude Moledor's testimony. After a hearing, the trial court denied the motion. The trial court also overruled Parham's objection to the introduction of Moledor's report at trial. Parham now argues on appeal that the trial court erred in admitting Moledor's expert testimony and report because Moledor's opinions are based on an unreliable methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Trial courts have broad discretion in determining the admissibility of expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, we overrule Parham's third assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 46} By Parham's fourth assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred in allowing the State to question him regarding a statement his former attorney made during a bond hearing.

At the hearing on the motion, Rutan argued for lower bail on the basis that the facts did not support a charge of premeditated murder. In summarizing the facts for the trial court, Rutan stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   In fact, what happened is the victim came to Ohio to meet with Mr. Parham, to go to clubs, to do things of that nature. During the day, they hung out, going around and this, that, and other, here's this place, here's this bar.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Around 11:00 at night, Mr. Parham is driving. One of the codefendants is in the front seat; the victim is in the back, and he pulls in his neighborhood. During this time, he runs into this Mr. Dotson guy, the culprit. He hops in the car. Where are you going to go?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Oh, we're going to go to the codefendant's girlfriend's.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   That's why the body was found in that neighborhood, not because it was an elaborate plan. What happens, as they are driving there, Mr. Dotson decides to overreact. That guy -- that guy took 40 grand, 50 grand, whatever. Ah, hell, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Pulls out a weapon, starts beating.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Parham[:] uh-oh, what's the hell this guy doing with a gun? Doesn't realize at the time the guy was beaten to death * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [I]t's not murder, just because you don't stop a crime from happening. He may not be the best human being in the world, but that doesn't justify a million dollar, two million dollar bail. The reality of it is he didn't commit murder. He didn't commit premeditated murder. Does he have knowledge about the incident? Yes. Was he present? Sadly. But the bottom line is, was he the one initiating it? Starting it? It makes no sense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (Apr. 15, 2014 Hearing Tr. at 5-6.) After the bond hearing, Parham fired Rutan and obtained different representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 48} At trial, Parham testified that he was not present when Connal was beaten to death. Upon hearing that testimony, the state informed the trial court and defense counsel that it intended to cross-examine Parham regarding the statement his former attorney had made during the bond hearing. Parham's counsel objected, arguing that the statement was inadmissible hearsay. The state responded that the statement fell within the exception to hearsay contained in Evid.R. 801(D)(2) because it constituted an admission by a party-opponent. The trial court overruled Parham's objection and permitted the state to proceed with its questioning. The state's\n   attorney then asked Parham, \"[D]id your attorney, on your behalf, tell the court that you were present at the place and time of the Kevin Connal beating and subsequent homicide?\" (Tr. Vol. X at 274.) Parham answered, \"I believe he said something along those lines.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525408\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/312/493/#p502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 49} \" 'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Evid.R. 801(C).

Rutan made the statement in the course of arguing that the trial court should reduce Parham's bond. The statement, therefore, is a statement\n   by Parham's agent concerning a matter within the scope of the agency, made during the existence of the agency relationship. Thus, the trial court did not err in permitting the state's attorney to cross-examine Parham regarding Rutan's statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 53} In arguing to the contrary, Parham contends that Rutan did not have authority to admit to Parham's liability.

Parham authorized Rutan to represent him at the bond hearing and advocate for a lower bail amount. Rutan made the disputed statement trying to convince the trial court to reduce Parham's bail. While Rutan's argument failed, the factual statements he made related to that argument. Consequently, Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(d) exempts Rutan's statement from the hearsay prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Finally, Parham maintains that Rutan's statement is inadmissible because it is protected by the attorney-client privilege. We reject this argument because the record does not support that Rutan relied on any communication from his client when stating that Parham was present when Connal was beaten. During his trial testimony, Parham denied telling Rutan that he was present. Rutan testified that he could not recall how he learned of Parham's presence, but it was not from Parham. Thus, the attorney-client privilege is inapplicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 56} In sum, we find no error in trial court's decision to allow the state to question Parham regarding Rutan's statement.

Parham primarily attacks the prosecutor's questioning of Aaliyah Dunson, Gregory Dunson's ex-wife. In 2011, Aaliyah Dunson overheard Parham and Dunson discussing a murder. Under direct-examination, Aaliyah Dunson testified that she heard Parham tell Dunson about \"a gentleman who they had beat to death and left naked or half-naked in\n   the apartment complex parking lot.\" (Tr.

However, we cannot fault the prosecutor here. Aaliyah Dunson testified that she could not recall if Parham said he committed the murder, but she also testified that Parham was talking like someone involved in the murder. It appears that, in the heat of trial, the prosecutor construed the latter testimony as negating the former testimony. The prosecutor was mistaken: speaking in a manner that causes a listener to surmise the speaker was involved in a murder does not equate to an admission of involvement\n   in the murder.

(Appellant's Brief at 36.) Parham also complains that the prosecutor offered to assist Dunson in obtaining court-appointed counsel after she discovered that Dunson had run out of funds to pay his attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   {\u00b6 66} During the trial, Dunson stayed in a hotel because he had moved out of state. The prosecutor picked Dunson up from his hotel and drove him to a Wendy's restaurant, where the prosecutor and Dunson discussed the matters Dunson intended to testify about at trial. A few days later, the prosecutor again picked Dunson up from his hotel and drove him to her office so she could prepare Dunson for trial. On the return trip to Dunson's hotel, the prosecutor stopped so Dunson could purchase pizza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   {\u00b6 67} While preparing Dunson for trial, the prosecutor played for Dunson a surveillance video showing Hill getting into a\n   car at the Columbus airport and the car driving away. The car in the video matched a car Dunson previously owned in color, make, and model. Consequently, the prosecutor wanted Dunson to observe the car and note any differences between his car and the car in the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 68} \"A prosecutor is free to prepare witnesses and review their expected testimony with them.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, there is no evidence that the prosecutor did anything untoward during her preparation of Dunson to take the stand. In fact, given the state of this record, defense counsel's accusations that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct during witness preparation are, at the very least, troubling to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 69} Parham next claims that the prosecutor \"improperly attacked a defense witness.\" (Appellant's Brief at 36.) This claim appears to arise out of the testimony of Steven Simons, Jr., a witness the state originally intended to call, but did not, because he told the prosecutor he did not make a statement attributed to him in an interview summary. According to Simons, the prosecutor became angry with him when he told her he never said that he saw Parham driving the car that dropped off Dotson on the night Connal died. Simons alleged that, in retaliation, the prosecutor detained him in a conference room for approximately one hour and may have instigated the revocation of his probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b6 70} Regardless of the propriety of the prosecutor's alleged actions, they did not intimidate Simons. At trial, defense counsel called Simons to the stand, and he testified that he did not see the driver of the car Dotson exited on the night of Connal's beating. Consequently, no prejudice to Parham arose from the prosecutor's alleged treatment of Simons. In fact, Parham arguably benefitted from the incident, because his counsel used Simons' story to vilify the prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Next, Parham argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct when she questioned him regarding his former attorney's statement that he was present at Connal's murder.

Because the trial court admitted the statement in issue into evidence, the prosecutor's questioning about that statement does not amount to prosecutorial misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Parham also argues that the prosecutor lacked a good faith basis to question him about his former attorney's statement. \"A cross-examiner may ask a question if the examiner has a good-faith belief that a factual predicate for the question exists.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

As we explained above, this statement mischaracterizes Dunson's testimony. However, appellate courts \"view the state's closing argument in is entirety to determine whether the allegedly improper remarks\n   were prejudicial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The prosecutor referred to Aaliyah Dunson's testimony only once during the closing argument, so the prosecutor's improper statement did not so permeate the state's closing that it denied Parham a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 74} We also note that Aaliyah Dunson's actual testimony-that Parham talked about Connal's murder like someone involved in the murder-is consistent with her ex-husband's testimony. Gregory Dunson confirmed that Parham admitted to his involvement in Connal's murder during the conversation Aaliyah Dunson overheard. Thus, even without the prosecutor's mischaracterization of Aaliyah Dunson's testimony, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have convicted Parham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 75} In sum, we conclude that, despite any alleged prosecutorial misconduct that occurred, Parham received a fair trial. Accordingly, we overrule Parham's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   {\u00b6 76} By Parham's fifth assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred in not merging his convictions for aggravated robbery and felony murder.

Thus, a defendant may be convicted and sentenced for multiple offenses if: (1) the offenses are dissimilar in import or significance, i.e., each offense caused a separate, identifiable harm; (2) the offenses were committed separately; or (3) the offenses were committed with separate animus or motivation.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , the defendant pointed a gun at the victim and demanded his belongings, and then shot the victim when he told the defendant to stop playing with the gun. We upheld separate sentencing for both offenses, stating that, \"[a]s the act of shooting [the victim] was an additional act of force well in excess of that necessary to commit the robbery, the intent to kill was separate from the intent to commit the robbery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   {\u00b6 80} Here, Dotson pointed a gun at Connal and forced him to strip and surrender his belongings.

However, the three men continued to beat Connal, leading to the coup de grace-the two stomps to Connal's head. Given these circumstances, the trial court could infer that Parham's immediate motivation changed over the course of the crime from robbery to causing Connal grave, life-threatening injury. Because the trial court could conclude that Parham committed aggravated robbery and felony murder with separate animus, the trial court could sentence Parham for both offenses.

If the judge grants relief at that point, there is a serious Double Jeopardy issue presented. The State may lose the opportunity to pursue either murder charge because the State insisted on a joint trial which proved to be an unfair trial. Again, an appellate court affirming the results of an unfair trial because defense counsel did not renew the motion for relief from joinder case looks like an appellate court searching for a reason to affirm a conviction, not trying to assure that an accused had a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   {\u00b6 86} I also strongly disagree with the State using statements made by a former criminal defense counsel at a bond hearing as evidence in the actual trial of the criminal charges. I note that the defense counsel was fired immediately after the hearing on the issue of bond reduction. A criminal defendant cannot be expected to stand up and yell \"that is wrong\" when his or her lawyer says something wrong or not in the client's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   {\u00b6 87} A layperson, especially a criminal defendant, has no control over what his or her lawyer says in open court. To suggest that a person with perhaps a minimal IQ and very limited knowledge of the law and court procedure controls what his or her lawyer says before a judge in open court is to make a suggestion which demonstrates an astonishing lack of reality of criminal trials and criminal defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   {\u00b6 88} I would sustain the fourth assignment of error. Because the majority of this panel does not, I dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
