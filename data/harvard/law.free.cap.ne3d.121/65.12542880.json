Wildcat appeals the trial court's award of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On December 19, 2014, Discovery and Wildcat entered into a contract. Discovery hired Wildcat to drill the J. Klick # 2 well (the well) in Stark County, Ohio. In return, Discovery agreed to pay Wildcat $13.85 per foot drilled and $11,000.00 per day of work on the well. The drilling was to commence on December 31, 2014. Pursuant to the contract, Discovery was required to pay any invoices submitted by Wildcat within ten days. If Discovery disputed any item on any invoice, it was required to notify Wildcat about the dispute within five days of receiving the invoice. In addition, the contract specified that Discovery was required to timely pay any undisputed portion of the invoice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The contract contained multiple indemnification clauses. One such clause, section 17.9.1 of the contract, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [Wildcat] shall assume full responsibility for and shall defend, indemnify, and hold [Discovery] and its joint owners harmless from and against any loss, damage, expense, claim, fine and penalty, demand, or liability for pollution or contamination, including control and removal thereof, that originates on or above the surface of the land or water from spills, leaks, or discharges of motor fuels, lubricants, and oils; pipe dope; paints and solvents; ballast, bilge, sludge, and garbage; and other liquids or solids in possession and control of [Wildcat]. These obligations are assumed\n   without regard to the negligence of any party or parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Complaint Exhibit A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Wildcat completed drilling the well. On February 13, 2015, Wildcat sent Discovery an invoice for the drilling services provided. The invoice charged Discovery $190,350.37. At no point did Discovery pay any portion of the invoice amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The reason Discovery did not pay was because it was fined by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) for Wildcat's drilling practices. On January 7, 2015, an inspector from the ODNR was on the site where Wildcat was drilling the well. The inspector tested the water on the well site and determined that Wildcat was illegally using brine water in its drilling operation. Discovery was fined by the ODNR for Wildcat's supposed use of brine water while drilling the surface casing. The ODNR issued a compliance notice to Discovery and Discovery paid $50,000.00 in fines for the brine water issue. Discovery paid the ODNR in March of 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} After Discovery paid the ODNR fine, Discovery requested that Wildcat indemnify it fully for the fine. Wildcat refused. In return, Discovery refused to pay any portion of the invoice until Wildcat agreed to fully indemnify it for the ODNR fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Wildcat brought an action against Discovery asserting a breach of contract claim. Wildcat's claim is based on the fact that Discovery never timely paid the invoice. Discovery filed a counterclaim asserting breach of contract and a claim for civil liability for criminal conduct. Discovery's breach of contract claim was based on the fact that Wildcat refused to indemnify Discovery for the ODNR fine. Discovery's civil liability for criminal conduct claim stemmed from Wildcat's usage of brine water while drilling the surface casing of the well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} After discovery was completed, Discovery filed a motion for partial summary judgment and Wildcat filed a motion for summary judgment. Discovery's motion sought summary judgment on liability only and requested a separate hearing on damages. Discovery argued that Wildcat breached the contract by using brine water during its drilling process, which is a crime under Ohio law. Discovery also argued that Wildcat breached the contract when it failed to later indemnify Discovery pursuant to section 17.9.1 for the fine Discovery paid to the ODNR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Wildcat's motion argued that Discovery breached the contract when it did not timely pay or timely dispute any portion of the invoice. Wildcat also argued that it was unaware of any fine issued by the ODNR for its practices and should not be required to indemnify Discovery for a fine based on an alleged offense that Wildcat could not challenge or defend against.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court granted both parties' motions for summary judgment finding that both parties were in breach of the contract. The trial court found that Discovery was in breach for not timely paying the invoice and Wildcat was in breach for not indemnifying Discovery for the ODNR fine. The trial court ordered Discovery to pay Wildcat $190,350.37 less the $50,000.00 fine and expenses of $14,150.09 that Discovery incurred as a result of the fine. This came to a total of $126,200.28 that Discovery was to pay Wildcat. The trial court also ordered Discovery to pay prejudgment interest starting from February 23, 2015. Discovery timely filed this appeal on February 6, 2017. Wildcat cross appealed. Discovery now raises four assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Discovery's first assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN AWARDING WILDCAT PREJUDGMENT INTEREST.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Discovery makes three arguments pertaining to this assignment of error. First, Discovery argues that prejudgment interest was inappropriate due to a good faith dispute regarding the indemnification issue. Second, Discovery argues that Wildcat is not entitled to prejudgment interest because it is not an \"aggrieved party\" under R.C. 1347.03. Third, Discovery argues, in the alternative, that the trial court's award of 18% prejudgment interest is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} An appellate court reviews a trial court's summary judgment decision de novo, applying the same standard used by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Ohio Govt.

In\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   , the Eighth District held that an award of prejudgment interest is not appropriate where \"liability was in dispute and the amount of potential liability was not readily ascertainable because allowance of a setoff was disputed by the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 405,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=624%20N.E.2d%20784\">\n    624 N.E.2d 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Discovery argues that this entire litigation concerns whether Discovery was entitled to indemnification\n   and a setoff against Wildcat's invoice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In response, Wildcat cites article 5 of the contract. Article 5 states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [Discovery] shall pay all invoices within ten (10) days after the receiving of an invoice. If [Discovery] disputes an invoice or any part thereof, [Discovery] shall, within five days of receiving an invoice, notify [Wildcat] of the disputed item, specifying the reason therefore, and payment of the disputed item may be withheld until resolution of the dispute. But timely payment shall be made on the undisputed portion of all invoices. Any sums * * * not paid within the above specified time shall bear interest at the rate of 18 percent per annum, or the maximum legal rate, whichever is higher, from the date due until paid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Complaint, Exhibit A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Wildcat argues that the interest the trial court ordered Discovery to pay was the interest that was stated in the contract, 18 percent per annum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 20} R.C. 1343.03(A) provides when money becomes due and payable upon, among other items, \"other instrument of writing,\" the creditor is entitled to the federal short term rate of interest unless a contract provides for a different rate of interest. If a contract does specify a rate of interest, the creditor is entitled to the rate of interest expressed in the contract. The contract states that Wildcat was entitled to 18 percent interest per annum on any balance that was not timely paid. Because of the interest provision in the contract, appellant's first argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Addressing Discovery's aggrieved party argument, Discovery argues that because Wildcat breached the contract first by not indemnifying Discovery for the ODNR fine, Wildcat is not an \"aggrieved party\" entitled to prejudgment interest. Discovery relies on two cases for this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The first case is the Eleventh District's decision in\n   <em>\n    Gray v.

The Grays terminated Petronelli from the job due to Petronelli's deviations from the construction plans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4-6. After a trial, the trial court awarded Petronelli $6,323.08.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Petronelli appealed arguing, among other things, that he was entitled to prejudgment interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51-53. The Eleventh District held that because Petronelli breached the contract, Petronelli was not entitled to prejudgment interest and was only entitled to the quantum meruit amount the trial court ordered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56-57. But the contracts in this case do not include anything about interest on unpaid sums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The second case is\n   <em>\n    Protek, Ltd. v.

Moreover, as previously stated, the contract did provide for Wildcat to receive 18 percent interest on any unpaid sums. This is what the trial court awarded. As such, Discovery's second argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Addressing Discovery's argument that 18 percent interest is inappropriate, Discovery argues that the trial court's judgment entry did not specify what rate of interest Wildcat is entitled to. Discovery also argues that it was entitled to withhold any disputed amounts under the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Article 5 of the contract specifically provides that Wildcat is entitled to 18 percent interest on all unpaid sums. It also provides that \"[i]f [Discovery] disputes an invoice or any part thereof, [Discovery] shall, within five days of receiving an invoice, notify [Wildcat] of the disputed item, specifying the reason therefore, and payment of the disputed item may be withheld until resolution of the dispute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Discovery's argument in summation is that the entire amount of the invoice is essentially disputed because the issue of brine water contaminating the ground water could potentially subject Discovery to future damages. With future damages that Discovery may be subject to being unascertainable, the entire invoice is essentially in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 30} This argument lacks merit. Article five required Discovery to dispute any portion of the invoice within five days of receiving the invoice. According to the affidavit of Richard Liddle, a Wildcat employee, Wildcat did not receive any notice about disputes regarding the invoice until April 23, 2015. (Aff. of R. Liddle \u00b6 J). As the invoice is dated February 13, 2015, disputes should have been conveyed to Wildcat by February 18, 2015. Furthermore, Michael Ellenis, Discovery's vice president of operations, testified that he had no knowledge of anyone from Discovery contacting Wildcat about the brine issue until two or three months after the ODNR inspection on January 7, 2015. (Dep. of M.
