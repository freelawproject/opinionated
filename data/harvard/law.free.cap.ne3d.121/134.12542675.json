Qadir asserts that the trial court committed fundamental error in admitting evidence seized after what he claims was an unconstitutional traffic stop. Because Qadir has failed to establish any error, let alone fundamental error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [2] The facts most favorable to Qadir's conviction are that Howard County and federal law enforcement authorities were investigating drug activity involving Reggie Balentine in early 2018. Balentine's associates included Michael O'Bannon in Kokomo and Pierre Riley in Atlanta, Georgia. In February 2018, federal authorities began tapping Balentine's and Riley's phones. Around that time, a confidential police informant involved in the investigation expressed concern for his safety. Police recorded phone conversations regarding a murder-for-hire plot involving Balentine, O'Bannon, and Riley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [3] On March 2, 2018, Kokomo Police Department Detective Derek Root was informed that O'Bannon would be at Balentine's house. Detective Root surveilled the residence and saw O'Bannon drive away in a Chevy Impala. The detective followed O'Bannon and saw him park in a Quality Inn hotel lot. A Kia with Georgia plates and two occupants - later identified as Qadir and Jamil Williamson - parked nearby. O'Bannon and one of the men in the Kia got out of their vehicles and talked in the parking lot. Eventually, all three men got into the Impala and drove away. Detective Root followed and saw the Impala go in front of and then behind the confidential informant's residence. The Impala stopped briefly, went past the residence again, and headed to a fast-food restaurant near the Quality Inn, where it remained for roughly thirty minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [4] Detective Root contacted Kokomo Police Department Officer Chad Vancamp and asked him to conduct a traffic stop of the Impala when it left the restaurant. The detective followed the Impala out of the parking lot onto State Road 931 and notified Officer Vancamp that it was traveling fifty-five miles per hour in a forty-five-mile-per-hour zone. Officer Vancamp activated the emergency lights on his patrol car, and the Impala pulled into the Quality Inn parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [5] Officer Vancamp approached the Impala's rear passenger door and knocked on the darkly tinted window.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Qadir rolled down the window, and Officer Vancamp \"detected an odor, consistent to that of [burning] marijuana.\" Tr. Vol. 2 at 37. Officer Vancamp advised the Impala's occupants of their\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, which they acknowledged, and asked Qadir to exit the vehicle. The officer handcuffed Qadir, searched him, and found a Georgia identification card and a hotel room key. The officer searched O'Bannon and found $7500 in cash. He also searched Williamson, the front seat passenger, and found $2500 in cash.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Vancamp searched the Impala and found an extended handgun magazine containing twenty 9-millimeter bullets \"inside the back seat pouch of the passenger seat[,]\" which was \"basically directly in front of\" where Qadir's knees would have been.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-42. Williamson was arrested on an outstanding homicide warrant from Atlanta, and all three men were taken to the police department for questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [6] Police learned that Qadir and Williamson had been staying in a room at the Quality Inn with Cynthia Foster. Police obtained Foster's consent to search the room, in which they found dark clothing that had been purchased from a Kokomo Walmart, the receipt from that purchase, and two 9-millimeter handguns. Police obtained security camera footage from Walmart showing Qadir and Williamson purchasing items from a cashier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [7] The State charged Qadir with attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. At trial, Foster testified that Qadir had asked her to drive him and Williamson in her car from Atlanta to Kokomo. When they arrived at the hotel, Foster went to bed. Qadir told her that he was going to take the car to Walmart, and he and Williamson returned to the hotel with bags from Walmart. They then left the hotel with O'Bannon. The trial court took the matter under advisement and ultimately found Qadir guilty as charged. The court later vacated the conspiracy conviction and sentenced Qadir to thirty-five years executed for attempted murder. This appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion and Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [8] Qadir contends that the trial court committed fundamental error in admitting unspecified evidence that he failed to object to at trial, claiming that it was seized as the result of an unconstitutional traffic stop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A claim that has been waived by a defendant's failure to raise a contemporaneous objection can be reviewed on appeal if the reviewing court determines that a fundamental error occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

The court held that Brown's claim of error regarding the admission of evidence seized from his home did not \"rise to the level of fundamental error\" because it did not call into question \"the integrity of the judicial process[,]\" i.e., \"there [was] no claim of fabrication of evidence or willful malfeasance on the part of the investigating officers and no contention that the evidence [was] not what it appear[ed] to be.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [10] Qadir claims that Officer Vancamp's stop of the Impala based on Detective Root's report of speeding was a \"sham\" that was used as a pretext to conduct allegedly unconstitutional warrantless searches of the vehicle and his person.

Qadir suggests that the warrantless search of the hotel room was unconstitutional, but he makes no cogent argument regarding the validity of Foster's consent to search the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [11] In sum, Qadir has failed to establish that the traffic stop and the ensuing searches and seizures were unconstitutional, and he has failed to establish that the police fabricated evidence or engaged in willful malfeasance or that the evidence was not what it appeared to be.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, he has failed to establish any error, fundamental or otherwise, in the admission of the evidence introduced at trial.

Qadir cites no authority for the proposition that a scientific calculation of a vehicle's speed is required for a legal traffic stop, and he failed to question Detective Root regarding his calculation of the Impala's speed at trial. Officer Vancamp testified that he stopped the Impala based on Detective Root's report of speeding, as well as a suspected window tint violation. Qadir expresses doubts about the latter, but because the former was a legitimate basis for the stop, we need not address those concerns.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Santana v.
