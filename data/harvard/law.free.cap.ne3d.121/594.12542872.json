(\"E.H.\") and I.H. (\"I.H.\") (collectively \"the children\"). Concluding that Casillas and Hernandez do not have standing to seek visitation, we reverse the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [2] We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Whether the trial court erroneously concluded that Grandparents have standing to seek visitation of Father's adopted children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [3] The facts are undisputed. E.H., who was born in March 2005, and I.H., who was born in December 2005, were adjudicated to be Children in Need of Services. In January 2017, the trial court terminated the parental rights of the children's biological parents. Father, the children's biological maternal uncle, and his significant other adopted the children. Father and his significant other are not married.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [4] In March 2018, Casillas and Hernandez, the children's biological maternal grandparents, filed petitions for grandparent visitation as maternal grandparents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Father filed motions to dismiss wherein he argued that Casillas and Hernandez lacked\n   standing to pursue visitation with the children because no visitation order had been established before the adoption and their visitation petition had been filed after the adoption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [5] In July 2018, Casillas and Hernandez filed amended petitions for grandparent visitation as paternal grandparents. Father responded to the petitions with motions to dismiss wherein he argued that Casillas and Hernandez lacked standing to petition for grandparent visitation because they did not meet the statutory requirements to seek visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [6] Following a hearing, in September 2018, the trial court issued orders wherein it explained that because Father and his significant other were not married when they adopted the children, the children were \"technically ... 'born' out of wedlock.\" (App. Vol. 2 at 46). Therefore, according to the trial court, Casillas and Hernandez had standing to seek grandparent visitation. Father appeals the trial court's orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [7] Father appeals the trial court's order concluding that Casillas and Hernandez had standing to seek grandparent visitation. He specifically argues that Casillas and Hernandez do not have standing to seek grandparent visitation because they do not meet the statutory requirements for standing. Casillas and Hernandez respond that they \"have standing to seek grandparent visitation as paternity was established in [Father] through the adoption proceeding and the minor children were born out of wedlock as [Father] was not married when the adoption was finalized.\" (Appellees' Br. at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [8] Grandparents historically had no common-law right to visitation with their grandchildren.\n   <em>\n    In re Visitation of M.L.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7112289\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/983/583/#p585\">\n    983 N.E.2d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 585 (Ind. 2013).

Statutes must be construed\n   to give effect to legislative intent, and courts must give deference to such intent whenever possible. Thus, courts must consider the goals of the statute and the reasons and policies underlying the statute's enactment. Courts are to examine and interpret a statute as a whole, giving words their common and ordinary meaning, and not overemphasize a strict, literal, or selective reading of individual words. Words and phrases are taken in their plain, ordinary, and usual meaning unless a different purpose is manifested by the statute. Where possible, every word must be given effect and meaning, and no part is to be held meaningless if it can be reconciled with the rest of the statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    A.J.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7095948\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/991/110/#p113\">\n    991 N.E.2d at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    JKB, Sr. v.

In that case, father killed mother in the presence of their two small children and was subsequently sentenced to sixty years. Paternal grandmother filed a petition for grandparent visitation. She argued that she should have standing under sections (1) or (2) of the GVA because her son should be considered deceased based on his sixty-year prison sentence and the marriage was technically dissolved due to father murdering mother.

In such a situation, the grandparents have lost their opportunity to seek visitation through their deceased child. The GVA contemplates a subsequent dispute over a visitation between the grandparents and a custodian of the children who is not the grandparents' child. The statute does not provide a means for court intervention, however, when the dispute is between the grandparents and a custodial parent who is their child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [15] Here, pursuant to the adoption, Father is the custodial parent of E.H. and I.H. The grandparents who seek visitation with the children are the parents of Father. They are therefore improperly seeking court intervention in a dispute with their own child. The legislature simply did not contemplate such a situation when enacting the GVA.
