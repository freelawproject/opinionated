Collins, who is currently an inmate at the Ross Correctional Institution. I would allow the writ and order respondent, Warden Mark Hooks, to file a return to the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 2}\n   </strong>\n   Collins alleges that his prison term expired on March 10, 2019, but that he is not scheduled for release until March 10, 2022. The source of the three-year discrepancy is a sentencing entry filed on January 28, 2009, when Collins was 16 years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 3}\n   </strong>\n   The 2009 entry reflects that Collins pleaded guilty in the Butler County Court of Common Pleas to four felony counts as well as a three-year firearm specification that accompanied Count 1. Counts 1 and 3 involved first-degree felonies, which were each subject to maximum prison terms of ten years at the time of sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   former R.C. 2929.14(A)(1), 2008 Sub.S.B. No. 220. On Count 1, the trial court imposed a seven-year term for the first-degree felony, along with a mandatory three-year term for the firearm specification, for a total of ten years. The trial court then imposed maximum sentences on all the other counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   former R.C. 2929.14(A)(2) and (3). The entry states that the sentences on Counts 2 through 4 are to run concurrently with the sentence on Count 1, with no mention of the firearm-specification term contained within the sentence for Count 1. The entry does not state an aggregate sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 4}\n   </strong>\n   Collins contends that he was sentenced to an aggregate term of ten years on January 28, 2009, and that Warden Hooks has added three years to the sentence based on the warden's application of R.C. 2929.14(C)(1)(a) (requiring consecutively run prison terms for certain firearm-related specifications) rather than carry out the trial court's sentencing entry as written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 5}\n   </strong>\n   If a petition, on its face, states a claim warranting relief in habeas corpus, this court is required by statute and by the Ohio Constitution to allow the writ and order a return.

Because Collins is asserting error in the warden's interpretation of the sentencing entry, rather than an error in the sentencing entry itself, his petition has stated a proper cause of action in habeas.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The warden's role, though, is limited to carrying out the sentence that the trial court actually imposed; the warden\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   An additional term of three (3) years is imposed as a mandatory and consecutive term pursuant to Revised Code Section 2929.14(D)(1)(a) [now codified as R.C. 2929.14(C)(1)(a)] to be served\n   <em>\n    before any other time is served\n   </em>\n   as to the specification for having a firearm on or about the offender's person or under the\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Capitalization sic and emphasis added.) Looking at this clause alone, without consideration of the sentencing entry as a whole, one might think that the trial court required Collins's firearm-specification term to run consecutively to all four of the prison terms imposed on Collins's felony convictions. But the interpretation of a sentencing entry is not a mere word-search game; we should construe the terms of an entry, like any other writing, in light of the document as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See United States v.

If the court had intended a 13-year term, the most straightforward approach would have been to impose the maximum ten years on the first-degree felony charged in Count 1, the count may not impose his own sentence based on\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   application of the law to the sentencing entry.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, given the entry's failure to state an aggregate sentence, the entry's instructions requiring the sentences on Counts 2 through 4 to run concurrently with the sentence on Count 1 creates ambiguity regarding the language in the firearm-specification clause that cannot be resolved by reference to the sentencing entry alone. Given the ambiguities and inconsistencies in the sentencing entry, it is not possible to conclude that Collins can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief in habeas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 9}\n   </strong>\n   It is true that a court speaks through its journal, but if its journal contains ambiguity, we must look beyond the journal itself to ascertain the court's true meaning.\n   <em>\n    See State ex rel.

On January 28, 2009, Collins may very well have received a 10-year aggregate sentence and he may very well have received a 13-year aggregate sentence. Had the trial court's intent been to impose a 13-year term, the most logical way to accomplish that would have been to impose the maximum ten years on the first-degree felony charged in Count 1 instead of waiting to impose the maximum ten years on the first-degree felony charged in Count 3. The fact that the trial court did not do so is cause for concern. Due to the illogical sequence of the first-degree-felony prison terms, the instructions requiring the sentences imposed on Counts 2 through 4 to run concurrently with the sentence imposed on Count 1, the failure to state an aggregate sentence, and the fact that the sentences were imposed pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement entered into by a 16-year-old, this sentencing entry demands clarification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 11}\n   </strong>\n   There is an extremely easy alternative to engaging in speculation to clarify the inconsistencies in Collins's sentencing entry: order the warden to file a return to the petition to allow this court to examine the detention. A quick review of the full record of Collins's case- including the January 28, 2009 sentencing-hearing transcript-will more than likely reveal exactly what sentence the trial court imposed. It is unconscionable to risk keeping Collins unlawfully in prison for three years beyond his actual sentence by refusing to take this simple step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 12}\n   </strong>\n   This case presents the exact problem that habeas corpus exists to solve. It is a manifest injustice to fail to require a return to the petition to ascertain the truth. I therefore dissent from this court's summary dismissal of Collins's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   STEWART, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
