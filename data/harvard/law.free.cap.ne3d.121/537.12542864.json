Respondent may petition for reinstatement upon termination of the disability pursuant to Admission and Discipline Rules 23(19)(h) and 23(18)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Given Respondent's indefinite disability suspension and the nature of his disability, the Court finds that further proceedings on a disciplinary complaint are not warranted at this time. Accordingly, the Court DISMISSES the Commission's disciplinary complaint without prejudice to refile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6780592,6780543\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/55/299/\">\n    55 N.E.3d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ind. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <author id=\"p-10\">\n    All Justices concur.\n   </author>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
