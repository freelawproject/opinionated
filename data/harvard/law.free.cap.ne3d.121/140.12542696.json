(\"Father\") appeals the termination of his parental rights as to H.H., D.H., F.H., and K.H., Jr. (\"Jr.\") (collectively, \"Children\"), arguing that the evidence is insufficient to support termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [2] Father was the father of H.H. (born in 2005), Jr. (born in 2006), D.H. (born in 2008), and F.H. (born in 2009). In May 2015, the Marion County Department of Child Services (\"DCS\") filed a petition alleging Children were Children in Need of Services (\"CHINS\") due to substance abuse by Father and physical abuse by Children's paternal grandmother. Children were placed in foster care, and later adjudicated CHINS after Father admitted to the CHINS allegations. Father was ordered to participate in home-based services. He was also ordered to undergo a substance-abuse assessment and participate in drug screens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [3] Father completed the assessment and entered a detoxification program in April 2016. After detoxifying, Father completed inpatient treatment and began residing in transitional housing. While Father addressed his substance abuse, parenting time was suspended. Parenting time eventually resumed in 2016, after Father had submitted several negative drug screens. Initially, Father received therapeutically supervised parenting time. By May 2017, Father had progressed to unsupervised parenting time. However, after Father relapsed in August 2017, his parenting time reverted to supervised parenting time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [4] In December 2017, Father was arrested and charged with several drug-related offenses, including possession of cocaine, possession of methamphetamine, possession of a narcotic drug, and unlawful possession of a syringe. Around that time, the juvenile court changed the permanency plan to adoption. In January 2018, DCS filed a petition to terminate Father's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [5] After his arrest in December 2017, Father was incarcerated until July 19, 2018. Shortly after Father's release, the juvenile court held a fact-finding hearing, which commenced on July 23, 2018, and concluded on July 31, 2018. The juvenile court later entered an order terminating Father's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [6] Father now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Discussion and Decision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [7] \"A parent's interest in the care, custody, and control of his or her children is 'perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bester v.

He focuses on subsection (B), directing argument under subsections (B)(i) and (B)(ii). As this portion of the statute provides alternative grounds for termination, we need only address subsection (B)(i), which pertains to the reasonable probability of changed conditions. In making a determination under this subsection, the \"court must judge a parent's fitness 'as of the time of the termination proceeding, taking into consideration evidence of changed conditions.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re E.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6955139\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/4/636/#p643\">\n    4 N.E.3d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 643 (Ind. 2014) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8431364\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/839/143/#p147\">\n    839 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   152 ).

[Father] has not demonstrated an ability to maintain sobriety outside of incarceration which would take some time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   App. Vol. II at 134.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [12] Father argues that the evidence is insufficient to support termination because \"[t]here is no clear and convincing evidence that Father will not maintain his sobriety.\" Br. of Appellant at 14. Father directs us to favorable evidence, including evidence that, as of the fact-finding hearing, \"he had been sober for around eight months.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7106556\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/989/1225/#p1231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Father observes that \"[h]e could have used drugs in jail, but he resisted the temptation\" and completed several programs while incarcerated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7106556\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/989/1225/#p1231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Father directs our attention to evidence of steps he was taking to address addiction, among them, taking medication to help with cravings. He also directs us to evidence that relapses are not uncommon, and that \"a single relapse does not mean a person is incapable of conquering ... addiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7106556\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/989/1225/#p1231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [13] However, in its findings and conclusions, the juvenile court acknowledged the positive steps Father had taken after the December 2017 arrest. Nevertheless, the court also reflected on Father's pattern of behavior, which included relapses during the pendency of the CHINS matter. The court also observed that Father had accrued \"several drug[-]related convictions over the past six years.\" App. Vol. II at 134. With respect to Father's criminal history, there was evidence Father had committed substance-related offenses in 2011, 2012, and 2015, with pending charges related to the arrest in 2017. The prior convictions included convictions for OVWI, possession of cocaine, and possession of a narcotic drug. The recent charges were similar, involving the possession of drugs. The evidence indicated that Father would stay out of trouble for a year or so, and then go off track again-relapsing or committing another drug-related offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [14] Ultimately, \"[r]equiring trial courts to give due regard to changed conditions does not preclude them from finding that parents' past behavior is the best predictor of their future behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    In re E.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6955139\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/4/636/#p643\">\n    4 N.E.3d at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, although Father had taken positive steps following his recent arrest, the trial court was free to give more weight to his pattern of conduct, determining that there was a reasonable probability that Father would not maintain his sobriety. At bottom, Father requests that we reweigh evidence, contrary to our standard of review. Moreover, to the extent Father is arguing that the instant matter \"has not reached the last resort stage,\" Br. of Appellant at 16, and that Father should have more time to address his addiction and demonstrate his ability to parent, we note that Children had been removed for three years while Father addressed this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10945880\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/534/273/#p275\">\n    534 N.E.2d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275 (Ind.
