He was responsible for conducting suspension appeal and expulsion hearings. He reported to Heather Baker, the director of pupil placement and child adjustment services, and Baker reported to James Gault, then the chief academic officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Issues arise with Spitulski's work performance.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Between November of 2012, and May of 2013, Baker received complaints that Spitulski had acted unprofessionally in his treatment of a non-attorney \"parent\n   advocate,\" several parents, and a character witness. In addition to this, on May 8, 2013, Spitulski admitted to Baker that he lost almost a year's worth of digitally-recorded hearings that he conducted during the 2012-2013 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The CBA outlines the disciplinary process.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Spitulski was an administrative employee of the Board, and as such, was a member of the Toledo Association of Administrative Personnel (\"TAAP\"). TAAP and the Board are parties to a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\"). The CBA provides procedures for addressing disciplinary concerns. Those procedures call for progressive discipline where appropriate, and they set forth a three-step disciplinary process: (1) an informal level, (2) a continuing disciplinary investigation (\"CDI\"), and (3) a CDI report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Under step one, an administrator who wishes to informally discuss a matter that may lead to a CDI must consult with her supervisor and notify the employee and TAAP in writing on a prescribed form known as \"a buff sheet.\" The buff sheet must describe (1) the conduct in question, (2) the date, time, and place of the meeting requested, and (3) the right of the employee to have a TAAP representative present. Under the CBA, every effort must be made to resolve matters at the informal level. If the matter is resolved, a record of the meeting and the prescribed resolution must be placed in the employee's personnel file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} If the matter is not resolved at step one, or if it is a \"serious matter,\" step two provides for a CDI, also referred to as \"a hearing on the record.\" The supervising administrator or TAAP may submit a written request to the personnel office for a CDI within 10 days from knowledge of the serious matter, or within five working days from the date of the informal meeting. A TAAP representative shall be permitted to be present for a CDI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Finally, under step three, a CDI report is generated. A designated human resources representative may hear testimony, examine witnesses, and review all relevant material pertaining to the CDI. He or she must then issue a report to the superintendent (or his designee), who must render a decision or recommend action to the Board. A copy of the superintendent or Board's decision must be sent to all parties concerned and placed in the employee's file. The employee may submit a written response which shall be attached to the decision. The employee or TAAP may then appeal from the decision. If the decision is to terminate the employee's contract, such termination must comply with Article VII, section E of the CBA. This provision of the CBA requires compliance with the Ohio Revised Code, including R.C. 3319.16, relating to the termination of a contract by a board of education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The CBA makes clear that an employee whose conduct is the subject of investigation is entitled to (1) timely and adequate notice of the conduct complained of on a prescribed form, (2) reasonable time to prepare a response, (3) representation by the TAAP; and (4) other reasonable procedures affording due process. If an investigation is not performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the CBA, it cannot be considered part of the employee's personnel file, and neither the fact of the investigation nor statements made during the investigation may be used in any subsequent Board proceeding. The CBA also specifies that while progressive discipline must be followed where appropriate-providing written warnings and suspensions in lieu of termination-a written warning is not always required and immediate termination may be appropriate in cases of serious misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Baker initiates the disciplinary process.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On May 23, 2013, Baker emailed Gault requesting a hearing on the record for Spitulski. She cited the following reasons for requesting the hearing: (1) failure to perform job duties, (2) failure to maintain professional relationships and behavior with parents and students, and (3) insubordination. On May 31, 2013, Gault contacted the District's chief human resources officer to request a hearing. He cited the following reasons for his request: (1) violation of licensure code of professional conduct for Ohio educators, (2) violation of board policy section G: Personnel; Title; Staff-Student Relations, (3) failure to perform job duties, and (4) insubordination. He further elaborated as to the conduct giving rise to his request as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Used inappropriate language during a suspension hearing for a student.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Acted in a very unprofessional way towards parents in hearings and while scheduling hearings. Several parents have refused to allow him to hear their cases because they felt he was rude, unprofessional, and unfair. These cases had to be heard by an alternate hearing officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   He has failed to maintain accurate hearing records or hearing dispositions. Parent and school personnel have verified that one particular disposition was incorrect and was not what was presented in the hearing. When questioned about it, he refused to adjust it, stating it was correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Upon request, Ron was unable to supply any audio hearing tapes from any hearings held in his office this school year up until the month of April. He states he is unsure of what happened to them. This is in violation of Ohio Revised Code 9.69 [sic].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 11} A hearing on the record took place on August 19, 2013. Gault presented the case to the District's hearing officer, Annmarie Heldt, and Baker and Spitulski testified. A union representative appeared on Spitulski's behalf. On September 9, 2013, Heldt issued a written recommendation to the Board, recommending that Spitulski be terminated. The District's chief human resource officer, Cheryl Spieldenner, recommended that Heldt's recommendation be upheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Board terminates Spitulski's employment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On October 4, 2013, the District's treasurer provided written notice under R.C. 3319.16 of its intent to terminate Spitulski's employment. Spitulski submitted a written request for arbitration to be conducted by an independent referee, and the Board invoked the hearing procedures provided in R.C. 3319.16. The Ohio Department of Education appointed a neutral referee, attorney James Gucker. On May 5 and 6, 2014, Gucker considered evidence and heard testimony from a number of witnesses. On August 14, 2014, he issued a recommendation to the Board concluding that \"good and just cause\" did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   exist to terminate Spitulski's employment agreement. Notwithstanding the referee's recommendation, the Board passed a resolution on December 16, 2014, terminating Spitulski's employment contract. The contract otherwise would have expired on July 31, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Spitulski seeks recourse.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Spitulski dually filed a charge of discrimination with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (\"OCRC\") and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") in September of 2013, alleging\n   gender, disability, and age discrimination. He later sought permission to withdraw the charge so he could pursue the matter in the common pleas court. The OCRC granted his request on July 17, 2014. At Spitulski's request, the EEOC issued a notice of right to sue dated October 14, 2014. On January 13, 2015, following the Board's termination of his employment contract, Spitulski filed a complaint against the Board, Gault, and Baker alleging eight claims: (1) termination without good and just cause in violation of R.C. 3319.16 ; (2) tortious violation of rights; (3) age discrimination; (4) disability discrimination; (5) retaliation in violation of R.C. 4112.02(I) ; (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\"); (7) false light invasion of privacy; and (8) intentional interference with business relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Through seven different orders, the trial court disposed of all of Spitulski's claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 May 29, 2015: dismissed counts two and eight;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 September 10, 2015: dismissed count one;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 February 3, 2016: dismissed Spitulski's claim for punitive damages and attorney's fees;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 October 3, 2016: dismissed counts four and seven;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 August 23, 2017: dismissed count six;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 September 13, 2017: dismissed count three; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 November 13, 2017: dismissed count five.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Spitulski appealed and assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. The Trial Court Committed Prejudicial Error by Creating a Fact to Justify Dismissal of Plaintiff's Age Discrimination Claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   B. The Trial Court Committed Prejudicial Error by Dismissing Plaintiff's Count Two, Improperly Inferring that He Had Received a Fair Administrative Hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   C. The Trial Court Committed Prejudicial Error in Dismissing Plaintiff's Disability Discrimination Claim by Holding that Pretext Could Not be Proven by Comparing Plaintiff's Discharge with the Lesser Discipline Received by Non-class Members Who had Committed Unprofessional Conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   D. The Trial Court Committed Prejudicial Error by Applying Inapplicable Private Sector Contract Preemption Law to Dismiss Plaintiff's Public Sector Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   E. The Trial Court Committed Prejudicial Error by Dismissing Plaintiff's Retaliation Claim Based on Dicta in a Case that Supposedly Rejected the \"Cat's Paw\" Theory of Liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   F. The Trial Court Committed Prejudicial Error by Assessing the Board's Resolution, rather than the Referee's Findings of Fact, and then Applying an Incorrect Evidentiary Standard in that Assessment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   G. The Trial Court Committed Prejudicial Error by Dismissing Plaintiff's Claims for Punitive Damages and Attorney Fees Under Abrogated Judicially-created Governmental Immunity Law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In his seven assignments of error, Spitulski challenges the trial court's dismissal of Counts 1 through 6 of his complaint, as well as the court's dismissal of his demand for punitive damages and attorney fees. We address each of his assignments of error in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Dismissal of Spitulski's Age Discrimination Claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In Count 3 of Spitulski's complaint, he claimed that he was unlawfully\n   discharged from his employment on the basis of his age. He alleged that Baker told him that \"they're asking me when you are going to retire,\" and told him that the District wanted him discharged because \"you have too much gray hair.\" He also contended that on September 13, 2013, Spieldenner called him and the TAAP president into her office, at which point she attempted to coerce him into signing \"an unlawful retirement agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The Board moved the court under Civ.R. 12(B)(1) to dismiss Spitulski's claim for age discrimination for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. In an order dated September 13, 2017, the trial court granted the Board's motion. In his first assignment of error (Error \"A\"), Spitulski claims that the trial court erred in granting the Board's motion because (1) it \"creat[ed] a fact to justify dismissal\" of his claim, and (2) the Board failed to assert lack of subject-matter jurisdiction as an affirmative defense, thereby waiving the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 19} \" Civ.R. 12(B)(1) provides for the dismissal of a complaint where the trial court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter of the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    United States Bank Natl.

It held that because Spitulski elected to pursue a charge with OCRC-and notwithstanding the fact that he later withdrew that charge-the court lacked jurisdiction over his age-discrimination claim based on the same alleged conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In Ohio, a plaintiff who claims to have been subjected to age-based employment discrimination may pursue either (1) a judicial remedy, by filing a civil action in the common pleas court under R.C. 4112.14 or 4112.02(L), or (2) an administrative remedy, by filing a charge with the OCRC under R.C. 4112.05(B)(1).\n   <em>\n    Vinson v.

It points to paragraph three of his charge, and insists that the same facts are alleged in his complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   3.

At this point, the stress of this notice led me to be hospitalized for my condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Spitulski contends that this paragraph makes clear that the unlawful practices alleged in the charge are not the same as those alleged in his complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 27} We have reviewed both Spitulski's OCRC charge and the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   While Spitulski's termination may not have been effected until December 16, 2014-after the procedures set forth in the CBA and R.C. 3319.16 were exhausted and the Board passed its resolution-Spitulski selected \"discharge/termination\" as the \"type of discrimination\" challenged in his charge (as opposed to other options from which he could choose, including \"demotion\" or \"discipline\"). He also specifically alleged in paragraph 3 of his charge that he had been \"disciplined/terminated\" based on his age. While we appreciate that termination had merely been \"recommended\" and not yet \"decided\" at the time he filed his charge, designating his charge as such evidences that Spitulski elected to challenge his discharge via the procedure set forth in R.C. 4112.05(B)(1). Having made this election, he was not free to file a lawsuit once the \"recommendation\" became a \"decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 28} We also observe that both the charge and the complaint allege age discrimination premised on threats made by the district in an attempt \"to coerce him into signing an unlawful retirement agreement.\" (Paragraph 68 of Spitulski's complaint, and paragraph 4(c) of his charge.) In sum, the charge and the complaint allege the same discriminatory practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Spitulski also argues that the Board waived the defense of election of remedies by failing to plead it. The Board counters that Spitulski's filing of an OCRC charge deprived the common pleas court of subject-matter jurisdiction, and subject-matter jurisdiction can never be waived and may be raised at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Indeed, it is well-established that subject-matter jurisdiction may not be waived.\n   <em>\n    Shawnee Twp. v.

Dismissal of Spitulski's Claim for Tortious Violation of Rights.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 32} At Spitulski's refereed hearing, the Board presented evidence concerning encounters between Spitulski and six individuals-parents, relatives, representatives, or witnesses for suspended or expelled students-during which Spitulski allegedly exhibited unprofessional behavior. Only one of those encounters was documented in a buff sheet. The Board also presented evidence concerning Spitulski's loss of hundreds of audio recordings of hearings he conducted. Again, there was no buff sheet related to this incident. Spitulski alleged in Count 2 of his complaint that the Board, \"with conscious disregard for [his] union contract due process rights,\" breached and violated (1) the terms of his supplemental employment rights as expressed in the CBA between the Board and TAAP, and (2) his statutory right under R.C. \u00a7 3319.16 to have the refereed hearing confined to the grounds stated in the notice thereof * * *.\" He termed this count of his complaint a \"tortious violation of rights.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The Board moved to dismiss this claim under Civ.R. 12(B)(1) and (6). It argued that Ohio law does not recognize a general cause of action for \"tortious violation\n   of rights.\" It also maintained that the rights that Spitulski claimed were violated were rights created by R.C. 3319.16 and the CBA. It insisted, therefore, that R.C. 3319.16 provides the exclusive means by which to challenge the termination of his employment, and that the State Employee Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction over claims based on rights created by the CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In a judgment dated May 28, 2015, the trial court dismissed Spitulski's claim for tortious violation of rights, holding that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because \"a common-law intentional tort claim cannot be based entirely on alleged violations of rights created and/or procedures mandated by either R.C. 3319.16 or a CBA.\" In his second assignment of error (Error \"B\"), Spitulski argues that in reaching this conclusion, the trial court \"improperly inferr[ed] that he had received a fair administrative hearing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The court determined that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Spitulski's claim under\n   <em>\n    Provens v.

To the extent that Spitulski alleges that the Board violated the disciplinary procedures and pre-hearing notice requirements contained in the CBA or in R.C. 3319.16, these alleged violations are properly considered in determining whether Spitulski was afforded a fair hearing (which we review within Spitulski's assignment of error \"F\" herein).\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

Upon his return from leave, Spitulski was \"relegated\" to the position of supervisor of the pupil personnel center-rather than a principal position. It was agreed, however, that his salary and \"working days level\" would be maintained for five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 39} On September 13, 2013, after the chief human resources officer allegedly attempted to coerce him to sign a retirement agreement, Spitulski \"excused himself and went to a nearby hospital's emergency room.\" He took FMLA leave until October 17, 2013, which he attributes to a \"serious health condition brought on by the District's unwarranted conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 40} In Count 4 of his complaint, Spitulski alleged that his termination and the alleged attempt to coerce him into signing a retirement agreement were on account of his disability and performed with knowledge that his five-year salary and working-day-level protections were set to expire. He also alleged that he was \"unlawfully suspended from his professional work; wrongfully barred from Board property, school functions and athletic events; and was humiliated in the eyes of his peers and the community.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 41} In a judgment dated October 3, 2016, the trial court granted summary judgment to the Board on Spitulski's claim for disability discrimination. Although the court found that Spitulski had offered evidence that he suffered from a disability, it concluded that Spitulski failed to offer evidence showing that the Board's stated reason for terminating him was pretext for disability discrimination. While it recognized that Spitulski had asserted that he was punished more harshly than non-disabled employees, the court found this assertion \"unavailing.\" In his third assignment of error (Error \"C\"), Spitulski argues that the trial court erred by holding that pretext could not be proven by comparing Spitulski's discharge to the lesser discipline received by non-class members who had committed unprofessional conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Appellate review of a summary judgment is de novo,\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

It found that Spitulski offered no evidence that would raise an inference of retaliation because too much time had passed between when Spitulski engaged in the protected activity (the filing of his OCRC charge) and when the adverse employment action (his termination) occurred. It also found that Spitulski's allegedly-biased supervisors (Baker and Gault) had no further involvement in his disciplinary matter after he filed his OCRC charge. While the court acknowledged that Spitulski was notified that Spieldenner intended to recommend that his paid suspension be converted to unpaid, it emphasized that this never happened.

While Spitulski argues that, effectively, only two business days had passed (given the Board's monthly meeting schedule), we find this argument unpersuasive. Spitulski's termination was simply too remote in time from his engagement in protected activity to establish the causal connection necessary to support his retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   {\u00b6 79} We also acknowledge that Spitulski claims that his suspension was an adverse employment decision that occurred within days of his engaging in protected activity. However, in\n   <em>\n    Perez v. Theller\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist. Sandusky No. S-10-053,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-2176\">\n    2011-Ohio-2176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201782093\">\n    2011 WL 1782093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16, we held that \"[t]he material adversity of a suspension is determined by the context under which it is imposed. Duration and lost income are the critical factors. Suspensions\n   <em>\n    with pay\n   </em>\n   are not deemed to be adverse, but if imposed even temporarily without pay, they are.\" Here, despite Spieldenner's later recommendation to convert Spitulski's paid suspension to an unpaid one, Spitulski's\n   suspension was entirely with pay. We, therefore, find that it did not constitute an adverse employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   {\u00b6 80} In addition to failing to establish a causal connection, we conclude, as did the trial court, that Spitulski cannot show that the Board was aware of the notice of right to sue. The Board's attorney clearly was aware of the notice letter, but it is undisputed that the Board members themselves were unaware. Spitulski claims that the Board's attorney's knowledge must be imputed to the Board members. But the Board cites\n   <em>\n    Bahar v. City of Youngstown\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist.

The appellant sought to establish that the law director's knowledge should be imputed to council members because \"the Law Director indisputably had knowledge of [her] protected activity during the ten days immediately before [her] discharge[, and] [a]s legal counsel to the City Council, [the law director] would have been derelict in her duties had she not informed the council members of [Appellant's] complaints that had been made so close in time to the legislative act of firing her.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40. The court held that the inference appellant was asking it to make was directly contradicted by evidence that the law director considered her conversations with appellant to be privileged, and, therefore, did not repeat her statements to the members of city council. Accordingly, it held that the appellant failed to establish that any member of council knew of her protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   {\u00b6 82} Here, too, there is no evidence that the Board members knew of the right-to-sue letter. To the contrary, the Board presented affidavits from its Board members indicating that they were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   told of the right-to-sue letter. Under these circumstances, Spitulski has failed to show that the Board was aware of the protected activity at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   {\u00b6 83} Because Spitulski has failed to establish a prima facie case that he was terminated for engaging in protected activity, we find that the trial court properly dismissed his retaliation claim.

In his sixth assignment of error (Error \"F\"), Spitulski argues that in doing so, the trial court improperly \"assess[ed] the Board's resolution, rather than the referee's findings of fact, and then appl[ied] an incorrect evidentiary standard in that assessment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   {\u00b6 85} The trial court found that the Board complied with applicable law when it rejected a number of the referee's findings of fact as against the weight of the evidence and when it rejected his recommendation based on its interpretation of the significance of his factual findings. It further found that the Board presented substantial and credible evidence to support its charges against Spitulski and that Spitulski had a fair administrative hearing.

It characterized Spitulski's instances of misconduct as \"serious matters that are directly related to [his] professional responsibilities, directly involve students, and are hostile to the school community.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   {\u00b6 93} Spitulski argues that the trial court applied an inapplicable standard of review here. He maintains that a board's decision is reviewed under a \"preponderance-of-the-evidence\" standard, and not a \"substantial and credible evidence\" standard. We conclude that Spitulski is mistaken. In fact, while\n   <em>\n    the Board\n   </em>\n   reviews the referee's findings of fact under a \"preponderance-of-the-evidence\" standard,\n   <em>\n    the trial court\n   </em>\n   reviews the Board's decision under a \"substantial-and-credible-evidence\" standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bertolini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"562964\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/139/595/#p604\">\n    139 Ohio App.3d at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=744%20N.E.2d%201245\">\n    744 N.E.2d 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Strohm v.

The trial court did not apply an incorrect standard. And under the narrow, abuse-of-discretion standard that\n   <em>\n    this court\n   </em>\n   is required to apply, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion given the detailed explanation provided by the Board for rejecting the referee's factual findings and reaching a different conclusion as to the significance of the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   {\u00b6 94} Spitulski also claims that he was not afforded a fair hearing because the hearing was not \"confined to the grounds stated in the notice thereof.\" He contends that the Board presented evidence at the refereed hearing about several parent encounters about which he had not been provided notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   {\u00b6 95} R.C. 3319.16 requires a board to furnish a teacher written notice signed by its treasurer of its intention to consider termination of the teacher's contract \"with full specification of the grounds for such consideration.\" \"While the term 'full specification' is not defined in the statute, it has been found that evidence of other instances of alleged misconduct which are 'interrelated' to the grounds stated in the notice are permissible at the hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Speller\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-2672\">\n    2015-Ohio-2672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20N.E.3d%20509\">\n    38 N.E.3d 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 26. \"The purpose of R.C. 3319.16 is to provide the essential requirements of due process: notice and an opportunity to respond.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20N.E.3d%20509\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   citing\n   <em>\n    Badertscher v.

What's more, he presented testimony from his own witnesses who countered the Board's allegations. Indeed, the referee was persuaded that the Board's allegations lacked merit. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that Spitulski did not receive a fair hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   {\u00b6 97} We find Spitulski's sixth assignment of error (Error \"F\") not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Dismissal of Spitulski's Claim for Punitive Damages and Attorney Fees.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   {\u00b6 98} In his seventh assignment of error (Error \"G\"), Spitulski claims that the trial court erred in dismissing his claims for punitive damages and attorney fees. Given our resolution of the preceding six assignments of error, it is unnecessary for us to address Spitulski's seventh assignment of error (Error \"G\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   {\u00b6 99} The trial court properly dismissed Spitulski's age-discrimination claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because Spitulski elected to pursue an administrative remedy by filing an OCRC charge. We reach this conclusion notwithstanding the fact that he later withdrew his charge. We, therefore, find Spitulski's first assignment of error (Error \"A\") not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   {\u00b6 100} Ohio does not recognize a cause of action for tortious violation of rights under a CBA or R.C. 3319.16. We, therefore, find Spitulski's second assignment of error (Error \"B\") not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   {\u00b6 101} Spitulski failed to offer proper summary-judgment quality evidence in support of his assertion that similarly-situated non-class members were treated more favorably. His disability discrimination claim was, therefore, properly dismissed. We find Spitulski's third assignment of error (Error \"C\") not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   {\u00b6 102} Spitulski's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress fails as a matter of law because the conduct alleged was not sufficiently extreme and outrageous. We, therefore, find Spitulski's fourth assignment of error (Error \"D\") not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   {\u00b6 103} Spitulski's claim for retaliation was properly dismissed where he failed to demonstrate a causal connection between his termination and his engagement in protected activity, and failed to show that the individual Board members knew of his most recent engagement in protected activity. We, therefore, find Spitulski's fifth assignment of error (Error \"E\") not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   {\u00b6 104} The trial court did not abuse its discretion in affirming the Board's termination of Spitulski's employment where there existed competent and credible evidence\n   to support its decision and he was afforded a fair hearing. We, therefore, find Spitulski's sixth assignment of error (Error \"F\") not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   {\u00b6 105} And given our resolution of Spitulski's first six assignments of error, we need not address his seventh assignment of error (Error \"G\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   {\u00b6 106} Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas dated May 28, 2015, September 10, 2015, February 3, 2016, October 3, 2016, August 23, 2017, September 13, 2017, and November 13, 2017.
