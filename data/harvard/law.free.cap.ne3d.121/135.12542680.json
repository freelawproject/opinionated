A Child in Need of Services (\"CHINS\") Petition was filed on the children on July 7, 2015, ... following allegations of domestic violence and medical neglect. The Petition alleged that Mother had failed to follow through with her own mental health treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   5. The children were detained and ordered removed from their mother's care and custody at the July 8, 2015, \"Initial/Detention Hearing.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   6. The children were adjudicated to be CHINS on October 14, 2015, when their mother [submitted an admission and agreement for services admitting the children were CHINS and agreed that court involvement was appropriate].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   7.

Ms. Bolden also supervised parenting time between Mother and the children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   10. Mother was initially consistent with parenting time with three visits per week. Eventually, Mother's parenting time reduced to two per week and then to one per week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   11. When parenting time did occur, it went well for the children. When Mother did miss visits, it was hard on the children, especially on Ti.C. who exhibited negative behaviors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   12.

Although Mother did successfully complete Domestic Violence Services, she has not completed any other services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   20. Home Based Case Management was referred three separate times and Home Base[d] Therapy was referred four separate times. Despite these referrals, Mother failed to successfully complete them. Home Based Therapy was restarted in March 2018 ... but she has a significant amount of work to do to make progress. Mother has been unsuccessfully discharged from Home Based Case Management.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   21. The children had been removed from their mother's care and custody under a dispositional decree for at least six (6) months prior to this Termination Action being filed on August 30, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   22. Mother's parenting time was suspended by the CHINS Court in December 2017 and she hasn't seen them since.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   23. The children have been placed in relative care with their paternal grandmother since the summer of 2017. They are doing well and their medical and mental health needs are being met.

Mother then stipulated that the Children were CHINS and agreed to participate in multiple needed services. The record indicates that, in addition to concerns regarding Mother acting violently toward the Children, the Children have medical and mental health needs that Mother was failing to meet. Notwithstanding considerable efforts by service providers to address these concerns, Mother was unsuccessfully discharged from home-based case management and failed to complete home-based therapy. Although Mother initially participated consistently with visitation, she soon began canceling and missing visits, and her visitation was eventually suspended. Mother has not seen the Children since December 2017. Prior to visitation being suspended, service providers observed no bond or affection between Mother and the Children. Mother failed to supervise and often interacted inappropriately with the Children, and they exhibited worsening behavioral issues after visiting with Mother. Service providers also noted that Mother did not show improvement in her parenting skills or interactions over the course of multiple visits. Although it appears that Mother did regularly participate in her own mental health therapy, the record indicates that she made very minimal progress and was unable to apply her learned skills. In sum, the evidence shows that other than domestic violence services,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother has been either unable or unwilling to successfully complete ordered services or make any meaningful progress in improving her parenting skills despite having almost three years to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [8] Mother asserts that there was evidence that she began to make some progress in services at the time of the termination hearing. However, it was the trial court's prerogative to balance Mother's recent progress against her habitual patterns of conduct to determine whether there is a substantial probability of future neglect or deprivation. Mother essentially asks that we reweigh the evidence in her favor, and we will not. There is sufficient evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that there is a reasonable probability that the conditions that led to the Children's removal and continued placement outside the home will not be remedied by Mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    Section 2 - DCS presented sufficient evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that termination of Mother's parental rights is in the Children's best interests.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   [9] Mother next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that termination of her parental rights is in the Children's best interests. In considering whether termination of parental rights is in the best interests of a child, the trial court is required to look beyond the factors identified by DCS and look to the totality of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    McBride v.

They each also commented on the Children's strong bond with paternal grandmother. GAL Cheatham testified that she believed that returning the Children to Mother's care could \"[a]bsolutely\" be detrimental to them, and that adoption by paternal grandmother was in their best interests. Tr. Vol. 2 at 12. Similarly, GAL Box stated that Mother had \"been given ample time to complete required services[,]\" and that at this point the Children were in need of \"a forever home.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117, 119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [11] DCS Family Case Manager La'Shawn Lewis stated that she agreed with the GALs that termination of Mother's parental rights is in the Children's best interests and that their paternal grandmother could meet their long-term needs.

Mother's arguments against this plan are simply reiterations and requests that she be given more time to make progress before her rights are terminated. As we acknowledged above, this case has been open for almost three years. Decisions to terminate parental rights \"are among the most difficult our trial courts are called upon to make\" and are very fact sensitive.\n   <em>\n    E.M. v. Ind. Dep't of Child Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6955139\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/4/636/#p643\">\n    4 N.E.3d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640 (Ind. 2014). We will reverse a termination of parental rights only upon a showing of \"clear error\" - that which leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\n   <em>\n    In re A.N.J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11862375\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/690/716/#p722\">\n    690 N.E.2d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 722 (Ind. Ct. App. 1997). Based on the record before us, we cannot say that the trial court's termination of Mother's parental rights to the Children was clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the trial court's termination order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [14] Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Vaidik, C.J., and Mathias, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    We remind Mother's counsel that an appellant's statement of facts \"shall be in narrative form and shall not be a witness by witness summary of the testimony.\" Ind. Appellate Rule 46(A)(6)(c).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The trial court's order references the parents and the minor children by their full names.

Accordingly, we do not separately address the evidence supporting those findings and simply look to the evidence in support of the trial court's findings and conclusions as a whole.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Mother also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court's conclusion that there is a reasonable probability that the continuation of the parent-child relationship poses a threat to the Children's well-being. However, Indiana Code Section 31-35-2-4(b)(2)(B) is written in the disjunctive, such that, to properly effectuate the termination of parental rights, the trial court need only find that one of the three requirements of that subsection has been established by clear and convincing evidence.\n    <em>\n     A.D.S. v. Ind. Dep't of Child Servs.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7125211\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/987/1150/#p1156\">\n     987 N.E.2d 1150\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1156 (Ind. Ct. App. 2013),\n    <em>\n     trans. denied\n    </em>\n    . Accordingly, we will address the sufficiency of the evidence regarding only one of the three requirements.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    While the record provides that Mother was successfully discharged from domestic violence services, evidence was presented questioning the validity of that successful discharge due to her inconsistent participation in these services. In addition, one service provider testified that Mother hit one of the Children during a visit after Mother had been successfully discharged from domestic violence services, which indicated to the provider that Mother had not learned from those services. Tr. Vol. 2 at 110.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The lion's share of Mother's arguments center around her belief that the Children should have never been adjudicated CHINS in the first place. These arguments are not well taken, especially in light of Mother's admission and stipulation to the contrary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
