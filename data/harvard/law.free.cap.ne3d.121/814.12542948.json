In said Complaint, Appellants asserted claims for intentional interference with expectancy of inheritance, constructive trust, declaratory judgment, and accounting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On June 13, 2017, Appellee filed her answer to Appellants' Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On July 7, 2017, Appellants filed an Amended Complaint, adding claims for fraudulent transfer and punitive damages, to which Appellee filed her answer on July 19, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In their Amended Complaint, Appellants allege the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} William Thomas and Clara Thomas were married on April 20, 1991. (Amended Complaint \u00b6 9). They remained married until William passed away on September 9, 2014. (AC \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In 2010, William and Clara, residents of Florida, engaged Andre Patrone, a licensed attorney in Florida, to draft\n   wills and trusts for them (the \"2010 Will\" and \"2010 Trust,\" respectively). Under the terms of the 2010 Will and the 2010 Trust, if William was survived by Clara, all of his interest in the marital residence and the tangible property would pass to Clara outright, and all of William's other assets would pass to a Trust for Clara's benefit. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 12-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In June or July 2014, William discussed a new estate plan with Attorney Edd K. Wright. The proposed new estate plan was to be comprised of a new will and trust. (AC \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On or about July 18, 2014, Attorney Wright brought a draft of the 2014 Will to Union Hospital in Dover, Ohio, where William was hospitalized. (AC \u00b6 24). Due to a quarantine, Attorney Wright was not permitted by the medical professionals to see William. (AC \u00b6 25). Attorney Wright handed the 2014 draft will to a nurse, with instructions to give the document to William (AC \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellee Clara Thomas acknowledged that she reviewed the 2014 draft Will and destroyed it, stating it contained factual inaccuracies. (AC \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Attorney Wright had not yet drafted a new Trust document. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 29-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} William Thomas died on September 9, 2014. (AC \u00b6 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} After William's death, the 2010 Will was admitted to the Probate Court in Lee County, Florida, Case Number 14-CP-2189. (AC \u00b6 44). Pursuant to the terms of the 2010 Will, the Decedent's probate assets were transferred to the 2010 Trust, for the benefit of Appellee Clara Thomas, and withdrawn from the Trust, pursuant to the power of withdrawal that was granted to her in the Trust. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 43-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On October 18, 2017, Appellee filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings requesting the trial court to dismiss Appellants' First Amended Complaint, claiming that Appellants' claims were barred by both Ohio and Florida law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Appellee's principal arguments were that the pour-over will drafted by the decedent's attorney in 2014, which was later destroyed by Appellee, did not meet the basic requirements of Ohio law and that Appellants' intentional interference with expectancy of inheritance claim constituted a \"collateral action\" barred by Ohio Law and the Florida Probate Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On November 6, 2017, Appellants filed their opposition to Appellee's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On February 14, 2018, following an oral hearing, the trial court issued its Judgment Entry granting Appellee's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Appellant now appeals, assigning the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} \"I.

The elements of intentional interference with an expectancy of inheritance are: (1) the plaintiff's expectancy of an inheritance; (2) the defendant's intentional interference with that expectancy of inheritance; (3) conduct by the defendant involving the interference that is tortious in nature, such as fraud, duress or undue influence; (4) a reasonable certainty that the expectancy of inheritance would have been realized, but for the defendant's interference; and (5) damage resulting from the interference.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=616%20N.E.2d%20202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , Appellants allege that, but for Appellee's actions, the Decedent would have executed an additional estate plan document, specifically the Will drafted in 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The Will, which the decedent would have purportedly executed, contained the following clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Item III\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   All of the remainder of my estate, both real and personal, wheresoever the same may be situated, I bequeath to the\n   <strong>\n    William J.

(emphasis in original).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 29} However, there is no allegation in the Complaint that the Appellee interfered with the drafting, review or execution of the 2014 William J.

(AC \u00a7 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 30} R.C. \u00a7 2107.63, which is also referred to as Ohio's pour-over clause statute, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A testator may by will devise, bequeath, or appoint real or personal property or any interest in real or personal property to a trustee of a trust that is evidenced by a written instrument signed by the testator or any other settlor either before or on the same date of the execution of the will of the testator, that is identified in the will, and that has been signed, or is signed at any time after the execution of the testator's will, by the trustee or trustees identified in the will or their successors or by any other person lawfully serving, by court appointment or otherwise, as a trustee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 31} A pour-over clause is a provision in a will directing the distribution of a decedent's property into a trust.\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   608 (5th Ed. 1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 32} As set forth above, R.C. \u00a7 2107.63, specifically requires that a trust be \"evidence by a written instrument.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 33} As such, Appellants arguments that Atty. Wright was still working on, but had not yet drafted the trust agreement, and/or that the decedent had created an oral trust, fail as same do not comply with the requirements that the trust be written and executed simultaneously with or prior to the will containing a pour-over clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Inasmuch as the 'pour-over' bequest to the living trust fails, the residue would descend as intestate property in the absence of something to save it.\n   <em>\n    Knowles v.
