Petitioner raises five assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. The trial court abused its discretion in its implementation of the 1 \u00bd hour time restriction resulting in substantial irregularities in the proceedings and prejudice to the appellant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. The trial court erred as a matter of law and abused its discretion in finding that the appellee was denied his right to a full hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   3. The trial court erred as a matter of law and abused its discretion in arbitrarily setting a one (1) year time restriction on all testimony and evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   4. The trial court erred and abused its discretion in substituting its decision for that of the trial court magistrate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   5. The trial court erred as a matter of law and abused its discretion in dismissing the appellant's motion for a new trial and motion for relief from judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Finding merit to Petitioner's first three assignments of error, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for a new full hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Petitioner and Respondent were married in August 1998. They had two children born as issue of the marriage: M.T.D. in October 2006 and Q.D. in March 2010. The parties had been living in London since 2012, where they owned two \"flats.\" In July 2015, however, Respondent got a job in Austin, Texas. Petitioner and the children remained in London until July 2016, when they moved to Solon to live with Petitioner's parents. Respondent would visit Petitioner and the children in Solon approximately twice a month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On May 31, 2017, Petitioner filed a petition for a domestic violence civil protection order pursuant to R.C. 3113.31. She also requested ex parte (emergency) protection for herself and the two children. After the ex parte hearing, the magistrate granted the ex parte CPO, naming Petitioner and the two children as protected persons under the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The magistrate continued the full hearing on the CPO several times per the parties' agreement. In an August 8, 2017 agreed judgment entry that was signed by Petitioner and her counsel, Respondent and his counsel, the magistrate, and the trial judge, the parties agreed that they would only use 1.5 hours to present their case and that the full hearing would take place on Monday, August 21, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On Friday, August 18, 2017, Respondent filed an \"Emergency Motion for a Discovery Order Regarding Children Services' Records in London.\" Respondent's counsel emailed a copy of the emergency motion to Petitioner's counsel, telling him that the magistrate intended to deny the motion. The magistrate stated that she denied Respondent's emergency motion because she intended to limit testimony during the full hearing to allegations of domestic violence that occurred within one year of Petitioner filing the CPO, which was May 31, 2017. Thus, according to the magistrate, she would not consider the children services' report because it was dated prior to June 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Petitioner testified that after she and the children moved back to Ohio in July 2016, they saw Respondent more frequently than they did when they were still in London. She testified that since they have been living in Ohio, Respondent \"visits\" them at her parents approximately two times per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Petitioner testified that on Mother's Day 2017, Respondent told her to \"enjoy Mother's Day because it might be the last one you have.\" She explained that Respondent had previously threatened to kill her. He told her that \"all [his] problems would be solved if he killed [her], cut [her] up, put [her] in a black trash bag, and threw [her] in the [Thames],\" which was five minutes from their flat. When he said it, Petitioner said that \"it was so scary because he was calm.\" He then told her that \"he would just say that [she] had gone * * * somewhere remote and that he lost track of [her] and that he would send out a search party to find [her] so no one would realize for quite a long time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Petitioner also testified that Respondent does \"IT for a living\" and stalks her electronically through her cell phone and internet use. She described a time from the fall of 2016 when Respondent called her cell phone 22 times in a row. She did not answer because she was outside with her mother and the children. Respondent also called her mom's phone and her parents' landline. Respondent later told her that he knew she was there because he tracked her phone and her mom's phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Petitioner further explained that she has her regular phone and a secret phone. The secret phone is an old one that she stopped using when she got her new phone. But Respondent figured out that she was using the old phone again because he \"troll[ed] the wifi for devices.\" She could not explain how Respondent does it because she does not understand technology, but she said that AT &amp; T confirmed to her that Respondent could track her cell phone through wifi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Petitioner testified that Respondent is very controlling. She said that he has hacked into her email account and read her emails. She stated that he monitors all of her internet activity. She said that he makes her feel like a \"caged animal.\" If she uses her bank card to purchase something over one cent, he immediately texts her and asks, \"[w]hat is this for?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Petitioner also discussed when she found a recording camera in her bedroom in London after Respondent had gone back to Texas after visiting them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She found it a few days after Respondent left. It was the fall of 2015. She said that she saw a red light on a small device between two photographs that were on a nightstand. The device was plugged into the wall. She said that it could have been a phone, but it was smaller than an iPhone. It was on the opposite side of the bed from where she slept. She identified two photos that she took of the camera on the nightstand. She said that she unplugged it and was not able to turn it on after she unplugged it. When she unplugged it, Respondent sent her \"very angry text messages.\" Petitioner testified that she never agreed to Respondent videoing them having sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Petitioner explained that Respondent also stalks her in person. She said that one time, he texted her a photo of her yoga studio and said, \"[y]ou say you're at 'yoga' but on my way to the dentist I passed it and * * * nope.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Petitioner testified that Respondent has also spun his car out on a bridge\n   with her in it. He told her, \"I drive carefully with the kids, but with you * * *[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} When asked why she did not just leave Respondent, Petitioner explained that it was not that simple. She said, \"I would have if I could have, but I have two children.\" When asked why she emailed Respondent if she was afraid of him, she responded that it was a \"coping strategy.\" She said that she tries to \"appease him,\" to make it seem like everything is okay, and to make him \"calm for a brief period of time.\" She explained that Respondent is \"just angry all the time. It doesn't have to be anything specific.\" She said, \"I've tried to appease him. I've tried so hard to, like, make it okay and he's become worse and worse and worse over time. And just nothing will set him off.\" She also stated that over time, he \"does it in front of the children * * * as if they aren't there. So they witness his angry outbursts and they witness his abusive behavior towards me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Petitioner further testified that she went on trips with Respondent and the children, but said that it was \"horrible.\" She said that she would get stomach aches, pain in her neck and shoulders, and diarrhea. In March 2017, they went on vacation for spring break. While checking into a hotel, Respondent \"threw a massive temper tantrum\" in front of the children. M.T.D. was so upset that he \"wet and soiled himself.\" While she was cleaning it up, Respondent \"sped off\" in the car and did not come back until the next morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 17} She explained another incident from October 2016, when they went to church around the time of M.T.D.'s birthday. On the way home, Respondent got \"angry about something\" and \"made a scene.\" Respondent was driving. He stopped the car, got out, and made her drive. She said that she never knows what is going to \"set him off.\" She stated that it was \"horrible because [she has] tried for a long time to protect [her] children\" from Respondent's anger, but he just continues to get angry in front of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 18} With respect to the children, Petitioner said that they witness Respondent yelling at her. She explained that things are very tense when Respondent is with them. Petitioner testified that on Mother's Day 2017, Respondent asked Q.D. to brush his teeth. When Q.D. did not brush his teeth \"quickly enough,\" Respondent lifted Q.D. up and started to shout at him with his face in Q.D.'s face. Petitioner stated that when Respondent lifted Q.D. \"up like he did,\" she almost called the police. The only reason she did not was because she was afraid of what Respondent would do before the police got there. Since that happened, Q.D. \"stays very close to her,\" looking for comfort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Petitioner further described how M.T.D. \"soils himself\" when Respondent is around, but does not when Respondent is not with them. She stated that because they see Respondent more since they have been back in Ohio, M.T.D. has had \"substantial incidents of soiling. And it was always when Respondent was around.\" M.T.D. asked her not to tell Respondent that he defecates in his underwear because he is afraid of what Respondent would do. Petitioner also described how when M.T.D. is on the computer, Respondent will \"pop up\" on the screen when M.T.D. is not expecting him. M.T.D. sees Respondent, slams his computer shut, and \"sit[s] in the bathroom for a half an hour.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Petitioner testified that since she obtained the CPO, the children's issues have improved. She stated that they used to wet the bed regularly but that it has stopped entirely since Respondent has not been around them. She also said that M.T.D.'s \"soiling\" has completely stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Petitioner admitted on cross-examination that Respondent could go to his dentist by driving past Petitioner's yoga studio. But she said that it would be out of the way to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 22} When asked how she knows that Respondent has accessed the IP address at her parents' house so that he could follow her when she is on wifi, she stated that he told her that he did so. Also, after the incident where Respondent called Petitioner 22 times in a row, and then called her parents' house phone and her mother's cell phone, Respondent later told her that he could track her phone and her mother's phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Petitioner also explained that the only way Respondent could have figured out that she was using her \"secret phone\" was because she forgot that he could follow her with the wifi and turned on the wifi on the phone. After that, Respondent called her regular phone and then called her \"secret phone.\" In fact, he called the \"secret phone\" three times in May 2017. She has never answered the secret phone when he calls it. Petitioner admitted, however, that the \"secret phone\" was one that she had gotten a long time ago and that Respondent knew the number in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 24} When asked on cross-examination if she had evidence that Respondent could monitor her internet activity, Petitioner testified that Respondent told her that he monitors her internet activity and showed her how he monitors her. She also explained that they have a tenant living in the London apartment. She stated that when she filed for the CPO, the tenant, who also works in \"IT,\" \"complained to [her] because of Respondent bringing down his internet access remotely.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 25} When asked how she knows that Respondent \"hacked [her] email,\" Petitioner responded that Respondent told her that he did. Petitioner said that Respondent has \"hacked\" into her email before the relevant time period and during the relevant time period. When asked, \"give me one date in one email that he's hacked,\" Petitioner responded, \"you don't seem to appreciate that he hack[s] my * * * email on a regular daily basis. He monitors my emails. He reads the things I look at, what websites I've gone to. He stalks me electronically.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Petitioner further stated that Respondent told her that he has a right to know every thought in her head. He also told her that he memorizes her passcode so that he can get into her phone and continues to observe her to obtain her new passcodes when she changes them. He also sends emails to himself from her email account that he hacked. Petitioner explained that Respondent has hacked into all three of her email accounts. She said that he has also sent her an email to one of her accounts from another one of her accounts that he hacked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Petitioner stated on cross-examination that Respondent set up a computer program on the laptop that she used in London that would essentially take a \"screen shot\" of whatever website she typed into the computer. He also could obtain her passwords by using this program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Petitioner agreed that she went to Las Vegas on a research trip for two days in May 2017. She said that she left the children with Respondent at her parents' house, but her parents were there too. Petitioner agreed that she lets Respondent drive the children to their sporting events, which she explained is a \"three minute drive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Petitioner also agreed that on Mother's Day, she, Respondent, and the children went kayaking or canoeing in the morning. When they returned, that is\n   when Respondent threatened her that this could be her last Mother's Day. Petitioner agreed that after Respondent threatened her, they all went to lunch at the Cleveland Museum of Art, then to Severance Hall for a concert, and then to a steakhouse for dinner with her parents. Petitioner stated that her mood was \"okay\" despite the fact that Respondent had threatened her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Petitioner identified a cell phone photo on cross-examination of herself, her mother, and both children that was taken on Mother's Day at 8:40 p.m., and she agreed that they \"all look happy.\" She said that the \"toothbrush incident\" with Q.D. occurred after the photo was taken, but she could not remember exactly what time it was. She further identified text messages between her and Respondent between 9:33 and 10:00 p.m., where Petitioner texted Respondent and said, \"Hi while you are at Walgreens if you happen to see Justin's dark peanut butter cup two pack for me please? They may not have them.\" Respondent then texted her that he did not see them so he was going to stop at Giant Eagle. Respondent then asked Petitioner, \"[p]lease ask your mom if she needs anything from there as I'm out.\" Petitioner replied, \"Thanks I've asked and she doesn't need anything. That is very nice of you to stop extra.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Petitioner further agreed on cross-examination that she allowed Q.D. to go to Catawba Island for Easter with Respondent by himself, which was one day before she, M.T.D., and Petitioner's parents went to Catawba. But Petitioner explained that her brother was at Catawba too, so Respondent was not alone with M.T.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Petitioner testified on cross-examination that she and Respondent took the children on a couple of trips together in March 2017. They went to Washington D.C. with her mother. Petitioner, her mother, and Q.D. drove there together, and Respondent and M.T.D. drove in a separate car. They also stayed in separate places; Petitioner, her mother, and Q.D. stayed at her sister's and Respondent and M.T.D. stayed at his brother's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Also in March 2017, Petitioner, Respondent, and the children drove to Atlanta for two days. They then drove to Orlando to go to Universal Studios. Petitioner said that her mother was with them as well. Petitioner identified a photo of herself, Respondent, and Q.D. from when they were at Universal. Petitioner agreed that she let Respondent and M.T.D. \"go off by themselves for a period of time\" at Universal. Petitioner stated that M.T.D. \"soiled himself when he was with Respondent alone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Respondent's counsel further questioned Petitioner as to how she could let Respondent drive M.T.D. to his sporting events if M.T.D. \"soils himself\" when he is with Respondent. Petitioner responded, \"[i]t's a minute drive to the soccer field.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Petitioner agreed that she went to Atlanta for a couple of days in January 2017 and left the children with Respondent and her parents. She also agreed that she went to Dartmouth for a reunion weekend in October 2016 and to Tanzania for three weeks in September 2016. She said that she left the children with her parents but agreed that Respondent came to visit them while she was gone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Respondent testified as if on cross-examination that he and Petitioner first had \"marital discord\" in 2014, when he found emails of hers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Respondent agreed that he texted Petitioner to ask her why she was not at yoga when she said she would be at yoga and further agreed that he sent a\n   photo to her of the front of the yoga studio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Respondent agreed that Petitioner was upset with him when he told her that he \"checked the IP address,\" and she was not supposed to be where she said she was going to be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Respondent agreed that \"there was an issue\" of him \"tape recording\" or \"video recording\" Petitioner, but that he claimed in his deposition that it \"was for a sex tape.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Respondent identified the photos that Petitioner had taken in London of what she suspected was a device recording her in her bedroom. Respondent agreed that is what he set up \"for a sex tape.\" Respondent stated that the device was a cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Respondent further agreed that he was aware of one incident when M.T.D. defecated in his underwear and that the children \"had problems wetting the bed\" when he was there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 41} After the full hearing, the magistrate granted the CPO, naming Petitioner and the two children as protected persons, and ordered that it would be effective for one year, or until August 24, 2018. The magistrate made the following findings of fact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Petitioner was sworn and gave testimony that supports finding that Respondent committed domestic violence as defined in R.C. 3113.31 and that the Petitioner and the parties' minor children are in danger of domestic violence. Although Petitioner's testimony was frequently hyperbolized and rehearsed, the basics of her story rang true and she testified credibly about them. Respondent's testimony was evasive and strained, but occasionally credible. The parties have lived separately for over a year. Respondent engaged in a pattern of electronically stalking Petitioner and the minor children while the parties lived separately. He frightened the Petitioner and the children by demonstrating to them, with frequency, that he electronically monitored their whereabouts, their computer use, their phone use and other activities. Through his pattern of conduct Respondent knowingly caused mental distress to Petitioner and to the children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 42} The trial court adopted the magistrate's decision on the same day. Respondent filed objections to the trial court's adoption of the magistrate's order granting the CPO after the full hearing and to the magistrate's order denying his motion for an emergency discovery order (to obtain the London records). Petitioner filed a brief in opposition to Respondent's arguments, but did not file objections to any part of the trial court's adoption of the magistrate's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 43} The trial court sustained Respondent's objections and vacated the CPO. In doing so, the trial court found that the magistrate's time limitations failed to provide Respondent sufficient time to cross-examine Petitioner and to testify on direct examination, which denied his due process rights. The trial court further found that the facts presented at the full hearing did not support the issuance of a CPO. Petitioner timely appealed the trial court's judgment vacating the CPO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Subsequent to filing a notice of appeal regarding the trial court's judgment vacating the CPO, Petitioner also filed a motion for new trial and motion for relief from judgment. The trial court denied\n   both of these motions. Petitioner appealed from this judgment as well. This court consolidated Petitioner's two appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Magistrate's Implementation of the Parties' Agreement to Limit the Presentation of Their Case to One and One-Half Hours\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 56} In her first assignment of error, Petitioner acknowledges that she agreed to limit the presentation of her case to one and one-half hours per the parties' agreement. She maintains, however, that the magistrate did not afford her the full 90 minutes. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 57} We can glean from the record that Petitioner's counsel began presenting her case at 1:44 p.m. If there would have been no interruptions, Petitioner should have finished her case at 3:14 p.m. During the presentation of her case, however, magistrate took a 20-minute break, which means that Petitioner should have had - at a minimum - until 3:35 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Before the 20-minute break began, the magistrate stated, \"Okay. We're going to resume at 2:40.\" That means that the break started at 2:20 p.m. (since Petitioner started at 1:44 p.m, she used up 36 minutes of her time and would have 54 minutes remaining, which would have been until 3:34 p.m.). Although it is not clear what time Petitioner's counsel completed presenting Petitioner's case, it is clear from the record that Respondent's counsel began cross-examining Petitioner at 3:30 p.m. We know this because at the end of the break, the magistrate stated to Petitioner's counsel that he would have until 3:30 and that Respondent's counsel would have until 5:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 59} The transcript near the end of the full hearing also supports the fact that Respondent's counsel began at 3:30 p.m. because Petitioner's counsel attempted to stop Respondent's counsel from cross-examining Petitioner at 4:45 p.m., arguing that Respondent's counsel had used all of his time. The magistrate disagreed and stated that Respondent's counsel was \"out of time at 5 o'clock. Have a seat[.]\" Thus, Petitioner's counsel definitely finished presenting her case before or at 3:30 p.m. Assuming that the magistrate resumed the hearing at 2:40 p.m. after the break (and there is nothing in the record to indicate that it did not do so), Petitioner's counsel\n   should have had until at least 3:34 p.m. to present her case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Accordingly, Petitioner was deprived of at least four minutes and possibly five minutes to present her case. One could argue that four or five minutes would be harmless, but not under the unique facts of this case. Petitioner could have used those four or five minutes to rebut some of the testimony elicited from Respondent's counsel on cross-examination. And considering the fact that the trial court found Petitioner's cross-examination testimony to be significant and damaging to her case, we cannot say that it was harmless error for the magistrate to prevent Petitioner from using her entire 90 minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 61} We sustain Petitioner's first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Trial Court Erred When It Determined That Respondent Was Denied His Right to a Full Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 62} In her second assignment of error, Petitioner argues that the trial court erred when it determined that the magistrate denied Respondent his right to a full hearing. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 63} The trial court stated in its judgment entry sustaining Respondent's objections and vacating the CPO:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Although not raised by Respondent in his Objections, the Court's review of the transcript of the \"full hearing\" required by statute indicates that the requirement of R.C. 3113.31(D)(2)(a) that Respondent be given \"an opportunity to be heard\" was not met.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   In a Judgment Entry dated August 8, 2017, the parties and counsel agreed to the August 21 date. The magistrate inserted, \"Each party will get 1-1/2 hours total to present their case.\" At the commencement of the scheduled trial the Magistrate limited each party to \"* * * one-and-a-half hours to present their case[;]\" and restricted testimony to the parties alone. The Magistrate then allowed counsel for Petitioner to begin her case-in-chief by calling Respondent as a witness on cross-examination; afterwards, Petitioner testified\n   <em>\n    on direct\n   </em>\n   in support of her Petition, using all of her 1-1/2 hours. (Tr. 78) Respondent had to use his time to cross-examine Petitioner; however, because of the time limit imposed by the Magistrate, he was cut off before he concluded. (Tr. 154). The time restriction imposed by the Magistrate resulted in the Respondent being denied an opportunity to testify in his own behalf or otherwise present his case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Here, the Magistrate elected to put a time limit on the length of the full hearing (3 hours) and allocated half the time to each party. In doing so, however, she did not make clear whether Respondent's cross-examination of Petitioner counted toward Petitioner's time or his. In effect, the Magistrate gave Petitioner three full hours for her case and\n   <em>\n    no time\n   </em>\n   for Respondent to rebut the testimony. Likewise, counting cross-examination of Petitioner against Respondent's trial time created a Hobson's choice for Respondent's attorney: between thoroughly crossing Petitioner and putting on his own rebuttal case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   (Emphasis sic.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 64} The trial court stated that the \"magistrate inserted '[e]ach party will get 1-1/2 hours total to present their case.' \" But the statement that each party would get one and one-half hours to present his and her case was part of an agreed judgment entry signed by the trial court, the magistrate, and both parties and their counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Further, the trial court found that although the magistrate limited the full hearing to three hours, \"she did not make clear whether Respondent's cross-examination of Petitioner counted toward Petitioner's time or his.\" We disagree. A review of the transcript shows that the magistrate made it perfectly clear to the parties that the entirety of the full hearing was limited to three hours, with each party having one and one-half hours to present his and her case. There is no ambiguity in the magistrate's order or statements at the hearing. Indeed, at the full hearing, neither party nor their counsel asked the magistrate any questions that would indicate that they did not understand what the time limit entailed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Accordingly, we sustain Petitioner's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Limiting All Testimony to Events That Occurred Within One Year of the Filing of the Petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 67} In her third assignment of error, Petitioner argues that the magistrate arbitrarily limited the presentation of her evidence to events that occurred within one year of her filing the domestic violence CPO. She filed her petition on May 31, 2017, which meant that the magistrate limited the evidence to events that occurred on or after June 1, 2016. Petitioner contends that this decision, and the trial court's sanctioning of it, prevented her from establishing that her fear was reasonable under R.C. 3113.31(A)(1)(a)(ii). We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 68} R.C. 3113.31(A)(1)(a)(ii) defines domestic violence in relevant part as \"[p]lacing another person by the threat of force in fear of imminent serious physical harm[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 69} R.C. Chapter 3113 does not define \"force,\" \"serious physical harm,\" or \"imminent.\" Force, however, is defined elsewhere in the Ohio Revised Code as \"any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.\" R.C. 2901.01(A)(1). Serious physical harm is defined in R.C. 2901.01(A)(5) as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   (a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity; (d) Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   (e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 70} \"Imminent\" is not defined in the domestic violence statute or elsewhere in the Ohio Revised Code.

By doing so, she prevented the Petitioner from presenting testimony regarding events that occurred between her and the Respondent that could have helped her establish that her fear of imminent serious physical harm was reasonable. This is because, as we stated, \"[a] court may determine the reasonableness of the petitioner's fear by reference to the parties' history and past acts of domestic violence.\"\n   <em>\n    Burnett\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15, citing\n   <em>\n    Kiedrowicz v.

Thus, we agree with Petitioner that the magistrate improperly limited the testimony to events that occurred after June 1, 2016. Evidence of past domestic violence is highly relevant to establishing whether Petitioner's fear was reasonable. In this case, Petitioner testified that Respondent threatened to kill Petitioner by chopping her body up and throwing it in the river. Petitioner testified that she was scared because Respondent\n   was so calm when he said it. Petitioner further stated that Respondent went as far as to explain to her how he would cover it up. And then two weeks prior to the ex parte hearing, Respondent threatened Petitioner, saying that she should enjoy Mother's Day because it may be her last. Based on Petitioner's testimony of Respondent's extremely controlling behavior, coupled with his threats to kill the Petitioner and alluding to the fact that he may kill her, these events were all pertinent to establishing whether Petitioner's fear of imminent serious physical harm was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b6 76} We further note that Petitioner was attempting to establish that Respondent committed domestic violence against her by \"committing a violation of section 2903.211[.]\" R.C. 2903.211 sets forth the requirements for menacing by stalking.
