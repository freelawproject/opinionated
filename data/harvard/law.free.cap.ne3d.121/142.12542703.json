Taylor (\"Taylor\") appeals the trial court's order revoking his probation and ordering him to serve his six-year sentence in the Indiana Department of Correction (\"the DOC\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [2] We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [3] In October 2017, Taylor pleaded guilty to Count I, criminal confinement\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a Level 5 felony; Count II, domestic battery with a previous domestic battery conviction\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a Level 6 felony; and Count V, resisting law enforcement\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a Class A misdemeanor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to his plea agreement, the trial court sentenced Taylor to six years for Count I, three years of which were to be served on home detention with Allen County Community Corrections (\"Community Corrections\") and three years suspended to probation. The trial court also sentenced Taylor to two years for Count II and one year for Count V and ordered the sentences for all three convictions to be served concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [4] Community Corrections approved Taylor's participation in the home detention program on October 30, 2017, only after Taylor's friend Maria agreed that he could serve the first two weeks of detention in her home. However, friction between Maria and Taylor arose when Taylor overstayed his welcome, leaving Maria to pay for his food, housing, and other living expenses. On November 26, 2017, Maria told Taylor he could no longer stay in her home. The two fought, and county police officers were called about the domestic disturbance. Before leaving Maria's home that night, Taylor called Community Corrections to alert them about the change in his housing situation, and a representative from Community Corrections ordered Taylor to report directly to the Community Corrections facility \"to resolve this residential issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Tr. Vol. 1\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [5] As part of home detention, Taylor was required to wear an electronic GPS monitoring device (\"ankle monitor\"). Testimony at the revocation hearing revealed that Taylor did not, as ordered, go directly to Community Corrections. Community Corrections Officer Kevin McIntosh (\"Officer McIntosh\") testified that his unit had tracked Taylor, via his ankle monitor, travelling from Maria's home to a nearby housing addition where he \"milled around\" for some time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Taylor] then went to a gas station and walked across a large field and milled around there for a few minutes. Then he crossed over, I believe it was Maplecrest, over to the rear of a cemetery and was walking behind the cemetery. He then went to a church across the road and milled around the church, hid behind a dumpster it appeared for a few minutes, and then continued on across the road behind Galbraith's Landscaping, along the creek, several hundred yards, I believe, off the road.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [6] County police officers responded to the report of a domestic disturbance and, after finding Taylor by the creek, detained him. Officer McIntosh joined the county officers, and when he got about twenty feet away from Taylor, he could hear the beeping of Taylor's ankle monitor. Officer McIntosh explained that the ankle monitor makes a beeping noise \"whenever a message has been sent to it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. A printout revealed that Community Corrections personnel had sent three messages to Taylor's ankle monitor and had also tried to call him three times. Taylor explained that he did not answer the calls because he was on the phone with someone else at the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. Before Taylor was taken into custody, police confiscated a black backpack and a small paring knife, which the police considered to be \"a weapon\"; Taylor had taken both items from Maria's home without her permission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [7] On November 27, 2017, the State charged Taylor with Class A misdemeanor unauthorized absence from home detention, a charge to which Taylor later pleaded guilty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Appellant's Br\n   </em>\n   . at 15. Over the following week, the State filed a petition to\n   <em>\n    revoke\n   </em>\n   Taylor's\n   <em>\n    placement\n   </em>\n   in home detention, and the Allen County Probation Department filed a petition to\n   <em>\n    revoke probation\n   </em>\n   . The latter petition alleged that Taylor: (1) failed to maintain good behavior when he committed the new crime of unauthorized absence from home detention; and (2) failed to maintain good behavior when he did not successfully complete home detention.\n   <em>\n    Appellant's App\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Vol. II\n   </em>\n   at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [8] During a February 2018 hearing on the petition to revoke his probation, Taylor argued that he had left his authorized residence, Maria's home, only after Community Corrections ordered him to \"walk down\" to their offices.\n   <em>\n    Tr. Vol. 1\n   </em>\n   at 40-41. The evidence revealed that Taylor \"milled around\" a nearby housing addition, went to a gas station, walked around the back of a cemetery, wandered around a church, hid behind a dumpster for a few minutes, and then wandered along a creek.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. Taylor admitted that he took a circuitous route to Community Corrections but testified that it was not his \"intention to evade law enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40. He claimed that he took that route because Maria had threatened him with a knife, and he was afraid she might continue to follow him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38, 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [9] The trial court found that, while Taylor was authorized to leave Maria's home, he was not authorized to travel to the gas station or the church, nor was he authorized to stop behind the dumpster.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61-62. Furthermore, Taylor did not respond to the clear beeping of his monitor-notification that Community Corrections had sent messages to his monitor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62. The trial court found that Taylor had violated the terms of both his Community Corrections and his probation, revoked Taylor's participation in those two programs, and ordered him to serve his six-year sentence in the DOC. Taylor appeals only the revocation of his probation and his six-year executed sentence in the DOC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion and Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [10] Citing to Indiana Appellate Rule 7(B), Taylor characterizes his issues as whether the revocation of his probation and the imposition of his six-year sentence were inappropriate in light of the nature of the offenses and the character of the offender.\n   <em>\n    Appellant's Br\n   </em>\n   . at 4. We remind Taylor's counsel that a trial court's action in a post-sentence probation violation proceeding is not a criminal sentence as contemplated by Appellate Rule 7(B).\n   <em>\n    Wooten v.

Taylor's admission that he pleaded guilty to Class A misdemeanor unauthorized absence from home detention constituted an admission that he was not maintaining good behavior.

Nevertheless, he made the mistake of not going directly to their office. Furthermore, Taylor did not respond to either the beeping of his monitor or the telephone calls from Community Corrections personnel. The trial court noted that Taylor \"did not respond to [Community Corrections'] attempts to communicate and verify the reasoning for [his] deviation in [his] route of travel to the point that [Community Corrections] had to dispatch officers in an attempt to locate [him] because [he was] not where [he was] supposed to be or doing what [he was] supposed to be doing.\"\n   <em>\n    Tr.

On appeal, Taylor has provided no evidence that the trial court abused its discretion when it ordered him to serve his suspended sentence. While it was within the trial court's discretion to continue Taylor's probation, with or without modifying the probation conditions, or to extend the probationary period for up to one year, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it ordered Taylor to serve his suspended sentence of six years in the DOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [17] Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Riley, J., and Robb, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-42-3-3\">\n     Ind.
