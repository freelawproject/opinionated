He presents multiple issues for our review, which we consolidate and restate as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   1. Whether Williams received ineffective assistance of counsel during his guilty plea hearing; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   2. Whether the post-conviction court committed error by allegedly adopting the State's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [2] On December 17, 1990, the State charged Williams with Class D felony theft.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 25, 1991, Williams entered a plea agreement with the State whereby Williams would plead guilty as charged and receive a sentence of one year, in exchange for the State declining to file habitual offender charges against Williams based on prior unrelated convictions. Williams and his attorney, Lori Howard, signed the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [3] On June 13, 1991, the trial court held a change of plea and sentencing hearing. Howard was not present at that hearing, and Maureen Keefe acted as counsel in Howard's absence. The trial court accepted Williams' plea and heard a factual basis therefor, ensured Williams understood the relinquishment of certain rights by taking the plea, and sentenced him according to the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [4] On March 14, 2012, Williams filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition for post-conviction relief, alleging he was not represented at the change of plea hearing. That petition was dismissed without prejudice on December 16, 2013. On August 11, 2014, Williams refiled his petition for post-conviction relief and amended that petition in July 2016. On January 11, 2017, the post-conviction court held an evidentiary hearing on Williams' petition for post-conviction relief. Williams did not testify at that hearing, nor did he call any witnesses. After the evidentiary hearing, the post-conviction court directed the parties to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. On October 6, 2017, the post-conviction court issued an order denying Williams' petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Discussion and Decision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [5] Post-conviction proceedings afford petitioners a limited opportunity to raise issues that were unavailable or unknown at trial and on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    Davidson v.

Instead, Howard's colleague, Keefe, was present. Williams contends the State did not prove Keefe was an attorney, and thus he was not represented at the change of plea hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [9] Regarding this issue, the post-conviction court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   4. On June 13, 1991, the Trial Court conducted Petitioner's Guilty Plea and Sentencing, Attorney. [sic] The Trial Court's Order of Judgment of Convictions reveals that attorney \"M. Keefe,\" appeared at the Plea and Sentencing on behalf of attorney Lori Howard. The Post-Conviction court, relying on its familiarity with Marion County Criminal Defense Bar of the early 1990's is confident that the respective attorneys were Lori Howard and Maureen Keefe, both of whom were Marion County Deputy Public Defenders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Appealed Order at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [10] During the Post-Conviction proceedings, the State presented a copy of the Abstract of Judgment, which listed \"M.

Howard[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) Finally, during the change of plea hearing, the following exchange occurred between Williams and the Judge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [Judge]: And are you satisfied with your attorney's representations in this matter?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [Williams]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [Judge]: Now you understand this lawyer didn't represent you; your regular P.D.'s gone today.

As noted in the transcript, Howard negotiated the plea and the corresponding sentence prior to the change of plea hearing. Williams and Howard signed the plea on April 25, 1991. (App. Vol. II at 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [12] Williams received substantial benefit from the plea. The State was prepared to offer testimony from store security that Williams hid merchandise and left the store without paying for it. The State also had closed circuit television footage of Williams committing the crime. The State was prepared to file a habitual offender charge based on Williams' past convictions, which could have increased his sentence by at least ten years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-50-2-8\">\n    Ind.

In addition, Williams received a one-year sentence for a Class D felony, which was less than the one-and-one-half-year presumptive sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-50-2-7\">\n    Ind.

He indicated he was satisfied with Howard's performance and eventually acquiesced to Keefe's representation. The trial court accepted the plea as signed by Williams, Howard, and the State. Williams has not demonstrated he suffered prejudice by Keefe's representation at his change of plea hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Willoughby v.

Our Indiana Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   It is not uncommon for a trial court to enter findings that are verbatim reproductions of submissions by the prevailing party. The trial courts of this state are faced with an enormous volume of cases and few have the law clerks and other resources that would be available in a more perfect world to help craft more elegant trial court findings and legal reasoning. We recognize that the need to keep the docket moving is properly a high priority of our trial bench. For this reason, we do not prohibit the practice of adopting a party's proposed findings. But when this occurs, there is an inevitable erosion of the confidence of an appellate court that the findings reflect the considered judgment of the trial court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Prowell v.
