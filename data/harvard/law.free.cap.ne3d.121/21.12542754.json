The trial court found Patrick N. Harris, defendant below and appellant herein, guilty of obstructing official business, in violation of R.C. 2921.31, and possessing an open container of alcohol, in violation of R.C. 4301.62. Appellant raises the following assignment of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   \"THE EXPLANATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES WAS INSUFFICIENT TO ALLOW THE TRIAL COURT TO MAKE A FINDING OF GUILTY UPON THE DEFENDANT'S PLEA OF NO CONTEST.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On November 5, 2017, shortly after midnight, Ohio University Police Lieutenant Farin Barber encountered appellant and appellant's two adult children, a son and a daughter. The lieutenant noticed that both appellant and appellant's daughter possessed open containers of alcohol. Lieutenant Barber approached appellant and asked him to \"turn around\" so the lieutenant could remove the open container\n   from appellant's person. Appellant refused to comply. Instead, appellant handed the open container to appellant's son and told his son to dispose of the open container. Appellant also instructed his daughter to leave the scene. Lieutenant Barber subsequently arrested appellant and charged him with obstructing official business and possessing an open container of alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Subsequently, appellant entered no-contest pleas to the two charges. At the plea hearing, appellant indicated that, although he agreed to enter no-contest pleas, he did not believe that the facts sufficiently established the offense of obstructing official business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At the change of plea hearing, the prosecutor offered Lieutenant Barber's report as the explanation of circumstances. The report states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2017, at zero thirty-two hours while patrolling in the area of 134 Mill Street, I observed a male later identified as 54 year old Patrick N. Harris with an open container of beer, Red Stripe, tucked under his right arm. I also observed a female with an open container of wine * * * standing next to Mr. Harris, later identified as 22 year old Kaitlyn A. Harris. I asked Mr. Harris to turn around so I could remove the bottle from under his arm. Mr. Harris looked at me and said, no. I then informed Mr. Harris that he was in possession of an open container. He handed it to his son and said, throw this out and throw it in the grass. Mr. Harris then told Ms. Harris and his son to leave the area. I informed Mr. Harris that Ms. Harris was not to leave, and she was also containing [sic] an open container, and if she attempted to leave she would be arrested. Mr. Harris again told both to leave and was placed under arrest for obstruction of official business. While placing Mr. Harris in handcuffs, he attempted to ask his son to intervene in the arrest, and his son said, what am I supposed to do? Mr. Harris then stated, you are making a big mistake, I was a judge, and you can't arrest me. While near the patrol car, Mr. Harris shoved backwards attempting to knock me off balance and said, go, now, leave now, speaking to Ms. Harris. I then called for backup and ordered Ms. Harris to place her hands on the back of my patrol car. Ms. Harris refused and said, what do I do? Mr. Harris again told Ms. Harris to leave. I again ordered Ms. Harris to place her hands on my patrol car and to not leave or she would also be arrested for obstruction. Ms. Harris then turned around and walked away in the direction of Stewart Street. I informed arriving officers to place Ms. Harris under arrest for obstruction of official business. Both were transported back to OUPD for processing.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Following the prosecutor's explanation of circumstances, appellant entered no-contest pleas to both charges, and the trial court found appellant guilty as charged. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In his sole assignment of error, appellant asserts that the prosecution's explanation of circumstances did not sufficiently establish the essential elements of the offense of obstructing official business. In particular, he contends that the facts fail to show that he committed an affirmative act, or that his conduct actually interfered with the officer's investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Generally, appellate courts conduct a de novo review of a trial court's finding of guilt pursuant to a no-contest plea in a misdemeanor case.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, appellant did not simply refuse to obey the officer's request to \"turn around,\" but, instead, affirmatively handed the container to another individual. Furthermore, appellant directed his daughter, whom the officer also suspected of possessing an open container, to flee the scene. The officer explicitly informed appellant that appellant's daughter could not depart the area, yet appellant again told her to leave. Thus, appellant's verbal instruction to his daughter to leave the area constituted an affirmative act of disobedience, not a mere failure to refuse to comply with the officer's request. Again, appellant directly contravened the officer's order that appellant's daughter could not leave the area. Moreover, when the officer arrested appellant, appellant instructed his son to intervene and continued to advise his daughter to leave the scene. We therefore reject appellant's assertion that his conduct constituted a mere refusal to respond and that he did not engage in an affirmative act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant next asserts that even if he engaged in an affirmative act, none of his actions actually hampered or impeded the officer's investigation. Appellant first contends that even if telling his son to discard the container constituted an affirmative act, the explanation of circumstances fails to reveal how this affirmative act hampered or impeded the investigation. Appellant also observes that the explanation of circumstances did not indicate whether appellant's son actually discarded the container, as appellant ordered. Appellant thus claims that the explanation of circumstances fails to show that appellant's alleged affirmative act adversely affected the officer's investigation. Appellant also argues that, even if advising his children to leave the scene of an active investigation constituted an affirmative act, the explanation of circumstances shows that his children did not, in fact, leave the scene. Because his children did not leave the scene, appellant reasons, his conduct did not actually hamper or impede the officer's investigation. Appellant further points out that the officer ultimately successfully arrested both him and his daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Many Ohio court decisions indicate that an obstructing official business conviction does not require that the defendant \"be successful in preventing the officers from doing their job.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although appellant asserts that his conduct did not actually prevent the lieutenant from concluding his investigation and arresting appellant and appellant's daughter, we observe that the question under the obstruction statute is not whether a defendant prevented an officer from completing an official duty, but rather whether the defendant made the officer's performance of that duty more difficult.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wellman\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In\n   <em>\n    Novak\n   </em>\n   , for example, we affirmed the defendant's conviction for obstructing official business even though the defendant asserted that his conduct did not prevent the officers from completing the official duty. The defendant argued that he could not be convicted under the obstruction statute when a false statement that he gave to the law enforcement officers did not actually hamper or impede their apprehension of a suspect. The defendant claimed that the officers ultimately apprehended the suspect and that his false statement did not, therefore, hamper or impede their efforts. We, however, rejected the defendant's argument. We emphasized that the defendant's conduct needed\n   only to delay, impede or obstruct-and not completely prevent-the officers' apprehension of the suspect to constitute a violation of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 20} For this same reason, we reject appellant's argument that his conduct did not actually hamper or impede the officer's investigation of the open-container violations or the arrest of appellant and appellant's daughter. Even though the officer ultimately successfully arrested both appellant and his daughter, the officer noted that appellant hindered the investigation and arrests by advising his son to intervene in the arrest and by advising his daughter to leave the scene. The officer further noted that appellant's conduct required him to contact other officers for assistance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Overholt\n   </em>\n   at *3 (determining that defendant's actions sufficiently hampered or impeded officer when defendant's conduct caused officer \"to characterize the situation as high-risk and to fear for his own safety and the safety of other officers on the scene\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Moreover, appellant's affirmative acts hampered or impeded the officer's open-container investigation. Appellant's act of handing the open container to his son, combined with instructions to his daughter to leave the area, delayed the officer's investigation into the alleged violation. Both actions interfered with the officer's ability to investigate whether appellant and his daughter were, in fact, violating the statute. Even if the officer ultimately successfully completed his investigation, appellant's conduct nevertheless hampered or impeded the officer's investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Consequently, after our review we believe that the prosecutor's explanation of circumstances adequately shows that appellant committed an affirmative act, and that appellant's act actually hampered or impeded the officer's performance of his official duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant's assignment of error and affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Hoover, P.J. &amp; Harsha, J.: Concur in Judgment &amp; Opinion\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
