Although the Hospital identified the reason for his termination as theft of food from the Hospital's cafeteria, Perkins contends that he was fired because, believing he had been subpoenaed, he testified at a former co-worker's unemployment benefits appeal hearing. The Hospital filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that Perkins was an at-will employee and that because he was never actually subpoenaed to testify at the unemployment hearing, the public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine did not apply. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Hospital. Perkins appeals, arguing that summary judgment was improperly granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   [2] We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts &amp; Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [3] Perkins, who had served as a Michigan State Trooper for over thirty years, began working for the Hospital as a security officer on June 27, 2011. In 2014, the Hospital's security department became a\n   full-fledged police department, at which time Perkins became a police officer for the Hospital. Perkins never entered into a written employment contract with the Hospital, and he was never promised continued employment through any specific date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [4] On May 12, 2015, Perkins left his shift at the Hospital early, but did not elaborate as to why he needed to leave. Perkins then went to the unemployment benefits appeal hearing for Rick Bradley, a former co-worker, believing he had been subpoenaed to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Craig Whitfield, the Assistant Chief of the Hospital's police department, learned of the unemployment hearing and knew that Perkins had left his shift early. Whitfield \"put two and two together\" and then he and Dan Rutledge, the Chief of the Hospital's police department, drove to the unemployment hearing and confirmed that Perkins was there upon seeing his vehicle in the parking lot.\n   <em>\n    Appellant's Appendix\n   </em>\n   at 137.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [5] The Hospital did not appear for the unemployment hearing, choosing not to contest Bradley's request for unemployment benefits. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) did not issue the requested subpoenas to Bradley's three witnesses, including Perkins, but nevertheless, all three witnesses testified before the ALJ. Perkins maintains that his testimony concerned only the Hospital's policies that related to Bradley's termination, with the apparent import being that there was no just cause therefor. At some point after the hearing, Whitfield listened to a recording of what transpired at the unemployment benefits appeal hearing to find out the substance of Perkins's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [6] On June 7, 2015, a cashier at the Hospital's cafeteria reported to Whitfield that when Perkins went through the line to pay for his food, Perkins did not mention that he had gotten gravy, and thus, Perkins received gravy with his meal without paying for it. Whitfield investigated the matter and determined that Perkins had on two other occasions received a biscuit from the Hospital's cafeteria without paying for it. Perkins explained that he often had breakfast at the Hospital's cafeteria on weekends, each time ordering an omelet and often times, but not always, sliding down the food line to get biscuits and gravy before grabbing a bottle of water. He would then proceed to the cashier where he may or may not have opened his container to show his food to the cashier. Perkins maintains that the amounts charged often varied even if he purchased the same thing. He would pay with his credit card and discard the receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [7] Employee theft was a violation of the Hospital's standard of conduct and was grounds for termination. On June 18, 2015, Perkins was terminated for stealing food from the Hospital's cafeteria. Prior to his termination, Perkins had not received any disciplinary complaints and had never been written up for violations of the employee handbook.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [8] On September 2, 2016, Perkins filed a complaint against the Hospital for wrongful termination. On January 16, 2018, the Hospital filed a motion for summary judgment and designation of evidence, arguing that Perkins was an employee at-will and that he was terminated for a valid, lawful reason. Perkins filed a response in opposition thereto, claiming that under the facts of the case, an exception to the at-will doctrine applied. The trial court held a hearing on the summary\n   judgment motion on March 8, 2018, and four days later, issued its order granting summary judgment in favor of the Hospital. The trial court accepted as true Perkins's claim that he was terminated in retaliation for testifying at a former co-worker's unemployment benefits appeal hearing, but nonetheless determined that because Perkins did not have a duty to do so under Indiana law, he did not establish that he was entitled to the protections of the public policy exception to the employment-at-will doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion &amp; Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [9] We review summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the trial court: \"Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of ... the non-moving parties, summary judgment is appropriate 'if the designated evidentiary matter shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Perkins and the Hospital both agree that the issue on appeal is whether Perkins's act of testifying at the unemployment hearing falls within the public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine. Perkins maintains that his good faith belief that he had been subpoenaed to testify at the unemployment hearing gave rise to a duty to testify. The Hospital argues that Perkins did not exercise a statutory right, and he did not have a duty to testify at Bradley's unemployment hearing because he was never actually subpoenaed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [14] In support of his position, Perkins directs us to\n   <em>\n    Frampton v. Cent. Ind. Gas Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1798980\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ind/260/249/\">\n    260 Ind. 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=297%20N.E.2d%20425\">\n    297 N.E.2d 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973), wherein our Supreme Court first recognized the public policy exception to the at-will doctrine. In\n   <em>\n    Frampton\n   </em>\n   , an employee brought an action against her former employer for retaliatory discharge that she alleged stemmed from her filing of a worker's compensation claim. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Notwithstanding that there were no cases holding that retaliatory discharge for filing a worker's compensation claim was actionable, the court found that such was \"a wrongful, unconscionable act and should be actionable in a court of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 252,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=297%20N.E.2d%20425\">\n    297 N.E.2d 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Drawing parallels with cases recognizing retaliatory evictions in landlord-tenant law, the Court concluded that the employee had stated a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court commented that \"when an employee is discharged solely for exercising a statutorily conferred right an exception to the general rule must be recognized.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=297%20N.E.2d%20425\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=297%20N.E.2d%20425\">\n    at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [15] Perkins asserts that \"[i]t is not fanciful or folly to suggest that a similar protection may be found to exist under the existing public policy exception for a witness testifying at an unemployment hearing, when the same witness believes he or she is required to do so in response to a lawful subpoena provided by statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Appellant's Brief\n   </em>\n   at 16. In this vein, Perkins correctly notes that an individual has a duty to respond to a subpoena issued by an ALJ for purposes of an unemployment hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-4-19-8\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 22-4-19-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Perkins admits, however, that although he believed he would receive a subpoena when he appeared for the hearing, he never actually received a subpoena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [16] We find\n   <em>\n    Frampton\n   </em>\n   inapposite to the case before us. The public policy exception created in\n   <em>\n    Frampton\n   </em>\n   is \"quite a limited exception\" and was grounded in express statutory language-i.e., that an employee has a right to file a worker's compensation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyers v. Meyers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8341989\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/861/704/#p707\">\n    861 N.E.2d 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 707 (Ind. 2007). Here, Perkins did not have a statutory right to testify. Further, we need not decide whether issuance of a subpoena would have created a duty for Perkins to testify because Perkins admits that he was never\n   issued a subpoena.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Absent the exercise of a statutory right or duty, the public policy exception does not apply. We decline Perkins's request to extend the exception to cover the circumstances of this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [17] We find this case to be similar to that addressed by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Baker v. Tremco Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7220129\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/917/650/#p653\">\n    917 N.E.2d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ind. 2009). In\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   , an employee was terminated because he refused to participate in his employer's competitive bidding practices given his mistaken belief that such practices were illegal. The Court found that the employer's competitive bidding practices were in fact legal, and thus, the employee was lawfully terminated. The\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   Court held that the employee's mistaken belief about the illegality of the company's bidding practices was \"not on par with the rights and obligations\" that formed the basis for the discharge complaint in\n   <em>\n    Frampton\n   </em>\n   , and thus, such did not warrant expansion of the public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7220129\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/917/650/#p653\">\n    917 N.E.2d at 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [18] Like the employee's honest belief in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   , Perkins's honest belief that he was subpoenaed to testify at an unemployment hearing is \"not on par with the rights and obligations\" that have been recognized as warranting an exception to the at-will employment doctrine. Perkins has not provided us with any other compelling reason to warrant judicial expansion of the public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine. Given the limited nature of the recognized exceptions to the at-will employment doctrine, we must therefore conclude that Perkins's sincere yet mistaken belief that he had been subpoenaed does not fall with the public policy exception. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [19] Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Oral argument was held at the McHale Performing Arts Center at Logansport High School on March 11, 2019.
