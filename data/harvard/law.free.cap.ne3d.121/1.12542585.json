In\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth District reviewed the Supreme Court's determination in\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Robbins\n   </em>\n   that the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   procedure is not a Constitutional mandate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. The\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   court then discussed the criticisms of the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   approach. These criticisms include the following: prejudice to the defendant by flagging the case as without merit and by involving a perfunctory review by the court; creation of a conflict for counsel between his duty to the court and his duty to his client; existence of a role reversal for counsel and court by placing the court in the role of defense counsel; creation of a greater burden on the judiciary by requiring a full review of the record; and the confusion created by a lack of uniformity in the courts regarding the degree of scrutiny given to\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   cases.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} With its review of these criticisms and considerations in mind, the Fourth District decided to \"reverse the direction\" taken in\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   cases and adopt the Idaho Rule: \"After counsel is appointed to represent an indigent client during an appeal on a criminal matter, we will not permit counsel to withdraw solely on the basis that the appeal is frivolous.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The court then crafted a procedure for appointed counsel to follow when counsel believes an appeal is frivolous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This procedure initially involves a discussion with the client in which counsel informs his client that he believes the appeal is frivolous and tries to persuade his client to abandon the appeal.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. However, \"if the defendant chooses to proceed with the appeal nonetheless, counsel must file a merit brief and argue the defendant's appeal as persuasively as possible regardless of any personal belief that the appeal is frivolous.\" The Fourth District also outlined a procedure for an indigent to file a supplemental brief when counsel does not raise all issues the indigent believes should be raised.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The Fourth District then concluded that although not perfect, this approach, which goes beyond the minimum safeguards afforded by\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   , was a better alternative to the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   method, as it addresses the concerns and criticisms of\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   more comprehensively than other approaches.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The Seventh and Sixth Districts have formally decided to follow the Fourth District's decision in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   and no longer accept\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   briefs.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In addition, the facts surrounding Lawrence's appeal raise several of the problems in\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   briefs discussed by the\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Lawrence was charged with gross sexual imposition, kidnapping with a sexual purpose and five counts of rape. The victim in these offenses was his girlfriend's 16-year-old daughter. In addition, Lawrence was convicted of domestic violence against his girlfriend. After a three-day jury trial, Lawrence was found guilty on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The trial court determined three of the rape offenses were allied offenses and that the kidnapping with a sexual purpose offense was allied to the five rape offenses. After merger of the allied offenses, Lawrence was sentenced to consecutive 11-year prison terms on each of the three rape convictions and 18 months each on the gross sexual imposition and domestic violence convictions, to run concurrently to the rape sentences, for an aggregate sentence of 33 years. He was also sentenced to five years postrelease control and classified as a Tier III sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 20} As mentioned above, counsel's\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief contains fifteen potential assignments of error that might arguably support the appeal. The issues raised include the certification of expert witnesses, the admission of opinions regarding DNA, the admission of evidence collected by a relative of the sexual offense victim, issues involving the denial of cross-examination of the sexual offense victim regarding text messages she sent to Lawrence, jury instructions, the sufficiency and weight of the evidence, allied offenses, the vindictiveness of the sentence because Lawrence exercised his right to trial, classification as a Tier III sex offender, prosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In his pro se brief, Lawrence raises issues related to prosecutorial misconduct, including coaching the victim during her testimony, false allegations by defense counsel and impermissible opinion testimony in closing arguments. Lawrence also raises issues involving his conviction of multiple counts of rape with the same animus and the court's decision to certify a witness as a DNA expert. Finally, he also argues his sentence was not supported by the record based on statutory findings without factual support, and he was not given the opportunity to review the presentence report as required by Ohio law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Clearly, the case before us presents many of the problems outlined in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   . There are numerous potential issues raised both by counsel and pro se by Lawrence. The case involves a three-day jury trial, with considerable testimony, as witnesses included the sexual offense victim, her friend, her father, a SANE nurse, a BCI forensic scientist, a BCI forensic scientist in the DNA field, a Hamilton police detective, the defendant's girlfriend, the domestic violence victim. A review of the entire record and consideration of the potential issues without argument by defense counsel puts not only a burden on judicial resources, but also places the court in the role of defense counsel to search out and consider issues when performing such a considerable review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Although this court acknowledges problems in the consideration of this appeal under the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   framework, we decline the opportunity to adopt the approach taken in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   . Instead, we find that clarification and discussion of when an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief is appropriate and setting a standard counsel must follow when considering drafting a brief is the proper approach to resolve many of the problems with\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   briefs discussed in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    When is an\n    <em>\n     Anders\n    </em>\n    Brief Appropriate?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Appellate counsel not only has a duty to his client, but to the court as well.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-420\">\n    2015-Ohio-420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 11.

Therefore, we find that counsel must view an \"arguable issue\" broadly and on finding an arguable issue, must file a merit brief even if counsel considers the arguments unlikely to prevail or anticipates a strong argument in reply from the prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 33} However, even given this broad definition of an \"arguable issue,\" we recognize there are situations in which an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief may be appropriate. For example, it is possible an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief may be appropriate when an indigent pleads guilty and the court has scrupulously adhered to Crim.R. 11 before accepting\n   the plea, or in cases where there is no discretion in sentencing the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-3323\">\n    2016-Ohio-3323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 5-9. In cases where there are no factual issues involved, and the court has meticulously followed the applicable legal rules, principles, or statutes, it is possible no arguable issues may remain for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In those cases where counsel finds no arguable issues that can be presented on appeal, an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief is appropriate. In addition to filing a request to withdraw,\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   instructs counsel to file a \"brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   at 744,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These are arguments counsel considered, but ultimately determined frivolous. This requirement is designed to provide the appellate court with a basis for determining whether appointed counsel has fully performed the duty to support the defendant's appeal to the best of their ability and to \"assist the court in the critical determination of whether the appeal is indeed so frivolous that counsel should be permitted to withdraw.\"\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218763\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/429/\">\n    486 U.S. 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 439,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218763\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/429/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Finally, if an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief is filed with this court, counsel must serve a copy of the brief on the defendant and inform the defendant that he may file a pro se brief if he so desires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   at 744,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Counsel should include notice of these requirements in the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief so that the court can determine whether counsel has fulfilled his duty to his client in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    Lawrence's Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Given our decision to continue accepting\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   briefs in the cases where no arguable issue can be found, we decline Lawrence's request to adopt the Fourth District's position in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   . However, we must determine whether an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief is appropriate for this appeal using the principles and guidelines discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 37} As previously discussed, the case before us involved a three-day jury trial for charges of domestic violence, gross sexual imposition, kidnapping with a sexual purpose and five counts of rape. Several witnesses testified, including the victim of the sexual offenses, her father, and her friend. Other witnesses included a SANE nurse, a BCI forensic scientist, a BCI forensic scientist in the DNA field, a Hamilton police detective, and the defendant's girlfriend who was the victim in the domestic violence charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 38} As also mentioned above, numerous \"potential issues\" were raised by counsel and were raised pro se by Lawrence. These issues include the certification of expert witnesses, the admission of opinions regarding DNA, the admission of evidence collected by the victim's relative, issues involving the denial of cross-examination of the victim regarding text messages she sent to Lawrence, jury instructions, sufficiency and weight of the evidence, issues involving allied offenses, the vindictiveness of the sentence because Lawrence exercised his right to trial, classification as a Tier III sex offender, prosecutorial misconduct, sentencing, review of the PSI report and ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 39} After considering the type of case, the factual and evidentiary issues and possible arguments on appeal, we find several of the possible issues presented in the brief appear to have arguable merit under the standards set forth above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Accordingly, counsel's motion to withdraw is granted. By separate entry, the court will appoint new counsel to represent Lawrence on appeal. After review of the record, new counsel may argue any of the potential errors raised in\n   the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   or pro se briefs, or any other issues identified in a review of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   S. POWELL, P.J., RINGLAND and M. POWELL, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Resolution of this case was delayed because counsel was instructed to obtain and review a transcript of voir dire and file a supplemental brief after the court discovered not all proceedings had been transcribed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
