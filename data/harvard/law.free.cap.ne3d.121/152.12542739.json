Crockett was convicted of Class A felony conspiracy to commit murder, and the trial court sentenced him to forty years. In 2018, Crockett filed a motion to correct erroneous sentence pursuant to Indiana Code section 35-38-1-15. Specifically, he argued that his \"\n   <strong>\n    conviction\n   </strong>\n   is illegal on its Face\" because the State did not properly charge him with conspiracy. Appellant's App. p. 22 (emphasis added). The trial court denied Crockett's motion without holding a hearing because he did not allege \"that the sentence itself is erroneous on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49. We affirm. The purpose of Section 35-38-1-15\"is to provide prompt, direct access to an uncomplicated legal process for correcting the occasional erroneous or illegal\n   <strong>\n    sentence\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Here, however, the basis of Crockett's motion is that his conviction-not his sentence-is illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [2] Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mathias, J., and Crone, J., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
