App.R. 11.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In this accelerated appeal, defendants-appellants, Murray Kudroff (\"Kudroff\") and Decko Properties, L.L.C. (\"Decko\") (collectively referred to as \"defendants\"), appeal from the trial court's judgment denying their motion for sanctions, without a hearing, against plaintiff-appellee, Ditech Financial L.L.C. (\"Ditech\"). For the reasons set forth below, we reverse and remand for a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In June 2017, Ditech (a loan servicer) brought a foreclosure action against Kudroff and Kudroff's corporation, Decko. Ditech alleged that Kudroff was in default and owed it the principal amount of $46,329.04, plus interest. Eight days after the defendants filed a joint answer to Ditech's complaint, Ditech moved the trial court to dismiss the complaint without prejudice. In its motion to dismiss, Ditech stated that it \"accepted sufficient funds to resolve the parties' present dispute.\" The trial court granted the motion one week later, dismissing the case without prejudice at Ditech's costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Approximately one month later, the defendants filed a motion for sanctions against Ditech and requested a hearing under R.C. 2323.51. The defendants contend that Ditech \"wrongfully and without justification declar[ed] Defendant[s]-borrowers to be in default of their mortgage loan obligations and commenc[ed] this foreclosure action.\" Specifically, the defendants contend that Ditech brought the foreclosure action alleging that defendants missed seven monthly payments, when defendants did in fact make those payments. Defendants allege that to further exacerbate\n   the matter, Ditech sent them formal notice of default one week after it filed its motion to dismiss. Ditech claimed that defendants defaulted on the May, June, July, and August 2017 payments, despite the fact that: (1) defendants made the June and July 2017 payments and these payments were acknowledged by Ditech in its motion to dismiss; (2) Ditech rejected and returned the May 2017 payment; and (3) the defendants made the August 2017 payment while the foreclosure action was pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Defendants further contend that Ditech failed to properly maintain its records and failed to properly service the loan. These errors caused defendants to incur legal and accounting fees and the loss of a long-term tenant. Defendants allege that Ditech called one of defendants' tenants at the subject property and informed the tenant that defendants defaulted on the mortgage, causing the property to go into foreclosure. This tenant then vacated the subject property, leaving defendants without a paying tenant since July 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Ditech opposed the defendants' motion, arguing that defendants have not shown conduct that would subject Ditech to sanctions. The trial court, without holding a hearing, denied defendants' motion for sanctions. The court found that Ditech's \"conduct was not frivolous or egregious in bringing this foreclosure action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} It is from this order that defendants appeal, raising the following single assignment of error for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error One\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court erred in denying the [defendants'] motion for sanctions in a foreclosure proceeding after [Ditech] voluntarily dismissed the foreclosure acknowledging no payment default.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Defendants argue that Ditech's conduct was frivolous under R.C. 2323.51 because it commenced the foreclosure proceeding without any evidentiary support for the alleged missed mortgage payments. Defendants argue that no default ever existed because they made each of these seven monthly mortgage payments to Ditech, who failed to properly record the payments. Defendants further argue that Ditech still cannot correctly account for the payments they have made and now incorrectly allege that they missed payments in July and August. As a result, defendants request that we remand the matter for an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} We review the trial court's order denying a motion for sanctions under R.C. 2323.51 for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Internatl.
