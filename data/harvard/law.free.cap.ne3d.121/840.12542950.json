Loyd appeals the judgment entered by the Licking County Municipal Court convicting him of improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle ( R.C. 2923.16(E)(1) ) and sentencing him to 90 days incarceration with all days suspended, and one year of community control. Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On October 20, 2017, at 11:33 p.m., Trooper Andrew Garwood of the Ohio State Highway Patrol was stopped at a red light at the intersection of Broad Street and Taylor Road in Reynoldsburg, Ohio. When his light turned green, he saw Appellant enter the intersection and make a left turn, disregarding the red light governing traffic in his lane of travel. Trooper Garwood made a traffic stop for the traffic violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant pulled over to the right side of Broad Street, and Tpr. Garwood approached Appellant's vehicle on the driver's side. Appellant produced his license, registration, and proof of insurance upon request. Appellant was then asked to exit the vehicle and go to the front of the cruiser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Tpr. Garwood asked Appellant if he had a weapon, and asked for permission to conduct a patdown. Appellant responded he had a gun on his person. Appellant told the trooper he had a permit. The trooper handcuffed Appellant, conducted a patdown search, and retrieved the gun. Approximately two minutes transpired from the time Appellant made contact with the trooper to the point in time at which Appellant first revealed he had a gun on his person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant was charged with improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle in violation of R.C. 2923.16(E)(1). He was also charged with a red light violation and possession of marijuana, to which he entered a plea of guilty outside the presence of the jury. The improper handling charge proceeded to jury trial in the Licking County Municipal Court. The first trial result in a mistrial due to a hung jury. The second jury trial resulted in a finding of guilty. Appellant was convicted as charged and sentenced to 90 days incarceration with all 90 days suspended and placed on community control for one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} It is from the February 8, 2018 judgment of conviction and sentence\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant prosecutes this appeal, assigning as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"I. THE APPELLANT'S CONVICTION FOR IMPROPER HANDLING OF A FIREARM IN A MOTOR VEHICLE IN VIOLATION OF R.C. 2923.16(E)(1) WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND WAS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE BECAUSE THE STATE FAILED TO PRODUCE ANY EVIDENCE AS TO THE APPELLANT'S CONCEALED HANDGUN LICENSE OR HIS STATUS AS ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY WITH FIREARMS TRAINING.

Meyers,\n   </em>\n   11th Dist.

However, in\n   <em>\n    Meyers,\n   </em>\n   the appellant had been charged not with a violation of R.C. 2923.16(E), but rather with a violation of R.C. 2923.16(C), and he was seeking an exemption from the application of subsection (C) pursuant to R.C. 2923.16(F)(5)(a).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The\n   <em>\n    Meyers\n   </em>\n   case is inapposite to the case at bar, where Appellant was charged with violation of R.C. 2923.16(E), which applies only to persons who have \"been issued a concealed handgun license or who is an active duty member of the armed forces of the United States and is carrying a valid military identification card and documentation of successful completion of firearms training that meets or exceeds the training requirements described in division (G)(1) of section 2923.125 of the Revised Code.\" We therefore conclude possession of a concealed handgun license in the instant case was an element of the charged offense, which the State was required to prove.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} However, while the State did not directly present Appellant's actual concealed handgun license as evidence, there was evidence presented from which the jury could conclude Appellant possessed such a license. Tpr. Garwood testified within the first few minutes of their encounter, Appellant said he had a weapon, and a license. Tr. 74. Further, the video of the traffic stop was played for the jury and admitted into evidence. In the video, Appellant states he has a weapon but he has a permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Further, while Appellant did not formally stipulate to the fact he had a concealed handgun license, and the court instructed the jury the evidence does not include argument or statements of counsel, counsel for Appellant stated in opening statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   This is going to go quick because there's really nothing in dispute, factually. As the Judge told you, you are the sole decider of the facts. We're going to stipulate to a lot of them to keep this moving along. Yes, he was driving. Yes, it was in Reynoldsburg. Yes, he did have a firearm. Yes, it was a handgun. The only real question is going to be, did he inform the Trooper promptly?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Tr. 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In closing argument, counsel for Appellant stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen, promptly. As I said at the beginning, that's all this case really comes down to. Was he legally\n   stopped? Yes. Did he have a concealed carry license? Yes. Did he have a firearm? Yes. Did he promptly inform the law officer, law enforcement officer, that he had those things? I don't know. That's up to you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Tr. 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The argument of counsel in the instant case was functionally equivalent to or tantamount to a stipulation Appellant had a valid concealed handgun license, and the only issue for the jury to decide was whether he notified the officer promptly of the existence of the handgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellant next argues the finding he did not \"promptly\" notify the officer he had a gun is against the manifest weight and sufficiency of the evidence. He argues viewing the video of the stop, only about two minutes passed before he notified the officer of the existence of the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Without objection, the trial court instructed the jury, \"Promptly means without delay and with reasonable speed.\" Tr. 89. The undisputed evidence reveals Appellant produced his license, registration, and proof of insurance without notifying the officer of the existence of the handgun. He stepped out of the vehicle at the officer's request, but did not notify the officer he had a gun on his person until he was in front of the cruiser and the officer specifically asked if he had a weapon. From this evidence, the jury could conclude Appellant did not notify Trooper Garwood without delay and with reasonable speed he had a handgun on his person. We further find the jury did not lose its way in finding Appellant failed to notify the officer promptly of the existence of the handgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The judgment is not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and the State presented sufficient evidence to support the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In his second assignment of error, Appellant argues R.C. 2923.16(E)(1), as quoted above, is void for vagueness because the term \"promptly\" is not defined with sufficient definiteness such that an ordinary person can understand what conduct is prohibited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The critical question in all cases as to void for vagueness is whether the law affords a reasonable individual of ordinary intelligence fair notice and sufficient definition and guidance to enable him to conform his conduct to the law.\n   <em>\n    City of Norwood v.

When examining a statute for vagueness, it should be measured against three values: 1.) to provide fair warning to the ordinary citizen so their behavior may comport with the statute, 2.) to preclude arbitrary, capricious, and generally discriminatory enforcement by officials, and 3.) to ensure fundamental constitutionally protected freedoms are not unreasonably impinged or inhibited.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Trumbull), the appellant argued the language, at the time set forth in R.C. 2923.16(E)(3), which required him to \"promptly\" notify the officer a firearm was in the vehicle was void for vagueness. In rejecting the appellant's argument, our brethren in the Eleventh District held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Likewise, R.C. 2923.16(E)(3) passes a void-for-vagueness test. This section requires an individual with a concealed-carry\n   license to \"promptly\" notify the officer, upon being stopped in a traffic stop, that a firearm is in the vehicle. The only provision of this statute that is arguably ambiguous is the term \"promptly.\" \"To do something 'promptly' is to do it without delay and with reasonable speed.\" Thus, a person of common intelligence would readily understand this term, as it is used in this situation, to require the license holder to inform the officer about the weapon as soon as possible. Certainly, the notification should occur during the initial encounter with the officer. We do not find this term, or the remaining terms in this section, to be ambiguous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 28}\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 29} We agree with the reasoning set forth by the Eleventh District, and for the reasons set forth in\n   <em>\n    State v.

He argues there was no reason to ask Appellant to exit his vehicle in order to continue questioning inside the police cruiser, and therefore no reason for the patdown. He further argues any consent given to the search was not voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 32} A properly licensed attorney is presumed competent.\n   <em>\n    State v.

During a routine traffic stop, it is unreasonable for an officer to search the driver for weapons before placing him or her in a patrol car, if the sole reason for placing the driver in a patrol car during the investigation is for the convenience of the officer. However, the officer may search the driver for weapons if placing the driver in the patrol car during the investigation prevents officers or the driver from being subjected to a dangerous condition and placing the driver in the patrol car is the least intrusive means to avoid the dangerous\n   condition.\n   <em>\n    State v.
