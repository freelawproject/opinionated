(\"Father\") appeals the juvenile court's finding that his daughter, A.S. (\"Child\") is a child in need of services (\"CHINS\"). Father raises one issue for our review, whether the juvenile court erred in finding Child to be a CHINS. Concluding the juvenile court did not err, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [2] Child was born to Father and S.L.S. (\"Mother\") on April 20, 2012, and was six years old when these proceedings began. Father and Mother do not live together. During a three-day period between April 20 and 22, 2018, Child was staying with Father. On April 21, Father and Mother engaged in the following conversation through text message:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [Father]: The next time [Child] poops her pants your [sic] going to spank her and spank her good. Got it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [Mother]: Yes ... [b]ut you don't need to be spanking her so hard your [sic] leaving bruises either\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Father]: Wouldn't have to if you would do your job\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [Mother]: I am\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Father]: Then why she [sic] still doing it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [Mother]: Cause [sic] she's stubborn and doesn't want to\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [Father]: That's where the a** whooping comes in\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Exhibit Volume I at 74-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [3] Child returned to Mother's on April 22 and Mother noticed significant bruising on Child's buttocks and left leg as she was helping Child take a bath. Mother texted Father about spanking Child and Father responded, \"it isn't a big deal\" and \"if [Child] wouldn't poop in her pants it wouldn't happen.\" Appellant's Appendix, Volume 2 at 14. Mother brought Child to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [4] Soon thereafter, the Indiana Department of Child Services (\"DCS\") received a report alleging that Father had physically abused Child. DCS Family Case Manager Lydia Stepp met Mother and Child at the hospital. Mother reported that Child had no bruising before going to Father's house three days before, and Stepp took four pictures of Child and her injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [5] DCS filed a CHINS petition on April 24. After several hearings in Father's absence, an initial hearing was held with respect to Father on May 22 and a fact-finding hearing was conducted on June 18. The juvenile court adjudicated Child to be a CHINS and made the following findings and conclusions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court now adjudicates the [Child] a Child in Need of Services as defined by [ Indiana Code sections] 31-34-1-1 and 31-34-1-2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   In support for this conclusion of law, the following findings of fact are found:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   a. [Father] is the biological father of [Child].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   b. [Child] was born on April 20, 2012, and is six (6) years of age.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   c.

Family Case Manager Rebecca Eldridge (hereinafter \"FCM Eldridge\"), testified that she attempted to contact and notify [Father] of the court hearing set for April 25. FCM Eldridge stated that [Father] knew about the hearing, but chose not to appear. FCM Eldridge further testified that she had attempted to notify [Father] of all subsequent hearings, even going so far as to go to his home with law enforcement. FCM Eldridge knocked on [Father's] door, but no one answered, despite [Father's] vehicle being present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   h.

Hospital records ... indicate that [Child] was diagnosed with \"contusion of lower back and pelvis\" and that it was \"suspected child maltreatment, confirmed\".

The records further indicate that the bruising was cause [sic] by \"non-accidental trauma\". (Exhibit 3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   l. FCM Eldridge testified that [Father] had spoken with her and indicated that he was willing to participate in services, but that he did not think that a Program of Informal Adjustment or a formal Child in Need of Services case was appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   m. FCM Eldridge further testified that [Father] indicated that [Child's] bruising could have been caused by anemia, as she was diagnosed with that when she was younger. Medical records from [Child's] primary physician indicate that [Child] does not have anemia. (Exhibit 4)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   n. FCM Eldridge also testified that [Father] had a previous substantiation with the [DCS] that was later overturned, but that case did not influence her decision in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   o. Mother ... testified that [Father] sent her text messages, in which [Father] admitted to spanking [Child] and leaving bruises. (Exhibit 5)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   p. Mother also testified that [Father] gave [Mother] several versions of how [Child] became injured, including [Child] having anemia, [Child] falling on his steel-toed boots in his home, and that [Child] may have the beginning stages of childhood leukemia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   q. Father testified that [Child] received her injuries when she fell on his steel-toed boots and shoe horns that were inside his front door. Father further testified that she seemed fine when she fell. Father provided a picture of the inside of his front door, though it was not a picture from the day of the incident. (Respondent's Exhibit A)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   r. Father admitted that he spanked [Child] because she lied about pooping in her pants. He stated that he didn't notice any bruises on her bottom when he spanked her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   s. Father has provided no probable explanation for how [Child] obtained her bruises. He has provided theories, but openly admits that he spanked her and that there were no bruises on her bottom when did so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   t. [DCS] has provided to the Court pictures of [Child's] injuries, as well as medical records which indicate that the bruises are the result of non-accidental trauma and child maltreatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   u.

After all, DCS had previous involvement with Father for the same reasons and despite completing discipline and potty training classes, Father continued to express a preference for spanking Child while encouraging Mother to do the same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lang v.
