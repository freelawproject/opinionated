In 2013, the defendant was convicted by a Superior Court jury of murder in the first degree for his role in the killing. In this direct appeal, the defendant maintains that a new trial is required because the judge did not declare a mistrial after members of the jury were exposed to an extraneous influence, and that the judge committed reversible error by partially excluding the defendant from the subsequent voir dire of the deliberating jury. In addition, the defendant argues that the judge should have allowed his request for individual voir dire on questions of ethnic bias, and abused his discretion in certain evidentiary rulings. The defendant also asks us to exercise our extraordinary power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or to reduce the degree of guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We affirm the conviction and decline to exercise our extraordinary powers to grant relief under G.

At some point during the evening, the victim's sister heard Cruz express an interest in a knife that was lying on a table. The victim and Cruz then left the house together. According to the victim's sister, Cruz took the knife when they left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Later that evening, the defendant was with Cruz and the victim at a convenience store. They ran into two women, the defendant's cousin, Maria Colon,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and one of her friends. Cruz and the victim were drunk. The victim suggested that they all smoke marijuana, and the group walked to the nearby railroad tracks to do so. Maria heard Cruz tell the defendant that Cruz recently had bought a new knife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After approximately fifteen minutes, Maria and her friend left to go home. As they were walking away, Maria heard what sounded like \"skin ripping.\" When she looked back, she saw the defendant throwing rocks at the victim; she described the rocks as thin and estimated them to be approximately one inch in width. Her friend saw the defendant throw four to six rocks, which hit the victim in the back. The victim fell to the ground, where he kept asking the defendant to \"stop.\" Cruz was laughing. When the defendant requested a knife, Cruz handed him a backpack. Maria asked the defendant to stop; he told her to leave, or \"it would happen to [her] as well.\" At that point, Maria and her friend left the area. When they last saw him, the victim was on the ground in a fetal position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next morning, when the defendant came to Maria's house, she saw \"little dots\" and \"splatter-marks\" on his left leg. That afternoon, she saw the defendant at a laundromat. When the defendant left the laundromat, the \"little dots\" on his pants were stained yellow, as though he had tried to wash them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   That evening, the defendant's girlfriend and her friend picked up the defendant and they all drove around. The defendant told his girlfriend that he had killed the victim, and he pointed toward something in the distance that \"looked like feet.\" He said that he had killed the victim \"for us,\" and he warned her not to tell anyone or he would harm her siblings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Later that evening, the defendant telephoned Maria and told her that he had killed the victim. The defendant explained that he had left the railroad tracks and was walking home, but then he returned to the railroad tracks, where he saw the victim getting up. The defendant picked up a large rock and hit the victim in the head with it several times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The same day, the victim's body was discovered near the railroad tracks. When a chemist from the State police crime laboratory arrived at the scene, he saw the victim lying on his back; his\n   heavily-bruised face and clothing were covered with \"red-brown staining.\" A large rock, weighing roughly fourteen pounds, with red-brown stains, was next to the victim. The stain later was determined to be the victim's blood. The medical examiner concluded that the cause of death was a combination of blunt force trauma to the head and two stab wounds to the body. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing indicated that the blood found on a pair of jeans recovered from the defendant's house was the victim's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Prior proceedings\n   </em>\n   . In November, 2005, a grand jury returned indictments, charging the defendant, among other things, with murder in the first degree. Thereafter, the defendant moved to suppress his statements to police and the items seized during the two searches of his house. Following an evidentiary hearing, a Superior Court judge, who was not the trial judge, allowed the motions to suppress in part and denied them in part. The judge found that the defendant's statements\n   were obtained in violation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p479\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p479\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p479\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966), because the Spanish interpretation of the Miranda warnings provided to the defendant were inadequate to apprise him of his rights. The judge denied the motion to suppress the evidence seized from the victim's house, after the judge determined that the defendant's consent to the first search had been validly obtained, and that police had had probable cause to obtain a warrant for the second search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In March, 2013, the defendant was tried before a Superior Court jury. The jury convicted him of murder in the first degree on theories of deliberate premeditation and extreme cruelty or atrocity. The defendant timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The defendant maintains that a new trial is required because the judge did not declare a mistrial when several deliberating jurors expressed concerns about their safety, and that the judge erred by partially excluding the defendant from the subsequent voir dire of the deliberating jury. The defendant argues also that he was denied a fair trial because the judge did not conduct individual voir dire of the members of the venire with respect to questions of ethnic bias that defense counsel had requested be posed. The defendant further asserts error in the denial of his motion to suppress physical evidence, as well as in the admission of out-of-court statements, and he contends that his attorney was ineffective in failing to make certain arguments at the hearing on the motion to suppress. In addition, the defendant\n   asks us to exercise our extraordinary power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or to reduce the degree of guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Dismissal of jurors during deliberations\n   </em>\n   . The defendant argues that he was denied the right to a fair and impartial jury when, after substantial evidence of bias was brought to the judge's attention during deliberations, the judge did not excuse the entire jury. Specifically, while the jury were deliberating, the juror in seat number 15 (juror no. 15) notified a court officer that she was afraid of the repercussions of the potential verdict in the case. She feared that if the jury were to find the defendant guilty, there could be possible retribution by gangs; if they were to find him not guilty, someone else would be stabbed. Juror no. 15 was fearful, in part, because the defendant had heard her name. The other jurors \"were all there\" during juror no. 15's conversation with the court officer; juror no. 15 reported that other jurors also previously expressed similar fears. The judge found that juror no. 15 could not remain impartial and excused her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because juror no. 15 reported that others had expressed similar \"gang-related\" fears, the judge conducted an individual voir dire of each of the remaining members of the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The juror in seat number 1 (juror no. 1) also was excused, after stating that he had been \"watching to see if anyone is following me when I leave here.\" The foreperson, who was in seat number 3 (juror no. 3), reported that she had heard other jurors express fears about the proximity of the crime to \"the location [in which] they lived\" and \"gang relation.\" Juror no. 3 also said she had been \"concerned,\" the day before deliberations began, that people the defendant might know would \"go after us.\" On the first day of deliberations, however, juror no. 3 reported that she was no longer concerned. The judge found that juror no. 3 \"indicated\n   very clearly that she didn't have any concerns now.\" Over the defendant's objection, juror no. 3 was not excused. The judge told juror no. 3 not to discuss the substance of the voir dire with anyone else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Juror nos. 1 and 15 were replaced with alternates, and the jury were instructed to begin deliberations anew. The defendant objected that the jury were not struck entirely; he argued that the \"fear running through the deliberations\" prevented the jury from remaining impartial. The motion was denied. Approximately one hour later, the jurors returned a verdict finding the defendant\n   guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, the defendant contends that the extraneous influences on the jury resulted in actual bias when the suggestion of gang activity was introduced during the process of deliberation, where no evidence of gang activity had been presented at trial. The defendant argues that, as a result, he was denied the right to a fair and impartial jury when the judge declined to dismiss the entire jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Extraneous influence\n   </em>\n   . \"Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to a trial before an impartial jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Philbrook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457188\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/20/#p30\">\n    475 Mass. 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20N.E.3d%20398\">\n    55 N.E.3d 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). \"The presence of even one partial juror violates this right.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Guisti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1080018\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/434/245/#p251\">\n    434 Mass. 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 251,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=747%20N.E.2d%20673\">\n    747 N.E.2d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001),\n   <em>\n    S\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    C\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817247\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/1018/\">\n    449 Mass. 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=867%20N.E.2d%20740\">\n    867 N.E.2d 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). \"Prohibiting premature jury deliberations, and extraneous influences on jurors\" is one of the ways in which to safeguard a defendant's right to trial before an impartial jury.\n   <em>\n    Philbrook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Accordingly, extraneous influences on jurors present a \"serious question of possible prejudice\" (citation omitted).\n   <em>\n    Guisti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1080018\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/434/245/#p251\">\n    434 Mass. at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=747%20N.E.2d%20673\">\n    747 N.E.2d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The case, as it was presented to the jury, did not involve allegations of gang involvement, and the record does not indicate that any evidence of gang affiliation was introduced at trial. The Commonwealth's theory was that the defendant killed the victim in order to be with the defendant's girlfriend. Numerous jurors subsequently recalled juror no. 15's comments. The conversation regarding gang involvement included discussion of the location of the crime and the \"tattoos on the [defendant's] hands.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Until jurors began discussing gang-related concerns, juror no. 3, for example, had not considered the defendant's tattoos to be\n   meaningful; \"I never noticed that.

Defense counsel then could relay pertinent information to the defendant at a later point. Defense counsel agreed that, if a juror were excused, counsel would tell the defendant only that it was for \"personal reasons,\" without explaining that any of the jurors had expressed fears of him.

There is no principled reason why a Hispanic defendant charged with murdering a Caucasian victim should be entitled to fewer protections against potential bias than an African-American defendant in the same position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Of course, attorneys seeking to ask questions about ethnic bias would now have some leeway to do so during attorney-directed voir dire, which was not available to defense counsel at the time of the defendant's trial. See, G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 67D, inserted by St. 2016, c. 36, \u00a7 4. Nonetheless, this questioning occurs within guidelines and limitations established by the judge, and does not provide a clear, consistent, authoritative, and reliable means of detecting bias among potential jurors in the way that mandatory questioning by the trial judge, upon request, would assure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Indeed, the value of individual voir dire to uncover potential ethnic bias was evident in the empanelment proceedings in this case. A least one potential juror identified in her written questionnaire that the knowledge that the defendant was Hispanic would interfere with her ability to be fair and impartial. After the judge conducted voir dire concerning the juror's response, he found that she would not be able to be impartial and excused her. Another juror's ethnic bias, however, only came to the fore after answering individual voir dire questions, where the potential juror had marked \"no\" to the relevant\n   question on the questionnaire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Of course, in many cases, ethnicity remains unlikely to be a\n   source of bias in a murder trial, particularly where it is difficult for jurors to distinguish between the ethnicities of the defendant and the victim. See generally\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bastaldo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361714\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/16/#p28\">\n    472 Mass. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 28-30,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20N.E.3d%20873\">\n    32 N.E.3d 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (discussing difficulties of distinguishing ethnic differences in some circumstances). In such cases, a reasonable defense attorney would likely have no reason to request individual voir dire on ethnic bias.

As stated, prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress statements and evidence recovered during a police search of his residence. The motion judge allowed the motion to suppress the statements, after he found that the Miranda warnings were inadequate, but denied the motion to suppress evidence. He concluded that some of the evidence had been seized pursuant to a \"consent search\" and some of the evidence was seized during a second search, with a warrant; the warrant affidavit did not rely on or even mention any of the evidence seized during the warrantless search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   On the day after the victim's body was discovered, police brought the defendant to the police station for questioning. At that time, the defendant was twenty-one years old; he could not read English, and he had a limited understanding of spoken English. Accordingly, a police officer was brought in to translate from English to Spanish. The officer read from a Miranda rights card, written in English, which he attempted to translate into Spanish. The officer advised the defendant of his Miranda rights as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   \"These are your Miranda rights. Before we begin I have to read this to you, ok? They're in English, I'm going to read it for you in Spanish, but back here where you sign it's going\n   to be in English. You understand? Ok. Before they, we ask you any question, you can stay quiet. You have right to silence. Uh, every little thing that you say we can use it in court. You have a right to talk to a lawyer before we ask you something. If you cannot pay for a lawyer the court gives you a lawyer without paying anything. If you want to talk to us without a lawyer here, you can stop when you want, without a lawyer. So if you want to talk to us and you want to stop, well that is your right, you want to talk and say nothing, to be looking for a lawyer. You understand? Ok.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Following this interpretation of his Miranda rights, the defendant agreed to speak with the officers. He denied any involvement in the victim's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Later in the interview, police requested the defendant's consent to search his residence. They presented him with a consent to search form, printed in English, which the officer again attempted to explain in Spanish. The officer did not provide a verbatim oral recitation of the language on the form, but he did tell the defendant that if he did not want to sign the form, \"you don't sign it.\" The defendant ultimately signed the form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Police searched the house where the defendant had been staying. They seized various items of clothing from an area of the living room where he had been sleeping\n   and keeping his belongings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officers then obtained a search warrant, returned to the residence, and seized additional items. A pair of blue jeans with a yellow stain on the ankle was located under the couch in the living room. Due to an error in the evidence log, it is unclear whether the jeans were seized during the first search or the second search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the judge erred in denying the motion to suppress the evidence seized, because the Commonwealth did not show that the defendant freely and voluntarily consented to the search, and the evidence seized pursuant to the later warrant should have been suppressed as the fruit of the poisonous tree. The motion judge found that the defendant's affidavit was limited, however, to the contention that, had he \"understood [his] rights under Miranda, [he] would not have signed the consent form.\" The defendant's appellate counsel concedes that the defendant \"did not raise\" any other issues regarding the consent form in Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \"The theory on which a motion to suppress is presented in the trial court cannot be changed when the motion comes before this court for review.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884277\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/406/540/#p542\">\n    406 Mass. 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 542,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=549%20N.E.2d%20106\">\n    549 N.E.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6340257,6341348,6340069,6342663,6339880,6341031,6340458,6342283,6341800,6342029,6342503,6340654,6340846,6339643\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/832/\">\n    498 U.S. 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20S.%20Ct.%2096\">\n    111 S.Ct. 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20L.%20Ed.%202d%2067\">\n    112 L.Ed.2d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990).
