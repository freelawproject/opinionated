In one assignment of error, the state contends (1) that the trial court erred in holding that the provisions challenged by the city did not fall within the bill's single subject of, according to the state, creating uniform business regulations across Ohio; and (2) that the trial court inappropriately severed unchallenged provisions of S.B. 331. The state's first argument is moot. The second has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Those parts of S.B. 331 challenged by the city, collectively referred to as the bill's \"Small Cell Provisions,\" amended R.C. Chapter 4939. These amendments are no longer in effect. All have been replaced or repealed by 2018 H.B. 478, effective August 1, 2018. It is well-established that \"[t]he role of courts is to decide adversarial legal cases and to issue judgments that can be carried into effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Cyran v.

Since the challenged provisions are no longer in effect, the first issue raised by the city is moot and we do not address it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The trial court also struck as unconstitutional several provisions that had not been challenged by the city. This included S.B. 331's amendments to R.C. 4111.02, the minimum wage statute, and enactment of R.C. 4113.85, which relates to employer-employee relations. Article IV, Section 4(B) of the Ohio Constitution gives the courts of common pleas original jurisdiction \"over all justiciable matters\" properly before them. Justiciability is a concept related to mootness, in that there must be an actual controversy between the parties.\n   <em>\n    Burger Brewing Co. v.
