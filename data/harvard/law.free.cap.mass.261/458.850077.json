The only question raised is whether there was error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict in his favor. There was evidence tending to show that, at about half past two in the afternoon of an August day in the current year, there was a crash of colliding automobiles on Cambridge Street in Cambridge where traffic was at the time stopped because of a railroad train crossing the street; that the defendant was immediately thereafter found sitting in the front seat of an automobile \u201cin a slumped down position behind the wheel\u201d; that the automobile, in which the defendant was alone, was not in motion and its motor was stopped; that it was the last of four automobiles on the street car tracks about fifteen feet from the curb in the line of traffic; and that the defendant was drunk and had been convicted of a like offence within the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">It is provided by St. 1925, c. 297, that \u201cWhoever upon any way operates a motor vehicle . . . while under the influence of intoxicating liquor . . . shall be punished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">This presents a typical case for the application of the rule of circumstantial evidence. \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>The true rule of law respecting the probative character of circumstantial evidence is well settled. It is that the 'circumstances must be such as to produce a moral certainty of guilt, and to exclude any other reasonable hypothesis; \u2018that the circumstances taken together should be of a conclusive nature and tendency, leading on the whole to a satisfactory conclusion, and producing, in effect, a reasonable and moral certainty, that the accused, and no one else, committed the offence charged.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ, </em>232 Mass. 58, 68. The positions of the automobile and of the defendant and all the circumstances amply justified a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant must have operated the automobile in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
