R. Radovsky, (H. W. Radovsky </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-11\"><em>H. F. Hathaway &amp; E. A.

[the paper away with her foot . . . [but] she did not stop to do that.\u201d At the close of the evidence the plaintiff asked the judge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>rule: (1) There was no evidence that the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care; and (2) upon all the evidence the jury should find that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care. The jury found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The trial judge was right in refusing to make either of the rulings requested. The question of the plaintiff\u2019s care was one of fact for the jury. The judge could not rule that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care. Although her testimony was not contradicted, the jury might not have believed it. They might have found that she was not injured in the way she testified; nor because the paper was on the stairway. The weight to be given to her testimony was for the jury. <em>Lindenbaum </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>197 Mass. 314. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Fall River Iron Works Co. </em>200 Mass. 188,191. <em>Dorne </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>243 Mass. 438,440.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Even if the jury believed a part of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony and disbelieved other parts, they could have found that, in going down the stairs and seeing the paper, she might have paused and pushed it away before proceeding, and that she was not in the exercise of proper care in acting as she did. See <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>H. B. Church Truck Service Co. </em>259 Mass. 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
