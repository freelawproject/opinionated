There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff, while passing over the sidewalk, stumbled and tripped in a depression in the walk where the cement had broken away and had been removed, leaving a hole about two feet by one and one half feet in area and two or three inches in depth.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">The plaintiff testified that at the time of the accident it was daylight, that the weather was fair, and that his sense of sight was not impaired; that the condition of the walk was the same as it had been for several months before the accident and that he had passed over it daily for several months; th\u00e1t he had observed the hole where he fell, and that before \u2022the accident \u201che had some days gone out into the road so as to avoid using this section of the walk on account of its condition.\u201d There was evidence that as a result of his fall his collar bone was broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">It is not contended by the defendant that the walk was not in a defective condition. Its contention is that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>shows the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care, and for that reason cannot recover. The fact that he had passed over the hole before and knew of its existence does not, as matter of law, preclude him from recovery. Apart from the provisions of the \u201cdue care\u201d statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, it was a question of fact whether the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care. <em>Winship </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>201 Mass. 273. <em>Page </em>v. <em>Weymouth, </em>207 Mass. 325. <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Dickson, </em>210 Mass. 510, 515. <em>Barron </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>211 Mass. 46. <em>Junkins </em>v. <em>Stoneham, </em>234 Mass. 130, 133. It follows that the defendant\u2019s first request for a ruling to the effect that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover was rightly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The defendant\u2019s second and third requests were as follows: \u201c2. If the plaintiff is entitled to recover, he may recover for bodily injury only. 3. If the plaintiff is entitled to recover, he is not entitled to recover damages for loss of time in his employment or for loss of pay or wages.\u201d The presiding judge denied the second request, and granted the third with the statement that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover for loss of pay or wages as such, but that he was entitled to recover the fair value of his time lost as the direct and proximate result of the bodily injury he received. The second request was properly refused. The plaintiff was entitled to recover not only for the physical injury but also for any mental suffering he endured and for any impairment of his earning capacity as the direct result of the physical injury. No error appears by reason of the manner in which the court dealt with the third request. The rulings made \u2018were sufficiently favorable to the defendant. The case, so far as it relates to the question of damages, is governed by <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Springfield, ante, </em>183 this day decided by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
