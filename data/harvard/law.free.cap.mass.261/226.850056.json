The defendant excepted to the refusal of the trial judge to direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The statute in question, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 66, forbids the employment of a girl under twenty-one years of age or permitting her to work in, about, or in connection with any establishment or occupation named in \u00a7 60 of that chapter before five o\u2019clock in the morning or after ten o\u2019clock in the evening. Among the establishments or occupations designated in \u00a7 60 of chapter 149 are \u201cmercantile establishment's].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The words \u201cmercantile establishment\u201d as used in that chapter include \u201cany premises used for a restaurant or for publicly providing and serving meals.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 1. The finding could have been made that the defendant permitted the girls named to participate in the exhibitions. The fact that the performers were employed by an independent contractor is not a defence. The offence was committed if the defendant permitted them to work in his establishment within the prohibited time. The participation by the girls in an exhibition of singing and dancing could be found to be work within the meaning of that word as used in the statute. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>204 Mass. 18, 21, the court, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>deciding that the word \"work\u201d as used in the statute should be given a broad meaning and that it included the employment of children to take part in theatrical exhibitions, said: \u201cThe statute was intended to protect children from employment calling for constant attention, regular effort and physical or mental strain, to accomplish the desired result.\u201d See also <em>Berdos </em>v. <em>Tremont &amp; Suffolk Mills, </em>209 Mass. 489, 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Upon the agreed facts the jury could have found that the defendant permitted minors to work in his mercantile establishment in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
