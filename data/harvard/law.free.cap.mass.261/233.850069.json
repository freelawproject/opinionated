He was bound by this definite statement. There was nothing else in his testimony or in the evidence to shake its force. He was bound by it. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>224 Mass. 405. His further testimony that the ice on the stairs was \u201cabout five feet from the bottom, up\u201d was not a modification of his clear description of particular steps. It follows that the judge correctly restricted the evidence to the condition of the three steps thus identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">The judge rightly declined to discharge the empanelled jury on the ground that another person among the veniremen, but not on the jury, was in the employ of the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>There is nothing in the state of the record which required the judge to give the plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings touching this matter. They were impertinent to any evidence in the case. <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>216 Mass. 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Other exceptions taken, not having been argued, are treated as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
