He further testified that about a year after the accident he had a conversation with the defendant, who came to the plaintiff\u2019s .place of employment; that after talking about not going to court, the defendant said that he was the owner of the car, and he offered $400 or $500 to settle the case out of court. We need not consider whether this statement was an offer of compromise or could be construed as an admission of liability, as that question is not raised. The plaintiff further testified that the defendant said: \u201cI own the car, but, he says, 'I give it to the other fellow to drive this machine to take his wife and another lady to a party here in Worcester.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Upon the completion of his cross-examination, the plaintiff rested. Thereupon the defendant presented a motion for a directed verdict. During the argument upon the motion, it appeared that \u201c there was or might be a misunderstanding as to the testimony of the plaintiff in respect of his alleged conversation with the defendant in which the latter was alleged to have said: \u2018I give it to the other fellow to drive this machine to take his wife and another lady to a party here in Worcester.\u2019 \u201d It was contended by the plaintiff that the statement referred to the defendant\u2019s wife. As the defendant did not rest his case when the motion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>presented, the judge properly declined to consider it, and allowed the plaintiff to offer further testimony for the purpose of determining whether the statement of the defendant referred to his wife or the wife of Kenton, who drove the car. There was no error in allowing the plaintiff to present further evidence upon this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In the further examination of the plaintiff he was asked \u201cNow, just repeat, tell us again the conversation that you had with Mr. Knoel. Tell us again.\u201d His answer was that the defendant said: \u201cI let her have it for a fellow drive the car for his relations, and he says, \u2018my wife was in it and another lady in it,\u2019 and, he says \u2018to take those ladies to a party.' \" At the close of the recross-examination of the plaintiff both sides rested, whereupon the defendant presented a motion that a verdict be directed in his favor; the motion was denied subject to the defendant\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The testimony of the plaintiff as to his conversation with the defendant respecting the occupants of the car at the time of the accident was ambiguous, obscure and contradictory. Even if the jury could have found that the defendant had stated that his wife was in the car, there is nothing to show it was being operated by the defendant\u2019s agent acting within the scope of his employment. It does not appear that Kenton was driving the car upon any business of the defendant or had been requested to take his wife to the party. All that appears from the testimony most favorable to the plaintiff is that she was in the car. Whether she was there upon invitation of Kenton, or he had been directed by the defendant to convey her to the party, did not appear. The burden rested upon the plaintiff to prove that Kenton while operating the car was the servant of the defendant, acting within the scope of his employment rather than for his'own private purpose. There was no evidence that Kenton was in the general employ of the defendant. It is well settled that proof of ownership of a car by a defendant and that the driver was in his general employ are not sufficient to establish liability for the negligence of the driver; the plaintiff must go further and offer evidence from which it can be found that the driver was engaged in the business of his employer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>In the ease at bar there was no evidence warranting such a finding. <em>Hartnett </em>v. <em>Gryzmish, </em>218 Mass. 258. <em>Melchionda </em>v. <em>American Locomotive Co. </em>229 Mass. 202, 204. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Farnum, </em>230 Mass. 193. <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>A-G Co.
