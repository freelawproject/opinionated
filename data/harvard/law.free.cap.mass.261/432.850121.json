G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 29, 31. The assessors valued the property for the purposes of taxation as follows: \u201cReal Estate, $594,875 Personal Property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>$1,265,275\u201d; and assessed a tax thereon in the sum of $51,434.18. The petitioner, claiming that it had been overtaxed, filed with the assessors on February 4, 1927, a petition for abatement. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\">This petition was the sole remedy for an excessive valuation of the petitioner\u2019s property. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>174 Mass. 396. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 61. There was no evidence tending to show that the tax list was not filed in good faith, and the petitioner\u2019s failure to include real estate did not deprive it of the right to apply for an abatement of the tax on the personal property listed in the return. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 59, 61. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>166 Mass. 298. <em>Blackstone Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Blackstone, </em>200 Mass. 82, 93. We find nothing in conflict with our decision in <em>Central Bank </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>259 Mass. 1, cited by the respondents, where it was held that a fist not sworn to was not in conformity with G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 29, and the refusal of an abatement was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">It was the duty of the board of assessors, who are public officers, to act within a reasonable time upon the petition, and to determine whether an abatement should be granted or refused. <em>Milford Water Co. </em>v. <em>Hopkinton, </em>192 Mass. 491, 497, 498. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Segee, </em>206 Mass. 380, 382. <em>Dexter </em>v. <em>Beverly, </em>249 Mass. 167. The petition for abatement was filed February 4, 1927, but the assessors took no action, thus depriving the petitioner of exercising its right of appeal from their decision as provided in G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 64, 65. The respondents having introduced no evidence explaining or justifying the delay, their request for a ruling that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition or to issue a writ of mandamus to compel them to pass upon the question of abatement was denied rightly. <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Justices of the Superior Court, </em>208 Mass. 162, 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
