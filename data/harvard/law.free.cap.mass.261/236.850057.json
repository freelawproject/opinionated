This request was denied. He found for the defendant. The report states that it contains all the evidence material to the questions raised; that the \u201cplaintiff claiming to be aggrieved by the rulings and refusals to rule as requested, the same [are reported] to the Appellate Division for determination.\u201d The plaintiff appealed from the order dismissing the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The judge based his finding that the defendant was free from negligence on the fact that the roadway on the defendant\u2019s land was in \u201cclose proximity\u201d to the fence and that \u201choles or uneven places in the road would cause the vehicles to lurch or swerve sufficiently to cause the injury.\u201d These facts did not relieve the defendant from liability for the damage brought about by his acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The defendant was the owner of the land on which the roadway was constructed. It was in his possession and under his control. If the way was so near the plaintiff\u2019s fence that the defendant could not use it without injury to the plaintiff\u2019s property and he continued to use it, and on several occasions, because of the nearness of the roadway, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>injured the fence, the fault was his. The condition of the roadway was something for which the defendant alone was responsible. There is nothing to show any excuse on his part for the existence of the \u201choles or uneven places\u201d that caused the \u201cvehicles to lurch or swerve sufficiently to cause the injury complained of.\u201d If the injury in part arose from defects in the roadway, there is nothing in the evidence to show that the defendant was not responsible for these defects and for any injury resulting therefrom. On this record there is no evidence to support the finding that the defendant was free from negligence. 'The evidence shows that in continuing to use the driveway in its defective condition, he was, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, negligent. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence disclosed is that the defendant was responsible for the damage and was guilty of negligence. There was no evidence to support the finding that the damage to the plaintiff\u2019s fence was not caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Lanes-borough </em>v. <em>Ludlow, </em>250 Mass. 99, 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The order dismissing the report is reversed and an order is to be entered directing a new trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
