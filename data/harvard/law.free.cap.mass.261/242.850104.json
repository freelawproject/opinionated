[but they]] were not completed in accordance with the terms of the contract,\u201d and the plaintiffs so notified the defendant, who promised to \u201csee to it and rectify the premises\u201d; that the plaintiffs were to do certain specified work, and in the fulfilment of this promise they installed the heater, cemented the cellar, did all the outside work, supplied shades and balcony dryers at an expense of $1,188.39 and paid out $49.80 for gas piping. It is further alleged that the plaintiffs are ready and willing to comply with the contract; that the defendant refuses to complete the contract and convey the premises to the plaintiffs; that, without the consent of the plaintiffs, he has placed a mortgage for $7,000 on the premises and insists on retaining the sums expended and advanced to him, amounting to $2,888.19. The plaintiffs prayed for an accounting. The. case was referred to a master to hear the parties and report his findings, \u201cwith such facts and questions of law as either party may request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">The master found that the agreement was entered into in effect as alleged in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill; that the plaintiffs were to pay $11,000 and to accept a deed when the house was completed; that the house was not constructed in a good and workmanlike manner \u201cor with good materials\u201d; that with the consent of the defendant the plaintiffs took posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>sion of the premises before the house was completed; that the defendant has never tendered a deed, and that the occupation of the premises did not amount to a waiver. It was further found that the plaintiffs were ready, able and willing to purchase the property, provided the house was completed according to contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">An interlocutory decree was entered confirming the report and denying the defendant\u2019s motion to recommit. The defendant excepted to this order of the' court, but filed no bill of exceptions. He did not appeal from the interlocutory decree. A final decree was entered, directing the defendant to pay \u201cthe plaintiff the sum of $2,266.33 with costs.\u201d The defendant appealed from the final decree. It also appeared that the defendant filed a cross bill, but as the record shows that no action was taken on this bill, we do not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">As the interlocutory decree was not appealed from, and no bill of exceptions was filed, the only question raised by this appeal was whether the final decree was within the scope of the bill and supported by the facts found. <em>Giuliani </em>v. Cordone, 246 Mass. 426, 427. <em>Church </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>247 Mass. 282, 287. <em>Kronberg </em>v. <em>Bulle, </em>247 Mass. 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The findings of the master were not inconsistent with the allegations of the bill. The plaintiffs alleged that the premises were not completed according to the contract, and the master so found. The question of waiver by the plaintiffs of the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the contract was, in the circumstances, one of fact. <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>224 Mass. 125, 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">From an examination of the record it does not appear that the final decree was erroneously affected by the interlocutory decree overruling the exceptions and confirming the master\u2019s report. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 27. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>233 Mass. 403, 409, 410. The report adequately covered the issues raised by the pleadings. The master was not required to report all the subsidiary facts. <em>Magullion </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>241 Mass. 355, 358. The question of the recommittal of the master\u2019s report was within the sound judicial discretion of the judge. <em>Magullion </em>v. <em>Magee, supra. Long </em>v. <em>Lowrey, </em>243 Mass. 414, 417. There was no abuse of this discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
