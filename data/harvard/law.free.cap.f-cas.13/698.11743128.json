The engineer\u2019s conduct-was unexeusable, and at the season and under the circumstances occasioned damage more than the amount of wages due.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">In navigating a steamboat, the engineer commands and controls his own department, but this power cannot be extended beyond the voyage. When that terminates his power ceases, except so far as is necessary for repairing the engine and making ready for another voyage. He has no authority to remodel the engine without the consent of the owner. That consent was not obtained in this case, and the act of the engineer was one of gross insurbordination \u2014 working a forfeiture of his wages. Libel dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
