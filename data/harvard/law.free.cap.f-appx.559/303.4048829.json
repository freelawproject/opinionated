He appeals his within-guidelines sentence, challenging the sixteen-level enhancement he received for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d (\u201cCOV\u201d). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">Following Canales\u2019s guilty plea, a pre-sentence report (PSR) was prepared in which a base offense level of eight was assessed pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2L1.2(a) (2012). The PSR then enhanced that base offense level by sixteen levels pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), on the ground that Canales\u2019s 2006 Connecticut conviction under Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 for \u201crisk of injury to a minor\u201d was a COV. The district court concluded that the prior conviction was a COV because it constituted the enumerated offense of \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d Ca-nales challenges this determination on two grounds: (1) he contends that the documentation the Government provided is insufficient to show under which subsection of section 53-21 he was convicted; and (2) even if the documentation shows that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>was convicted under subsection 53-21(a)(2), this subsection is \u201coverbroad\u201d such that his conviction does not fit within the \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d of the phrase \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The PSR relied upon the following documents to establish Canales\u2019s conviction: (1) a document entitled \u201cInstructions to Clerk,\u201d which was signed by the assistant clerk, reflecting a judgment against Canales for violating Conn. GerStat. \u00a7 53-21(a)(2) and sentence of two years and one day of imprisonment and five years of \u201cspecial parole\u201d; (2) a \u201cLong Form Criminal Information Worksheet,\u201d which was signed by prosecutor, clerk, and the judge, reflecting that Canales entered a plea of nolo contendere and was adjudged guilty of violating Conn. GerStat. \u00a7 53-21(a)(2) and was sentenced to two years and one day of imprisonment and five years of special parole; and (3) a document entitled \u201cTitle, Allegation and Counts,\u201d signed by the Assistant State Attorney, reflecting that Canales was charged with risk of injury to a minor, in violation of Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 53-21 (Count One) and sexual assault, first, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 53a-70 (Count Two). The district court found that the Probation Office had secured the equivalent of a judgment in the form of the \u201cLong Form Criminal Information Worksheet,\u201d which reflected that the statute of conviction was Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 53-21(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Canales contends that the Connecticut documents are insufficient to show that he was convicted of any specific subsection of section 53-21; he also contends that because he pleaded \u201cnolo contendere\u201d rather than \u201cguilty,\u201d these documents cannot be used to narrow his offense conduct. Contrary to Canales\u2019s assertion, a district court may consider state adjudicative documents to determine the proof of existence of the prior conviction. <em>See United States v. Neri-Hernandes, </em>504 F.3d 587, 591-92 (5th Cir.2007). Further, as the challenged documents here were not used to narrow section \u00a7 53-21 based upon the <em>facts </em>underlying Canales\u2019s offense, <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), does not apply. <em>See </em>504 F.3d at 591; <em>United States v. Moreno-Florean, </em>542 F.3d 445, 449-50 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2008) (using the defendant\u2019s indictment and a California abstract of judgment to prove the existence of a prior conviction, where the abstract of judgment was not being used to narrow the statute of conviction based upon the facts underlying the offense). Rather, they were relied upon by the district court to establish of which subsection of Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 53-21 Canales was convicted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Under the circumstances of the present case, as in <em>Moreno-Florean, </em>542 F.3d at 449-50 &amp; n. 1, and <em>Neri-Hernandes, </em>504 F.3d at 590-92, the state adjudicative documents, and especially the Long Form Criminal Information Worksheet, which was signed by the trial judge and which the district court found to be the equivalent of a judgment, were properly used to determine that Canales pleaded nolo con-tendere to violating Conn. GerStat. \u00a7 53-21(a)(2). Thus, the district court\u2019s finding that the adjudicative documents, and especially the Long Form Criminal Information Worksheet, reflected the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>conviction as Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 53-21 (a)(2) was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>630 F.3d 377, 380 (5th Cir.2011) (a district court\u2019s factual findings in sentencing are reviewed for clear error).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Turning to the question of whether the Connecticut conviction constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d section 53-21(a)(2) states: \u201cAny person who ... (2) has contact with the intimate parts ... of a child under the age of sixteen years or subjects a child under sixteen years of age to contact with the intimate parts of such person, in a sexual and indecent manner likely to impair the health or morals of such child ... [commits an offense].\u201d Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 53-21 (a)(2) (West 2005). In the district court, Canales argued that \u201cintimate parts\u201d was not adequately defined and could include the child\u2019s head, feet, or hands. The district court overruled this objection, noting \u201c[i]ntimate parts [under Connecticut law was] defined as the genitalia area, groin, anus, inner thighs, buttocks or breast,\u201d <em>see </em>Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 53a-65 (West 2005), and that section 53-21 (a)(2) included contact with the intimate parts \u201cin a sexual and indecent manner likely to impair the health or morals of [a] child,\u201d <em>see </em>Conn. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 53-21(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">On appeal, Canales makes an argument not specifically raised to the district court:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that contact with a minor\u2019s \u201cintimate parts\u201d \u201cin a sexual and indecent manner likely to impair the health or morals of such child\u201d is not \u201cabuse\u201d within the meaning of \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d Accordingly, we review this contention for plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">We recently examined how to approach the definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 512, 187 L.Ed.2d 365 (2013). We clarified the method used to determine \u201cthe \u2018generic, contemporary meaning\u2019 of non-common-law offense categories enumerated in the federal sentencing enhancements\u201d and adopted a \u201cplain-meaning\u201d approach. <em>Id. </em>at 552. Under that approach, this court first must identify the enumerated offense categories that trigger the sentencing enhancement and determine whether the meaning of the offense categories is apparent from the language of the relevant enhancement or its applicable commentary. <em>Id. </em>at 552, 557-58. If the meaning is unclear, this court must assess whether the offense categories are defined under common law. <em>Id. </em>at 552, 558-59. If the offense categories are not defined under common law, this court must derive their \u201c \u2018generic, contemporary meaning' \u201d from their \u201ccommon usage as stated in legal and other well-accepted dictionaries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552, 559-61. Finally, this court must look to the state statute of conviction and assess whether \u201cthose elements comport with the generic meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>of the enumerated offense category.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552-53, 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We have previously held that the term \u201cabuse\u201d \u201cinvolve[s] either physical or psychological harm to the minor.\u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d at 562. We conclude that it is not error, plain or otherwise, to determine that touching the \u201cintimate parts\u201d of a minor \u201cin a sexual and indecent manner likely to impair the health or morals of such child\u201d involves at least \u201cpsychological harm,\u201d sufficient to constitute \u201cabuse\u201d within the meaning of the Guidelines.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Chacon, </em>742 F.3d 219 (5th Cir. 2014) (holding that \u201cintentional touching [by or to a minor] of the victim\u2019s or actor\u2019s genital, anal, or other intimate area for sexual arousal or gratification\u201d constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d (quoting Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014301(a)(3), 3-307(f) (2002))); <em>cf. State v. Thomas </em>W., 115 Conn.App. 467, 974 A.2d 19, 28 (2009) (\u201cThe general purpose of \u00a7 53-21 is to protect the physical and psychological well-being of children from the potentially harmful conduct of adults.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\">. Canales argues that <em>Neri-Hernandes </em>is not good law because it contradicted the holding of a prior case, <em>Omari v. Gonzales, </em>419 F.3d 303 (5th Cir.2005). <em>Omari, </em>however, involved the use of documents to determine the facts of the offense, while <em>Neri-Hernandes </em>involved the use of documents that directly identified the statutory subsection of conviction, making the cases distinguishable. <em>Compare Omari, </em>419 F.3d at 308-09, <em>with Neri-Hernandes, </em>504 F.3d at 590-92.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\">. Canales\u2019s argument that his plea of nolo contendere does not admit facts is irrelevant. The entry of a nolo plea does not affect the result of this case because the relevant question under the Guidelines is whether the defendant has a conviction for a COV, not whether he has admitted to being guilty of such a crime. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\">. Canales's written objection was that this was not a \"drug trafficking offense.\u201d At the sentencing hearing, his counsel explained that this was a mistake and he meant to object to the documentation. His counsel further argued: \"I have to speak as to what he was really charged with in this case. I also have a serious question as to the side of it as being brought to us. What are intimate parts? You know ... that could mean the head, the feet[ ], the hands of a child? So ... I wanted to make clear that I\u2019m objecting to this enhancement based on what we have here.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b333-8\">. As Canales concedes, his argument that an age-differential requirement is necessary for \"sexual abuse of a minor\u201d is foreclosed. <em>Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d at 562 n. 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
