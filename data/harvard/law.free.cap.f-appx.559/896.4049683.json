He appeals his sentence, arguing that it is greater than necessary and substantively unreasonable because the District Court focused excessively on his criminal history and failed to give due consideration to relevant sentencing factors included within those set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), that is, his motivation for returning to the United States, his severe addiction to alcohol, and his impending deportation upon completion of his prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Domingo also argues that a sentence within the Guidelines range, 21 to 27 months confinement, would have been sufficient to provide just punishment, protect the public, and deter him from further criminal activity. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a)(2)(A),(B) and (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We may \u201cset aside a sentence only if we determine, after giving a full measure of deference to the sentencing judge, that the sentence imposed truly is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">The District Court was required to impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra. </em>In imposing a particular sentence, the court had to consider as well the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">When a sentencing court determines that a sentence outside the applicable Guidelines range is appropriate, it must consider the extent of the deviation and provide sufficient justification for the degree of the variance. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008). We \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The reasonableness of a sentence may also be indicated when the sentence imposed is well below the statutory maximum sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">Domingo does not demonstrate that his sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The District Court explained why a variance from the Guidelines range was necessary to meet the goals encompassed within 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court expressed its concern that the Guidelines range did not adequately reflect Domingo\u2019s particular circumstances, including that, since his reentry, Domingo had 11 convictions, including three DUIs and a hit and run. The court indicated that an upward variance was necessary to promote specific deterrence, to protect the public from Domingo\u2019s criminal conduct, and to reflect the seriousness of the offense in this case, which included putting the public at risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>from Domingo\u2019s sometimes-violent criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Although the court placed specific emphasis on Domingo\u2019s criminal history, the record indicates that it did not do so \u201csingle-mindedly\u201d to the detriment of all of the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.2006). The court acknowledged Domingo\u2019s alcoholism and indicated it would not punish him for it. However, the court indicated that the problem with Domingo\u2019s alcoholism is that he \u201cengages in conduct that is harmful and could be not only dangerous but fatal to other people while he\u2019s under the influence.\u201d The court also acknowledged Domingo\u2019s argument that his motivation for reentering the United States was to earn money to send back to his family in Guatemala. However, the court found that Domingo\u2019s economic motivation to enter the United States would remain unchanged after time served for the instant offense, and his subsequent deportation, and that deterrence called for a longer, rather than a shorter, prison term. The weight to be given any particular sentencing factor is left to the sound discretion of the court, absent a clear error of judgment. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Williams, 526 </em>F.3d at 1322. Moreover, while Domingo\u2019s month sentence is significantly higher than the Guidelines range of 21 to 27 months, the sentence is well below the 10-year statutory maximum penalty. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Because Domingo\u2019s sentence is supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the court adequately explained its reasons for issuing an upward variance, it did not commit a clear error of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-8\">.
