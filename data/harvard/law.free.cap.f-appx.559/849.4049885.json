She contends that her sentence is procedurally unreasonable, substantively unreasonable, and a violation of her right to equal protection under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-23\">In May 2010 Heard was the front seat passenger in a car pulled over by a sher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>iff s officer in Butts County, Georgia. The officer found 1,995 grams of cocaine and 419.56 grams of marijuana in a bag sitting on the car\u2019s backseat. The officer arrested all three of the car\u2019s occupants \u2014 Heard, the driver, and the back seat passenger. When the jail officers searched Heard during her intake, they found 39 grams of marijuana hidden in her vagina. In her interview with investigators, Heard explained that the driver was her boyfriend, that she was only along for the ride to Jacksonville, and that she did not know about the drugs in the bag on the backseat. The other two occupants did not contradict her story when investigators interviewed them. The driver and the backseat passenger were charged with two felonies: possession with intent to distribute cocaine, and possession with intent to distribute marijuana. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(ii), (b)(1)(D); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Heard was charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Heard pleaded guilty to the misdemean- or in October 2010. Her guidelines range was 0 to 6 months in prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court sentenced Heard in March 2011 to one year of probation \u2014 with the condition that she participate in a substance abuse program. She did not raise any objections at the sentence hearing and did not appeal the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Eight months into her probation, in December 2011, Heard\u2019s probation officer filed a petition to revoke her probation. The probation officer alleged that Heard violated mandatory conditions of her supervised release three times: (1) possessing marijuana in September 2011, (2) being arrested for felony shoplifting in November 2011, and (3) being arrested for felony shoplifting in December 2011. At her revocation hearing in February 2012, Heard admitted that she had possessed marijuana during her supervised release, and the court sentenced her to two months imprisonment followed by one year of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">After Heard served her sentence and began her year of supervised release, her probation officer filed another petition for revocation in May 2012. He alleged that Heard violated the terms of her supervised release this time by: being arrested for felony shoplifting in March 2012,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and twice failing to submit to required drug testing in April 2012. After the petition was filed, Heard was again arrested for felony shoplifting in July 2012. The officer filed a revocation report that included two Grade B probation violations for violating a state law while on probation, and two Grade C probation violations for failing to report for drug testing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">At the revocation hearing in September 2012, Heard admitted that she had violated the terms of her probation by missing the two drug tests. The government decided not to pursue the other two violations, so Heard had a guidelines range of 3 to 9 months in prison. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a). Heard\u2019s attorney argued against prison time on two grounds. The first was that Heard had missed the two drug tests because she could not get a ride to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>probation office. Counsel pointed out that Heard had tested negative in her seven other drug tests. The second asserted ground was that Heard was suffering from depression, and because she had recently become pregnant she had stopped taking her medication. Counsel asked the court, if it did revoke Heard\u2019s probation, \u201cto place her on home detention, at least until the baby is born, to give her a chance to have proper prenatal care at her expense and not at the expense of the government. And also so that the baby may be born in a hospital.\u201d The government agreed that Heard\u2019s mental health issues had played a role in her string of probation violations and did not push for prison time. The district court, however, was \u201cconvinced that a period of incarceration [was] appropriate here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">The district court entered an order revoking Heard\u2019s supervised release. Based on its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8558(a) sentencing factors, the court sentenced Heard to five months in prison. She has not yet served her sentence because the district court granted her motion for release pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Heard contends that her sentence is procedurally unreasonable, substantively unreasonable, and a violation of her equal protection rights. All three contentions rely on selected statements from the hearing, taken out of context to create the appearance of error. We address each in turn, quoting from the transcript to provide proper context for the district court\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Heard contends that her sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court based it on an erroneous fact finding. At the revocation hearing, the district court heard both attorneys\u2019 opening statements and then began its questions with the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-10\">[I]t\u2019s been one thing after another since Ms. Heard received very favorable treatment, I think, when she was sentenced on the substantive offense here. She did plead to the indictment, but I think the indictment was drawn \u2014 I think she got a good deal, very much so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-11\">And I\u2019m not complaining about that, I signed off on that. But you would think that with that \u201cgood deal\u201d \u2014 I remember [the prosecutor] talking then that this was her opportunity to get things back on track. And it\u2019s been constantly off track ever since. So how are things going to be different if there is not some period of incarceration?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">Heard contends that these statements amount to an erroneous fact finding that she received a favorable plea bargain from the government, when she actually entered her guilty plea without any bargain. She argues that the district court sentenced her to prison time based on its mistaken belief that she received a favorable plea bargain, and concludes that doing so was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">The parties argue over which standard of review we should apply here. The government argues that Heard failed to object to this issue at the revocation hearing, so we should review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). Heard claims that she did object, and that we should apply our normal abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Register, </em>678 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2012). We need not decide the issue because Heard\u2019s challenge fails under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">A fact finding cannot make a defendant\u2019s sentence procedurally unreasonable unless the finding was (1) clearly erroneous and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>(2) a basis for the court\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that procedural error exists where the district court \u201cselects [the] sentence based on clearly erroneous facts\u201d). Heard has proven neither requisite. First, contrary to Heard\u2019s assertion, the district court did not make a factual finding that she had received a favorable plea deal from the government. The court acknowledged that Heard \u201cdid plead to the indictment\u201d without a plea bargain, so it was not under the mistaken impression that Heard received a plea deal. And the court observing that a misdemeanor was \u201ca good deal\u201d for Heard was merely an observation, not a finding of fact. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1199 n. 26 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (distinguishing a \u201ccharacterization\u201d from \u201ca finding of fact\u201d). Second, Heard does not identify anything in the record indicating that the court sentenced her to prison time because it believed she originally got \u201ca good deal.\u201d Everything in the record suggests the opposite. The court expressly removed the government\u2019s charging decision from its considerations, saying that it was \u201cnot complaining about\u201d the fact that Heard was originally charged with a misdemeanor. And in deciding Heard\u2019s sentence, the court justified the five-month prison term based on its consideration of the guidelines range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 without mentioning Heard\u2019s original charge, plea, or sentence. Thus Heard\u2019s challenge fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Heard contends that her sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court: (1) imposed her sentence in order to promote her rehabilitation, which is an impermissible basis for imposing a sentence; and (2) misapplied the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In reviewing the substantive reasonableness of Heard\u2019s sentence, we consider the totality of the circumstances and will reverse the district court only for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cA sentence may be substantively unreasonable if a district court unjustifiably relied on any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor, failed to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected the sentence arbitrarily, or based the sentence on impermissible factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">First, Heard contends that the district court relied on an impermissible factor by sentencing her to prison so that she could receive treatment for her mental health issues. Sentencing courts cannot impose or lengthen a prison sentence based on the defendant\u2019s rehabilitative needs. <em>See Tapia v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2391, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011) (\u201cSection 3582(a) precludes sentencing courts from imposing or lengthening a prison term to promote an offender\u2019s rehabilitation.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Bennett, </em>698 F.3d 194, 197-98 (4th Cir.2012) (holding that <em>Tapia </em>applies to the revocation of probation). But the district court did neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">At the revocation hearing, the district court quickly made it clear that it was leaning toward giving Heard another prison sentence. Then Heard\u2019s attorney \u2014 not the court \u2014 raised the issue of rehabilitation by saying \u201cThe question, Your Honor, then is how incarceration rehabilitates her.\u201d Counsel argued that prison would set Heard\u2019s rehabilitation back by preventing her from getting help for her mental health issues. The court dismissed that argument. Initially, the court admonished counsel that \u201cwe\u2019re not here for a philosophical discussion about rehabilitation and what role incarceration plays in that.\u201d The court then went on to explain why it believed that prison would not negatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>affect Heard\u2019s rehabilitation. It countered defense counsel\u2019s argument by noting that, \u201cIt seems to me that in many ways the argument could be made that a period of incarceration is in her interest and in the interest of the child.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Then the court also pointed out that Heard could \u201chopefully ... get appropriate counseling\u201d for her mental health issues while she was \u201cin a federal facility or under federal jurisdiction.\u201d The court never said that it was sentencing Heard to prison so that she could receive rehabilitative services, or that it was choosing a specific sentence length so that she could receive rehabilitative services. <em>Compare Tapia, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2385 (holding that a court could not impose a particular sentence length to ensure that the defendant would complete a prison substance abuse program). And when it came time to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court did not indicate that rehabilitation was a factor in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">For these reasons, the district court did not err by pointing out, in response to an argument from Heard\u2019s attorney, that a prison term would not negatively affect Heard\u2019s rehabilitation. <em>See id. </em>at 2392 (\u201cA court commits no error by discussing the opportunities for rehabilitation within prison or the benefits of specific treatment or training programs.\u201d). And even if the district court did err, Heard invited that error by arguing that the court should consider her rehabilitation; we are precluded from reviewing invited errors. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>443 F.3d 822, 823-24 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Second, Heard contends that the district court misapplied the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors by failing to give proper weight to her mitigating evidence that she suffered from mental health problems.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Heard recounts the evidence that was presented to the district court, but offers no reason why the weight the district court gave to her mental health issues amounted to an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (\u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d). Thus Heard\u2019s challenge fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Finally, Heard contends that the district court violated her right to equal protection by giving her a longer sentence because she was a woman. At the revocation hearing, the court made two references to Heard\u2019s unborn child while discussing whether a prison' sentence would deter her from future misconduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) (making \u201cadequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d a factor to consider at sentencing). First, it asked a rhetorical question: \u201cIf she is not incarcerated for some period of time, and <em>I\u2019m </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number><em>thinking about the baby too, </em>what\u2019s going to be any different as we go forward.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Later, after Heard\u2019s attorney urged the court to consider \u201chow incarceration rehabilitates her\u201d and argued that prison time would negatively affect Heard\u2019s rehabilitation because she would not receive treatment for her mental health issues, the court responded: \u201cIt seems to me that in many ways the argument could be made that a period of incarceration is in [Heard\u2019s] interest and in the <em>interest of the child.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Heard argues that those two statements show that she \u201creceived a harsher sentence than a similarly situated male for no other reason than her female gender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Neither of those statements shows that the district court would have treated a similarly situated male differently. The statements show a concern with deterring future misconduct for the sake of the child \u2014 irrespective of its parent\u2019s gender. The court could have just as easily made the same statements to a single' father with a young child. If a single father\u2019s attorney raised the issue of who would care for the child with the father in prison, the court could acknowledge, as it did in this case, that it was \u201cthinking about the baby\u201d and that \u201ca period of incarceration is in [the father\u2019s] interest and in the interest of the child.\u201d Because the statements do not show that the district court would have treated a father differently, Heard has not made the basic showing needed for an equal protection challenge \u2014 that a similarly situated male would have been treated differently. <em>See Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, </em>420 U.S. 636, 653, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 1236, 43 L.Ed.2d 514 (1975) (explaining that plaintiff must show \u201cdissimilar treatment for men and women who are ... similarly situated\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Thus Heard\u2019s challenge fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">For those reasons we hold that the district court did not err in sentencing Heard to five months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-8\">. Heard's adjusted offense level was 2 (a base offense level of 4, minus 2 for acceptance of responsibility), and her criminal history category was I \u2014 yielding a range of 0 to 6 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b875-9\">. The petition for revocation alleges that Heard was arrested for felony shoplifting in Gwinnett County on March 22, 2012. The record does not indicate how Heard was arrested on that date, when it appears that she should have still been serving the two-month prison sentence the district court gave her on February 9, 2012. We need not resolve that discrepancy because the parties do not make it an issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-5\">. It is not entirely clear what the district court meant by this. As best as we can tell, the court was referring to its view that prison time was necessary to deter Heard from future misconduct, and that deterring her from such misconduct would ultimately be in her interest. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) (making \u201cadequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d a factor to consider at sentencing).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b878-10\">. Heard also asserts that her sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court based the sentence on her gender and the court\u2019s perception that she got a favorable plea deal. As we explain in the sections addressing those issues more fully, the district court did not sentence Heard based on either of those reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
