We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-16\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b360-17\">Gillie was an employee at the Louisiana Department of Child Support Enforcement. A supervisor requested that Gillie deliver a termination letter to an employee\u2019s home, and Gillie refused. She alleges that after refusing to deliver the letter, her supervisor began to avoid her and refused to speak with her. A few months later, Gillie received complaints in her performance plan review and was transferred to the Department of Children and Family Services Central Human Resources (\u201cDCFSHR\u201d) following a re-organization of her department. Gillie claims that she was not given proper training for her new position. She received a \u201cneeds improvement\u201d on her performance plan review from the DCFSHR.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-18\">That same year, Gillie\u2019s physician ordered her to spend three weeks on bed rest for diabetic ulcers on her feet. Gillie went on medical leave and began applying for extended leave under the FMLA. One week later, Gillie\u2019s supervisor notified her that she was being terminated pursuant to a governor-sponsored layoff plan due to budget cuts. Her supervisor further informed her that she was ineligible for rehiring due to her recent performance plan review rating. Later, co-workers informed Gillie that the governor-sponsored layoff plan was never approved, and performance ratings were not a basis for the layoffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-19\">Gillie filed a complaint with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), and she was given notice that she had a right to sue under Title VII. Gillie filed this suit, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss, which the district court granted. Gillie timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo. Kane Enters. v. MacGregor (USA) Inc., </em>322 F.3d 371, 374 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, \u2018to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). While a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff is held to less stringent standards than lawyers, \u201ceonclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Books A Million, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 376, 378 (5th Cir.2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Gillie asserts that she was terminated on account of her race, sex, and color in violation of Title VII, but her complaint does not set forth any factual allegations to support her claims. She does not allege that her position was filled by an individual outside her class or that she was treated less favorably, which is required to establish a prima facie discrimination case. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Her assertion of discrimination is a legal conclusion that is not sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. <em>See Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678-79, 129 S.Ct. 1937. Gillie\u2019s ADEA claim suffers the same flaw: she does not allege that she was terminated as a result of her age or that she was replaced by someone younger. <em>See Jackson v. Cal-W. Packaging Corp., </em>602 F.3d 374, 378 (5th Cir.2010) (ADEA claims require a showing that, inter alia, the plaintiff was \u201creplaced by someone younger, or [] otherwise discharged because of [her] age\u201d). Thus, the district court properly dismissed Gillie\u2019s Title VII and ADEA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Gillie\u2019s claim for retaliation under the ADEA fails because she does not allege facts sufficient to establish that she participated in statutorily protected activity, which she must show to establish a prima facie case. <em>See Mayberry v. Vought Aircraft Co., </em>55 F.3d 1086, 1092 (5th Cir.1995). Gillie\u2019s retaliation claim hinges on her allegation that her refusal to deliver a termination letter triggered retaliatory acts. However, refusal to deliver a termination letter is not a statutorily protected activity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the district court properly dismissed Gillie\u2019s retaliation claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Finally, the district court properly dismissed Gillie\u2019s FMLA claim. To make an FMLA claim, Gillie must allege facts demonstrating, <em>inter alia, </em>that her leave was interfered with or that she was denied restoration to her position pursuant to valid FMLA leave. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2614(1); <em>see also Mauder v. Metro. Transit Auth. of Harris Cnty., Tex., </em>446 F.3d 574, 580 (5th Cir.2006). Gillie\u2019s complaint merely contains eonclusory statements, without any facts alleged, that her entitlement to take leave was interfered with and that she was denied restoration following valid FMLA leave, which is not sufficient to defeat a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>motion to dismiss. <em>See Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678-79, 129 S.Ct. 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\">. While her EEOC complaint would be a statutorily protected activity, it was not filed until after the facts giving rise to the retaliation claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-12\">. On appeal, Gillie raises for the first time a claim of First Amendment retaliation. \"We do[ ] not review issues raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
