Rowland Trucking Company, Inc.\u2019s Dallas, Texas truck terminal, in addition to an 18% penalty and attorney\u2019s fees. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">I. Factual &amp; Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Plaintiff-Appellee W.W. Rowland Trucking Company, Inc. (\u201cRowland\u201d) transported a load of video game consoles valued at $354,000 from Marshall, Texas, to its Dallas, Texas terminal. Thieves stole the tractor/trailer loaded with the consoles while it was located at the Dallas terminal. At the time of the theft, Rowland had an insurance policy (\u201cthe Policy\u201d) with Defendant-Appellant Max America Insurance Company, also known as Alterra America Insurance Company (\u201cAlterra\u201d). The Policy\u2019s section entitled \u201cCoverage\u201d provides for \u201cLegal Liability Coverage,\u201d which covers Rowland\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">[L]egal liability for loss to covered property: a. while under [Rowland\u2019s] care, custody, and control; [and] b. that [Rowland] become[s] legally obligated to pay as a common or contract carrier under a bill of lading, contract of carriage, or shipping receipt that is issued by [Rowland] or that is issued on [Rowland\u2019s] behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">Under the \u201cProperty Covered\u201d section, the Policy provides coverage for \u201cProperty in Vehicles,\u201d defined as \u201cdirect physical loss caused by a covered peril to property of others described on the \u2018schedule of coverages\u2019 while in due course of \u2018transit\u2019 including loading and unloading.\u201d The parties do not dispute that theft is a \u201ccovered peril.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Policy also provides that all eight of Rowland\u2019s terminals must be \u201c100% fenced, gated, locked and lighted 24 hours per day, 7 days per week,\u201d or else the \u201c[coverage is null and void.\u201d The Policy had a limit of $300,000, and included a $2,500 deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">Following the theft, Rowland filed a claim with Alterra. Alterra investigated the loss and determined that the thieves entered and left the property by cutting a hole in the fencing along the eastern perimeter of the Dallas terminal. However, Alterra ultimately denied the claim because it discovered that there were gaps in the fence along the southern and western perimeters in violation of the Policy\u2019s fencing provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">Rowland subsequently filed this lawsuit in state court alleging negligence, breach of contract, and violations of the Texas Insurance Code and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act. Alterra removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. The parties filed cross-motions for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>judgment, and the district court held a hearing on the motions. The district court applied Texas\u2019s Anti-Technicality Statute, Tex. Ins.Code Ann. \u00a7 862.054 (West 2013), which requires that there be a causal link between the breach in the policy provision and the loss in order for an insurer to deny a claim under a property insurance policy. The district court held that the breach of the Policy\u2019s fencing provision did not cause the theft loss, and it concluded that Alterra breached its contract with Rowland by failing to pay on Rowland\u2019s claim. The district court entered summary judgment in Rowland\u2019s favor, and it ordered Alterra to pay the claim plus 18% interest per year in damages and attorney\u2019s fees. Alterra moved for reconsideration, which the district court denied. Al-terra timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">II. Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We review the district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court in the first instance. <em>Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., </em>476 F.3d 337, 343 (5th Cir.2007). Because we have diversity jurisdiction over this action, we must apply the substantive law of the forum state. <em>See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). It is undisputed that Texas law governs this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We review the district court\u2019s award of prejudgment interest for abuse of discretion. <em>Jauch v. Nautical Servs., Inc., </em>470 F.3d 207, 214 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Alterra raises three issues on appeal. First, it claims that summary judgment in Rowland\u2019s favor is improper. According to Alterra, Texas\u2019s AntiTechnicality Statute, Tex. Ins.Code Ann. \u00a7 862.054 (West 2013), does not apply to the present claim because Rowland has a liability insurance policy as opposed to a property policy, and the Anti-Technicality Statute does not govern a liability policy. Second, Alterra asserts that the district court erred in ordering it to pay 18% interest to Rowland under the Prompt Payment of Claims Statute, Tex. Ins.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 542.051-.061, because the statute only applies to first-party claims and this is a third-party claim. Lastly, Alterra argues that even if we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment, we should reverse its award of attorney\u2019s fees since Rowland\u2019s initial demand for damages was in excess of the insurance policy\u2019s limits. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">A. Application of the Anti-Technicality Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">Alterra argues that the district court erred in applying Texas Insurance Code \u00a7 862.054, also known as the Anti-Technicality Statute, to Rowland\u2019s insurance claim because, according to Alterra, the statute applies only to property insurance coverage and not to liability insurance coverage. The Anti-Technicality Statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">Unless the breach or violation contributed to cause the destruction of the property, a breach or violation by the insured of a warranty, condition, or provision of a fire insurance policy <em>or contract of insurance on personal property, </em>or of an application for the policy or contract: (1) does not render the policy or contract void; and (2) is not a defense to a suit for loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">Tex. Ins.Code Ann. \u00a7 862.054 (emphasis added). The district court applied the Anti-Technicality Statute to Rowland\u2019s insurance claim, explaining that the statute uses the phrase \u201cpersonal property\u201d in contrast to \u201creal property,\u201d and the stolen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>property at issue was \u201cclearly\u201d not real property, so the statute applied. The district court also found that Rowland, as a common carrier, acted as a bailee for the cargo owner, so Rowland maintained all of the rights and responsibilities of a legal owner. Such rights include \u201cthe right to recover the full value of bailed goods as though it was the owner.\u201d Additionally, in response to Alterra\u2019s claim that the statute did not apply to liability policies, the district court commented that none of the legal sources on which Alterra relied expressly supported its position, but did not ultimately decide this question. The district court interpreted the statute to mean that \u201crecovery depends on the loss suffered \u2014 as opposed to the type of insurance chosen.\u201d Since Alterra had not shown that the pre-existing gaps in the fence aided in the theft, under the statute, the Policy was still valid and Alterra\u2019s failure to pay Rowland for the claim amounted to a breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">On appeal, Alterra argues that the insurance contract with Rowland is a liability policy and, as such, the Anti-Technicality Statute does not apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rowland counters that the Policy is a property policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Whether a policy is a property policy, liability policy, or both, depends on the policy\u2019s language. <em>See Highlands Ins. Co. v. City of Galveston, </em>721 S.W.2d 469, 471 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1986, writ refd n.r.e.). Texas law distinguishes between property insurance and liability insurance. \u201cA policy of property insurance is a personal contract for indemnity for the insurable interest possessed by the insured at the time of the issuance of the policy, and also at the time of the loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cCoverage in a property policy is commonly provided by reference to causation, such as \u2018loss caused by ...\u2019 certain enumerated forces. It is precisely these physical forces that bring about the loss.\u201d <em>Warrilow v. Norrell, </em>791 S.W.2d 515, 527 (Tex.App.-Corpus Christi 1989, writ denied) (citation omitted) (alteration in original). Liability insurance provides coverage based on \u201ctraditional tort concepts of fault, proximate cause, and duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528; <em>see also Highlands, </em>721 S.W.2d at 471 (\u201cLiability policies ... insure against loss aris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ing out of legal liability, usually based upon the assured\u2019s negligence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Policies that reference the insured\u2019s \u201clegal liability\u201d are not by default liability insurance contracts. <em>See, e.g., Hudiburg Chevrolet, Inc. v. Globe Indem. Co., </em>394 S.W.2d 792, 796-97 (Tex.1965). In Texas, \u201c[p]oliey provisions covering property contained in specific places and \u2018for which the insured is liable,\u2019 have been held to insure against loss of the property and not to indemnify insured against his legal responsibility in tort or by contract to the owners of the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 29 Am.Jur. Insurance \u00a7 295). This is because an insured bailee may sue for losses and account to the owner. <em>See id. </em>at 797. In fact, absent limiting language in an insurance policy, \u201cTexas law presumes that a bailee has insured both its interest and the bailor\u2019s interest when the bailee takes an insurance policy on the bailed goods.\u201d <em>United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Mundell Terminal Servs., Inc., </em>740 F.3d 1022, 1028 (5th Cir.2014) (citing <em>Cumis Ins. Soc\u2019y, Inc. v. Republic Nat\u2019l Bank of Dall., </em>480 S.W.2d 762, 764-65 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1972, writ ref'd n.r.e.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Policies that insure against the theft of property belonging to a third party while under the control of the insured have previously been considered property policies under Texas law. In <em>Hudiburg, </em>the insured, Hudiburg Chevrolet, had a contract with a third party to store a truck, and the truck was stolen from the premises. <em>See </em>394 S.W.2d at 793-94. Hudiburg Chevrolet\u2019s insurance policy covered \u201call sums which the insured shall become obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law for direct loss of or damage including loss of use by theft ... to automobiles which are the property of others and in the custody of the insured for storage....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 796. The insurance company argued that the policy covered Hudiburg Chevrolet only \u201cin the event of the insured\u2019s legal liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the Texas Supreme Court disagreed, explaining that the policy covered \u201cthe property itself and not by way of indemnity only,\u201d and that the policy amounted to property insurance, even though the insured did not own the property and was only \u201cliable\u201d for the property. <em>Id. </em>at 796-97. Although the property was owned by a third party, and Hudiburg had a legal duty to that third party, the loss was still covered by the terms of the property policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">We recently decided <em>United National, </em>which involved similar facts to those before us here, and in so doing, we described the nature of the applicable insurance policy. In <em>United National, </em>a company owned a warehouse which stored copper sheeting pursuant to a contract with the owner. 740 F.3d at 1024. The company that owned the warehouse had an insurance policy that covered \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage to Covered Property at the premises described in the Declarations caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The policy covered the theft of the personal property of others that was in the insured\u2019s \u201ccare, custody, or control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We discussed the nature of the insurance policy and concluded that since the warehouse was a bailee of the copper sheeting, the insurance policy covering the loss of the sheeting due to theft was a \u201cfirst-party property policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Alterra urges us to apply <em>Esco Transportation Company v. General Insurance Company of America, </em>75 Fed.Appx. 936, 939 (5th Cir.2003), to the present case, arguing that <em>Esco </em>held that a policy with similar language to the policy at issue here constituted a liability policy. This is a misstatement of the case. The legal question at issue in <em>Esco </em>was whether the insured had provided sufficient proof to the insurance company to establish its loss. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>Id. </em>In discussing this issue, we repeatedly-referred to the insured\u2019s \u201clegal liability\u201d to a third-party owner of property for the loss of that property. <em>Id. </em>We did not, however, explicitly characterize the underlying insurance policy as a liability policy, as opposed to a property policy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Like the policies at issue in <em>Hudiburg </em>and <em>United National, </em>Rowland\u2019s Policy clearly states that it covers the \u201closs of property of others ... while in due course of \u2018transit\u2019 including loading and loading.\u201d Moreover, just as in <em>Hudiburg </em>and <em>United National, </em>Rowland\u2019s claim is based on the theft of property owned by a third party while in Rowland\u2019s custody. Although the Coverage section of the Policy states that it covers Rowland\u2019s \u201clegal liability for loss to the covered property,\u201d the use of \u201clegal liability\u201d and the fact that a third-party owned the property does not transform the policy into a liability policy. <em>See, e.g., Hudiburg </em>394 S.W.2d at 796-97. As a bailee, Rowland had an insured interest in the stolen video game consoles. Thus, the relevant portions of Rowland\u2019s Policy covering those consoles amount to property insurance, not liability insurance. Therefore, we hold that the district court properly applied the Anti-Technicality Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">B. Prompt Payment Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Alterra claims that the district court erroneously ordered Alterra to pay an 18% penalty to Rowland, in addition to the amount of the claim and attorney fees, and that the district court improperly calculated the date from which the interest would accrue. The Texas Insurance Code includes a subchapter providing for the \u201cPrompt Payment of Claims.\u201d <em>See </em>Tex. Ins.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 542.051-.061 (\u201cPrompt Payment Statute\u201d). In the event an insurance carrier fails to meet its obligations under the statute, such as by refusing to timely pay a valid claim, the claimant is entitled to 18% interest as damages and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 542.060. By its terms, the Prompt Payment Statute only applies to first-party claims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 542.051. Alterra argues that Rowland\u2019s claim is a third-party claim, so the statute does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The Prompt Payment Statute does not define first-party claims, but Texas law distinguishes between first-party and third-party claims \u201cbased on the claimant\u2019s relationship to the loss.\u201d <em>Evanston Ins. Co. v. ATOFINA Petrochemicals, Inc., </em>256 S.W.3d 660, 674 (Tex.2008). In a first-party claim, the insured \u201cseeks recovery for the insured\u2019s own loss\u201d; in a third-party claim, the insured \u201cseeks coverage for injuries to a third party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because a bailee has an insurable interest in the bailed goods, <em>see Cumis Ins. Soc\u2019y, Inc., </em>480 S.W.2d at 766, insurance claims to recover for losses to the bailed goods are first-party claims, <em>cf. United Nat\u2019l, </em>740 F.3d at 1027. Rowland\u2019s claim is a first-party claim because Rowland has an insured interest in the game consoles. Thus, the Prompt Payment Statute applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Alterra also claims that the district court\u2019s imposition of the penalty with an accrual date of April 11, 2011, is improper because it claims that it was not presented with proof of the value of the stolen cargo until March 15, 2013. Rowland contends that the accrual date of April 11, 2011, is appropriate because Alterra had sixty days from when Alterra issued its February 9, 2011 report to pay the claim, and Alterra\u2019s own report showed that the loss exceeded the $300,000 policy limit. Since Alterra was fully aware that the loss exceeded the policy limit as of April 11, 2011, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>est accruing as of this date. <em>Jauch, </em>470 F.3d at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">C. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Alterra\u2019s final claim is that the district court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to Rowland. Alterra\u2019s argument is specific to awards of attorney\u2019s fees made pursuant to Chapter 38 of the Texas Insurance Code, and it does not challenge the award of attorney\u2019s fees under the Prompt Payment Statute (aside from the previously rejected argument). The Prompt Payment Statute applies to this claim, and the statute provides for awards of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in addition to the 18% penalty. <em>See </em>Tex. Ins.Code Ann. \u00a7 542.060. Thus, we affirm the award of attorney\u2019s fees under the Prompt Payment Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">IY. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-16\">. The record does not contain a copy of the complete insurance policy or the \"schedule of coverages.\u201d However, neither party contends that theft is not covered by the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-5\">. This argument assumes that application of the Anti-Technicality Statute depends on the nature of the insurance policy, not the nature of the loss. Rowland contends that the opposite is true \u2014 that the application of the statute depends on the nature of the loss. According to Rowland, since the loss here was of personal property, the statute applies. We disagree and find Rowland's interpretation of the statute unconvincing based on the plain text of the statute. The statute applies to \"a fire insurance <em>policy </em>or a <em>contract of insurance </em>on personal property.\u201d Tex. Ins.Code Ann. \u00a7 862.054 (emphasis added). This language clearly refers to the type of policy and not simply the type of loss. <em>See generally Tex. Adjutant Gen.\u2019s Office v. Ngakoue, </em>408 S.W.3d 350, 362 (Tex.2013) (holding when interpreting statutes, courts must give \"words their plain, ordinary meaning unless the statute indicates an alternative meaning\u201d). The district court\u2019s conclusion was based only in part on the interpretation of the statute that Rowland argues for, and as to that part, we respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AY4\">Alterra\u2019s challenge also claims that a liability policy would be excluded from the Anti-Technicality Statute. We note that a liability policy is not included in the plain language of the statute. <em>See </em>Tex. Ins.Code Ann. \u00a7 862.054. However, since we find that the relevant coverage in Rowland's insurance contract amounts to property insurance, we need not address Alterra\u2019s assertion that the Anti-Technicality Statute does not apply to a liability policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\">. Alterra argues that Rowland has waived this argument since it is raised for the first time in Rowland\u2019s response brief. Yet, Alterra argues here, and argued before the district court, that the policy was a liability policy, not a property policy. Thus, we find that Alterra sufficiently raised this issue and it has not been waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
