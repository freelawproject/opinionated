Six Unknown Agents of the Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and the dismissal of his negligent training claim brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). Dorsey specifically alleges that the district court erred in determining that Thomas Relf and Jordan Boone did not act with deliberate indifference when they failed to transport him to medical after he fell out of his wheelchair, that the court erred by sua sponte granting summary judgment on his negligence claims, and that the court erred by determining that his claim for negligent training was barred by the discretionary function exception in the FTCA. Dorsey had not briefed any additional claims; thus, he has abandoned, by failing to brief, any argument relative to the district court\u2019s dismissal of the remaining claims raised in his complaint. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); FED. R. APP. P. 28(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">First, Dorsey, a paraplegic confined to a wheelchair, argues that Relf and Boone acted with deliberate indifference because they did not transport him to medical after they discovered that he had fallen out of his wheelchair; Dorsey alleges that he informed Relf and Boone that he was in pain and that he thought that his leg was broken. This court reviews the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Xtreme Lashes, LLC v. Xtended Beauty, Inc., </em>576 F.3d 221, 226 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Dorsey has not carried his burden of showing that Relf and Boone\u2019s conduct was \u201creckless \u2014 without regard to the rights of others,\u201d \u201ccauseless[ ], without restraint, and in reckless disregard of the rights of others.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Treen, </em>759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>Smith v. Wade, </em>461 U.S. 30, 39 n. 8, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983), internal quotation marks omitted). It is undisputed that Dorsey fell out of his wheelchair during \u201ccount,\u201d in which prison officials perform a count of each prisoner. According to Bureau of Prisons (BOP) policy, count is not to be interrupted, and prisoners are not to be moved during count, absent an emergency, which includes a severe medical condition that warrants timely medical attention. It is likewise undisputed that Relf and Boone inspected Dorsey\u2019s leg and discovered no swelling, blood, or protruding bone; Dorsey\u2019s medical treatment was delayed, at most, by an hour and fifteen minutes. Based on the lack of evidence establishing that Relf and Boone knew that Dorsey\u2019s leg was broken, the absence of obvious signs showing that his leg was broken, the fact that the incident occurred during count, and the length of the delay, Dorsey has failed to show that the district court erred in determining that Relf and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Boone did not act with deliberate indifference. <em>See Johnson v. Treen, </em>759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985); <em>see also Walker v. Butler, </em>967 F.2d 176, 178 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Second, Dorsey\u2019s argument that the district court erred in sua sponte granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on his negligence claims is belied by the record; he argues that he did not have an opportunity to provide evidence and argument supporting his negligence claims. Although Dorsey alleges that defendants did not move for summary judgment on these claims, the record reflects otherwise. <em>See John Deere Co. v. Am. Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>809 F.2d 1190, 1192 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Third, Dorsey has not established that the district court erred by determining that his negligent training claim was barred by the discretionary function exception to the FTCA. The FTCA provides a limited waiver of sovereign immunity from suit for claims regarding \u201cinjury or loss of property, or personal injury or death arising or resulting from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(1). Under the discretionary function exception, the waiver of immunity does not apply to any claim \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a); <em>see Guile v. United States, </em>422 F.3d 221, 229 (5th Cir.2005). BOP policy regarding count provides that if a medical issue arises during count, correctional officers are required to assess the situation and determine whether the medical condition is sufficiently severe to justify the interruption of count. Because Relf and Boone exercised their judgment and discretion when deciding not to interrupt count by transporting Dorsey to medical, he has not shown that the district court erred in determining that the challenged act involved \u201can element of judgment or choice\u201d and that Relfs and Boone\u2019s judgment was of \u201cthe kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.\u201d <em>United States v. Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. 315, 322-23, 111 S.Ct. 1267, 113 L.Ed.2d 335 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
