Nye filed a brief identifying arguable issues for appeal pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Brown did not respond to Nye\u2019s motion to withdraw or the <em>Anders </em>brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">After a careful, independent review of the record, we conclude that there are no non-frivolous grounds on which Brown could base an appeal. For this reason, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Brown\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
