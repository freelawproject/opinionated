Brinson\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines and the Fair Sentencing Act. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-21\">Brinson\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our precedent. We have held that defendants, like Brinson, whose sentences are based on the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not on the drug quantity tables, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, are ineligible for a reduction of their sentence under Amendment 750. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1074-79 (11th Cir.2010). Brinson also cannot obtain relief under the Fair Sentencing Act. The Act \u201cis not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission ... [that can] serve as a basis for a ... sentence reduction,\u201d and does not apply to Brinson because he was sentenced before the Act became effective on August 3, 2010. <em>See United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 181, 187 L.Ed.2d 124 (2013); <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376-78 (11th Cir.2012). The district court did not err by denying Brinson\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-24\">We AFFIRM the denial of Brinson\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
