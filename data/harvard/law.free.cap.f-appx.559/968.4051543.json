In its dismissal order, the court stated that Donawa conceded his failure to exhaust, although it did not identify where the concession occurred. Because Donawa\u2019s complaint did not concede a failure to exhaust, and in fact suggested that he exhausted his administrative remedies, we reverse the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-19\">On appeal, Donawa contends that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint because he did not fail to exhaust his administrative remedies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Defendants did not file a response brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-20\">We review a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A de novo, taking the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006). Moreover, we hold pro se pleadings to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and liberally construe them. <em>Id. </em>at 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-21\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) requires federal and state prisoners to exhaust available administrative remedies before bringing an action before a court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Alexander v. Hawk, </em>159 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir.1998). But, a plaintiff is not required to plead or demonstrate exhaustion in the complaint because the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement is an affirmative defense. <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 216-17, 127 S.Ct. 910, 921-22, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007) (discussing dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A and explaining that the PLRA does not impose heightened pleading standards). A district court may <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss a complaint under \u00a7 1915A for failure to exhaust only when lack of exhaustion \u201cappears on the face of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>the complaint.\u201d <em>Bingham v. Thomas, </em>654 F.3d 1171, 1175 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Here, the district court erred for two reasons. First, the record simply does not support the court\u2019s conclusion that Donawa conceded that he failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Rather, the complaint repeatedly asserted that Donawa pursued the BOP\u2019s administrative remedies, even though Donawa was not required to affirmatively plead exhaustion. Second, Dona-wa also alleged in the complaint that he was threatened and retaliated against for the administrative complaints he did pursue. We have previously held that in some situations \u201ca prison official\u2019s serious threats of substantial retaliation against an inmate for lodging or pursuing in good faith a grievance make the administrative remedy \u2018unavailable,\u2019 and thus lift the exhaustion requirement.\u201d <em>Turner v. Burnside, </em>541 F.3d 1077, 1085 (11th Cir.2008). So, Donawa\u2019s complaint \u2014 while not a model of clarity \u2014 suggests that the exhaustion requirement was met and any event does not concede that administrative remedies were not exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">The district court erred by dismissing the complaint when failure to exhaust administrative remedies was not apparent on the face of the complaint. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is reversed, and we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b992-17\">. Donawa also contends that the district court failed to provide him with adequate notice and dismissed his complaint in order to control its docket and discourage prisoner litigation. After careful review, we find no merit in these contentions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
