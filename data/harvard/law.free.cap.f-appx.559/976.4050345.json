Jones sought to raise two claims of ineffective assistance of counsel based on his trial counsel\u2019s failure to advise him of his ability to enter an open guilty plea and failure to pursue a substantial-assistance departure in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-21\">On appeal, Jones argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to advise him of Jones\u2019s ability to enter open guilty pleas. He states that he was unaware of his ability to enter his pleas without a plea agreement or to enter an agreement without an appeal waiver. He contends that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s assistance: his pleas were, in effect, involuntary and he was precluded from pursuing a direct appeal or seeking habeas relief. He also contends that the district court\u2019s sentence \u2014 although within the guidelines \u2014 is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-22\">The government asserts that the record is insufficient to evaluate the question on appeal and requests that we remand the case for further proceedings and factual development. It contends that the district court\u2019s rationales (mainly that Jones had voluntarily pleaded guilty) for denying Jones\u2019s motion were flawed because the rationales ignored the substance of Jones\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>claims and were not supported by the record. The government notes that the record is currently insufficient to evaluate the performance of Jones\u2019s trial counsel, partially due to the government\u2019s choosing to submit no affidavit from said counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">\u201cIn a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cA claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">We agree with the government that the district court erroneously concluded that Jones was precluded from raising his claims based on his guilty pleas, where Jones specifically challenged the voluntariness of the pleas. We also agree that the record is insufficiently developed to evaluate Jones\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance. Therefore, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal order and remand the case for further proceedings and factual development.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
