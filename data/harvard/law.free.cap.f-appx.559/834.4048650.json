Upon careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">We have seen Smith\u2019s case before. Initially the district court sentenced Smith to 60-months imprisonment and four years of supervised release based in part on his convictions for crack cocaine offenses. On direct appeal, we held that Smith should be resentenced under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010(FSA). <em>United States v. Smith, </em>481 Fed.Appx. 540, 545 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam). When he was resentenced, his guideline range was 30 to 37 months, and he was sentenced to time served, or 31-months imprisonment. Around seven months later, the probation officer filed a petition to revoke Smith\u2019s supervised release for seven alleged violations, including possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">For the revocation proceedings, Smith appeared before the same district court judge, who said he remembered Smith and thought he had been required to resen-tence Smith previously because he \u201cgot some credit off of a sentence based on the Fair Sentencing Act.\u201d The district court then varied upward from Smith\u2019s guideline range of 4 to 10 months and resentenced him to 14-months imprisonment. The court explained that it varied upward from the guideline range because Smith \u201cgot a break from the sentence that [he] received in this original case.\u201d Later, the court again stated that the variance was justified because Smith had received a \u201cbreak\u201d when he was resentenced under the FSA. The court added: \u201cIf stupid was a crime, you would be on death row.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">On appeal, Smith argues that his 14-month sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable. He claims that because the district court relied on a supposed \u201cbreak\u201d Smith received, it relied on a clearly erroneous fact which was an impermissible factor. Smith also emphasizes that he did not receive a \u201cbreak\u201d when he was resentenced under the FSA and instead merely received a legal sentence as provided by the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-16\">We review a challenged sentence first for procedural reasonableness and then for substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court properly calculated the guideline range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. Id. A factual finding is clearly erroneous if we are left with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>\u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\u201d even if there is evidence to support the finding. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1195 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">With regard to substantive reasonableness, we will only vacate a sentence involving an upward variance if we have the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that the district court clearly erred by weighing the \u00a7 3558(a) factors and that the defendant\u2019s sentence was outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts. <em>United States v. Early, </em>686 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009)). \u201cThe district court has wide discretion to decide whether the section 3553(a) factors justify a variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (citation omitted). We review <em>de novo, </em>as a question of law, whether a factor considered by the district court is impermissible. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence based entirely upon an impermissible factor is unreasonable because such a sentence does not achieve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Even if this Court finds a substantive or procedural error, we only remand for re-sentencing if the defendant was harmed by the error. <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1120-21, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). A defendant is harmed if we cannot conclude, based on the record as a whole, that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the erroneous factor. <em>Id. </em>We should affirm if we have \u201cfair assurance\u201d that the error did not substantially affect the sentence. <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Smith\u2019s sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court\u2019s conclusion that Smith\u2019s reduced sentence under the FSA was a \u201cbreak,\u201d in the sense that it was an unjustified benefit, was clearly erroneous. <em>See Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1195. The FSA was an act of Congress intended to reduce the historical sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses. Congress\u2019s decision to reduce this disparity was not a \u201cbreak\u201d for which prisoners lawfully entitled to be resentenced could be held accountable later. Thus, the district court was required to sentence Smith under the FSA after this Court vacated and remanded his original sentence in light of <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). The district court\u2019s sentence was therefore procedurally unreasonable, as the determination that Smith\u2019s resentencing was an undeserved benefit was clearly erroneous. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">In addition to being procedurally unreasonable, the district court\u2019s reliance on an impermissible factor in sentencing Smith was substantively unreasonable as well. By imposing an upward variance based on the conclusion that Smith benefit-ted from a \u201cbreak\u201d provided by the FSA, the district court penalized Smith for receiving a lawful sentence authorized by Congress. Given that the district court said that the upward variance was due to this factor, Smith\u2019s sentence was substantially affected by the impermissible factor such that the sentence did not fulfill the purposes of \u00a7 3553. <em>See Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>Finally, the district court\u2019s error was not harmless. Although the district court indicated that a lower sentence would not have served the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a), the record as a whole indicates that the district court relied heavily on its belief that Smith had unjustifiably benefit-ted from the FSA. <em>See Williams, </em>503 U.S. at 203, 112 S.Ct. at 1120-21. Given the nature of the district court\u2019s repeated statements, the record does not leave this Court with the \u201cfair assurance\u201d that the district court would have imposed the same sentence without consideration of the improper factor. <em>See Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292. Therefore, we vacate Smith\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
