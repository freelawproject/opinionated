She and her husband Wendel Sinclair, individually and on behalf of their minor son, (together, \u201cthe Sinclairs\u201d) filed suit against the Allen Parish School Board (\u201cSchool Board\u201d) and several individual defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for the deprivation of a right created by state statute \u2014 here, the right of a teacher to be returned to the \u201csame position\u201d following sabbatical leave \u2014 without due process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case proceeded to trial, after which a jury returned a verdict in favor of the Defendants. The Sinclairs appeal the district court\u2019s entry of judgment based on the court\u2019s jury instruction regarding the sabbatical statute, and the dismissal of Wen-del and the Sinclairs\u2019 son\u2019s claims on summary judgment. For the reasons below, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b420-21\">Charlotte Sinclair (\u201cCharlotte\u201d) was a teacher at Oakdale High School in Allen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Parish, Louisiana. She worked at the school from August 2001 until she took sabbatical leave during the 2007-2008 school year. She taught both science and business courses during this period. Following her sabbatical leave, Oakdale High School principal Nancy Willis assigned Charlotte to teach only science rather than business classes for the 2008-2009 school year. Charlotte soon after took leave for medical reasons, and never returned to work in any capacity for the School Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">On January 21, 2009, the Sinclairs filed suit in federal court against the School Board; Michael Doucet, the parish superintendent; Diane Marcantel, the parish personnel director; and Nancy Willis, the principal at Oakdale High School, alleging various state and federal law claims. Among other claims, the Sinclairs alleged that the defendants violated Charlotte\u2019s procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by reassigning her to a new position in violation of Louisiana\u2019s sabbatical leave statute. In particular, the Sinclairs contended that the statute entitled her to return to the same teaching assignment following her sabbatical and she was deprived of this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Defendants moved for summary judgment on all of the Sinclairs\u2019 claims. The district court denied summary judgment as to Charlotte\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment claim and granted summary judgment on all other claims. Consequently, the court dismissed all loss of consortium claims made by Wendel Sinclair and the Sinclairs\u2019 minor son. The district court conducted a three-day jury trial. During jury instructions, the district court stated to the jury that under Louisiana\u2019s sabbatical leave statute, the term position means \u201cclassroom teacher.\u201d Charlotte Sinclair objected to the instruction, arguing that the term position means a particular subject to which a classroom teacher is assigned. The jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of the Defendants. The Sinclairs filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">The district court had jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. This Court has jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s final judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">On appeal, the Sinclairs argue two points of error: (1) the district court improperly instructed the jury on the meaning of \u201cposition\u201d in \u00a7 17:1182 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes, the sabbatical leave statute; and (2) the district court improperly dismissed the claims for loss of consortium raised by Wendel Sinclair and the Sinclairs\u2019 minor son.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">A. Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">We review a trial court\u2019s jury instruction for abuse of discretion if, as here, the alleged error is preserved below. <em>United States v. Fuchs, </em>467 F.3d 889, 900 (5th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). We will only reverse a judgment based on a jury charge if: (1) \u201cthe charge as a whole creates substantial and ineradicable doubt whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations;\u201d (2) the error is not harmless; and (3) \u201cthe proposed instruction offered to the district court correctly stated the law.\u201d <em>Taita Chem. Co. v. Westlake Styrene, LP, </em>351 F.3d 663, 667 (5th Cir.2003) (footnotes, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted). As we have previously observed, \u201cperfection is not required as long as the instructions were generally correct and any error was harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Bank One, Tex., N.A. v. Taylor, </em>970 F.2d 16, 30 (5th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">The Sinclairs\u2019 dispute turns on a question of state law. Louisiana law provides that \u201c[mjembers of the teaching staff of public schools ... shall be eligible for sab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>batical leaves.\u201d La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 17:1171(A). Section 17:1182 states, \u201cEvery person on sabbatical leave shall be returned at the beginning of the semester immediately following such leave to the same position at the same school from which such leave was taken, unless otherwise agreed to by him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 17:1182. The statute does not define the term \u201cposition.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 17:1170 (definitions). The district court relied on a state appellate court decision interpreting the term \u201cposition\u201d to mean only \u201cthat of teacher rather than teacher of any specific subject.\u201d <em>Scott v. Dennis, </em>392 So.2d 169, 170 (La.Ct. App.1980). The Sinclairs contend that <em>Dennis </em>\u201cmakes no sense.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">As the interpretation of \u00a7 17:1182 is a question of Louisiana law, we look to the final decisions of Louisiana\u2019s highest state court. <em>See Temple v. McCall, </em>720 F.3d 301, 307 (5th Cir.2013) (citation omitted). If there is no such decision, we make an <em>E\u00f1e </em>guess to determine how the Louisiana Supreme Court would resolve the issue if presented with the same case. <em>See id. </em>(quoting <em>Six Flags, Inc. v. Westchester Surplus Lines Ins. Co., </em>565 F.3d 948, 954 (5th Cir.2009)). \u201cIn making an <em>Erie </em>guess, federal courts defer to intermediate state appellate court decisions, unless convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration omitted) (quoting <em>Mem\u2019l Hermann Healthcare Sys. Inc. v. Eurocopter Deutschland, </em>524 F.3d 676, 678 (5th Cir.2008)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We believe that the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Dennis </em>was correct. The case that the Sinclairs raise in support of their argument, <em>Comeaux v. Iberia Parish School Board, </em>597 So.2d 1263 (La.Ct.App.1992), does not address the precise issue in this case and does not provide \u201cpersuasive data\u201d that the Louisiana Supreme Court would disagree with the ruling in <em>Dennis </em>if faced with such a decision. That case addresses the \u201csame school\u201d requirement and merely restates the plain language of the statute: a teacher returning from sabbatical must be returned to the same school, not just the same school system. <em>Comeaux, </em>597 So.2d at 1264. In fact the <em>Comeaux </em>court acknowledges <em>Dennis </em>as precedent, but distinguishes it as addressing a distinct issue \u2014 i.e., the \u201csame position\u201d requirement. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, we find no reason to doubt the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Dennis </em>and its resulting instruction that \u201cposition\u201d means \u201cteacher.\u201d The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">B. Dismissal of Loss of Consortium Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\u201cWe review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Haverda v. Hays Cnty., </em>723 F.3d 586, 591 (5th Cir.2013) (citing <em>Vaughn v. Woodforest Bank, </em>665 F.3d 632, 635 (5th Cir.2011)). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), summary judgment is appropriate only \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A genuine dispute as to a material fact exists when, after considering the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits, a court determines that the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. <em>LeMaire v. La. Dep\u2019t of Transp. &amp; Dev., </em>480 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.2007) (citations omitted). We must consider all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (citation omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ted); <em>Haverda, </em>723 F.3d at 591 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The district court found that \u201cthe evidence submitted ... does not identify any loss beyond ... generalizations.\u201d On appeal, the Sinclairs do not argue that there is any evidence that the district court overlooked, nor do they direct the court\u2019s attention to any additional evidence. Based on our review of the record, we hold that the district court did not err in dismissing Wendel Sinclair and the Sinclairs\u2019 son\u2019s claims for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s final judgment and its grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-22\">. Appellants also raised claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, Title VII, and Louisiana law.
