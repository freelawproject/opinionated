In Albers\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition, he stated that he was indigent and requested the waiver of all fees with the petition, and all other considerations afforded to <em>pro se </em>petitioners. He requested his letter be accepted in lieu of a standard \u00a7 2241 form. After over 30 days had passed since Albers\u2019 filing, the district court dismissed his petition without prejudice on the basis that he failed to pay the filing fee or request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) within 30 days of the filing of his petition, as required by the court\u2019s local rule. Albers filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of his petition, claiming his statement of indigency in his petition should have been accepted in lieu of a formal application to proceed IFP. The district court denied the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-19\">Albers contends the certification he was indigent in his original \u00a7 2241 petition sufficiently constituted a request to proceed IFP. He asserts he was never sent any forms, as required by the local rules. Thus, he contends his petition was erroneously dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-20\">Rule 60(b) allows a party to move a court for relief from a final judgment due to, in relevant part, mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, or any other reason justifying relief. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1), (b)(6). Generally, in reviewing an appeal of an order denying a motion for reconsideration, we may only consider the denial of relief of the motion for reconsideration, not the underlying judgment itself. <em>Rice v. Ford Motor Co., </em>88 F.3d 914, 918-19 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Albers\u2019 motion for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>consideration. <em>See Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003) (stating we review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion). The record shows Albers had neither paid the required filing fee nor filed an application to proceed IFP with the district court within 30 days of filing his petition, in violation of the court\u2019s local rules. M.D. Fla. Local Rule 1.03(e) (stating a prisoner case \u201cwill be subject to dismissal by the Court, sua sponte, if the filing fee is not paid or if the application [to proceed IFP] is not filed within 30 days of the commencement of the action\u201d). Al-bers has not identified any error under Rule 60(b) that justified relief such that the district court was required to vacate its initial order. <em>See Solaroll Shade &amp; Shutter Corp., Inc. v. Bio-Energy Sys., Inc., </em>803 F.2d 1130, 1132 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201cTo demonstrate an abuse of discretion\u201d in denying a Rule 60(b) motion, a movant \u201cmust prove some justification for relief ... [and] cannot prevail simply because the district court properly could have vacated its order).\u201d Although Albers argues the court should have accepted his statement that he was indigent in lieu of a formal application to proceed IFP, he has not shown how the court\u2019s refusal to do so entitled to him relief under Rule 60(b). Similarly, there is no authority that supports his contention that the court was required to send him the requisite application forms when it declined to accept his letter as a substitute for a formal application. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
