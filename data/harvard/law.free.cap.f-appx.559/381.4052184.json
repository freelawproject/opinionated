We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-22\">Holverson first contends that the district court erred in applying a 14-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H) based on its finding of the amount of the intended loss. We review factual determinations for clear error and the application of the Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Setser, </em>568 F.3d 482, 496 (5th Cir.2009). Holverson asserts that the intended loss was zero because he intended to repay the loan, and he pledged 11 properties as collateral. Alternatively, he contends that the district court should have given him credit for the fair market value of the encumbered properties based on an appraisal he submitted or should have used different tax assessments. Holverson also asserts that he should have received credit for repairs made to the properties as of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-23\">Holverson submitted loan applications totaling $974,700 for repairs to rental properties and $25,000 for repairs to his primary residence. His intention to divert funds from the government for unintended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>uses qualifies the loan application amounts as the \u201cintended losses.\u201d <em>United States v. Dowl, </em>619 F.3d 494, 502 (5th Cir.2010). The district court\u2019s determination that Holverson did not show that he intended to repay the loans was amply supported by the evidence of his conduct, including his submission of fraudulent invoices and fraudulent cancelled checks totaling $685,731, in an attempt to get the SBA to disburse the loan proceeds; his exploitation of his former wife, his current wife, his brother, and employees of his company to fabricate receipts and other documents; and his submission of misleading appraisals of the properties pledged as collateral in an effort to reduce his sentencing exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The district court also rejected Holver-son\u2019s claim that he should receive credit for the aggregate amount of the repairs that he made to the properties as of the date of sentencing, totaling $383,672.16. The district court was entitled to rely on the facts in the Presentence Report (PSR), which stated that the SBA investigation found that he had made only $10,330.31 in legitimate repairs. <em>See United States v. Scher, </em>601 F.3d 408, 413 (5th Cir.2010). The district court concluded that the evidence he submitted was \u201cunbelievable\u201d and contained a great number of items that were totally unrelated to the instant case. Holverson has not shown that he presented evidence sufficient to rebut the information in the PSR. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>480 F.3d 309, 320 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Holverson has also failed to show that the district court erred in using tax assessments in determining the fair market value of the properties. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n. 3(E) &amp; (E)(iii)). Moreover, as the district court determined that, even if it accepted the figures offered by Holverson, the loss amount would not have been reduced below $400,000 and, therefore, the 14-level enhancement would still be applicable. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H). In short, we discern no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination of the loss amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Next, Holverson contends that the district court erred in applying a two-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice because the appraisals he submitted were not false or fraudulent, he did not commit perjury or make a false statement, and the district court failed to make a finding of willfulness. We review this determination for clear error. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 208 (5th Cir.2008). The record supports the conclusion that Holverson submitted inflated appraisals to his attorney, the government, and the district court in an effort to reduce his sentencing exposure, and that this constituted obstruction of justice. There was no clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Holverson claims that, because the district court erred in applying the obstruction of justice enhancement, it also erred in denying a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Alternatively, he asserts that the district court erred because he has admitted his guilt and shown remorse. We will not reverse the denial of acceptance of responsibility unless it is without foundation, a standard more deferential than the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.2003). The district court did not err in imposing the obstruction of justice enhancement as discussed above. Further, Holverson has not shown that his case is one of the extraordinary ones in which both \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 and 3E1.1 may apply. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>120 F.3d 564, 574-75 (5th Cir.1997). In short, the district court\u2019s determination was not without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">In addition, Holverson claims that the district court erred in not considering his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>requests for a downward departure. The district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward is not reviewable unless the court mistakenly believed that it lacked the authority to do so. <em>United States v. Lucas, </em>516 F.3d 316, 350 (5th Cir.2008). This bar applies even when a district court summarily denies a departure without explanation or implicitly denies a departure by imposing a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.2006). The district court heard Holverson\u2019s arguments, cited the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and determined that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range was appropriate. Nothing in the record suggests, and Holverson does not claim, that the district court misunderstood its authority to depart downward. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of a downward departure. <em>See Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d at 424 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Finally, Holverson insists that the sentence was substantively unreasonable because it did not account for all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including his strong community support, his good behavior during detention, his age, his lack of a prior conviction, and his history of community and charitable work. The district court considered Holverson\u2019s contentions before imposing a within-guidelines sentence of 108 months of imprisonment. Given the deference owed to the district court\u2019s sentencing determination, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), Holverson\u2019s assertion that his sentence is unreasonable is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the within guidelines sentence is reasonable, <em>see United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
