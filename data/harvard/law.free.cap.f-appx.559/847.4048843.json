We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">In his complaint, Mr. Moore alleged that the Library violated his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments when it wrongfully accused him of sexually harassing its employees and banning him from its premises. <em>See </em>D.E. 1. Mr. Moore also asserted claims against the Library for defamation, slander, wrongfully withholding evidence, and unlawful arrest. <em>Id. </em>The district court granted the Library\u2019s motion to dismiss, finding that Mr. Moore\u2019s claims were barred under the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>(i.e., claim preclusion). D.E. 16 at 2. Specifically, the court found that Mr. Moore\u2019s claims in this case were the same, or arose from the same nucleus of operative facts, as those raised by Mr. Moore in a previous complaint filed with the district court in 2012, which had been dismissed with prejudice. <em>See Moore v. Birmingham Public Library, </em>2013 WL 1498974 (N.D.Ala.2013) <em>(Moore I) </em>(dismissing with prejudice Mr. Moore\u2019s claims for alleged violations by the Birmingham Public Library of his freedom of speech and due process rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling that <em>res judicata </em>bars an action. <em>Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1999). Prior litigation will bar a subsequent action under the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>when four requirements are met: \u201c(1) the prior decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) there was a final judgment on the merits; (3) the parties were identical in both suits; and (4) the prior and present causes of action are the same.\u201d <em>Davila v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>326 F.3d 1183, 1187 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Jang v. United Techs. Corp., </em>206 F.3d 1147, 1149 (11th Cir.2000)). This bar applies to claims that were raised in the prior action as well as those claims that could have been, but were not, raised. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>From the record, it is clear that the first three elements of <em>res judicata </em>are present here. First, the district court in <em>Moore I </em>properly exercised jurisdiction in that case, liberally construing Mr. Moore\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint as asserting a civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violations of constitutional rights. Second, the district court dismissed Mr. Moore\u2019s complaint in <em>Moore I </em>with prejudice, thereby rendering a final adjudication on the merits. <em>See Citibank, N.A. v. Data Lease Fin. Corp., </em>904 F.2d 1498, 1501-02 (11th Cir.1990) (a dismissal with prejudice \u201cnormally constitutes a final judgment on the merits which bars a later suit on the same cause of action\u201d). Third, the parties in <em>Moore </em>I\u2014 namely, Mr. Moore and the Birmingham Public Library \u2014 are the same parties in this case. <em>See Moore, </em>2013 WL 1498974, at *1; D.E. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The fourth element, requiring that the prior and present causes of action be the same, has also been met. \u201cIn determining whether the causes of action are the same, a court must compare the substance of the actions, not their form.\u201d <em>Ragsdale, </em>193 F.3d at 1239 (citations omitted). Specifically, we must decide whether the prior and present causes of action \u201carise[ ] out of the same nucleus of operative fact, or [are] based upon the same factual predicate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">In addition to First and Fourteenth Amendment claims, the current complaint by Mr. Moore asserted claims for defamation, slander, wrongfully withholding evidence, and unlawful arrest that were not raised in <em>Moore I. </em>Mr. Moore\u2019s claims in both cases, however, arise from a series of incidents between Mr. Moore and Library employees which resulted in a 2011 sexual harassment complaint filed against Mr. Moore by Library employees, as well as his subsequent expulsion from the Library in 2012. Both actions, therefore, are based upon the same factual predicate, and Mr. Moore\u2019s present claims were or could have been asserted in <em>Moore I. </em>As all four elements of <em>res judicata </em>are satisfied, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting the Library\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-11\">.
