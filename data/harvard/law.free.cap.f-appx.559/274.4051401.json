He alleges two points of error in connection with the district court\u2019s jury charge. First, he contends that the court erroneously instructed the jury that the Government had to prove that he knowingly exported ammunition in violation of the law but need not prove that he knew the specific law violated. Reyes urges that a violation of \u00a7 554(a) is a specific intent crime and that the court thus should have instructed the jury that, in order to find him guilty, it must find that he violated the Arms Export Control Act or Customs Regulations with the specific intent to violate the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">This court reviews a jury instruction for abuse of discretion, affording substantial latitude to the district court in describing the law to the jury. <em>United States v. Santos, </em>589 F.3d 759, 764 (5th Cir.2009). A district court generally does not err by giving a charge that tracks this circuit\u2019s pattern jury instructions and that is a proper statement of the law. <em>See United States v. Whitfield, </em>590 F.3d 325, 354 (5th Cir.2009). As Reyes concedes, the instruction given in his case closely mirrors this court\u2019s pattern jury instructions. <em>See </em>5th Cir. Pattern Crim. Jury Instr. 2.31. Further, the district court\u2019s instructions were a correct statement of the law. <em>See United States v. Bernardino, </em>444 Fed.Appx. 73 (5th Cir.2011) (stating that, to establish an offense under \u00a7 554(a), the Government is required to prove only that the defendant knew he was dealing with ammunition that was intended for export and that the exportation was illegal); <em>see also </em>5th Cir. R. 47.5.4; <em>Ballard v. Burton, </em>444 F.3d 391, 401 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (5th Cir.2006). Consequently, Reyes has failed to demonstrate any error on the district court\u2019s part. <em>See Whitfield, </em>590 F.3d at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">By his second point of error, Reyes challenges the district court\u2019s inclusion of a deliberate-indifference instruction in its charge. He contends that the instruction was unwarranted on the facts of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">Any error in giving a deliberate indifference instruction is subject to harmless-error review. <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>493 F.3d 613, 619 (5th Cir.2007). The error is harmless where substantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s actual knowledge is presented. <em>United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 341 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">This court need not decide whether the deliberate-indifference instruction was appropriate in this case because any error in giving the instruction was harmless. The Government presented substantial evidence of Reyes\u2019s actual knowledge, including his codefendant\u2019s testimony establishing that he hired Reyes to illegally smuggle ammunition from the United States to Mexico for the Zeta Cartel, that Reyes had done so before and offered to do it again, and that Reyes knew that he had placed groceries in the trunk in an attempt to hide the speaker box where the ammunition was hidden; the Government also presented evidence of Reyes\u2019s own admission to agents both that he knew he was carrying something illegal and his ultimate admission that he knew he was carrying ammunition in the car he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>was driving. <em>See MeElwee, </em>646 F.3d at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Reyes\u2019s arguments are without merit. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
