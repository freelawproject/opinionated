No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-25\">This case arose from the alleged illegal downloading and distributing of a copyrighted video produced by First Time Videos, LLC (\u201cFTV\u201d). FTV filed a complaint for copyright infringement in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida against various \u201cJohn Does,\u201d identified only by their IP addresses. FTV then sent Oppold a letter notifying him of the lawsuit and telling him that he had been identified as being associated with one of the IP addresses named in the suit. Shortly thereafter, FTV dismissed voluntarily (and without prejudice) the complaint against Oppold\u2019s IP address. The dismissal was pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-26\">FTV then filed a complaint against Op-pold for copyright infringement in the Middle District of Florida. Before Oppold filed an answer or a motion for summary judgment, FTV filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice, pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1). The district court dismissed the case without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-27\">Oppold moved for attorney\u2019s fees as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied the motion, concluding that Oppold was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the meaning of section 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>On appeal, Oppold first argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to deny his motion for attorney\u2019s fees after the district court dismissed FTV\u2019s complaint. This argument is without merit. The Supreme Court has made clear that a federal court retains jurisdiction over collateral issues \u2014 including motions for attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 after a complaint is dismissed. <em>See Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 2455-56, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Next, Oppold argues that he is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In determining whether Oppold constitutes a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d we must determine whether a \u201ccourt-ordered ... material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties\u201d has occurred. <em>See Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Res., </em>532 U.S. 598, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 1840, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001). In other words, there must be something along this line: \u201c(1) a situation where a party has been awarded by the court at least some relief on the merits of his claim <em>or </em>(2) a judicial <em>imprimatur </em>on the change in the legal relationship between the parties.\u201d <em>Smalbein v. City of Daytona Beach, et al., </em>353 F.3d 901, 905 (11th Cir.2003) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Nothing evidences a court-ordered change in the legal relationship between Oppold and FTV. FTV dismissed voluntarily its complaint against Oppold under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(l)(i). Such a dismissal is permitted explicitly \u201cwithout a court order.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1) (\u201cthe plaintiff may dismiss an action <em>without a court order </em>by filing ... a notice of dismissal before the opposing party serves either an answer or a motion for summary judgment. ...\u201d); <em>see also Matthews v. Gaither, </em>902 F.2d 877, 880 (11th Cir.1990) (noting that a dismissal under Rule 41(a)(l)(i) \u201cis effective immediately upon the filing of a written notice of dismissal, and no subsequent court order is required.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">To the extent that FTV\u2019s notice of dismissal in this case \u201coperate[d] as an adjudication on the merits,\u201d pursuant to Rule 41(a)(l)(B)\u2019s \u201ctwo-dismissal rule,\u201d the dismissal itself was still automatic and not the result of court action. Cf. Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1)(B) (describing the effect of a voluntary dismissal <em>without a court order). </em>Because Oppold has failed to demonstrate \u201cprevailing party\u201d status, he is ineligible for attorney\u2019s fees under section 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b955-18\">. Oppold also sought attorney's fees under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 and 54(d), 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 412, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, and pursuant to the district court's inherent power. Because Oppold does not raise these issues on appeal, they are abandoned. <em>See N. Am. Med. Corp. v. Axiom </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number><em>Worldwide, Inc., </em>522 F.3d 1211, 1217 n. 4 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b956-7\">. Section 505 provides that \"the court in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party other than the United States ...\u201d and that \"the court may also award a reasonable attorney's fee to the <em>prevailing party </em>as part of the costs.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
