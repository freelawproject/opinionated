After review of the record and upon consideration of Llovera-Linares\u2019s brief, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b974-20\">On May 21, 2007, Llovera-Linares pled <em>nolo contendere </em>in Florida state court to charges of aggravated fleeing and eluding a law enforcement officer and felony driving under the influence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 21, 2007, the state court sentenced Llovera-Linares to a total of five years\u2019 imprisonment with no term of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-21\">On August 2, 2010, Llovera-Linares was released from state custody. Since his release from Florida state custody, Llov-era-Linares has been in federal immigration detention pending his removal from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-22\">In December 2011, Llovera-Linares filed an emergency petition for a writ of coram nobis to vacate his Florida state sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651. In January 2012, Llovera-Linares amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>ed his petition and requested that the district court \u201cVacate a Florida State sentence- entered on the date of June 21, 2007.\u201d In his petition, Llovera-Linares raises various challenges to his 2007 state court convictions and sentence, including a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on his state trial counsel\u2019s failure to warn him of the potential immigration consequences of pleading no contest in state court. In May 2013, Llovera-Linares requested that his petition for a writ of coram nobis be reviewed alternatively as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 2241, 2244, and 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">The district court dismissed Llovera-Linares\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus because Llovera-Linares was not in state custody and did not allege that he was denied the right to counsel. The district court also dismissed Llovera-Li-nares\u2019s petition for a writ of coram nobis because that writ cannot be used in federal court to attack a state criminal judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Llovera-Linares appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">We construe <em>pro se </em>briefs liberally. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). So construed, Llovera-Linares argues that the district court erred in dismissing (1) his habeas corpus petition filed under \u00a7\u00a7 2241, 2244, and 2254 and (2) his coram nobis petition filed under \u00a7 1651. We consider each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">A. Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">The availability of federal habeas relief presents a question of law we review <em>de novo. Ward v. Hall, </em>592 F.3d 1144, 1155 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">A district court may entertain a habeas corpus petition only if a petitioner is \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(c)(3), 2254(a). This \u201cin custody\u201d requirement is jurisdictional. <em>Stacey v. Warden, Apalachee Corr. Inst., </em>854 F.2d 401, 403 (11th Cir.1988). To satisfy the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement, \u201cthe habeas petitioner [must] be \u2018in custody\u2019 under the conviction or sentence under attack at the time his petition is filed.\u201d <em>Maleng v. Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 490-91, 109 S.Ct. 1923, 1925, 104 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">Llovera-Linares asks this Court to \u201c[v]acate the Florida State sentence entered on ... June 21, 2007\u201d in Broward County, Florida. As of August 2010, Llov-\u2019 era-Linares was no longer in state custody or subject to state probation or parole. And, Llovera-Linares did not file his federal habeas petition until May 2013, which was well after his state custody unconditionally expired. Because Llovera-Linares was not \u201cin custody\u201d pursuant to his 2007 Florida convictions when he filed his federal habeas petition, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider, and thus properly dismissed, Llovera-Linares\u2019s federal habeas petitions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Stacey, </em>854 F.2d at 403 (noting that \u00a7 2241\u2019s \u201cin custody\u201d requirement is jurisdictional); <em>Maleng, </em>490 U.S. at 490-91, 109 S.Ct. at 1925 (stating that \u201cthe habeas petitioner [must] be \u2018in custody\u2019 under the conviction or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>sentence under attack <em>at the time his petition is filed </em>\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Llovera-Linares contends that he is \u201cin custody\u201d because he is in federal immigration detention pending his removal from the United States. However, Llovera-Li-nares immigration detention is not a direct consequence of his 2007 Florida state court convictions. Rather, Llovera-Linares\u2019s present immigration detention is a collateral consequence of his state court convictions. <em>See United States v. Campbell, </em>778 F.2d 764, 767-68 (11th Cir.1985) (stating that \u201cdeportation is a collateral consequence of a guilty plea\u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010). Because \u201cthe <em>collateral consequences </em>of [a] conviction are not themselves sufficient to render an individual \u2018in custody\u2019 for the purposes of a habeas\u201d petition, Llovera-Linares\u2019s present immigration detention does not satisfy the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement for federal habeas petitions. <em>See Maleng v. Cook, </em>490 U.S. 488, 492, 109 S.Ct. 1923, 1926, 104 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">B. Petition for a Writ of Coram Nobis</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">We review a denial of coram nobis relief for abuse of discretion. <em>Alikhani v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 732, 734 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Llovera-Linares seeks a writ of co-ram nobis vacating his 2007 state court convictions. Our law is clear, however, that a writ of \u201ccoram nobis is not available in federal court as a means of attack on a state criminal judgment.\u201d <em>Theriault v. Mississippi, </em>390 F.2d 657, 657 (5th Cir.1968); <em>see also Cavett v. Ellis, </em>578 F.2d 567, 569 n. 4 (5th Cir.1978) (noting that the writ of coram nobis is \u201cunavailable to review state court decisions\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the district court was correct, and did not abuse its discretion, in dismissing Llovera-Linares\u2019s petition for a writ of coram no-bis.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing Llovera-Linares\u2019s petitions for writs of ha-beas corpus and coram nobis is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-13\">. Llovera-Linares also pled <em>nolo contendere </em>to one count of reckless driving. However, that charge was ultimately dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b975-11\">. Even if we liberally construe Llovera-Li-nares\u2019s December 2011 coram nobis petition as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,-Llovera-Linares was not \"in custody\u201d pursuant to his 2007 Florida convictions at any time after August 2010, which is well before December 2011. Thus, even viewing Llov-era-Linares\u2019s December 2011 <em>pro se </em>petition liberally, this Court still would lack subject matter jurisdiction over Llovera-Linares\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b976-8\">.
