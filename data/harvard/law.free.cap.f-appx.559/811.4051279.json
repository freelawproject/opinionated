After careful review of the record and the briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b836-16\">A. Flagship\u2019s First Amended Complaint <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-17\">Plaintiff Flagship\u2019s amended complaint arose out of the City\u2019s denial of Flagship\u2019s application for approval of the \u201cSecond Amendment to Heron\u2019s Glen Planned Development Agreement, which was memorialized in Ordinance 2011-09-500\u201d (\u201cthe Ordinance\u201d). This Ordinance would have re-zoned a 245-acre property owned by Flagship, thereby allowing Flagship to construct waste disposal and waste management facilities, methane gas recovery facilities, recycling facilities, and wetlands habitat preservation areas on the property. Flagship alleged that the manner in which the City Council denied the application was arbitrary and capricious and violated both procedural and substantive due process guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-18\">More specifically, Plaintiff Flagship claimed that the hearing on the requested Ordinance \u201cwas an extremely emotional, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>heated, and unwieldy affair. While Flagship presented expert testimony and volumes of documentary evidence in support of the Ordinance, the opponents responded only with \u201ca plethora of emotional, argumentative, hyperbolic, and unsubstantiated arguments and opinions,\u201d including \u201cirrelevant stories about feared, potential odors, animals, environmental degradation, and the like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">Plaintiff Flagship further explained that \u201cconfusion reigned\u201d during the hearing; for example, council members at times \u201ccould not even figure out what they were voting on.\u201d Amidst all this confusion, City Council members demonstrated clear bias when they already stated their opposition to the Ordinance before ever hearing any evidence. Other council members admitted to having conducted their own research before the hearing, which Flagship contended was tantamount to relying on ex parte communications. One council member relied on an actual ex parte communication with an unidentified person about a landfill located in a different community. And, several other council members could not explain the reasons behind their votes against the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">What is more, the City Council members then discussed the Ordinance at the next Mascotte City Council meeting \u2014 without providing notice to Flagship that the Ordinance would be discussed at this meeting. Flagship also took issue with the purpose of this post-hearing discussion: in an \u201cill-conceived attempt to cleanse the basis for their denial of the [Ordinance],\u201d the City Council members and the City attorney \u201cattempted to match the reasons of the Council Members in regard to their vote with some of the testimony ... given at the [prior] hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Thereafter, the City Council issued an order containing its findings of fact and conclusions of law underlying its denial of the Ordinance. The principal reasons for the City Council\u2019s denial were: (1) unpleasant odors, (2) attraction of rodents, (3) traffic increase due to garbage trucks, and (4) a \u201cpurported requirement of two distinct access point/entrance ways.\u201d Flagship contended that these findings were \u201cnot supported by substantial, competent evidence\u201d; in fact, some of the cited reasons were actually undermined by the evidence presented at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Based on these allegations, Plaintiff Flagship asserted that the City violated Flagship\u2019s procedural and substantive due process rights. In response, the City moved to dismiss these claims under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">B. The District Court\u2019s Order</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">The district court dismissed Flagship\u2019s procedural due process claim. The court pointed out that Flagship had not alleged that it had availed itself of the remedies available under Florida law, namely the Florida Administrative Procedures Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 120.68, which \u201cprovides for judicial review of agency actions, including a local government\u2019s zoning decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">The district court explained that these state remedies were available and adequate \u201cto cure any procedural due process defects\u201d that may have occurred during the City\u2019s denial of Flagship\u2019s application for the Ordinance. Given that Flagship failed to pursue these available and adequate state remedies, the district court concluded that Flagship\u2019s procedural due process failed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">The district court dismissed Flagship\u2019s substantive due process claim for two reasons: First, the district court reasoned that the \u201cDue Process Clause ... only provides substantive due process protection against deprivations of fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>rights ... created by the Constitution,\u201d and state-created property rights are \u201cnot subject to substantive due process protection.\u201d Instead, \u201ca substantive due process claim predicated on an arbitrary and irrational deprivation of a property interest should be treated as a procedural due process claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Second, the district court concluded that \u201cthe City\u2019s alleged actions in this case were specifically directed at Flagship\u201d and thus \u201cwere executive in nature.\u201d The district court explained that \u201cexecutive deprivations of state-created rights ... cannot support a substantive due process claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Flagship timely appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the procedural and substantive due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">This Court reviews \u201cthe grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim <em>de novo, </em>accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Belanger v. Salvation Army, </em>556 F.3d 1153, 1155 (11th Cir.2009). This Court also \u201creviews questions of constitutional law <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Duboc, </em>694 F.3d 1223, 1228 n. 5 (11th Cir.2012), cert. denied, - U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1278, 185 L.Ed.2d 214 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">A. Flagship\u2019s Procedural Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">As the district court observed, Flagship has not alleged that adequate state remedies were unavailable to remedy any alleged deprivations of procedural due process. Flagship could have availed itself of the remedies provided in the Florida Administrative Procedure Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 120.68, but did not. This is fatal to Flagship\u2019s procedural due process claim, as this Court has held that \u201c \u2018only when the state refuses to provide a process sufficient to remedy the procedural deprivation does a constitutional violation actionable under section 1983 arise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cotton v. Jackson, </em>216 F.3d 1328, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1557 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\">In <em>Cotton, </em>the plaintiff was terminated after his employer, a state university, found that the plaintiff had violated the university\u2019s sexual harassment policies. 216 F.3d at 1329. The plaintiff asked the university and the Board of Regents to hold a hearing regarding his termination, but both entities denied this request. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30. The plaintiff sued the university president and members of the Board of Regents in federal court under \u00a7 1983, alleging that the defendants\u2019 refusal to afford him a hearing was a violation of procedural due process. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-16\">This Court held that the plaintiffs procedural due process claim failed as a matter of law because the plaintiff could have pursued a writ of mandamus in state court. <em>Id. </em>at 1332-33. We explained that \u201c[i]t is the state\u2019s failure to provide adequate procedures to remedy the otherwise procedurally flawed deprivation of a protected interest that gives rise to a federal procedural due process claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1331. This rule \u201crecognizes that the state must have the opportunity to remedy the procedural failings of its subdivisions and agencies in the appropriate fora \u2014 agencies, review boards, and state courts before being subjected to a claim alleging a procedural due process violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, \u201c[i]f adequate state remedies were available but the plaintiff failed to take advantage of them, the plaintiff cannot rely on that failure to claim that the state deprived him of procedural due process.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number><em>Id. </em>We therefore concluded in <em>Cotton </em>that \u201cbecause adequate state remedies were available to provide Plaintiff with the opportunity for a ... hearing, he has failed to state a procedural due process claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">Again and again, this Court has repeated the basic rule that a procedural due process claim can exist only if no adequate state remedies are available. <em>See Reams v. Irvin, </em>561 F.3d 1258, 1266-67 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cBecause we conclude that available state remedies were adequate to cure any erroneous deprivation of [the plaintiffs] protected interest in her equines, [the plaintiff] has failed to establish that her procedural due process rights were violated\u201d); <em>Foxy Lady, Inc. v. City of Atlanta, </em>347 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c[Ejven if a procedural deprivation exists ..., such a claim will not be cognizable under \u00a7 1983 if the state provides a means by which to remedy the alleged deprivation\u201d); <em>Horton v. Bd. of Cnty. Commm\u2019rs of Flagler Cnty., </em>202 F.3d 1297, 1300 (11th Cir.2000) (no federal procedural due process violation if state courts \u201cgenerally would provide an adequate remedy for the procedural deprivation the federal court plaintiff claims to have suffered\u201d); <em>Bell v. City of Demopolis, </em>86 F.3d 191, 192 (11th Cir.1996) (affirming district court\u2019s dismissal of procedural due process in employment discrimination context because \u201cAlabama has available a satisfactory means by which [the plaintiff] can seek redress for any procedural due process deprivation\u201d); <em>Narey v. Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1528 (11th Cir.1994) (concluding that because the plaintiff \u201cdid not take advantage of the opportunity for state court review, [the plaintiff] cannot now claim that the state deprived him of procedural due process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Flagship\u2019s complaint failed to allege that adequate state remedies were unavailable to cure the procedural deprivations allegedly committed by the City. Nor did the complaint allege that Flagship attempted to avail itself of the remedies provided in the Florida Administrative Procedure Act. Our binding precedent therefore bars Flagship\u2019s procedural due process claim as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Flagship, instead, relies on cases holding \u201cthat there is no requirement that a plaintiff exhaust his administrative remedies before filing suit under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Beaulieu v. City of Alabaster, </em>454 F.3d 1219, 1226-27 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Patsy v. Board of Regents, </em>457 U.S. 496, 516, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 2568, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982)). That concept is true; but it is also inapposite here. As this Court explained in <em>Cotton, </em>the rule that a section 1983 claim is not stated unless inadequate state procedures exist to remedy an alleged procedural deprivation \u201cis not an exhaustion requirement.\u201d 216 F.3d at 1331 &amp; n. 2. Instead, it is \u201ca recognition that procedural due process violations do not even exist unless no adequate state remedies are available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1331 n. 2. In other words, the unavailability of adequate remedies is an element of a procedural due process claim \u2014 as opposed to an exhaustion requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">B. Substantive Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">Flagship\u2019s substantive due process claim is also barred by this Court\u2019s precedent. \u201cThe substantive \u25a0 component of the Due Process Clause protects those rights that are \u2018fundamental\u2019 that is, rights that are \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1556 (quoting <em>Palko v. Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325, 58 S.Ct. 149, 152, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937)). However, \u201careas in which substantive rights are created only by state law ... are not subject to substantive due process protection under the Due Process Clause because \u2018substantive due process rights are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>created only by the Constitution.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, </em>474 U.S. 214, 229, 106 S.Ct. 507, 515, 88 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985) (Powell, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">\u201cThe list of state-created rights ... include^] land-use rights like the zoning restrictions at issue here,\u201d <em>Lewis v. Brown, </em>409 F.3d 1271, 1273 (11th Cir.2005), because these rights \u201care created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law,\u201d <em>Greenbriar Village, L.L.C. v. Mountain Brook, City, </em>345 F.3d 1258, 1262 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Flagship predicates its claim on the denial of its state-granted- and-defined land-use rights, \u201cno substantive due process claim is viable.\u201d <em>Id.; Lewis, </em>409 F.3d at 1272-74 (holding that a claim based on the denial of a request for re-zoning is not viable as a substantive due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The rights Flagship advances here are indistinguishable from those asserted by the plaintiffs in <em>Lewis. </em>There, the plaintiffs also alleged a substantive due process violation after a local government entity denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request to re-zone their property. <em>Lewis, </em>409 F.3d at 1272. The plaintiffs contended that this denial was arbitrary and capricious. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">This Court explained in <em>Lewis </em>that such a land-use claim falls under the general rule that \u201careas in which substantive rights are created only by state law are not subject to substantive due process protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1272-73 (internal quotation marks omitted). An exception to the general rule applies when \u201can individual\u2019s state-created rights are infringed by legislative act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1273. In that scenario, \u201cthe substantive component of the Due Process Clause generally protects [the individual] from arbitrary and irrational action by the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By contrast, \u201c[n]on-legislative, or executive, deprivations of state-created rights, which would include land-use rights, cannot support a substantive due process claim, not even if the plaintiff alleges that the government acted arbitrarily and irrationally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">The question in <em>Lewis </em>was therefore whether the government decision \u201cwas a legislative act or an executive act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court squarely held that the local government\u2019s denial of a request to rezone the plaintiffs\u2019 property was \u201ca textbook \u2018executive act\u2019 \u201d because this decision affected only a limited number of people, namely the plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>As a result, the denial of the request for re-zoning was an executive act that could not form the basis of a substantive due process claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">So too here. Flagship has not distinguished itself from the plaintiffs in <em>Lewis. </em>Flagship asserts a state-created property right; more specifically, it claims that the City\u2019s arbitrary and capricious denial of the request to re-zone Flagship\u2019s property impinges on the company\u2019s land-use rights. The City\u2019s decision was a \u201ctextbook executive act\u201d because it affected only Flagship. Thus, Flagship\u2019s claim is subject to this Court\u2019s general rule that no substantive due process claim exists for executive acts affecting state-created land-use rights. <em>See id.; Greenbriar Village, L.L.C., </em>345 F.3d at 1262.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Flagship\u2019s procedural and substantive due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-12\">. We present the facts as alleged in Plaintiff Flagship\u2019s first amended complaint. At this point in the litigation, we must assume the facts set forth in the complaint as true. <em>Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., </em>547 U.S. 451, 453, 126 S.Ct. 1991, 1994, 164 L.Ed.2d 720 (2006) (stating that on a motion to dismiss, the court must \"accept as true the factual allegations in the amended complaint\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b836-19\">. Flagship also asserted a federal equal protection claim, which the district court dismissed. Flagship has not appealed from that ruling. Given the dismissal of Flagship's federal claims, the district court did not address the merits of Flagship\u2019s state law claims but remanded them to state court. Flagship has not appealed this aspect of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\">. We reject Flagship\u2019s argument that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A, Inc., </em>544 U.S. 528, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876 (2005) provides a basis for Flagship\u2019s claim. <em>Lingle </em>addressed a Fifth Amendment takings claim arising from a rent-control statute, <em>see id. </em>at 532-34, 125 S.Ct. at 2078-79, not a substantive due process claim arising out of a zoning decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
