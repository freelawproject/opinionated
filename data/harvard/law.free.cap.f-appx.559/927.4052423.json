On appeal, Hodges argues that, although his sentence is one month below the low end of his guideline range, he should have received no further imprisonment and had his supervised release reinstated to provide him a better opportunity at rehabilitation through drug treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-17\">We generally review the revocation of supervised release for an abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008), and a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). When reviewing for reasonableness, we in turn apply the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Revocation of supervised release is mandatory if the defendant unlawfully possesses a controlled substance. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g). Where revocation is mandatory, the district court is not required to consider the Section 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1241 (11th Cir.2000). Rather, the only limitation on the sentence is that the term of imprisonment must not exceed the maximum term of imprisonment authorized under \u00a7 3583(e)(3). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g). The court may require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on post-release supervision. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-19\">When review for substantive reasonableness is appropriate, we examine the totality of the circumstances and ask \u201cwhether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). In order to vacate a sentence, we must have the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc). Ordinarily, we expect, but do not presume, a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the factors in \u00a7 8558(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Revocation of Hodges\u2019s supervised release was mandatory given that Hodges admittedly used and therefore unlawfully possessed cocaine. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g). Hodges has failed to establish that his below-guidelines sentence was unreasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Hodges\u2019s multiple and repeated violations of his supervised release suggest that (1) supervised release would not help end Hodges\u2019s illegal drug use, and (2) Hodges\u2019s six-month sentence was a reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-15\">. On appeal, the government raises the issue and concedes that the district court plainly erred by imposing a prison term and supervised-release term that together exceeded the three-year maximum supervised-release term for Hodges's felon-in-possession conviction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(2), (h). However, shortly after Hodges\u2019s new term of supervised release began, Hodges's post-revocation supervised release was revoked, and he was sentenced to a 12-month term of incarceration without any further term of supervised release. Therefore, this issue is rendered moot and there is no miscarriage of justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
