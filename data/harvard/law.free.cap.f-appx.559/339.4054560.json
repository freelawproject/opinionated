He contends that the immigration judge erred in denying his motion to reopen because he did not receive notice of his removal hearing and that the immigration judge should have considered the factors set forth in <em>Matter of M-R-A-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 665 (BIA 2008), to determine whether reopening his case was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-22\">\u201cIn reviewing the denial of a motion to reopen, this court applies a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, regardless of the basis of the alien\u2019s request for relief.\u201d <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir.2009). We will \u201caffirm the BIA\u2019s decision as long as it is not capricious, without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-23\">To comply with the statutory requirements, a notice to appear must inform the alien of his obligation to provide a current address and phone number, his obligation to provide any change of address, the consequences for failing to provide an address and phone number, the time and date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the hearing, and the consequences for failing to appear. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(l)(F)(G). It need not include the specific time and date of a removal hearing, however, if that information is provided in a subsequent notice of hearing. <em>Gomez-Palacios, </em>560 F.3d at 359. An alien is not entitled to notice if he fails to provide the address information required under \u00a7 1229(a)(1)(F) and may be removed in absentia if he fails to appear. \u00a7 1229(a)(2)(B); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A) &amp;(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">In June 2005 the Petitioner was personally served with a notice to appear that in all things complied with the statutory requirements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(l)(F)-(G), save the specific time and date of his removal hearing. It is undisputed that Petitioner failed to provide the address information required under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1)(F). No further notice was required to remove Gonzalez-Lopez in ab-sentia. Gonzalez-Lopez\u2019s reliance upon <em>Matter of M-R-A- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 668, is thus misplaced, as it concerns the presumption that a notice is received at the address to which it is mailed, facts not at issue here. No abuse of discretion has been shown in the denial of the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Gonzalez-Lopez\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
