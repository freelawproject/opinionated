BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">A. The Patels\u2019 2006 Illegal Entries and Notices to Appear</p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">The record evidence shows that Mr. Patel\u2019s brother paid a smuggler, Ali, to arrange for the Patels to leave India, fly to Cuba, and enter the United States by boat. Mr. Patel does not know if Ali is the smuggler\u2019s first or last name.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">Ali provided the Patels with passports and Cuban visas, which Mr. Patel believed that Ali could obtain only if Ali had a connection to the Indian government. Mr. Patel, however, did not know whether Ali actually had a government connection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, Mr. Patel did not \u201cknow much\u201d about Ali\u2019s background or occupation, aside from the fact that he was a smuggler and a \u201cpowerful person.\u201d Before the Pa-tels left India, Ali warned Mr. Patel not to speak about the smuggling operation or Mr. Patel would face \u201charsh consequences\u201d if he returned to India.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\">In May 2006, the Patels left India and arrived in Cuba. At the Cuban airport, an unknown person of Indian nationality picked up the Patels and transported them to a hotel in Cuba. This person instructed the Patels not to \u201cname names\u201d or the Patels or their families would be hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>On June 9, 2006, while still in Cuba, the Patels, along with four other Indian nationals, boarded a boat driven by Steven Kivett, whom Ali had hired. The U.S. Coast Guard stopped the boat before it reached the United States and took the Patels to a U.S. detention facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">On July 25, 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice issued Notices to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) charging the Patels as removable, pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, for being present in the United States without being admitted or paroled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At a March 2007 hearing, the Patels conceded removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">B.Mr. Patel\u2019s October 2006 Testimony Against the Smuggling Operation</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">In the meantime, Mr. Patel testified against Kivett during Kivett\u2019s October 2006 criminal trial involving the smuggling of the Patels into the United States. Ki-vett was convicted of a smuggling offense and sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Following his conviction, Kivett became concerned about the Patels\u2019 safety and, thus, alerted his attorney that he believed the Patels would be killed if they returned to India. According to Kivett, the Indian smugglers had informed Kivett that they had told the Patels that, if they testified about the smuggling operation, they would be killed upon their return to India. Ki-vett later filed an affidavit in which he attested that he had heard \u201crumors\u201d that Ali \u201cwas in a high position in the [Indian] government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">C. Mr. Patel s March 2007 Application for Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and CAT Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">In March 2007, Mr. Patel filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. Mr. Patel expressed his fear that, if he returned to India, Ali would harm him because Mr. Patel testified against Kivett and mentioned Ali during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">In September 2009, the IJ held a merits hearing regarding Mr. Patel\u2019s application, at which the Patels testified. Mr. Patel testified that Ali telephoned him ten days prior to the hearing and warned Mr. Patel not to speak to anyone about \u201canything\u201d or Mr. Patel would be killed if he returned to India. Mr. Patel further testified that, despite Ali\u2019s threats against him, Mr. Patel\u2019s brother and other family members who remained in India were unharmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">D. IJ\u2019s June 4, 2012 Decision<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">On June 4, 2012, the IJ found that the Patels were credible and that Mr. Patel was threatened by individuals connected to the smuggling operation. The IJ determined, however, that Mr. Patel did not show past persecution or that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution <em>on account </em>o/his political opinion or membership in a particular social group if removed to India. The IJ explained that: (1) the threats to Mr. Patel were made \u201cso that this ongoing smuggling ring would not be interrupted\u201d; (2) the threats involved a \u201cpersonal dispute\u201d and were not based on Mr. Patel\u2019s political opinion or membership in a particular social group; and (3) \u201cfear of retribution over personal matters is not a basis for asylum.\u201d Thus, the IJ deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>mined that Mr. Patel was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">The IJ also determined that, although the Patels assumed that Ali was associated with the Indian government, no evidence showed that the Indian government was involved in the smuggling operation. The IJ found that Mr. Patel had not shown that he was entitled to CAT relief because he had not shown that he would be tortured by, or with the acquiescence of, a public official if removed to India.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">E. The Patels\u2019 June 2012 BIA Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">In June 2012, the Patels filed a notice of appeal, which asserted that the IJ erred in finding Mr. Patel ineligible for (1) asylum and withholding of removal because the evidence showed that he objectively feared political persecution if removed to India; and (2) CAT relief because the evidence showed that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to India.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">In their supporting brief, the Patels argued generally that the IJ erred in finding that Mr. Patel failed to show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the enumerated grounds. However, the Patels did not articulate or argue a specific ground that would support Mr. Patel\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims. The Patels further argued that their evidence showed that: (1) the smuggling organization would kill Mr. Patel for testifying against Kivett if Mr. Patel returned to India; and (2) the smuggling organization had ties to India\u2019s government. The Patels argued that Mr. Patel was eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">F. BIA\u2019s April 12, 2013 Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">On April 12, 2013, the BIA concluded that the Patels did not establish that they suffered past persecution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, the BIA determined that, even if they had established a well-founded fear of future persecution, such persecution would not be on account of one of the five grounds set forth in the INA because acts of private violence or evidence that aliens may be the victims of criminal activity do not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground. The BIA also observed that the Patels\u2019 family, including Mr. Patel\u2019s brother (who had contracted with Ali and the smugglers), remained in India unharmed, which undermined the Patels\u2019 fear of future persecution. According to the BIA, the Patels failed to show that Ali or the smuggling operation acted with the consent of any public official and that they would be subjected to state-sponsored torture. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s determination that the Patels were ineligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">On May 8, 2013, the Patels filed a petition for review in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AVu\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b844-16\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). \u201cUnder the substantial evidence test, we view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027. We may reverse the BIA\u2019s factual findings only when the record so compels. <em>Id. </em>Here, we review both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decision because the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s findings. <em>Wu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>712 F.3d 486, 492 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">B. Exhaustion of Claim of Membership in a Particular Social Group</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">We may review a final order of removal only if the petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies available to him as a matter of right. INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). The exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional and precludes review of a claim that was not presented to the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">To properly raise a claim before the BIA, the petitioner must mention the issue and discuss its merits, or at least contest the basis for the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1253 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that the petitioner failed to exhaust his cancellation-of-removal claim because, in his appeal to the BIA, the petitioner \u201cnever discussed the merits of his application for cancellation of removal, let alone the IJ\u2019s basis for denying it\u201d); <em>see also Cendejas Rodriguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>735 F.3d 1302, 1310 n. 10 (11th Cir.2013) (concluding that the petitioner\u2019s claim that he was persecuted based on his imputed membership in a particular social group was not raised before the BIA and, thus, was not exhausted).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review the Pa-tels\u2019 claim that they were members of a particular social group (defined as \u201cthe shared past experience of witnessing an Indian smuggling ring and testifying against its members\u201d). As the government\u2019s appellate brief points out, the Pa-tels did not raise this claim before the BIA, either in their notice of appeal to the BIA or in their supporting brief. This claim is not exhausted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We, therefore, dismiss the Patels\u2019 petition as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">C. Mr. Patel\u2019s Eligibility for Asylum and Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">To establish asylum eligibility, an alien must show, with specific and credible evidence, either past persecution or a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution on account of one of the five statutorily listed grounds, which include an alien\u2019s membership in a particular social group. INA \u00a7\u00a7 101(a)(42), 208(a)(1) and (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42), 1158(a)(1) and (b)(1); <em>see Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005). Similarly, an applicant for withholding of removal must show that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted on account of a protected ground. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>see Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the Pa-tels did not show \u201cthat any potential harm would be inflicted <em>on account of </em>one of the five grounds\u201d enumerated in the INA. This Court has stated that \u201c\u2018[evidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas, or that merely shows that a person has been the victim of criminal activity, does not constitute evidence of persecution <em>based on </em>a statutorily protected ground.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cendejas Rodriguez, </em>735 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>F.3d at 1810 (emphasis added) (addressing petitioner\u2019s application for withholding of removal). Here, the evidence did not show that Mr. Patel would be targeted or singled out for persecution because of his status as a testifying witness to a crime. <em>See id. </em>(providing that an applicant must present evidence showing that he will be \u201c <em>\u2018singled out </em>for persecution on account of [a protected ground]\u2019 \u201d). More likely, any future persecution of Mr. Patel is because he threatened the personal interests of those involved in the smuggling operation. <em>See id. </em>at 1310-11 (concluding that, even if the petitioner was a member of a cognizable social group, the IJ and BIA correctly determined that the petitioner failed to show that the harm he feared from a drug-trafficking organization arose from his membership in such a group, but rather only showed that his family was harmed due to their failure to cooperate with the drug traffickers or were the victims of criminal activity).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore deny the Patels\u2019 petition in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">D. Mr. Patel\u2019s Eligibility for CAT Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">To establish eligibility for CAT relief, an applicant must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured by, or with the acquiescence of, the government, if he is removed to the designated country of removal. <em>See </em>8 <em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 </em>208.16(c)(2), 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Patel did not establish that Ali had any connection to the government of India. Mr. Patel\u2019s evidence as to any government connection was purely speculative and not based on any specific knowledge. Since Mr. Patel has failed to show a nexus between the smuggling organization and the Indian government, he failed to demonstrate that he would likely be tortured by or with the consent of a government official.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We thus deny the petition as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss in part and deny in part the Patels\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-10\">. Mr. Patel\u2019s asylum application sought derivative relief for his wife, Mrs. Patel. The statutes and regulations governing withholding of removal and CAT relief do not create derivative rights. <em>See Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that the withholding-of-removal statute does not create derivative rights); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c) (discussing eligibility of applicant for CAT relief, but not derivative beneficiaries). Thus, Mrs. Patel is not entitled to withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b842-17\">. Mr. Patel\u2019s asylum application and written statement provided that Ali had a \"high level\" or \"upper level\u201d position with the Indian government, but Mr. Patel later admitted at the merits hearing that he did not know Ali\u2019s background or occupation. At the merits hearing, Mrs. Patel also indicated that she lacked actual knowledge as to whether Ali had \"a connection with the government.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\">. The NTAs also charged the Patels as removable, pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), for not possessing valid entry documents. However, the IJ dismissed these charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b843-14\">. It is unclear from the record why there was an almost three-year gap between the September 2009 merits hearing and the IJ\u2019s June 2012 decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\">. The BIA, unlike the IJ, reviewed whether both of the Patels had shown their eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, rather than recognizing that Mrs. Patel sought only derivative relief through Mr. Patel. However, this has no impact on our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b845-9\">. We note that the BIA specifically recognized that \u2018\u2018[t]he sole argument put forth by [the Patels] is their fear of future harm from Mr. Ali.\u201d The BIA did not specifically address whether the Patels were members of a particular social group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b846-6\">. Because the Patels have not shown that any persecution of Mr. Patel would be <em>on account of </em>a protected ground, they cannot show that Mr. Patel is eligible for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230-31; <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. Accordingly, we need not address the Patels\u2019 remaining argument, which is that the BIA erred in concluding that evidence that Mr. Patel\u2019s brother remained in India unharmed undermined Mr. Patel's claims of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">In any event, we conclude this remaining argument lacks merit. The evidence shows that the Patels and their families were threatened. Despite this threat, Mr. Patel\u2019s brother and other family were living in India unharmed at the time of the merits hearing. <em>See Ruiz </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258-59 (11th Cir.2006) (providing that the petitioner\u2019s claim that he feared future persecution was \"contradicted\u201d by the ability of his family to live unharmed in the area in which he purportedly faced the threat of violence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b846-14\">. Additionally, we lack jurisdiction to consider the Patels\u2019 claim \u2014 concerning the IJ's failure to give them notice of the need to supply additional evidence of Ali\u2019s government connections \u2014 because that claim was not exhausted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
