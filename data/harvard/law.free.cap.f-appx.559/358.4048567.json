First, the BIA dismissed Petitioner\u2019s appeal of an order by an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denying Petitioner\u2019s application for adjustment of immigration status. As explained in its decision, the BIA rejected Petitioner\u2019s contention that he is eligible for adjustment to permanent resident status as a \u201cgrandfathered alien\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l)(B)(i).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, the BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s motion to terminate removal proceedings after rejecting Petitioner\u2019s contention that he had already been granted permanent resident status by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d). Finally, the BIA denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to remand proceedings to the IJ based on the insufficiency of Petitioner\u2019s new evidence of eligibility for adjustment of immigration status.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Giving \u201cconsiderable deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the legislative scheme it is entrusted to administer,\u201d we generally review an immigration court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for substantial evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, under a \u201cjurisdiction stripping provision\u201d codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), no court may review certain discretionary decisions reached by immigration officials or the findings of fact made in support of those discretionary decisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In particular, this rule applies to the BIA\u2019s discretionary decisions regarding adjustment of immigration status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255 and cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the same time, under an exception to the jurisdiction stripping provision codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), the circuit courts retain authority to consider <em>de novo </em>any \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law\u201d raised in a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s discretionary decisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">An alien who entered the United States without inspection may seek adjustment of immigration status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i) if he is a \u201cgrandfathered alien\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>or, in other words, the beneficiary of a visa petition filed before April 30, 2001.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For an alien to avail himself of this provision, however, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.10(a)(l)(i) requires that the visa petition must have been \u201capprovable when filed.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Where the visa petition is based on the relationship of marriage, the BIA has previously held that the alien must show that the marriage was bona fide at its inception.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This interpretation of the governing statute and applicable regulation has been upheld by several circuit courts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Petitioner argues that he is a grandfathered alien because his alleged former spouse, Noelia Martinez (\u201cMartinez\u201d), filed a Petition for Alien Relative on Petitioner\u2019s behalf in 1996. However, the BIA held that Martinez\u2019s petition, which was deemed abandoned in 2003,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> does not support adjustment of Petitioner\u2019s present immigration status because Martinez\u2019s petition was not approvable when filed. In the BIA\u2019s view, the items of evidence submitted \u2014 both in connection \u25a0with Martinez\u2019s original petition and during the different stages of Petitioner\u2019s present removal proceedings \u2014 have collectively failed to establish the existence of a marriage that was bona fide at its inception. As we held in <em>Ayanbadejo v. Chertoff, </em>517 F.3d 273, 277 n. 11 (5th Cir.2008), the \u201cdetermination of whether the [alien] had a bona fide marriage [i]s a question of fact, not law.\u201d Accordingly, to the extent that Petitioner presently challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that he failed to demonstrate a bona fide marriage, we lack jurisdiction to consider Petitioner\u2019s challenge under the jurisdiction stripping provision codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">In this context, Petitioner also raises one argument that involves a question of law over which our jurisdiction is preserved by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). According to Petitioner, an internal memorandum issued in 1997 by the Acting Executive Associate Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service suggested that \u201cthe mere filing of a visa petition could protect a beneficiary\u2019s eligibility to file for adjustment of status pursuant to [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\u00ae ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">As the BIA correctly observed, however, Petitioner\u2019s reliance on this internal memorandum is misplaced. This internal memorandum only notified immigration officials of the possibility that Congress might subsequently \u201cprovide a grandfather clause for ... alien beneficiaries\u201d in the future, and instructed immigration officials regarding the procedures to follow in anticipation of such a provision\u2019s enactment. But the memorandum did not purport to interpret the language of that statutory provision, which did not yet exist. Nor did the memorandum, which was issued long before the current version of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.10(a)(1)\u00ae, purport in any way to disavow that regulation\u2019s \u201capprovable when filed\u201d requirement or the BIA\u2019s interpretation that a predicate marriage must have been bona fide at its inception.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>In any event, because the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the current version of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.10(a)(l)(i) is certainly not a \u201cplainly erroneous\u201d interpretation of that administrative regulation, the BIA\u2019s interpretation is entitled to our deference under <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Giving the requisite \u201cdeference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the legislative scheme it is entrusted to administer,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we therefore deny review of the BIA\u2019s decision regarding Petitioner\u2019s application for adjustment of immigration status.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Petitioner also argues that the BIA erred in upholding the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion to terminate removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b because he had already been granted permanent resident status. As evidence, Petitioner cites an undated and partially completed 1-94 notice, which Petitioner obtained from the records of the USCIS pursuant to a request under the Freedom of Information Act. The BIA concluded, however, that the USCIS never issued this 1-94 notice. According to the BIA, this document was partially completed in the course of considering Martinez\u2019s 1996 petition for a visa on Petitioner\u2019s behalf. After reviewing other USCIS documentation dated 2008 and 2006, the BIA concluded that Martinez\u2019s 1996 petition had ultimately been deemed abandoned. The BIA therefore upheld the IJ\u2019s decision to deny the motion to terminate removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Like the BIA\u2019s decisions regarding immigration status adjustment under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, the cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b is also a discretionary decision that is explicitly subject to the jurisdiction stripping provision codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The BIA\u2019s conclusion that the USCIS never issued the partially completed 1-94 notice is a finding of fact, over which we lack jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Additionally, to the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision in the present case relied on a conclusion of law regarding the legal effect of an unissued 1-94 notice, we uphold the BIA\u2019s decision on <em>de novo </em>review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Petitioner identifies no legal authority that would render Petitioner \u201can alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b based on the existence of an 1-94 notice that was never issued. We therefore deny review of the BIA\u2019s decision regarding the termination of removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">Finally, in his arguments regarding the bona fides of his marriage to Martinez, Petitioner refers to items of evidence that were submitted to the BIA in his motion to reopen. Construing this submission as a motion to remand under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(4), the BIA denied Petitioner\u2019s motion after finding that the evidence he had submitted was insufficient to warrant a remand. In the present appeal, however, Petitioner has briefed no argument regarding the correctness of the BIA\u2019s ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>on this motion. We therefore conclude that Petitioner has abandoned this issue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we consider that none of Petitioner\u2019s arguments in this appeal have merit. We therefore DENY Petitioner\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
