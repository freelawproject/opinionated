He contends that the district court committed plain error by imposing a 16-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on a determination that Rodriguez\u2019s prior Pennsylvania conviction for manufacture/deliver/possess with intent to manufacture or deliver cocaine qualified as a felony drug trafficking offense. Rodriguez asserts that his offense is broader than the standard definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d because he may have been convicted of \u201cdelivery,\u201d which, he contends, \u201cincludes offers to sell.\u201d In lieu of a response brief, the Government moved for summary affir-mance, asserting that Rodriguez is not entitled to relief on his allegations. Rodriguez filed no response to the motion for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-22\">Contrary to Rodriguez\u2019s assertion, the Pennsylvania offense of \u201cdelivery\u201d of a controlled substance does not include offers to sell. <em>See </em>35 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 780 \u2014 102(b). Moreover, the Sentencing Commission has amended the definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d to include offers to sell controlled substances. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)). Rodriguez\u2019s sole argument on appeal, then, is unavailing. Accordingly, we pretermit the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance, and AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
