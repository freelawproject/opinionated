In his complaint, Lawton alleged that his ex-wife, officials with the Florida Supreme Court, and the Florida and Ohio child support enforcement agencies (CSEAs) violated various federal and state laws in seeking and enforcing a child-support order against him, which required him to pay $44,082.66 in child-support arrears to his ex-wife. After he moved to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>the district court dismissed Lawton\u2019s complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) as barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine because his claims challenged the validity of the state court child-support order. The court additionally found that the Florida and Ohio CSEAs were entitled to sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Lawton contends that his claims are not barred for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine because that doctrine does not prohibit, but instead empowers, lower federal courts \u201cto correct wrong judgments\u201d by state courts \u201cto the extent that they incorrectly adjudge federal rights.\u201d Lawton misconstrues the doctrine. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine provides that \u201cfederal district courts cannot review state court final judgments because that task is reserved for state appellate courts or, as a last resort, the United States Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009). It applies to all \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil v. Saudi Basic Indus., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). And it extends not only to federal claims actually raised in state court, but also to federal claims \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court\u2019s judgment, meaning those that can \u201csucceed[ ] only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues\u201d before it. <em>Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1260 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-13\">Because Lawton\u2019s claims attacked the validity of the child-support proceedings already litigated in state court and the judgments that resulted from those proceedings, they can \u201csucceed[ ] only to the extent\u201d that the state courts wrongly decided the issue of his child-support obligations. <em>Id. </em>Those claims are therefore \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court\u2019s child support order and the district court did not err in dismissing them for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-14\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b998-6\">. <em>See Rooker v.
