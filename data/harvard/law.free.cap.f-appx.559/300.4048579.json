He argues that the appeal-waiver provision in his plea agreement does not bar this appeal because he is challenging a restitution order, which results in a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum. Regarding the restitution order, Hatcher contends that the district court erred by not requiring the Government to prove that the victim\u2019s losses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2259(b)(3)(A)-(E) were proximately caused by his conduct. The Government has moved for summary affir-mance, asserting that Hatcher\u2019s argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-21\">As Hatcher acknowledges, his challenge to the restitution order is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>In re Amy Unknown, </em>701 F.3d 749, 762 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc), <em>cert. granted, Paroline v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2886, 186 L.Ed.2d 932 (2013), wherein we held that the types of losses listed in \u00a7 2259(b)(3)(A)-(E) do not require a finding of proximate causation. Hatcher raises the issue to preserve it for further review. Because Hatcher\u2019s only appellate issue is foreclosed, we pretermit whether Hatcher\u2019s appeal is barred by his appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-24\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
