Fisher argues here that his claims were not ripe for summary judgment because the record contained disputed issues of material fact. He also argues that the district court erred by failing to grant his motion for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>extension of discovery. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">The Viridian is a high-rise apartment building in St. Petersburg, Florida catering to low-income residents, many of whom are disabled, elderly, or both. In 2009, the Viridian was purchased by SP One, which hired Royal American Management (RAM) to manage the property. Defendants Tom Robinson and Terry Dykes were both employees of RAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Soon after purchasing the property, SP One began a multi-million dollar renovation. As a part of these renovations, the Viridian informed the building\u2019s residents that they would no longer be allowed to operate large personal appliances in their apartments. Fisher was one of the tenants affected by this new policy because he had an air conditioner, a washing machine, and a dryer Jn his apartment. He asked the building for permission to keep his appliances as a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d for his disabilities. However, these requests were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">After renovation of the building was complete, Fisher also asked for the installation of different handrails in- his bathroom as a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d to aid in his balance. The Viridian responded to Fisher\u2019s request by asking for clarification about the type of replacement handrails he wanted and where he wanted them. Although the parties dispute whether Fisher ever replied, the record contains no evidence that Fisher\u2019s request was formally denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Fisher then filed a complaint in federal district court against the defendants, alleging violations of his rights under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), the Rehabilitation Act, and the Florida Fair Housing Act. Fisher\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendants discriminated against him by denying his requests for reasonable accommodations. The complaint also alleged that the defendants retaliated against Fisher after he filed his grievances with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">The district court entered a Case Management and Scheduling Order on January 4, 2012, stating that the parties would have to complete discovery by November 30, 2012. On the day that discovery was scheduled to close, Fisher filed a motion to extend discovery for another 60 days, which the district court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">The defendants then filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted in part and dismissed in part. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on Fisher\u2019s discrimination and retaliation claims. The district court then dismissed Fisher\u2019s state law claims after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. Fisher filed a motion for relief from the judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), which was denied. Fisher now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">Fisher\u2019s primary argument is that summary judgment was inappropriate here because there were still disputed issues of material fact relating to his claims. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, viewing all evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Rine v. Imagitas, Inc., </em>590 F.3d 1215, 1222 (11th Cir.2009). A court should grant summary judgment when, \u201cafter an adequate time for discovery, a party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an essential element of that party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Nolen v. Boca Raton Cmty. Hosp., Inc., </em>373 F.3d 1151, 1154 (11th Cir.2004). Finally, genuine disputes of facts are \u201cthose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>in which the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant. For factual issues to be considered genuine, they must have a real basis in the record.\u201d <em>Hairston v. Gainesville Sun Publ\u2019g Co., </em>9 F.3d 913, 919 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">We first consider whether summary judgment was appropriate for Fisher\u2019s discrimination claims. Fisher argues that these claims were not ripe for summary judgment because there was a factual dispute regarding the reasonableness of his requests to keep his air-conditioner, washer, and dryer. He specifically disputes the district court\u2019s finding that Fisher\u2019s personal appliances would potentially overload the Viridian\u2019s limited electrical infrastructure.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The Fair Housing Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prohibits discrimination \u201cin the provision of services or facilities in connection with [a] dwelling, because of a handicap.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(2). Discrimination includes \u201ca refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B). To prevail on a discriminatory failure-to-accommodate claim, a plaintiff must establish that (1) he is disabled or handicapped within the meaning of the FHA, (2) he requested a reasonable accommodation, (3) such accommodation was necessary to afford him an opportunity to use and enjoy his dwelling, and (4) the defendants refused to make the requested accommodation. <em>See Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, </em>544 F.3d 1201, 1218-19 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">The plaintiff has the burden of proving that a proposed accommodation is reasonable. <em>Loren v. Sasser, </em>309 F.3d 1296, 1302 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). \u201cWhether a requested accommodation is required by law is highly fact-specific, requiring case-by-case determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). An accommodation is not reasonable if it imposes undue financial and administrative burdens on the defendant. <em>See Schwarz, </em>544 F.3d at 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">With these legal principles in mind, we conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment to the defendants on Fisher\u2019s discrimination claims. As for the denial of Fisher\u2019s requests to keep his appliances, the defendants hired an architectural expert to explore the feasibility of accommodating personal appliances in the Viridian. The expert stated that the electrical panels servicing the Vi-ridian were already operating at near-maximum capacity and could not accept the additional load of an air-conditioner or a washer and dryer. The expert also stated that upgrading the electricity panels to increase their capacity would be prohibitively expensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">Fisher presented no evidence to the District Court to dispute these findings. Instead, he argued that his requests were reasonable because past owners had never said that the appliances were a problem. This assertion alone, however, does not rebut the evidence in the record that Fisher\u2019s appliances created an administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>and financial burden on the defendants. It may have been the case, for example, that previous owners were unaware that the Viridian\u2019s electrical panels were near full capacity. More importantly, the ban on large appliances was not imposed until after the Viridian underwent substantial renovations, including an overhaul of its central air system. In light of these renovations, the Viridian\u2019s old policies regarding large personal appliances may no longer have been feasible. As a result, we agree that Fisher failed to prove that his requested accommodations were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Fisher counters that there is a genuine issue of material fact here because the defendants\u2019 expert assumed that Fisher\u2019s appliances were \u201ctypical\u201d in their energy consumption. Unlike typical air-conditioners, washers, and dryers, Fisher argues that his appliances are energy efficient, and their operation would not require the defendants to expand the capacity of the Viridian\u2019s electrical panels.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Fisher\u2019s assertions cannot help him now because he presented none of these facts to the district court. Had he done so, the district court may have found that there was a factual dispute regarding the reasonableness of his requests. Because he did not, however, Fisher\u2019s argument is simply based on bare assertions rather than facts and evidence in the record. As a result, we cannot say that Fisher has established a genuine issue of material fact regarding the reasonableness of his requests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">We next consider whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment on Fisher\u2019s retaliation claims. After Fisher complained to HUD about the defendants\u2019 refusals to allow him to keep his appliances, Fisher alleges that the defendants retaliated against him in two ways. First, when the defendants temporarily moved Fisher to another apartment during the renovations to his unit, Fisher alleges that the defendants failed to take pictures or video of all of his valuables. Second, he also alleges that the defendants delayed the return of his belongings for two months after he returned to his unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">The FHA\u2019s anti-retaliation provision states that it is unlawful \u201cto coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any person ... on account of his having exercised or enjoyed ... any right granted or protected by [the FHA].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3617. In <em>Sofarelli v. Pinellas </em>County, 931 F.2d 718 (11th Cir.1991), for example, we held that a plaintiff stated a colorable claim under \u00a7 3617 by alleging that the defendants interfered with his efforts to move into a neighborhood on account of the plaintiff\u2019s race. <em>Id. </em>at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">The district court properly granted summary judgment here because Fisher could not establish that the defendants\u2019 adverse actions were \u201con account of\u2019 his decision to file a complaint with HUD. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3617. In support of his retaliation claim, Fisher alleges that he filed his complaint on February 25, 2010. The defendants did not move Fisher out of his apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>ment, however, until May 27, 2010 \u2014 more than three months after Fisher filed his complaint. Without any other evidence of a retaliatory motive in the record, the three-month delay between Fisher\u2019s complaint and the alleged adverse action was too long to establish a causal connection under our precedent. <em>See Higdon v. Jackson, </em>393 F.3d 1211, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that a three-month period between the protected conduct and the adverse action was not sufficient to allow a reasonable inference of causality in an Americans with Disabilities Act retaliation suit); <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cA three to four month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action is not enough.\u201d); <em>Clark Cnty. School Dist. v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001) (noting that temporal proximity between protected activity and adverse action in Title VII retaliation suits must be \u201cvery close\u201d in order to be sufficient evidence of causality). As a result, Fisher failed to show that the adverse actions he suffered were \u201con account of\u2019 his decision to file a complaint with HUD.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Finally, we consider Fisher\u2019s argument that the district court erred by denying his motion to extend discovery. Fisher argues that the district court should have granted an extension because he needed the additional time to resolve material issues regarding his medical records and tenant records he had requested from the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">We review a district court\u2019s discovery rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Josendis v. Wall to Wall Residence Repairs, Inc., </em>662 F.3d 1292, 1306 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cDiscretion means the district court has a range of choice, and that its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). In other words, \u201cwe will leave undisturbed a district court\u2019s ruling unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>Guideone Elite Ins. Co. v. Old Cutler Presbyterian Church, Inc., </em>420 F.3d 1317, 1325 (11th Cir.2005). In addition, discovery rulings will not be overturned \u201cunless it is shown that [they] resulted in substantial harm to the appellant\u2019s ease.\u201d <em>Iraola &amp; CIA, S.A. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., </em>325 F.3d 1274, 1286 (11th Cir.2003) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(b)(3)(A) states that a district court must issue a scheduling order that sets a limit on the amount of time to complete discovery. The schedule set forth by the court may only be modified for good cause and with the court\u2019s consent. Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b)(4). To establish good cause, the party seeking the extension must establish that the schedule could not be met despite the party\u2019s diligence. <em>See Oravec v. Sunny Isles Luxury Ventures, L.C., </em>527 F.3d 1218, 1232 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Against this legal backdrop, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion here by refusing to extend the discovery period. The court entered its scheduling order in January 2012, providing for nearly eleven months of discovery. Fisher, however, gave the court no indication that he would be seeking an extension until the day that discovery was scheduled to close. Beyond that, the district court also pointed out that granting a discovery extension would create a chain reaction of delay, pushing back the schedule for summary judgment motions and trial. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to grant Fisher\u2019s last-minute extension. <em>See Josendis, </em>662 F.3d at 1307 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>(noting that district courts have the authority to grant extensions of the discovery deadline for good cause, but they are under no obligation to do so); <em>Bearint ex rel. Bearint v. Dorell Juvenile Grp., Inc., </em>389 F.3d 1339, 1348-49 (11th Cir.2004) (upholding district court\u2019s decision to exclude an expert report disclosed after the deadline the court had established for its submission).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendants on Fisher\u2019s discrimination and retaliation claims. We also affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Fisher\u2019s motion to extend discovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-7\">. Although Fisher also brought claims under the Florida Fair Housing Act and the Rehabilitation Act, the district court evaluated each of the claims under the same framework applicable to Fair Housing Act claims. On appeal, Fisher also does not make any arguments specific to the Florida Fair Housing Act or the Rehabilitation Act. As a result, we confine our analysis to the Fair Housing Act. <em>See Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, </em>544 F.3d 1201, 1211-12 (11th Cir.2008) (reviewing the plaintiff's various discrimination claims solely under the FHA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-6\">. Construing Fisher's <em>pro se </em>briefing liberally, he also appears to challenge the district court's grant of summary judgment to the defendants on his discrimination claim regarding his request for new handrails. On this issue, we agree with the district court that the defendants expressly refrained from making a decision on Fisher's request until he specified what types of handrails he wanted and where he wanted them. Because there was no evidence that the defendants unambiguously denied Fisher\u2019s request, his discrimination claim under the FHA fails as a matter of law. <em>See Schwarz, </em>544 F.3d at 1219 (\"Simply put, a plaintiff must actually request an accommodation and be refused in order to bring a reasonable accommodation claim under the FHA.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b903-17\">. Fisher also appears to argue that the district court erred by considering certain documents before ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Fisher did not raise these evidentiary challenges in the district court, however, and for that reason, we decline to consider these issues on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines, Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (\"This Court has repeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
