More than 44 days after the entry of judgment, Cabrera-Hernandez filed a notice of appeal and a motion seeking an extension of time to file an appeal based on excusable neglect or good cause. The district court denied the motion, finding that the appeal was untimely and that Cabrera-Hernandez failed to show excusable neglect or good cause. The Federal Public Defender appointed to represent Cabrera-Hernandez has filed a motion to withdraw and a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-20\">Cabrera-Hernandez did not file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the entry of the criminal judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)\u00a9, (b)(6). His motion for an extension of time to file an appeal was filed beyond the 30-day time limit for extending the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(b)(4). Because the district court enforced the time limitations set forth in Fed. R.App. P. 4(b), the untimeliness of Cabrera-Hernandez\u2019s notice of appeal may not be disregarded. <em>See United States v. Leijano-Cruz, </em>473 F.3d 571, 574 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-21\">The instant appeal is without arguable merit. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
