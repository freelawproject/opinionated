He contends the administrative law judge (ALJ) erred by failing to explicitly assign weight to the opinions of two emergency room physicians, each of whom examined him and commented on his alleged disability. He also complains that the ALJ failed to give those opinions sufficient weight in his disability evaluation. After careful review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we conclude Tillman\u2019s arguments fail, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-20\">Tillman first faults the ALJ for failing to explicitly assign weight to the opinions of doctors Ullah and Subhani, who treated Tillman during his hospitalization following a stroke in 2006. Ordinarily, an ALJ\u2019s failure to explain the particular weight given to the different medical opinions provided is reversible error. <em>Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 279 (11th Cir.1987). However, when the ALJ\u2019s error did not affect its ultimate findings, the error is harmless, and the ALJ\u2019s decision will stand. <em>See Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983). In the instant case, the ALJ expressly noted and considered the diagnostic evidence on which Ullah and Subha-ni relied in forming their opinions, and that evidence, along with other objective medical evidence in the record and Tillman\u2019s own testimony, showed that he was not disabled and incapable of work. For example, Ullah opined that Tillman was \u201cseverely disabled\u201d and \u201cunable to function independently,\u201d but he did not offer any detailed explanation supporting this opinion, and when Tillman was discharged only days after Ullah\u2019s examination, his symptoms were stable, and he had been ambulating \u201cquite safely\u201d with the use of a cane. Moreover, Ullah\u2019s and Subhani\u2019s opinions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>concerned matters ultimately reserved to the Commissioner for final determination (i.e., whether Tillman was legally disabled) and were therefore not entitled to controlling weight. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(l)-(3), 416.927(d)(l)-(3); <em>Caulder v. Bowen, </em>791 F.2d 872, 878 (11th Cir.1986). Thus, while we acknowledge the ALJ\u2019s failure to specifically reference the opinions of Ullah and Subhani, we conclude that this failure did not affect the result in Tillman\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">For the same reasons, we conclude that the ALJ did not accord Ullah\u2019s and Subha-ni\u2019s opinions too little weight. Given the totality of the evidence presented and Tillman\u2019s own testimony concerning the activities he regularly performed, it is clear that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount the opinions of Ullah and Subhani, which spoke to matters ultimately reserved to the Commissioner, were conclusory and based on limited underlying relationships with Tillman, and were contradicted by other evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b999-18\">. In a Social Security appeal, we affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it \"is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc.
