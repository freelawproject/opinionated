Whether substantial evidence supports the denial of Ozerova\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal based upon an adverse-credibility determination and a lack of corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">2. Whether the BIA erred in concluding that, <em>in the alternative, </em>Ozerova failed to establish the eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">The IJ and BIA provided specific and cogent reasons for the adverse-credibility finding (the record does not compel the conclusion that the adverse-credibility was unfounded), and substantial evidence supports the determinations of adverse credibility and lack of reasonably available corroboration. Besides, the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions to deny Ozerova\u2019s application for asylum \u2014 no past persecution proved and no countrywide persecution proved \u2014 were based on reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence; and the record as a whole does not compel reversal. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. For background, see <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254-59 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b957-11\"> Ozerova did not challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of her eligibility for CAT relief in her appeal to the BIA. As a result, she did not exhaust her administrative remedies relating to her claim for CAT relief, and this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the issue. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006). Ozerova also does not raise before this Court any challenge to the denial of the CAT claim, thereby abandoning her claim on appeal. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (a party abandons claims that she does not argue in her brief). Thus, this appeal concerns only the denial of Ozerova's petition for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
