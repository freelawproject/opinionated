Rodriguez appeals the 18-month within-guidelines sentence imposed after he pleaded guilty to being an alien in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5)(A). All of Rodriguez\u2019s appellate arguments to go the district court\u2019s application of the four-level increase called for by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-21\">Rodriguez\u2019s advisory guidelines sentencing range was determined under \u00a7 2K2.1. Section 2K2.1(b)(4)(B) calls for a four-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level if he possessed a firearm with \u201can altered or obliterated serial number.\u201d The increase is to be applied \u201cregardless of whether the defendant knew or had reason to believe that the firearm ... had an altered or obliterated serial number.\u201d \u00a7 2K1.2, comment. (n.8(B)). \u201cThis court has continually enforced the clear and unambiguous language of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) and its strict liability standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>585 F.3d 880, 883 (5th Cir.2009). Rodriguez challenges the validity of the Guideline\u2019s strict liability standard, but <em>Perez </em>governs the issue. <em>See United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002) (holding that one panel of this court may not overrule the decision of another absent an intervening en banc or Supreme Court decision that changes the applicable law).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-22\">The penalty for a violation of \u00a7 922(g) is found at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). Section 924(a)(2) does not mandate any minimum sentence for a violation of \u00a7 922(g), and it caps a defendant\u2019s possible prison sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>at 10 years. No other penalty range is triggered by the fact of the obliteration of a firearm\u2019s serial number. Because the fact of the obliterated serial number is not a fact that increases the mandatory minimum or maximum statutory sentencing range, Rodriguez\u2019s argument that it was required to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt fails. <em>See Alleyne v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013); <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>United States v. Tuma, </em>738 F.3d 681, 693 (5th Cir.2013)(\u201cTuma\u2019s sentence did not expose him to a mandatory minimum sentence and was well within the sentencing discretion of the district court; therefore, <em>Alleyne </em>is inapplicable.\u201d). \u201cIt is settled in this circuit that a sentencing judge is entitled to find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts relevant to the determination of a Guidelines sentencing range.\u201d <em>United States v. Setser, </em>568 F.3d 482, 498 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">We also reject Rodriguez\u2019s argument that the district court impermissibly considered the obliteration of the serial number in sentencing him because that same obliteration was the subject of a separate count in the indictment, charging him with violating \u00a7 922(k), that was later dismissed. Conduct that is charged in dismissed counts of an indictment may be considered as relevant conduct for sentencing purposes as long as the conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>453 F.3d 252, 264 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Finally, we consider the applicability of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B) here. According to the presentence report (PSR), the serial number of the firearm Rodriguez possessed had, in fact, been obliterated or removed. The PSR was prepared using investigative reports provided by the Government. Accordingly, the facts contained therein had sufficient indicia of reliability that the district court could rely upon them in making its factual determinations absent the presentation of rebuttal evidence by Rodriguez. <em>See United States v. Zuniga, </em>720 F.3d 587, 591 (5th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Ollison, </em>555 F.3d 152, 164 (5th Cir.2009). Rodriguez has never asserted that the serial number of the firearm he possessed was not obliterated. Instead, his arguments have pertained only to his knowledge of that obliteration, which knowledge is irrelevant for purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B). <em>See Perez, </em>585 F.3d at 883. Thus, the district court\u2019s finding that Rodriguez possessed a firearm with an obliterated serial number was plausible in light of the record as a whole and the district court\u2019s application of the four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B) was not clearly erroneous. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
