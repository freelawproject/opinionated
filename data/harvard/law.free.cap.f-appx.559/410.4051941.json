On appeal of her sentence, she challenges a sixteen-level increase in her offense level based on a pre-deportation conviction in Oklahoma for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, which was deemed a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d (\u201cCOY\u201d) under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). We review Padilla-Loera\u2019s challenge <em>de novo </em>because she properly objected to the increase in the district court. <em>See United States v. Ortiz-Gomez, </em>562 F.3d 683, 684 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">A COV is defined as any of several enumerated offenses, including \u201caggravated assault.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). Because we agree with the district court that the Oklahoma offense qualifies as an aggravated assault, we need not decide in the alternative whether it \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)); <em>see United States v. Velasco, </em>465 F.3d 633, 637 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">We determine whether a prior offense is an enumerated COV by looking to the elements of the offense rather than the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2287-88, 186 L.Ed.2d 438; <em>United States v. Martinez-Flores, </em>720 F.3d at 293, 296 (5th Cir.2013). If the elements are the same as or narrower than the \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning\u201d of the enumerated offense, the prior offense is a COV. <em>Id. </em>at 295-96. Where a \u201cstatute sets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative,\u201d and some elements make the generic enumerated offense while others do not, we may \u201cconsult a limited class of documents, such as indictments and jury instructions, to determine which alternative formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction.\u201d <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281. We then compare the elements of the offense, as narrowed by the documents, with the elements of the generic offense. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">The generic contemporary definition of \u201caggravated assault\u201d is an assault that is aggravated by either of two traditional factors, namely \u201cserious\u201d bodily injury or the use of a deadly weapon. <em>See Martinez-Flores, </em>720 F.3d at 296, 299 &amp; nn. 6 &amp; 7 (referring to Model Penal Code \u00a7 211.1(2)); <em>United States v. Guerrero-Robledo, </em>565 F.3d 940, 946-47 (5th Cir.2009) (same). The Oklahoma statute provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-18\">Every person who, with intent to do bodily harm ... commits any assault, battery, or assault and battery upon the person of another <em>with any sharp or dangerous weapon, </em>or who ... shoots at another, with any kind of firearm, air gun, conductive energy weapon or other means whatever ... is guilty of a felony....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-19\">21 Ok. St. Ann. \u00a7 645 (emphasis added). Under Oklahoma law, the \u201cdangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>weapon is what distinguishes the crime of an assault with a dangerous weapon -with intent to do bodily harm from a simple assault.\u201d <em>Wilcox v. State, </em>13 Okla.Crim. 599, 166 P. 74, 75 (1917). The approved state-court documents show that Padilla-Loera was convicted under the \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Padilla-Loera contends that the Oklahoma crime is not generic aggravated assault because it does not require \u201cserious\u201d bodily harm but only \u201cbodily harm.\u201d We need not answer this contention because, even without \u201cserious\u201d bodily injury, a simple assault that is made \u201caggravated\u201d by the use of a deadly weapon is a COV. <em>See United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 199 (5th Cir.2007); <em>cf. Martinez-Flores, </em>720 F.3d at 295, 298-99 &amp; n. 6 (indicating that the defendant\u2019s prior offense would have been aggravated assault had he been convicted of using a deadly weapon as originally charged); <em>Velasco, </em>465 F.3d at 637 n. 4 (noting in <em>dictum </em>that the conviction would be an aggravated assault under the Model Penal Code because the defendant used a weapon). Padilla-Loera\u2019s prior offense was a generic aggravated assault under the dangerous-weapon provision of the Oklahoma statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Padilla-Loera nonetheless maintains that the Oklahoma crime is not aggravated assault because it requires the use of a \u201cdangerous\u201d weapon rather than a \u201cdeadly\u201d one. That conclusional assertion deserves merits no consideration because it merely presumes, without explanation, that there is a distinction between a \u201cdangerous\u201d weapon and a \u201cdeadly\u201d one. <em>See United States v. McMillan, </em>600 F.3d 434, 457 n. 75 (5th Cir.2010) (declining to review conclusional assertions).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In any event, we have not recognized any distinction between a dangerous weapon and a deadly one. The guideline definition of \u201caggravated assault\u201d refers to \u201ca dangerous weapon,\u201d which is defined to include \u201can instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.l(D)(i) (dangerous weapon)); \u00a7 2A2.2, comment, (n.l) (aggravated assault). Likewise, under Oklahoma law, \u201c[a] dangerous weapon is one likely to produce death or great bodily injury by the use made of it.\u201d <em>Wilcox, </em>166 P. at 75. The Model Penal Code similarly defines a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d as any item \u201c \u2018which in the manner it is used or is intended to be used is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ruedas, </em>452 F.3d 409, 414 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting Model Penal Code \u00a7 210.0(4)). Further, our pattern jury instructions use a single, similar definition for the inclusive term \u201cdeadly or dangerous weapon.\u201d 5th CiR. Pattern Jury Instructions: Criminal \u00a7\u00a7 2.09, 2.79 (2012); <em>see United States v. Williams, </em>520 F.3d 414, 421 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">The judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
