(\u201cBig Darby\u201d). Battelle claimed that bullets fired from the range were landing on or striking structures on Battelle\u2019s property. The Madison County Common Pleas Court granted the prehminary injunction after hearing more than two days of testimony. On appeal of that decision, Big Darby argues in its single assignment of error that the trial court erred in granting the prehminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">{\u00b6 3} Big Darby\u2019s stated issue in its appeal is whether a trial court may grant a preliminary injunction on a claim for nuisance, \u201cwhere the defendant is afforded immunity from the nuisance claim, and where there is no objective, scientifically valid expert or fact testimony supporting the existence of the claimed nuisance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>{\u00b6 4} According to R.C. 1533.84, the chief of the division of wildlife shall adopt rules establishing generally accepted standards for shooting ranges, and these rules should be no more stringent than National Rifle Association (\u201cNRA\u201d) standards and include standards for the limitation and suppression of noise and standards for public safety. At the time of its establishment, a shooting range shall comply with all existing local ordinances, regulations, or laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 1533.85 is titled \u201cImmunities regarding noise at shooting ranges.\u201d Most of the paragraphs of this statute deal with noise issues at a shooting range. However, R.C. 1533.85(C) states, \u201cNotwithstanding any contrary provision of law, the courts of common pleas [and] municipal courts * * * shall not grant injunctive relief under Chapter 3767. or any other section of the Revised Code, under an ordinance, resolution, or regulation of a political subdivision, or under the common law of this state against the owner or operator of a shooting range in a nuisance action if the court determines that the owner\u2019s or operator\u2019s actions or omissions that are the subject of a complaint substantially complied with the chiefs noise rules or the chiefs public safety rules, whichever apply to the nuisance action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">{\u00b6 6} Ohio Adm.Code 1501:31-29-03(A) states that in accordance with R.C. 1533.84, the chief of the division of wildlife establishes standards for shooting ranges in Ohio, addressing noise levels, hours of operation, and safety. Ohio Adm.Code 1501:31-29-03(A) also states that private or public shooting ranges in Ohio should substantially comply with these standards to receive the civil and criminal immunities granted under R.C. 1533.85.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">{\u00b6 7} According to Ohio Adm.Code 1501:31-29-03(D), private and public shooting ranges should substantially comply with safety guidelines generally recognized and accepted by the NRA. \u201cSuggested safety guidelines are described or explained in great detail in \u2018The NRA Range Source Book, Section I, Chapter 2, (1999 Edition).\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The administrative code section also requires that each range implement a safety plan and includes, without limitation, a number of items the plan should include.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">{\u00b6 8} We have reviewed the extensive testimony and exhibits admitted at the hearing, and will provide only a brief summary of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">{\u00b6 9} Battelle\u2019s campus consists of several buildings. Big Darby is located west of Battelle\u2019s campus, with State Route 142 running north and south between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>them. Big Darby has five shooting bays. The trial court made findings that Bay 1 is a 300-yard high-powered rifle bay with an earthen backstop, which had settled from 20 feet in height to 18.25 feet. The firing line of Bay 1 is 6,500 feet from three buildings on Battelle\u2019s campus. Bays 2 to 5 are 50-yard ranges with much shorter backstops. The trial court found that the firing lines for Bays 2 to 5 are approximately 5,750 feet from the same three Battelle buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">{\u00b6 10} Battelle presented two witnesses who said that they had encountered gunfire coming from the direction of Big Darby. A sergeant with Battelle security testified that on one occasion in 2009, he saw employees in the north parking lot of Battelle \u201ccrouching over\u201d as they moved quickly toward a building. The employees told him that they had heard bullets traveling through the trees just west of the north parking lot. The sergeant said that he had also heard bullets going through the trees and sounds of gunfire.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">{\u00b6 11} Another witness was an off-duty Battelle employee who was fishing with his family at the recreation lake on the Battelle property in 2009. He had just commented to his wife that the gunfire from Big Darby was particularly loud that day when he had heard the whistling sound of a bullet hitting the cattails near where they were standing. The employee said his daughter had reacted to the whistling sound by dropping to the ground. The trial court observed that a police investigation of both gunfire incidents yielded no findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">{\u00b6 12} The trial court stated that 13 bullets were recovered from the west side of three buildings on the north campus, directly down range from Big Darby. The trial court also noted that Battelle security found eight bullet-impact areas on the west-facing area of Battelle buildings. Big Darby emphasized that there were reports of gunfire heard in and around Battelle from sources other than Big Darby. For example, a Battelle security employee acknowledged that two individuals were discovered target shooting at a metro park east of Battelle\u2019s campus. Employees who testified also acknowledged that there may be individuals who disagree with the nature of the some of the research conducted at the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">{\u00b6 13} Battelle presented the testimony of James Gombarcik, a senior ordnance technician working for Battelle, who was asked to look into at least two bullet strikes that were discovered. Asked about the situation where a bullet struck a vehicle, Gombarcik found that the bullet had traveled from east to west, or came from a direction east of Battelle. He also examined the bullet strike to an air conditioning unit (\u201cHVAC\u201d). Gombarcik testified that he believed that the bullet found below the unit had caused the strike mark on the HVAC unit and that the bullet had come from Big Darby.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">{\u00b6 14} The trial court stated in its decision that it considered this witness for his lay testimony only. The trial court indicated that the witness was unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>explain the underlying science of ballistics to give credibility to an expert opinion, but the court found that the witness\u2019s opinion was \u201crationally based on his perceptions and helpful in determining the point of origin of that particular bullet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">{\u00b6 15} Battelle witness, Junior L. Davis, was qualified by the trial court as an expert witness, but it is not entirely clear from the record the specific area in which Davis was qualified as an expert. Davis recently retired from and had extensive experience with security forces for federal facilities in Tennessee, and his experience included developing shooting ranges as part of his employment. Davis testified that he viewed a number of issues that he believed made Big Darby not substantially compliant with the NRA Range Source Book. Davis listed a number of criticisms of the range, including ricochet problems, and issues with backstop height and the condition of some backstops and targets. Davis stated that most of the bullets found on the Battelle buildings came from the direction of Big Darby. He acknowledged that this opinion about the direction of the discovered bullets was an educated guess based upon his experience, not scientific fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">{\u00b6 16} Kevin Dixon, shooting sports and range coordinator for the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Wildlife, was called to testify by Big Darby. He recommended some changes for the range, such as raising backstops for the ranges to \u201cat least the point of 20 feet across the board\u201d and adding \u201cbullet catchers]\u201d on the top of backstops.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">{\u00b6 17} Dixon said that some of the Battelle buildings had marks that could be bullet strikes in areas other than just the side of those buildings that face Big Darby. Dixon also said that Davis, Battelle\u2019s expert witness, was holding Big Darby to a higher standard than Ohio law requires. Dixon stated that Big Darby was in substantial compliance with the division of wildlife standards for shooting ranges.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>Barnett v. Carr ex rel. Estate of Carr, </em>this court explained that \u201cnuisance\u201d is a term used to designate \u201cthe wrongful invasion of a legal right or interest.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Battelle indicated that its cause of action was for a qualified private nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">{\u00b6 19} A \u201cprivate nuisance\u201d is a nontrespassory invasion of another\u2019s interest in the private use and enjoyment of land.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In order for a private nuisance to be actionable, the invasion must be either (a) intentional and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>unreasonable or (b) unintentional but caused by negligent, reckless, or abnormally dangerous conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cQualified\u201d nuisance is premised upon negligence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To recover damages for a qualified nuisance, negligence must be averred and proven.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A qualified nuisance, or a nuisance dependent on negligence, consists of an act lawfully but \u201cso negligently or carelessly done as to create a potential and unreasonable risk of harm, which in due course results in injury to another.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under such circumstances, the nuisance arises from a failure to exercise due care, and even that which was lawful in origin may become a nuisance through negligence in maintenance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">{\u00b6 21} The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo of the parties pending a final adjudication of the case on the merits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In ruling on a motion for preliminary injunction, a trial court must consider whether (1) the moving party has shown a substantial likelihood that he or she will prevail on the merits of their underlying substantive claim, (2) the moving party will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted, (3) issuance of the injunction will not harm third parties, and (4) the public interest would be served by issuing the preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The party seeking the preliminary injunction must establish each of these elements by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">{\u00b6 22} The decision whether to grant or deny an injunction is a matter solely within the discretion of the trial court, and a reviewing court should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>disturb the judgment of the trial court in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">{\u00b6 23} In its decision granting the preliminary injunction, the trial court cited a portion of Ohio Adm.Code 1501:31 \u2014 29\u201403(D), which states that shooting ranges should be large enough to accommodate the appropriate disciplines and projectile containment as modified by existing topographic features and additional range features.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">{\u00b6 24} The trial court said it relied on the NRA Source Book to review recommendations for covered backstops, overhead ground and side baffles, etc., and noted that the source book stated that projectiles must be confined on the property. The trial court found that fired bullets were escaping from Big Darby, which endangered the traveling public on State Route 142 and Battelle employees and facilities. Because projectiles were not confined to Big Darby property, the trial court found for purposes of the preliminary injunction that the range was not in substantial compliance with NRA standards. As a result, the trial court evaluated the appropriate factors for granting a preliminary injunction and found that granting a preliminary injunction was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">{\u00b6 25} Turning to Big Darby\u2019s arguments, we do not agree that the record supports the claim that the trial court \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d Ohio\u2019s Range Protection Act or disregarded Big Darby\u2019s competent evidence. The trial court cited the range law in its decision. The trial court also discussed the evidence presented by Big Darby. The weight to be given this evidence is determined by the trier of fact.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">{\u00b6 26} Big Darby also challenges the admission or exclusion of some evidence or testimony. Ordinarily, a trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence in any particular case, so long as such discretion is exercised in line with the rules of procedure and evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And an appellate court reviewing the trial court\u2019s admission or exclusion of evidence must limit its review to whether the lower court abused its discretion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">{\u00b6 27} Further, trial courts have broad discretion in determining the admissibility of expert testimony, subject to review for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>In general, courts should admit such expert testimony when it is material and relevant and, according to Evid.R. 702, under the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(A) The witness\u2019 testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(C) The witness\u2019 testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information. To the extent that the testimony reports the result of a procedure, test, or experiment, the testimony is reliable only if all of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(1) The theory upon which the procedure, test, or experiment is based is objectively verifiable or is validly derived from widely accepted knowledge, facts, or principles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(2) The design of the procedure, test, or experiment reliably implements the theory;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(3) The particular procedure, test, or experiment was conducted in a way that will yield an accurate result.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">{\u00b6 34} The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it permitted Battelle\u2019s expert witness, Davis, to testify about safety features for shooting ranges, as Davis possessed knowledge or experience in shooting-range development beyond that possessed by lay persons.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Davis acknowledged that his opinion that the bullets or bullet strikes on Battelle buildings came from the direction of Big Darby was not based upon scientific or technical information. While this determination may be a closer call, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it permitted Davis to give his opinion that he believed the bullets came from the direction of Big Darby, based upon his specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">{\u00b6 35} We also do not find that the trial court abused its discretion when it determined that Gombarcik\u2019s testimony would be considered as lay testimony only, \u201crationally based on his perceptions and helpful in determining the point of origin of that particular bullet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>{\u00b6 36} Big Darby also argues that the trial court erred in not allowing it to use a preliminary report from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI <em>&amp; </em>I\u201d)- The record indicates that the state of Ohio initially filed a motion to quash the subpoena for the individual who was responsible for the BCI &amp; I report. The trial court granted the motion at the beginning of the hearing, accepting the state\u2019s argument that the preliminary report was a confidential law-enforcement investigatory record.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">{\u00b6 37} It appears from the record that BCI &amp; I subsequently provided the preliminary report with an affidavit of authenticity and indicated by cover letter that it was releasing the report \u201cupon agreement with counsel for Big Darby.\u201d According to the transcript, the trial court told Big Darby that it would have to produce the author of the report the next day to have the report admitted. Big Darby did not produce the witness, but proffered the report after the trial court would not admit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">{\u00b6 38} A trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to quash a subpoena generally is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Civ.R. 45(C)(3)(b) provides that, on timely motion, a court shall quash or modify a subpoena if it \u201c[Requires disclosure of privileged or otherwise protected matter and no exception or waiver applies.\u201d The state initially moved to quash the subpoena, and the motion was granted. We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it initially quashed the subpoena, and later, when it ruled that the report could be admitted if the author testified, which he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">{\u00b6 39} Finally, Big Darby moved to stay enforcement of the preliminary injunction after the trial court issued its decision. Big Darby proposed modifications to the range as part of that effort. To the extent that Big Darby is requesting that this court consider this range-modification plan for purposes of this appeal, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">{\u00b6 40} Having reviewed the record and the requirements for granting a preliminary injunction, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction. Big Darby\u2019s single assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b333-9\">Ringland and Hendrickson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\">.
