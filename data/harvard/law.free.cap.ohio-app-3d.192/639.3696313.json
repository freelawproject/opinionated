For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">{\u00b6 2} On November 20, 2008, appellant pleaded guilty to one count of theft, a first-degree misdemeanor, in violation of R.C. 2913.02. The trial court sentenced appellant to 180 days in jail and suspended the jail days, placing appellant on probation for one year. The conditions of his probation included obtaining employment, paying restitution, and completing an anger-management class. In June 2009, appellant stopped reporting to his probation officer. Subsequently, appellant was declared to be an absconder and his probation was suspended. On March 31, 2010, following an administrative hearing, the court restored appellant\u2019s probation, imposing a 90-day term of electronically monitored house arrest (\u201cEMHA\u201d) and extending the probation for one year. On May 21, 2010, appellant violated the EMHA. He also failed to complete other conditions of his probation. On June 25, 2010, the trial court conducted a hearing on the probation department\u2019s request to revoke appellant\u2019s probation. At the hearing, appellant argued that if his probation was revoked and the jail sentence was reimposed, he was entitled to time-served credit against the jail sentence for 50 days spent under EMHA. Appellant also argued that he was entitled to credit for 90 days of actual time spent in jail related to the theft conviction and that the probation department had miscalculated in asserting that he was entitled to credit for only 81 days spent in jail. The trial court revoked appellant\u2019s probation, reimposed the 180-day jail sentence, and ordered that appellant was entitled to receive time-served credit of 81 days for the time he spent in jail. No credit was given for the time appellant spent under EMHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Appellant appeals, setting forth the following two assignments of error for the court\u2019s review:</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER ONE</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Any\">The trial court erred by not crediting the time the defendant was sentenced to electronically monitored house arrest toward the maximum jail sentence that it imposed upon the defendant because house arrest is defined as confinement and detention by the Revised Code and the courts are obligated to credit the amount of time a defendant is confined \u201cfor any reason arising out of the offense for which the person was convicted and sentenced\u201d towards the sentence imposed upon an offender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER TWO</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsW\">The trial court erred when it failed to correct an obvious clerical error in the calculation of the time that the defendant spent in pretrial detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error asserts that when the trial court revoked his probation, it should have given credit against his jail term for the time he spent under EMHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">{\u00b6 5} Generally, an appellate court will not overturn the sentence imposed on a misdemeanor offender absent an abuse of discretion by the trial court. See <em>Columbus v. Repine, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-250, 2007-Ohio-5015, 2007 WL 2773839, \u00b6 19 (French, J., concurring). However, the essence of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error involves a dispute over the proper application of R.C. 2949.08(C). \u201c \u2018When an appellate court is called upon to review a trial court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute, the \u201cappellate court conducts a de novo review, without deference to the trial court\u2019s determination.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Willig, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-925, 2010-Ohio-2560, 2010 WL 2298840, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>McGeehan v. State Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(Dec. 28, 2000), 10th Dist. No. 00AP-648, 2000 WL 1877586, quoting <em>State v. Sufronko </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 504, 506, 664 N.E.2d 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">{\u00b6 6} In imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor offense, a trial court is \u201cguided by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing,\u201d which are \u201cto protect the public from future crime by the offender and others and to punish the offender.\u201d R.C. 2929.21(A). The sentencing court \u201chas discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve\u201d these purposes. R.C. 2929.22(A). Unless a specific sanction is required, the court may sentence an offender to a jail term, community-control sanctions, or both. R.C. 2929.25(A)(1). The range of available community-control sanctions includes residential sanctions, such as a term in a halfway house; nonresidential sanctions, such as a period of house arrest; and financial sanctions, such as restitution. R.C. 2929.26 to 2929.28. The total time of all community-control sanctions imposed for a misdemeanor offense may not exceed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>five years. R.C. 2929.25(A)(2). If an offender violates a community-control sanction, the court may impose a longer time under that community-control sanction, a more restrictive community-control sanction, or a combination of community-control sanctions, including a jail term. R.C. 2929.25(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cHouse arrest\u201d is defined as \u201ca period of confinement of an offender that is in the offender\u2019s home or in other premises specified by the sentencing court\u201d during which the offender is required to remain in the home except when authorized to leave for employment or other designated purposes. R.C. 2929.01(P). The offender is required to periodically report to a designated person and may be subject to other restrictions or conditions. Id. Electronic monitoring involves the use of an electronic device to monitor and determine an individual\u2019s location. R.C. 2929.01(TT) and (UU).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">{\u00b6 8} Ohio law provides that when a person is sentenced to jail for a felony or misdemeanor offense, his sentence shall be reduced \u201cby the total number of days the person was confined for any reason arising out of the offense for which the person was convicted and sentenced.\u201d R.C. 2949.08(C)(1). Appellant argues that because the law defines house arrest as \u201ca period of confinement,\u201d time served in postconviction EMHA qualifies for a reduction of his jail sentence under R.C. 2949.08(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">{\u00b6 9} The term \u201cconfinement\u201d is not separately defined under R.C. 2929.01. However, the fact that house arrest is defined using the term \u201cconfinement\u201d does not necessarily mean that it qualifies for time-served credit under R.C. 2949.08(C)(1). \u201c[W]here two statutes do not expressly state that the word has the same meaning in both, it is apparent that it might have different meanings.\u201d <em>State v. Dickinson </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St.2d 65, 70, 57 O.O.2d 255, 275 N.E.2d 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">{\u00b6 10} It is clear that house arrest does not always qualify as \u201cconfinement.\u201d This court has previously held that time served under EMHA as a condition of bail prior to sentencing cannot be credited toward a jail sentence. <em>State v. Furlong </em>(Feb. 6, 2001), 10th Dist. No. 00AP-637, 2001 WL 95870, citing <em>State v. Holt </em>(May 12, 2000), 2d Dist. No. 18035, 2000 WL 569930. Similarly, the Supreme Court of Ohio has held that pretrial EMHA as a condition of bond \u201cdoes not constitute detention.\u201d <em>State v. Gapen, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-6548, 819 N.E.2d 1047, \u00b6 72; see also <em>State v. Sutton, </em>6th Dist. No. L-03-1104, 2004-Ohio-2679, 2004 WL 1171149, \u00b6 16.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant concedes that pretrial EMHA as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>condition of bail is not confinement for purposes of calculating time-served credit, but he seeks to distinguish these cases by arguing that a person can refuse pretrial EMHA as a condition of bail and choose to remain in jail awaiting trial but cannot refuse EMHA when it is imposed as part of a postconviction sentence. Therefore, appellant argues, postconviction EMHA as a condition of a sentence is different in nature and should qualify for time-served credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 11} The case before this court involves a misdemeanor offender and the application of the time-served-credit provision of R.C. 2949.08(C)(1). Our holding is accordingly limited to these circumstances. We note, however, that much of the existing case law regarding credit for time served arises in the context of felony offenses. We also note that some of these cases involve application of the time-served credit provision of R.C. 2967.191. In relevant part, R.C. 2949.08(C)(1) and 2967.191 contain nearly identical language. Therefore, we find that the analysis, reasoning, and conclusions of these cases may be analogous to the matter before us. With this in mind, we begin our analysis with a discussion of two decisions of the Supreme Court of Ohio evaluating whether other forms of restrictions on offenders qualified for time-served credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>State v. Nagle </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 185, 23 OBR 348, 492 N.E.2d 158, the Supreme Court of Ohio considered whether time spent in a residential rehabilitation facility as a condition of probation constituted confinement under R.C. 2949.08(C). The defendant in <em>Nagle </em>pleaded guilty to felonious assault; he was given a suspended jail sentence and placed on conditional probation. One of the conditions of his probation was spending 18 months at an out-of-state rehabilitation facility. After less than two months, the defendant left the rehabilitation facility, returned to Ohio, and turned himself in to authorities. Id. At a subsequent probation-revocation hearing, the trial court terminated the defendant\u2019s probation and reimposed the original jail sentence. The court of appeals held that the trial court erred by not giving the defendant credit under R.C. 2949.08(C) for the time he spent in the rehabilitation facility. Id. at 186. The Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals and reinstated the original sentence, holding that the trial court was not required to give credit against the jail term for time spent in the rehabilitation facility. Id. at 188. Central to this holding was the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that \u201cin none of [the examples of confinement under R.C. 2949.08(C) ] may the defendant leave official custody of his own volition.\u201d Id. at 186. By contrast, although the rehabilitation facility imposed restrictions on the defendant\u2019s freedom of communication with those outside the facility, \u201c[his] freedom of movement was not so severely restrained, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>i.e., </em>he indeed did voluntarily depart the facility.\u201d Id. at 187. Therefore, time spent in this residential rehabilitation facility as a condition of postconviction probation was not a form of \u201cconfinement\u201d eligible for time-served credit under R.C. 2949.08(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">{\u00b6 13} By contrast, in <em>State v. Napier </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 646, 758 N.E.2d 1127, the Supreme Court of Ohio concluded that time spent in a community-based correctional facility constituted confinement under R.C. 2967.191. That case involved a defendant who pleaded guilty to felony drug possession and was sentenced to three years of community-control sanctions, including evaluation and treatment at a residential community-based correctional facility. Id. at 649. After the defendant violated his community-control sanctions, the trial court imposed an eight-month prison sentence, and the defendant claimed he was entitled to credit for 110 days spent at the community-based correctional facility. The trial court granted the defendant credit for only the first 30 days at the facility when he was in a \u201clockdown\u201d status and not permitted to leave the facility. Id. at 647. The Supreme Court reversed the trial court\u2019s determination, holding that the defendant was entitled to credit for all of the time spent at the facility. The Supreme Court noted that although the defendant could leave the facility after the \u201clockdown\u201d period, his ability to leave was subject to requesting permission and submitting a detailed written description of when he was leaving the facility, where he was going, and when he planned to return. Because the defendant was not free to come and go as he wished and \u201cwas subject to the control of the staff regarding personal liberties,\u201d the defendant\u2019s time in the community-based correctional facility constituted \u201cconfinement\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2967.191. Id. at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 14} Consistent with the reasoning of these decisions, this court has previously noted that \u201c \u2018confinement\u2019 requires such a restraint on the defendant\u2019s freedom of movement that he cannot leave official custody of his own volition.\u201d <em>State v. Slager, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-581, 2009-Ohio-1804, 2009 WL 1027182, \u00b6 20. In <em>Slager, </em>the court concluded that pre-arrest hospitalization for treatment of injuries sustained while fleeing the police did not constitute confinement for purposes of R.C. 2967.191. Id. at \u00b6 21. The court stated that a hospital is not the type of secure facility that would give rise to confinement. Further, the defendant was not guarded, confined, or restrained while in the hospital, and he was not placed under arrest until the day he was discharged from the hospital. Id. The court therefore determined that the defendant was not entitled to credit for time served for his pre-arrest hospital stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 15} The Second District Court of Appeals considered a case similar to the present appeal in <em>State v. Ober, </em>2d Dist. No. 2003-CA-27, 2004-Ohio-3568, 2004 WL 1506127. The defendant in that case was convicted of five counts of sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>battery, served a portion of his original jail sentence, and then was released on probation. After violating his probation, the terms of probation were modified, and he was placed on house arrest. Id. at \u00b6 6. When the defendant once again violated his probation, his original jail sentence was reimposed. The defendant argued that under R.C. 2967.191, he was entitled to time-served credit for the period he spent under house arrest before violating his probation a second time. Id. at \u00b6 19. The court of appeals concluded that the defendant\u2019s house arrest \u201cwas less restrictive, or at least no more restrictive, than the situation of the defendant in <em>State v. Nagle.\u201d </em>Id. at \u00b6 20. Therefore, while under house arrest, the defendant had not been confined for purposes of R.C. 2967.191.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 16} The order imposing EMHA on appellant indicates that he was permitted to leave his home for both anger-management treatment and employment. Moreover, like the defendant in <em>Nagle, </em>appellant was apparently able to leave the home of his own volition, because he must have done so to violate the terms of his EMHA. The fact that he faced possible consequences for choosing to violate his EMHA did not transform the EMHA into a condition imposing \u201csuch a restraint on [his] freedom of movement that he [could not] leave official custody of his own volition.\u201d <em>Slager </em>at \u00b6 20, citing <em>Nagle, </em>23 Ohio St.3d at 186-187, 23 OBR 348, 492 N.E.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\"> {\u00b6 17} In addition to case law supporting a finding that EMHA does not constitute confinement for purposes of R.C. 2949.08(C), statutory analysis also supports this conclusion. In construing a statute, \u201c \u2018[statutes relating to the same matter or subject * * * are <em>in pan materia </em>and should be read together to ascertain and effectuate if possible the legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>D.A.B.E., Inc. v. Toledo-Lucas Cty. Bd. of Health, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 250, 2002-Ohio-4172, 773 N.E.2d 536, \u00b6 20, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt </em>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 463, 58 O.O. 315, 132 N.E.2d 191, paragraph two of the syllabus. Appellant argues that EMHA constitutes confinement under R.C. 2949.08(C) because an offender convicted of a misdemeanor cannot be sentenced to a term of EMHA that exceeds the maximum jail term available for the offense. However, this claim is contrary to established law applicable specifically to misdemeanor sentencing. Although R.C. 2929.27 is silent as to how long EMHA may be imposed, R.C. 2929.25(A)(2) provides that the duration of all community-control sanctions\u2014 which includes nonresidential sanctions such as EMHA \u2014 imposed on a misdemeanor offender may not exceed five years. By contrast, the law specifically provides that a misdemeanor offender may be sentenced to a term in a halfway house or an alternative residential facility \u201cnot to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense.\u201d R.C. 2929.26(A)(1) and (2). Absent a similar statutory restriction on EMHA, a trial court has discretion to impose a term of EMHA longer than the maximum jail term available for the offense, so long as the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>heeds the cumulative five-year restriction for all community-control sanctions. In <em>State v. Cowen, </em>167 Ohio App.3d 233, 2006-Ohio-3191, 854 N.E.2d 579, the Second District Court of Appeals held that a trial court did not err by sentencing a misdemeanor offender to three months of EMHA when the maximum possible jail term for the offense was 30 days. The court held that \u201cif the legislature intended for a sentence of [EMHA] to be the equivalent of a jail term, then it could have inserted the same limitation in R.C. 2929.27 [as in R.C. 2929.26(A)(1) and (2) ], but it did not.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant\u2019s position is also contrary to the authority given to trial courts to remedy violations of community-control sanctions. Under R.C. 2929.25(C)(2), a court may impose additional penalties on a person who violates a condition of a community-control sanction, including a longer time under the same community-control sanction or a more restrictive community-control sanction. The statute provides that \u201c[t]he court <em>may </em>reduce the longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer sanction or the more restrictive sanction * * * by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under the sanction that was initially imposed.\u201d R.C. 2929.25(C)(3). (Emphasis added.) This statute vests trial courts with discretionary authority to give violators credit for time served under a community-control sanction when imposing additional punishment for violating that community-control sanction. Thus, under this statute, if the court below had sentenced appellant to an extended term of EMHA as a penalty for violating the original EMHA sanction, the court would have had discretionary authority to reduce the extended term to give appellant credit for time served under the original EMHA sanction. Appellant argues that when the trial court reimposed the original jail sentence after he violated EMHA, the court was <em>required </em>to give him credit for time served under EMHA. However, if credit must be given for time served under EMHA when reinstating a jail sentence, then it would follow that time-served credit would be mandatory when imposing an extended community-control sanction. The General Assembly has clearly provided otherwise. Accepting appellant\u2019s position would be logically inconsistent with the authority granted to trial courts under R.C. 2929.25(C)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">{\u00b6 19} In light of the case law and statutory analysis set forth above, we hold that a person convicted of a misdemeanor offense is not entitled to time-served credit under R.C. 2949.08(C) for time spent under EMHA as a condition of postconviction probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">{\u00b6 20} We note finally that although we find that the trial court is not required to give appellant time-served credit for his time under EMHA, we disagree with the state\u2019s assertion that only preconviction confinement may be credited under R.C. 2949.08(C). The state argues that both the title of R.C. 2949.08, \u201cConfinement of convicts; reduction of sentence for confinement prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>conviction,\u201d and the examples provided in the statute demonstrate that only preconviction forms of confinement may be used in determining time-served credit. Id. However, it is well established that title, chapter, and section headings do not constitute part of the law. R.C. 1.01; see also <em>Viers v. Dunlap </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 173, 175, 1 OBR 203, 438 N.E.2d 881, overruled on other grounds by <em>Wilfong v. Batdorf </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 100, 103, 6 OBR 162, 451 N.E.2d 1185.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, one of the examples of confinement for which time-served credit should be granted under R.C. 2949.08(C)(1) is \u201cconfinement while awaiting transportation to the place where the person is to serve the sentence,\u201d which by its own terms assumes that the confined individual has been convicted and sentenced. The <em>Napier </em>decision, discussed above, also demonstrates that certain forms of postconviction community-control sanctions are deemed to be confinement for purposes of determining time-served credit. Therefore, we cannot agree with the state\u2019s position that only preconviction confinement is eligible for time-served credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">{\u00b6 21} For the reasons set forth above, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">{\u00b6 22} In his merit brief, appellant asked this court, in the event that we overruled the first assignment of error, to certify our decision as being in conflict with the decision in <em>State v. Holmes, </em>6th Dist. No. L-08-1127, 2008-Ohio-6804, 2008 WL 5341009. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Whitelock v. Gilbane Bldg. Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 594, 613 N.E.2d 1032, the Supreme Court of Ohio explained the conditions that must be met before certifying a conflict, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">First, the certifying court must find that its judgment is in conflict with the judgment of a court of appeals of another district and the asserted conflict <em>must </em>be \u201cupon the same question.\u201d Second, the alleged conflict must be on a rule of law \u2014 not facts. Third, the journal entry or opinion of the certifying court must clearly set forth that rule of law which the certifying court contends is in conflict with the judgment on the same question by other district courts of appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">(Emphasis sic.) Id. at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">{\u00b6 24} In <em>Holmes, </em>the Sixth District considered whether a defendant who had been convicted of felony drug possession was entitled to credit for time served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>under EMHA when he was returned to prison for violating his community-control sanctions. <em>Holmes </em>at \u00b6 2-6. The present case involves an offender convicted of misdemeanor theft. There are important distinctions between the schemes for felony sentencing and misdemeanor sentencing. See, e.g., <em>State v. Sutton, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 802, 2005-Ohio-4589, 835 N.E.2d 752, \u00b6 9. Because <em>Holmes </em>involved a felony offender and the present case involves a misdemeanor offender, we believe that the decisions are not \u201cupon the same question\u201d and certification is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">{\u00b6 25} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error claims that the trial court erred by granting credit for only 81 days of time served in jail, when he had actually spent a total of 90 days in jail at various times for this offense. Appellant asserts that this nine-day discrepancy arises from the time of his original sentencing in November 2008. Appellant was arrested on October 2, 2008, and was released from jail on bond on November 6, 2008. Thus, it appears that appellant spent 36 days in jail prior to his release on bond. At the original sentencing, however, the court ordered that he was entitled to 27 days of credit for time served in jail prior to conviction. This alleged mathematical error remained on the record and formed part of the trial court\u2019s calculation in the order revoking appellant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">{\u00b6 26} While suggesting that res judicata might apply to this assignment of error, the state \u201cconcedes that a limited remand is appropriate to correct the original sentencing entry.\u201d In light of the facts asserted by appellant, it appears that the trial court erred in its original calculation of appellant\u2019s time-served credit and that this error led to a subsequent error in the order revoking appellant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">{\u00b6 27} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">{\u00b6 28} For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled and his second assignment of error is sustained. We affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas denying time-served credit for the time appellant spent under EMHA, but reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment granting only 81 days of credit for time served in jail. We remand this matter to the trial court to vacate its July 1, 2010 revocation entry and to re-issue a new corrected order regarding the credit for actual time served in jail to which appellant is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part; and cause remanded with instructions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b685-9\">Bryant, P.J., and French, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-9\">. \"Detention\u201d is defined in R.C. 2921.01(E) and is relevant to the crime of escape, prohibited under R.C. 2921.34.
