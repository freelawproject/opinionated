For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">{\u00b6 2} The following procedural background is not in dispute. Sometime prior to October 2005, Unger hired Jose Acosta to install a concrete patio in Unger\u2019s back yard. Dissatisfied with the installation, Unger filed suit in Warren County seeking monetary damages and obtained a default judgment against Acosta in March 2006 (\u201cthe Warren County case\u201d). The following month, Unger filed a judgment lien against Acosta\u2019s real estate in Butler County.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">{\u00b6 3} In April 2006, an entity called Tri State Investment Trust, Inc., purchased Acosta\u2019s property by way of a short sale. Shortly thereafter, Tri State sold the property to James and Paige Miller. At the time of the sale, the Millers were unaware of Unger\u2019s judgment lien against the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">{\u00b6 4} In the following months, Unger\u2019s attorney communicated with the Millers\u2019 attorney about the judgment lien. The Millers\u2019 attorney believed no final judgment had been entered in the Warren County case, rendering Unger\u2019s lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>premature and unenforceable. The Millers demanded that the lien be removed because it was interfering with their ability to resell the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">{\u00b6 5} In September 2006, Unger filed an action against the Millers to foreclose on the judgment lien (\u201cthe foreclosure action\u201d). In response, the Millers filed counterclaims against Unger to quiet title and for slander of title and tortious interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">{\u00b6 6} In December 2006, the Warren County Court of Common Pleas vacated the default judgment against Acosta in the Warren County case. In May 2007, Unger removed the judgment lien against the property (now owned by the Millers). Unger also voluntarily dismissed the foreclosure action against the Millers without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">{\u00b6 7} Despite the resolution of Unger\u2019s foreclosure action, the Millers proceeded on their counterclaims. Ultimately, they obtained a default judgment against Unger on the claims and were awarded $25,590 in compensatory damages and $83,790 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">{\u00b6 8} Following the damages award, the Millers submitted a February 2009 filing captioned \u201csupplemental complaint\u201d asserting a claim for malicious prosecution against Unger. The filing was submitted under the same case number as Unger\u2019s foreclosure action. In the document, the Millers insisted that Unger maliciously prosecuted his foreclosure action against them based upon an invalid judgment lien. In July 2009, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. Among other terms, Unger paid the Millers $20,000 to resolve his personal liability on their malicious-prosecution claim. In September 2009, the Millers voluntarily dismissed the claim without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">{\u00b6 9} Four days later, the Millers instituted the present action against Unger asserting the same malicious-prosecution claim asserted in their supplement complaint. Unger moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted in a September 2010 entry. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Matthew Unger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">{\u00b6 11} The Millers acknowledge that one requirement for establishing their malicious-prosecution claim is the termination of Unger\u2019s foreclosure action in their favor. In challenging the trial court\u2019s decision on summary judgment, the Millers insist that Unger\u2019s foreclosure action did not end when he voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit under Civ.R. 41(A). Instead, the Milers maintain that the proceeding came to an end when they obtained a default judgment against Unger on their counterclaims. According to the Millers, this constituted a termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>of the foreclosure action in their favor and precluded summary judgment in favor of Unger on their malicious-prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">{\u00b6 12} This court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision on summary judgment de novo. <em>Burgess v. Tackas </em>(1998), 125 Ohio App.3d 294, 296, 708 N.E.2d 285. Summary judgment is proper when (1) there are no genuine issues of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can only come to a conclusion adverse to the nonmoving party, construing the evidence most strongly in that party\u2019s favor. Civ.R. 56(C). See also <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">{\u00b6 13} In order to prevail on a claim for malicious prosecution of a civil action, a plaintiff must prove the following: (1) the defendant maliciously instituted the prior proceedings against the plaintiff, (2) lack of probable cause for filing the prior lawsuit, (3) the prior proceedings terminated in the plaintiffs favor, and (4) the plaintiffs person or property was seized during the course of the prior proceedings. <em>Crawford v. Euclid Natl. Bank </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 135, 139, 19 OBR 341, 483 N.E.2d 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">{\u00b6 14} After thoroughly reviewing the procedural history related to the instant case, we find that the Millers failed to satisfy the third essential element for a malicious-prosecution claim. The default judgment on the Millers\u2019 counterclaims did not constitute a termination of Unger\u2019s foreclosure action in then-favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">{\u00b6 15} We recognize that the default judgment constituted a judgment favorable to the Millers <em>on their counterclaims. </em>But this fact alone does not render the disposition of Unger\u2019s foreclosure action favorable to the Millers. In an attempt to refute this conclusion, the Millers contend that their counterclaims \u201carose out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject of Unger\u2019s foreclosure action\u201d and that the foreclosure proceeding did not end until the trial court entered a default judgment on their counterclaims months after Unger voluntarily dismissed the action under Civ.R. 41(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">{\u00b6 16} Admittedly, Unger\u2019s foreclosure action and the Millers\u2019 counterclaims both involved the judgment lien that was later set aside. However, Unger\u2019s dismissal of the foreclosure action did not render the disposition of that action favorable to the Millers. A number of Ohio courts of appeal, including this one, have held that the voluntary dismissal of a complaint is not a termination in favor of a party who later asserts a malicious-prosecution claim. See, e.g., <em>Elite Designer Homes, Inc. v. Landmark Partners, </em>Summit App. No. 22975, 2006-Ohio-4079, 2006 WL 2270832, \u00b6 41; <em>Graff v. Ohio Valley Truss Co., </em>Highland App. No. 05CA3, 2005-Ohio-6661, 2005 WL 3441252, \u00b6 12; <em>Bayer v. Neff (Dec. </em>29, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>1995), Lake App. No. 95-L-044, 1995 WL 815845, at *4; <em>Summitville Tiles, Inc. v. Jackson </em>(Nov. 15, 1988), Columbiana App. No. 87-C-42, 1988 WL 122836, at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">{\u00b6 17} Cited by the trial court, this court articulated the same holding in <em>Wilson v. Fifth Third Bank of S. Ohio </em>(June 13, 1994), Brown App. No. CA9401-001, 1994 WL 250144:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cFifth Third\u2019s foreclosure action was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by Fifth Third, and the attachment was released only after appellants secured refinancing and paid the past due note in full. Such a dismissal is not an adjudication on the merits and does not indicate nonliability on appellants\u2019 part. Thus, where Fifth Third exercised its right to voluntarily dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 41, there was no termination in appellants\u2019 favor.\u201d Id. at *1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">{\u00b6 19} The Millers attempt to distinguish <em>Wilson </em>by arguing that the parties in that case who were pursuing the malicious-prosecution claim against Fifth Third Bank were not found to be free from liability on the note that was the subject of the underlying foreclosure action. In contrast, the Warren County court vacated the default judgment upon which Unger\u2019s judgment lien was predicated and released the lien. Unger subsequently dismissed his foreclosure action against the Millers. According to the Millers, this course of events indicates that they were never liable on the judgment lien and distinguishes the present matter from <em>Wilson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">{\u00b6 20} We find the Millers\u2019 attempt to remove the present matter from the province of <em>Wilson </em>to be unavailing. Referring to the above-quoted portion of the decision, the Millers insist that this court \u201cemphasized\u201d the fact that the dismissal of the foreclosure action by Fifth Third did not involve a finding that the borrowers were free from liability. The Millers categorize the borrowers\u2019 acknowledgment of their liability on the note as \u201ckey\u201d to our disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">{\u00b6 21} We believe that the Millers place undue emphasis on the allocation of liability in <em>Wilson </em>and decline to read the case as narrowly as they suggest. Instead, we believe that <em>Wilson </em>supports the proposition that <em>any </em>voluntary dismissal of a complaint under Civ.R. 41(A) is not a termination of the proceeding in favor of a malicious-prosecution claimant. Indeed, the allocation of liability in the underlying action <em>may </em>speak to other elements of a malicious-prosecution claim. For example, it may or may not signify whether the prior proceedings were maliciously commenced or whether probable cause supported the institution of the prior lawsuit. <em>Crawford, </em>19 Ohio St.3d at 139, 19 OBR 341, 483 N.E.2d 1168. However, in view of <em>Wilson </em>and other Ohio cases on point, a party\u2019s freedom from liability in an action that was voluntarily dismissed does not render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>the disposition of that action favorable to the party for purposes of a malicious-prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">{\u00b6 22} In sum, we hold that the voluntary dismissal of a complaint is not a termination in favor of a party who later asserts a malicious-prosecution claim. <em>Wilson </em>at 4. Furthermore, the grant of default judgment in favor of the Millers on their counterclaims did not amount to a victory on the substantive merits of Unger\u2019s foreclosure action. <em>Broadnax v. Greene Credit Serv. </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 881, 888, 694 N.E.2d 167. Accordingly, because Unger\u2019s foreclosure action did not terminate in favor of the Millers, their malicious-prosecution claim fails as a matter of law. See <em>Graff, </em>2005-Ohio-6661, 2005 WL 3441252, at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">{\u00b6 23} We conclude that the trial court properly awarded summary judgment in favor of Unger because there were no genuine issues of material fact regarding the failure of at least one of the essential elements for a malicious-prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">{\u00b6 24} The Millers\u2019 sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b748-8\">Powell, P.J., and Bressler, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
