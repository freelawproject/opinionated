Fry, filed April 2, 2010. On April 7, 2008, Fry filed a complaint against Jack L. King, following a July 4, 2006 collision between Fry\u2019s motorcycle and King\u2019s vehicle at the intersection of Route 66 and Ziegler Road in Piqua. Fry alleged that King pulled his vehicle into the southbound lane of State Route 66 from Ziegler Road as Fry approached the intersection, requiring Fry to \u201clay his motorcycle down on the roadway in order to avoid a collision, thereby causing Fry multiple injuries.\u201d Fry later amended his complaint to include Progressive Preferred Insurance Company, King\u2019s insurer, and Progressive filed a counterclaim against Fry and a cross-claim against King. Fry filed a second amended complaint against the United States, demanding that the United States \u201cset forth its claim in subrogation or for reimbursement for payments made pursuant to the Medicare program for Plaintiffs medical bills\u201d resulting from the collision. King filed a third-party complaint against Joseph Adams and Julie Adams, alleging that they had parked their white SUV along State Route 66 \u201cat a point so close to Ziegler Road as to create an obstruction for motorists using either State Route 66 or Ziegler Road.\u201d Julie Adams is Fry\u2019s daughter. King later dismissed his claims against Joseph Adams and Julie Adams. A trial to a jury resulted in a verdict in favor of King, and in response to an interrogatory, the jury determined that King was not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">{\u00b6 2} Fry testified at trial that King pulled into the intersection in front of him. He identified the skid mark left by his motorcycle in a photograph of the scene of the accident, and he estimated that it was 17 to 18 feet in length. Fry further testified that he later measured, using a \u201cwheel,\u201d the distance between the beginning of the skid mark and the center line of Ziegler Road, and that the distance was 79 feet. In other words, according to Fry, he was about 79 feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>away from King\u2019s vehicle when he began to skid. Fry stated that he was traveling between 40 and 45 miles per hour at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">{\u00b6 3} Marvin Adams, Joseph Adams, who is Marvin\u2019s brother, Julie Adams, and Jeremy Adams, Marvin\u2019s son, all of whom witnessed the accident, also testified for Fry. Marvin Adams lives at the corner of State Route 66 and Ziegler Road and was hosting a cookout for his family at the time of the accident. Each of Fry\u2019s witnesses testified that they observed King\u2019s vehicle reverse direction in the course of the accident. They also identified on a scaled drawing of the scene the placement of both vehicles as the accident progressed. Michael and Vicky Tufts, who were present to watch fireworks at a nearby location, and who also witnessed the accident, testified that King did not reverse his vehicle in the manner suggested by Fry\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">{\u00b6 4} Fry asserts one assignment of error herein as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error in permitting the defendantappellee\u2019s expert accident reconstructionist, Henry Lipian, to state his opinions when those opinions were based upon measurements of the scene of the incident that were neither \u2018perceived by the expert or admitted in evidence at the hearing\u2019 as required by Evid. Rule 703.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c \u2018In all proceedings involving matters of a scientific, mechanical, professional or other like nature, requiring special study, experience or observation not within the common knowledge of laymen, expert opinion testimony is admissible to aid the court or the jury in arriving at a correct determination of the litigated issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Huffman v. Stone </em>(1971), 26 Ohio St.2d 159,160, 55 O.O.2d 308, 270 N.E.2d 347, quoting <em>McKay Machine Co. v. Rodman </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St.2d 77, 40 O.O.2d 87, 228 N.E.2d 304, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">{\u00b6 7} Foundational requirements for admission of an expert\u2019s opinion testimony are set forth in Evid.R. 703 and 705. Evid.R. 703 provides, \u201cThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by the expert or admitted in evidence at the hearing.\u201d Evid.R. 705 provides, \u201cThe expert may testify in terms of opinion or inference and give the expert\u2019s reasons therefor after disclosure of the underlying facts <em>or </em>data. The disclosure may be in response to a hypothetical question or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cWhere an expert bases his opinion, in whole or in major part, on facts or data perceived by him, the requirement of Evid.R. 703 has been satisfied.\u201d <em>State v. Solomon </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 124, 570 N.E.2d 1118, syllabus. In <em>Solomon, </em>the trial court excluded expert testimony because the experts\u2019 opinions were based, in part, on medical and police reports not in evidence. The Supreme Court of Ohio held that the expert testimony should have been admitted because the experts had personally examined the defendant and \u201cthus, had based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>their opinions on facts or data perceived by them.\u201d Id. at 126. See also <em>State v. Hoover-Moore, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-1186, 2004-Ohio-5541, 2004 WL 2341691, \u00b6 35 (\u201cthe Ohio Supreme Court adopted a more relaxed interpretation of Evid.R. 703 in <em>[Solomon </em>]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">{\u00b6 9} By way of background, Lipian testified that he is board certified in the field of accident reconstruction by the Accreditation Commission of Traffic Accident Reconstruction. According to Lipian, \u201cAccident reconstruction is part science and it\u2019s part art. It\u2019s a process of looking at the available information and data that comes from, say police agencies, depositions, photographs, * * * analyzing the physical evidence, doing necessary follow-up work on our own to fill in gaps for information that isn\u2019t available, and then ultimately once you have enough data and information you determine how the crash occurred. * * * And part of it is basic understanding of physics and mathematics. A lot of it is analyzing the physical evidence, understanding what you\u2019re looking at and what it means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">{\u00b6 10} As Lipian began to testify regarding a drawing prepared by him and his staff that purported to depict the accident scene to scale, counsel for Fry approached the bench, and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cMR. THIEMAN: Mr. Lipian \u2014 I don\u2019t think he can compare that. He didn\u2019t scale it out. He didn\u2019t perform these things and he doesn\u2019t have personal knowledge. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cMR. RODERER: Well, I think he has personally been there. I think his staff has gone which he relies on to maintain things. I think they\u2019ve been created within the ordinary course of business and he\u2019s got everything he needs to be able to testify about the area and the scale and all the matters incidental thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cMR. THIEMAN: His report says he didn\u2019t \u2014 and he wasn\u2019t there. He said his staff went out there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-11\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cMR. RODERER: He\u2019s been there since his trip down here. You know, it\u2019s just like any other expert. Any other expert can rely on data and staff members, such as nurse\u2019s notes and things like that in a hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-12\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cMR. THIEMAN: Not in State court. Federal Court they can.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">{\u00b6 17} The court then excused the jury and allowed counsel for Fry to conduct a voir dire of Lipian as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-14\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cQ. Mr. Lipian, have you ever been to this scene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-15\">{H19}\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>{\u00b6 20} \u201cQ. When were you there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cA. Yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cQ. Was that the first time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cA. The first time that I\u2019ve personally been there, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cQ. * * * And there\u2019s snow on the ground of course?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-11\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cQ. What time of day were you there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-12\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cA. Just after sunset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-13\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cQ. So it was dark out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-14\">{130}\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-15\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-16\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cQ. But by and large the area has been covered with what, perhaps six, seven inches of snow? I might be exaggerating, it might be four or five. Something, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-17\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cA. The ground itself, the area off the road and the berm is snow covered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-18\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cQ. * * * And would it be fair to say that you were unable to take measurements of this scene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-19\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cA. I didn\u2019t need to take measurements yesterday cause my staff had already done that, so I didn\u2019t take any last night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-20\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cQ. And who on your staff took those measurements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-21\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA. Troy Hahn and Dale Meyer. They did it with a total station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-22\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-23\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cQ. And what is a total station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-24\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cA. It\u2019s [the] same instrument that a surveyor uses. In my profession we call it forensic mapping, so it\u2019s laser transit. It\u2019s where a theodolite, which is an infrared laser measuring device, is mounted on the tripod. The other person walks around with a prism pole and using the same technique that a surveyor would the scene is electronically mapped. The data is then put into an electronic data collector, brought back to our office where we can then print out the data and then we can incorporate anything else that would be done in the form of police measurements or other measurements. And I was involved in the process of rendering the scale drawing when my staff came back with the electronic measurements and they took a lot of photographs and videotape as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>{\u00b6 41} \u201cQ. * * * So this scaled drawing that we\u2019re looking at, it\u2019s got two foam boards taped together, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cQ. It was something that you had a part in preparing, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cA. Correct. Once the data collector is brought back to the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cQ. And the data upon which this drawing is based is data gathered by someone other than you, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cA. Two of my employees, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-10\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cQ. * * * You also did some friction valuation testing of the surface of the pavement, right, with a VC2000 accelerometer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-12\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-13\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cQ. And when I say you, you didn\u2019t personally do that, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-14\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cA. No, that was done by Troy Hahn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-15\">{\u00b6 52} Counsel for King then inquired as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-16\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cQ. All the things that were done to make this drawing and to measure these co-efficient defriction [sic], were they things that have been done in the ordinary course of business of your firm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-17\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cA. Yes, under my direction I told them what I wanted done, and when they brought back the electronic measurements I reviewed them in paper format as well as on the computer. This is the ordinary way we do it. I cannot always be at every scene inspection when the time is available. So my staff is all certified in the use of the total station, we\u2019re all certified forensic mapping specialists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-18\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cThe electronic measurements, it\u2019s not like if you\u2019re the hand tape [sic] where you can write down the wrong number. The data collector knows exactly where the pole is shot each time. The electronic measurements are in paper format and then I look at the format once it\u2019s done electronics [sic], and then I look at the scaled drawing and compare it with photographs. So it\u2019s not just taken in a vacuum. There\u2019s an actual process that we go through that I was involved with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-19\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cQ. What kind of qualifications does Troy Hahn have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-20\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cA. Troy Hahn is a retired Trooper from the highway patrol with 26 years of service. He is an ACTAR accredited reconstructionist. He is a certified forensic mapping specialist and an advanced certified forensic mapping specialist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>certified by Cara Corporation, which is a company that manufactures the theodolite and the total station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cQ. * * * What about the other gentleman you mentioned, Dale, was it Meyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cA. Yes. Dale Meyer has been with me for 12 years. He\u2019s a retired Sergeant from the Ohio State Highway Patrol from the Sandusky Post. He likewise is an ACTAR accredited reconstructionist. He likewise is certified by Cara Corporation as a forensic mapping specialist and an advanced forensic mapping specialist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cQ. From your personal observations of the scene, does this scaled drawing appear to fairly and accurately depict the layout of that particular stretch of roadway and all the landmarks incidental thereto?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cA. It does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cQ. And you examined photographs and video of this particular area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-10\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cA. Correct, including Google Earth satellite photographs where I could compare the geometry and the position of objects and compare it to the scaled drawing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-11\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cQ. And you personally did those things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-12\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-13\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cQ. And again, based on those investigations does the scaled drawing fairly and accurately depict the layout of this intersection and all the geographical markings thereto?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-14\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-15\">{\u00b6 68} Counsel for Fry then asked the following follow-up questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-16\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cQ. The scaled drawing that we\u2019re looking at here is based upon measurements made with a prism and so forth, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-17\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-18\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cQ. And a pole that holds up like a surveyor wuuld use, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-19\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-20\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cQ. And that was made by someone other than you, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-21\">{\u00b6 74} <em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir. Troy Hahn and Dale Meyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-22\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cQ. Yes. And those measurements are not something that you personally observed or verified, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>{\u00b6 76} \u201cA. I can verify them when they came back and it was drawn to scale, such as I said comparing it with Google Earth satellite mapping and the photographs that they took back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cQ. But you are basing it solely upon what their measurements were, because you didn\u2019t make \u2018em? Let me put it another way. You were relying upon their measurements, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cA. I\u2019m relying upon their measurements and then once the measurements are drawn to scale I can compare the accuracy of their measurements to photographs. But yes, I\u2019m relying on the actual measurements which were taken by the instrument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">{\u00b6 79} \u201cQ. And they drew it from scale based on their measurements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cA. No, they didn\u2019t draw it to scale. My draftsman and I drew it to scale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\">{\u00b6 81} \u201cQ. * * * So as far as drawing it for scale, did you draw it to scale or your draftsman or both?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-10\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cA. It\u2019s a computer assisted drafting system. So my draft[s]man\u2019s hands were on the mouse and the keyboard, I was with him, so he is the specialist in the CAD, so I sat down with him when this drawing was done. There are aspects that I wanted included, such as the dimensions of the intersection, so two of us were involved but Scott\u2019s hands were on the mouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-11\">{\u00b6 83} \u201cQ. * * * I understand that and I don\u2019t want to diminish that, but the fact of the matter is whatever that draftsman was doing, again, it was based upon measurements taken by your staff, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-12\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-13\">{\u00b6 85} \u201cQ. Now the opinions you intend to render here today are based upon those measurements; aren\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-14\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cA. In part, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-15\">{\u00b6 87} \u201cQ. Your opinions regarding speed are based upon the measurements, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-16\">{\u00b6 88} \u201cA. In part. I mean, there\u2019s photographs that were taken of a skid mark, I believe by your client, plus the deposition testimony as to where the motorcycle came to a final rest. Once it\u2019s described verbally, plotting the final rest position of the motorcycle that\u2019s in testimony on the scaled drawing became part of that process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-17\">{\u00b6 89} \u201cQ. But your opinions regarding speed were in part based upon measurements, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-18\">{\u00b6 90} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>{\u00b6 91} \u201cQ. All right. And you also said you looked at photographs and other things. I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-4\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">{\u00b6 93} \u201cQ. * * * And other of your opinions were based upon measurements, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">{\u00b6 94} \u201cA. There\u2019s really two measurements, the position and the length of the skid mark that was photographed by your client, we were able to position that on the scaled drawing based on what we could see in the photograph and then there was descriptions including icons placed on scaled drawings which were Exhibits to the depositions as to where the motorcycle came to final rest. Once the various deponents placed the motorcycle at final rest, since the drawing was to scale, I could measure the distance that the motorcycle traveled after the skid mark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">{\u00b6 95} Counsel for Fry then argued, \u201c[U]nder Rule [703] facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases his opinion or inference may be those perceived by the expert which they were not, or admitted into evidence at the hearing, and there\u2019s been no measurements admitted except the length of the skid mark that I can remember. So he can\u2019t do it based upon the [data] of others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">{\u00b6 96} Counsel for King responded, \u201cWe have one, two, three, four, five roughly, drawings created by witnesses here in the Courtroom and created by them in their depositions that Mr. Lipian has reviewed and I\u2019m gonna ask him questions on these drawings. There\u2019s not been any objection to any of these things. They\u2019ve been admitted into evidence, I guess we\u2019re not to the point where they\u2019ve been submitted yet, but there\u2019s not been any objection to any of these witnesses that * * * \u2014 we\u2019ve asked any questions about any of these things.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">{\u00b6 97} \u201c * * * Mr. Lipian has clearly explained how the document was created, he has personally verified the data by comparing it to photographs, Google Earth, he\u2019s personally visited the area. No, he\u2019s not the one that took the measurement but his staff did. They have the training to do it and he\u2019s personally verified the accuracy. So I think * * * he\u2019s certainly done everything that an expert would need to do in order to be able to testify about this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">{\u00b6 98} Counsel for Fry asserted, \u201cThe drawings that he\u2019s referring to, those large paper drawings that we\u2019ve seen all through the trial, none of which have been admitted would reflect the relative positioning of things. But there\u2019s been nobody testify that those are made to scale and they\u2019re all made by the same company, Introtech. Witnesses used them but no testimony that they\u2019re to scale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>{\u00b6 99} The court determined: \u201cI\u2019m going to permit the testimony because the scale has been verified by an independent source, and that would be the Google Earth verification. I realize that may not be the last word on accuracy, but I think it goes to the weight of the testimony and not the admissibility of it. I think the minimum threshold of admissibility has been met and the rest will go to weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">{\u00b6 100} Largely consistent with Fry\u2019s own testimony, Lipian testified that Fry\u2019s skid mark was \u201c18/6 to 19 feet long,\u201d \"with a remaining distance of \u201conly 65 feet\u201d to the alleged location of King\u2019s vehicle. Lipian opined that Fry was traveling at 41.9 miles per hour when he first applied his brakes and began to skid. Lipian further determined that the \u201ctime frame for the motorcycle from where it first began its skid mark to where it would have reached the location where [King\u2019s vehicle] would have been had it encroached into the roadway was 1.54 seconds.\u201d Lipian then \u201clooked at all these deposition Exhibits to look at the location where various deponents had placed [King\u2019s vehicle]. Those deponents had placed it within the intersection. And then I read the deposition of Mr. King and Mr. Fry.\u201d Lipian \u201cthen had to determine if there was sufficient time within some of those depositions for [King\u2019s vehicle] to move forward, encroach into the path of the motorcycle, stop, put it in reverse and back up before the motorcycle would have reached the impact location which again was 1.54 seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">{\u00b6 101} \u201cSome of the deposition Exhibits showed [King\u2019s vehicle] being extensively into the actual part of the intersection. So I looked at the time frame in conjunction with where the deponents * * * placed [King\u2019s vehicle], and then I also had to consider within the time frame available for Mr. King to basically back up and get out of the way, I had to consider his perception and response time. The time that it would take for him to identify the motorcycle, perceive its approach, decide on a course of evasive action, then stop the [vehicle], put [it] from drive into reverse, and back out of the way. And I looked at those two time frames to see if it was a probable situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">{\u00b6 102} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">{\u00b6 103} \u201c * * * Before you can actually physically act upon what you\u2019ve decided upon, you have to go through this perception response time. For a normally alert driver, paying reasonable attention to the roadway in responding to a relatively straightforward event, that time frame is 1.5 seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">{\u00b6 104} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">{\u00b6 105} \u201cThat being the case, if Mr. King began to recognize the motorcycle the instant that it came into view and at the time that it was skidding, 1.5 seconds would then only mean he was four one-hundredths of a second away from impact. Obviously four one-hundredths of a second is not enough time to move the foot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>from the accelerator to the brake, put it from drive into reverse and back out of the way before the motorcycle reaches the crash location. So some of the descriptions in the various deposition Exhibits, frankly there\u2019s nowhere near enough time for Mr. King to have perceived and reacted and taken evasive action to get out of the way. What that means is, if it had occurred the way some of these deposition Exhibits depicted, the motorcycle would have actually crashed into [Kang\u2019s vehicle].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">{\u00b6 106} Lipian then responded to hypothetical questions assuming the facts as reflected in the deposition exhibits of Jeremy Adams and Fry, and he opined that the set of assumed facts, namely that King\u2019s vehicle was in the intersection when Fry\u2019s motorcycle began to skid, did not comport with the laws of physics and that the vehicles would have collided if King\u2019s vehicle was in the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">{\u00b6 107} On redirect examination, Lipian responded affirmatively when asked whether his scaled drawing of the scene fairly and accurately depicts \u201cthe intersection based on his personal observations and [his] team\u2019s observations as well as comparisons to Google Earth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">{\u00b6 108} Fry directs our attention to <em>State v. Joseph </em>(July 24, 1985), Hamilton App. No. C-840751,1985 WL 8947, and <em>Shivers v. Cincinnati, </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP 395, 2002-Ohio-6633, 2002 WL 31722466. In <em>Joseph, </em>the defendant was indicted on three counts of sex-related offenses, and the trial court admitted the opinion testimony of a psychologist who interviewed the victim twice. Assistants of the psychologist administered tests to the victim, which were not admitted into evidence, and the assistants, one of whom was a student, did not testify. \u201cDr. Lippert conceded that his opinion \u2014 that the victim of the sexual conduct charged in the indictment is \u2018diminished, that he is limited in capacity to make decisions, * * * is mentally retarded\u2019 \u2014 was predicated upon the extensive tests performed by others.\u201d The First District determined that since records of the tests were not admitted, the defense \u201chad no opportunity to assay the tests. Admittedly, the doctor had some personal knowledge about the victim, but the doctor in testifying relied heavily upon records of tests primarily administered by others. In other words, the doctor had no personal knowledge of most of what the test results showed.\u201d The appellate court remanded the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">{\u00b6 109} In <em>Shivers, </em>the Tenth District determined that defendant\u2019s expert-witness testimony regarding the adequacy of security in a dormitory lacked a proper foundation when the expert \u201cexplicitly testified he based his opinion on his interviews with the head of the residence halls and the campus chief of police. Neither the head of residence halls nor the campus chief of police testified at trial, and no deposition testimony concerning their conversations with defendant\u2019s expert was admitted at trial. As a result, the university\u2019s expert based his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>opinion on facts or data not admitted at trial. Moreover, the university\u2019s expert admitted he did not visit Daniels Hall prior to rendering his opinion, so his opinion could not have been based in whole, or in major part, on facts or data perceived by him.\u201d 2002-Ohio-6633, 2002 WL 31722466, at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">{\u00b6 110} King relies upon <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>Columbiana App. No. 05 CO 63, 2008-Ohio-1525, 2008 WL 850179, in which the Seventh District determined that an autopsy report is admissible as a business record of the coroner\u2019s office even though no employee of that office made the report. A physician at the Cuyahoga County Coroner\u2019s Office prepared the autopsy report, while a Columbiana County Coroner testified at trial. \u201cHe stated that upon learning of the victim\u2019s death, he sent an investigator to the crime scene who examined the body, took photographs and arranged to have the body transported to Cuyahoga County for a forensic autopsy. * * * He explained that his office has a contract with the Cuyahoga County Coroner\u2019s Office to perform forensic autopsies. * * * [He] testified that he received the autopsy report and autopsy photographs from Cuyahoga County in the regular course of business.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 94. Mitchell objected to the admissibility of the autopsy report in the absence of the testimony of the physician at the Cuyahoga County Coroner\u2019s Office and to the testimony of the Columbiana County Coroner, asserting that the \u201creport is testimonial in nature and thus is inadmissible hearsay where the declarant failed to testify.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 98. Alternatively, Mitchell asserted that, if the report is ruled nontestimonial, the state failed to qualify it as a business record. The Seventh District determined that the autopsy report was a business record and not hearsay in reliance upon Evid.R. 803(6). Id. at \u00b6 106-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">{\u00b6 111} We agree with King and Progressive that Lipian\u2019s opinion testimony was properly admitted. In contrast to the expert in <em>Joseph, </em>Lipian did not rely \u201cheavily\u201d nor exclusively upon the measurements taken by Hahn and Meyer; he independently verified the accuracy of those measurements, by means of Google Earth, by reviewing photographs and by his own personal observations at the scene. In <em>Shivers, </em>the expert witness\u2019s opinion was based on facts or data not admitted at trial, namely his interviews with the head of the residence halls and the campus chief of police, and it was not based upon any facts or data perceived by the expert. King\u2019s reliance upon <em>Mitchell </em>is also misplaced; Mitchell objected to the hearsay nature of the autopsy report, and the Seventh District admitted the report as a business record pursuant to Evid.R. 803(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">{\u00b6 112} We further agree with the trial court that the extent to which Lipian verified the measurements that form the basis of his opinions is an issue going to the weight to be given to his opinion and not to its competence or admissibility. As shown above, Lipian explained the bases for his opinions at length, revealing that he personally verified the facts or data at issue by means of Google Earth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>by review of photographs and video, and by on-scene observation, thereby enabling the jury to evaluate the weight to be given to his opinion. Significantly, Lipian\u2019s testimony that the skid mark was <em>l&amp;k </em>to 19 feet in length and that the \u25a0remaining distance to the intersection from the skid mark was 65 feet is supported by Fry\u2019s testimony that the skid mark was 17 to 18 feet and that the distance from its beginning to the center line of Ziegler Road was 79 feet. As in <em>Solomon, </em>Lipian\u2019s testimony was admissible. Since Lipian\u2019s testimony was properly admitted, his sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b740-6\">Grady, P.J., and Froelich, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b740-7\">Grady, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AHU\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">{\u00b6 113} Evid.R. 703 states: \u201cThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by the expert or admitted in evidence at the hearing.\u201d The complementary provisions of Evid.R. 705 state: \u201cThe expert may testify in terms of opinion or inference and give the expert\u2019s reasons therefor after disclosure of the underlying facts or data.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">{\u00b6 114} Defendant-appellee King\u2019s accident-reconstruction expert, Henry Lipian, indicated that he intended to offer an opinion concerning causation. Lipian testified that he used measurements of the accident scene that were taken by his two assistants to prepare a diagram of the accident scene on which his opinion was based, and which defendant-appellee King intended to also offer in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">{\u00b6 115} Plaintiff-appellant, Fry, objected, arguing that because the measurements made by Lipian\u2019s assistants were not admitted in evidence, Lipian\u2019s proposed testimony concerning causation based on those measurements was inadmissible pursuant to Evid.R. 703. In that event, neither could the diagram based on those measurements be offered in evidence through Lipian\u2019s testimony, because his reliance on his assistants\u2019 measurements was hearsay. Evid.R. 801 and 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">{\u00b6 116} In a voir dire examination, and with respect to his own perceptions, Lipian testified that he visited the scene of the accident the night before, adding: \u201cI didn\u2019t take any measurements yesterday cause my staff had already done that, so I didn\u2019t take any last night.\u201d Lipian explained that \u201cit was probably dark\u201d when he visited the accident scene. Lipian testified that he would rely instead on photographs and a video of the area, \u201cincluding Google Earth satellite photographs where I could compare the geometry and the position of objects and compare it to the scaled drawing\u201d prepared from his assistants\u2019 measurements.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>{\u00b6 117} The court overruled Fry\u2019s Evid.R. 703 objection and permitted Lipian to testify on the basis of the diagram exhibit he prepared from the measurements taken by his assistants, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">{\u00b6 118} \u201cI\u2019m going to permit the testimony because the scale has been verified by an independent source, and that would be the Google Earth verification. I realize that may not be the last word on accuracy, but I think it goes to the weight of the testimony and not the admissibility of it. I think the minimum threshold of admissibility has been met and the rest will go to weight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">{\u00b6 119} Lipian disclaimed any reliance on his visit to the scene of the accident as a basis for his opinion. The trial court placed no reliance on it, and neither should we. Lipian\u2019s reliance on photographs and videos admitted in evidence is problematic, to the extent that he compared them to the diagram prepared from his assistants\u2019 measurements to arrive at an opinion. Instead, Lipian relied on Google Earth to verify those measurements, and the trial court held that Evid.R. 703 was satisfied on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">{\u00b6 120} Evid.R. 703 contains no provision for verification of facts or data not admitted in evidence. To do that, the expert must rely on facts or data he perceived, the alternative grounds for admissibility in Evid.R. 703. Consistent with Evid.R. 602, those perceptions must be the expert\u2019s \u201cfirsthand perceptions.\u201d Weissenberger, Ohio Evidence Treatise (2010 Ed.), Section 703.1. Lipian\u2019s firsthand perceptions were of Google Earth, not the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">{\u00b6 121} As it was employed by Lipian, Google Earth is a technical procedure on which Lipian based his testimony. Lipian\u2019s reliance on that procedure is governed by Evid.R. 702(B)(1), (2), and (3), which impose tests formulated in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469, for the court\u2019s determination of the expert\u2019s qualifications and the reliability of any tests or procedures he performed, not the admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony. No evidence was offered demonstrating that Google Earth satisfies the requirements of Evid.R. 702(B), and the court made no findings that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">{\u00b6 122} Evid.R. 703 is a rule of admissibility and is concerned with adjudicative facts: \u201cfacts or data * * * perceived by the expert or admitted in evidence at the hearing.\u201d Further, and unlike the standards in Evid.R. 702(B) regarding qualifications of the expert and the reliability of tests and procedures he performs, which involve a degree of deference by the court, the standards for admissibility imposed by Evid.R. 703 are narrow and specific. The two rules and their concepts should not be confused in their application to cause the court to defer to an expert\u2019s pronouncements in determining whether the adjudicative facts on which the expert relies satisfy the admissibility requirements of Evid.R. 703. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Imwinkelreid, The \u2018Bases\u2019 of Expert Testimony: The Syllogistic Structure Of Scientific Testimony (1998), 67 N.C. L.Rev.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">{\u00b6 123} A technical procedure the expert performed may qualify as firsthand knowledge when the procedure was found to satisfy the requirements of Evid.R. 702(B). <em>State v. Minor </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 22, 546 N.E.2d 1343. However, in the present case, no such finding was made concerning Lipian\u2019s use of Google Earth. Instead, the court accepted Lipian\u2019s reliance on the Google Earth procedure, based on nothing more than the fact of that reliance, to find that the admissibility requirements of Evid.R. 703 were satisfied. In so doing, the court applied the deferential standard in Evid.R. 702 to an admissibility issue under Evid.R. 703, which instead imposes a narrow and strict standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">{\u00b6 124} The trial court erred when it overruled Fry\u2019s objection to Lipian\u2019s testimony based on the measurements performed by his assistants because Lipian verified those measurements using Google Earth. Nevertheless, an error in the admission of evidence is not a basis for setting aside a verdict \u201cunless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d Civ.R. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">{\u00b6 125} I agree with the majority that Lipian\u2019s alternative reliance on Fry\u2019s own testimony concerning the speed at which his motorcycle was traveling and the measurements of the skid marks it left comfortably support the reasons Lipian gave for his opinion that King could not have backed his vehicle out of the intersection, as Fry claimed King had, in the time available to him to do that. Just as damaging to Fry\u2019s negligence claim, and perhaps even more damaging, was Lipian\u2019s stated opinion that Fry could not have laid his motorcycle down to avoid colliding with King\u2019s vehicle, as Fry said he did, because the physical principle of gyroscopic procession would have prevented that from happening. Any error in overruling Fry\u2019s objection concerning Lipian\u2019s reliance on the measurements his assistants performed was therefore harmless. Civ.R. 61. I would affirm the judgment for King on that basis.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b742-8\">Froelich, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AoNQ\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">{\u00b6 126} I concur with Judge Donovan that the expert\u2019s testimony was admissible because he verified the measurements that were taken by his staff. I also concur with Judge Grady that this verification could not be by means of Google Earth, but I find the record sufficient to support a finding that the expert, by examining photographs that were admitted and his personal view of the scene, could render his own opinion without relying on the independent measurements of his staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">{\u00b6 127} Appellee argues that the staff measurements were admissible as business records pursuant to Evid. R. 803(6). Appellee\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number><em>Mitchell, </em>Seventh District No. 05CO63, 2008-Ohio-1525, 2008 WL 850179, is questionable in fight of that district\u2019s subsequent opinion in <em>State v. Lanier, </em>Mahoning App. No. 09 MA 97, 2010-Ohio-6382, 2010 WL 5541690, which took account of <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts </em>(2009), 557 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314. Such a broad reading, especially when the data was collected in anticipation of litigation, could eviscerate Evid.R. 703, which requires personal observation or that the factual basis of the opinion otherwise be admitted into evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
