Howcroft, appeals the April 9, 2010 and April 22, 2010 judgment entries of the Fairfield County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Plaintiff-appellant, Fred A. Howcroft, and defendant-appellee, Wanda J. Howcroft, married on February 13, 1993. No children were born as issue of the marriage. The marriage was a second marriage for appellant and a third marriage for appellee. Appellant was born on February 10, 1941. At the time of the divorce, appellant was 68 years old. Appellee was born on October 18, 1952. At the time of the divorce, appellee was 57 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant\u2019s first divorce was final on December 23, 1989. As part of the divorce, appellant\u2019s first wife paid appellant for his portion of the marital residence, in the amount of $29,000. On June 29,1991, appellant used the $29,000 as a down payment to purchase a house in Stoutsville, Ohio, for $82,000. Appellant pm-chased the home in his name only.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">{\u00b6 4} In 1991, appellant and appellee moved in together at the Stoutsville home. As stated above, appellant and appellee were married in 1993. The Stoutsville home was the marital residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">{\u00b6 5} At the time of the marriage, appellant was employed as a schoolteacher. He had been a teacher for 41 years before retiring from the profession in 2004. Appellant draws pension benefits in the amount of $4,436.43 gross per month. After deductions, including health insurance for the parties, his net benefit was $3,187.36. Prior to marriage and relevant to this appeal, appellant owned a tax-sheltered annuity opened under Section 403(B), Title 26, U.S.Code, and a Prudential account worth $29,324.67 on June 30,1993. Appellant rolled the funds into a Raymond James individual retirement account (\u201cIRA\u201d) valued at $69,127.46 in 2009. Appellant contributed $100 per month to the Raymond James IRA until 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">{\u00b6 6} The parties lived a frugal lifestyle. They had minimal living and entertainment expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">{\u00b6 7} Appellee had a high school education, and she was previously employed as an administrator in a medical office. On August 25, 1996, appellee suffered a stroke. Appellee recovered from the stroke but suffered residual effects such as speech aphasia, difficulty writing, and problems concentrating and multitasking. After the stroke, appellant took off a semester from his teaching position to assist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>appellee with her recovery. Appellant told appellee that she did not have to return to work after her stroke. Appellee has not earned an income since 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">{\u00b6 8} After appellee\u2019s stroke, appellant stated that he moved to another bedroom to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">{\u00b6 9} In 1997, appellant transferred an interest in the Stoutsville home to appellee. A survivorship deed granting appellant and appellee one-half interest in the Stoutsville home was recorded on May 8, 1997. Appellant stated that he transferred a one-half interest in the home to appellee for estate-planning purposes only in that he wanted the house to go to appellee if he died. He was not considering divorce at the time of the transfer. Appellant refinanced the home in 1998. At the time of the refinance, the home was appraised at $118,000. In 2008, the home was appraised at $135,000. In 2009, the mortgage payoff amount was $17,038.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">{\u00b6 10} In 2003, appellant was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He received radiation treatment to combat the cancer. At that time, appellant stated that he moved to the basement of their home. Appellee testified that while appellant slept in different rooms, she often slept with him in whichever room he was sleeping. Appellant states that by 2003, the parties had ceased communicating directly and communicated only through notes. Appellant states that appellee was not completing her \u201cwifely duties,\u201d such as cleaning the home and cooking meals. The parties still engaged in sexual relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant filed a complaint for divorce on August 30, 2007. Appellant did not vacate the marital residence until December 2008. In February 2008, appellant delivered two wedding-anniversary cards to appellee, and the parties engaged in sexual relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">{\u00b6 12} There was no temporary spousal support ordered during the pendency of the divorce because the parties were still residing in the same home. In order to meet her living expenses, appellee used an AT &amp; T Universal credit card that the court ordered be paid by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">{\u00b6 13} The matter came on for hearing before the magistrate on April 16, 2009. The magistrate issued her decision on September 4, 2009. The magistrate made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe Magistrate finds that the duration of the marriage is February 14, 1993 until April 16, 2009. O.R.C. 3105.171(A)(2)(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-13\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe Magistrate finds that the Plaintiff has traced $30,000 separate property contribution in the real estate [marital residence]. The Magistrate finds that the remaining value of the real estate is a marital asset subject to division.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>{\u00b6 17} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cFrom the evidence presented, the Magistrate finds that the Raymond James IRA account is both separate and marital. The Plaintiffs separate property portion of the Raymond James IRA is valued at $29,324.67. The remaining balance of the Raymond James IRA is marital property subject to division.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe Magistrate finds that the debts to the AT <em>&amp; </em>T Universal card, the Kohls card and the Sears card are marital in nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">{\u00b621}\u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe Magistrate finds, based on the evidence presented, that the Defendant is unable to return to her prior employment. However, the evidence was insufficient to determine that the Defendant is completely disabled and unable to work. For purposes of determining spousal support, the Magistrate finds that the Defendant is capable of earning at the most a minimum wage income based on the evidence presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">{\u00b624} \u201cBased on the foregoing findings, the Magistrate finds that it is reasonable and appropriate to order the Plaintiff to pay spousal support to the Defendant in the amount of $1250.00 per month, plus processing charge. * * * The spousal support ordered shall continue for an indefinite duration, but shall terminate upon the death of either party, the marriage of the Defendant, or the cohabitation of the Defendant with an unrelated male.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">{\u00b6 25} Appellant filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. On April 9, 2010, the trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision. The final decree of divorce was filed on April 22, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">{\u00b6 26} It is from these decisions that appellant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b348-15\">{\u00b6 27} Appellant raises seven assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-16\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cI. What is required of a magistrate in rendering a decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-17\">{\u00b629} \u201cII. What standard of review is imposed upon the trial judge in reviewing objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-18\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cIII. Did the trial court err/abuse its discretion when it found the duration of the marriage to be from February 13, 1993 through the date of trial, April 16, 2009?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>{\u00b6 31} \u201cIV. Did the trial court err/abuse its discretion when it found the residence at 10420 Sixteenth Road, Stoutsville, Ohio to be marital property and awarded wife one-half (1/2) of its fair market value over $30,000.00 traced to appellant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cV. Did the trial court err/abuse its discretion by ordering spousal support in the amount of $1250.00 per month for an indefinite duration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cVI. Did the trial court err/abuse its discretion when it found more than $13,000.00 of the Raymond James IRA was marital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cVII. Did the trial court err in requiring plaintiff to pay the AT <em>&amp; </em>T Universal card in its entirety?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">{\u00b6 35} Appellant argues in his first assignment of error that the magistrate\u2019s decision was insufficient for the trial court to independently analyze the conclusions reached by the magistrate. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">{\u00b6 36} Appellant states that the magistrate\u2019s decision contains no facts to support the magistrate\u2019s conclusions. The magistrate\u2019s decision consists of 77 findings of fact. We have reviewed the transcript of the trial held before the magistrate on April 16, 2009, and we find that the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact accurately represent the evidence elucidated at the one-day trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">{\u00b6 37} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">{\u00b6 38} Appellant contends in his second assignment of error that the trial court failed to conduct an independent analysis of the magistrate\u2019s decision pursuant to Civ.R. 53. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">{\u00b6 39} Civ.R. 53(D) regulates proceedings before magistrates. Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d) states: \u201cIf one or more objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision are timely filed, the court shall rule on those objections. In ruling on objections, the court shall undertake an independent review as to the objected matters to ascertain that the magistrate has properly determined the factual issues and appropriately applied the law. Before so ruling, the court may hear additional evidence but may refuse to do so unless the objecting party demonstrates that the party could not, with reasonable diligence, have produced that evidence for consideration by the magistrate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">{\u00b6 40} The trial court filed its judgment entry overruling appellant\u2019s objections on April 9, 2010. The judgment entry stated that the trial court reviewed the magistrate\u2019s decision and the transcript of the hearing. The trial court deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>mined the magistrate\u2019s decision was well reasoned and based upon sufficient, credible evidence. The trial court further found that the magistrate found appellee to be more credible than appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 41} Appellant argues that the judgment entry shows that the trial court failed to engage in an independent review of the objections. Appellant relies on <em>Nolte v. Nolte </em>(1978), 60 Ohio App.2d 227, 14 O.O.3d 215, 396 N.E.2d 807, for the proposition that a trial court may not \u201crubber stamp\u201d a magistrate\u2019s decision. <em>Nolte </em>held that a trial court judge cannot adopt a magistrate\u2019s decision unless he or she has independently analyzed the case and cannot do so unless the magistrate\u2019s decision contains findings of facts to support the basis of the magistrate\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">{\u00b6 42} As we found above, the magistrate\u2019s decision contained 77 findings of fact that accurately represented the evidence presented at trial. These findings of fact were sufficient to allow the trial court to independently analyze the magistrate\u2019s conclusions so it could rule upon appellant\u2019s objections under Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">{\u00b6 43} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">{\u00b6 44} In appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, appellant states that the trial court abused its discretion in determining the termination date of the parties\u2019 marriage to be April 16, 2009, the date of trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">{\u00b6 45} R.C. 3105.171(A)(2) provides that except when the court determines that it would be inequitable, the date of the final hearing is usually the date of termination of the marriage. <em>Combs v. Combs, </em>Stark App. No. 2008CA00169, 2009-Ohio-1683, 2009 WL 943965, \u00b621. Thus, R.C. 3105.171(A)(2) creates a statutory presumption that the proper date for the termination of a marriage, for purposes of the division of marital property, is the date of the final divorce hearing. <em>Bowen v. Bowen </em>(1999), 132 Ohio App.3d 616, 630, 725 N.E.2d 1165. However, the trial court has broad discretion in choosing the appropriate marriage-termination date, and this decision cannot be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. See <em>Berish v. Berish </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 318, 321, 23 O.O.3d 296, 432 N.E.2d 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">{\u00b6 46} R.C. 3105.171 establishes an alternative date for determining what is marital property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-12\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c(A) As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-13\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>{\u00b6 49} \u201c(2) \u2018During the marriage\u2019 means whichever of the following is applicable:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c(a) Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section, the period of time from the date of the marriage through the date of the final hearing in an action for divorce or in an action for legal separation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c(b) If the court determines that the use of either or both of the dates specified in division (A)(2)(a) of this section would be inequitable, the court may select dates that it considers equitable in determining marital property. If the court selects dates that it considers equitable in determining marital property, \u2018during the marriage\u2019 means the period of time between those dates selected and specified by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 52} Courts, however, should be reluctant to use a de facto termination of marriage date unless the evidence clearly and bilaterally shows that it is appropriate based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>Boggs v. Boggs, </em>Delaware App. No. 07 CAF 02 0014, 2008-Ohio-1411, 2008 WL 795305, \u00b6 66, citing <em>Day v. Day </em>(1988), 40 Ohio App.3d 155, 158, 532 N.E.2d 201; <em>Stafinsky v. Stafinsky </em>(1996), 116 Ohio App.3d 781, 689 N.E.2d 112; <em>Schneider v. Schneider </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 487, 674 N.E.2d 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">{\u00b6 53} Generally, the trial court has broad discretion in choosing the appropriate marriage-termination date, and this decision cannot be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Boggs, </em>citing <em>Berish v. Berish, </em>69 Ohio St.2d 318, 321, 23 O.O.3d 296, 432 N.E.2d 183. \u201cThe abuse-of-discretion standard is based upon the principle that a trial court must have the discretion in domestic relations matters to do what is equitable given the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Jefferies v. Stanzak </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 176, 179, 733 N.E.2d 305, citing <em>Booth v. Booth </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 142, 144, 541 N.E.2d 1028. Therefore, in order to find an abuse of discretion, there must be a determination that the trial court\u2019s judgment is \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">{\u00b6 54} Upon review of the transcript in this case, we cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in selecting the appropriate marriage-termination date as April 16, 2009. While appellant argues that the marriage was over in 1995 when appellant moved to the second bedroom, or in 2003 when appellant moved to the basement, under the facts and circumstances of this case, we find that there was contrary evidence presented that the parties still engaged in a relationship as late as 2008, after appellant filed his complaint for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">{\u00b6 55} Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">{\u00b6 56} Appellant argues in his fourth and sixth assignments of error that the trial court abused its discretion in determining the status of certain property as separate or marital. Specifically, appellant states that the trial court erred when it designated the Stoutsville home and the Raymond James IRA as marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">{\u00b6 57} The characterization of property as separate or marital is a mixed question of law and fact, and the trial court\u2019s ruling must be supported by sufficient credible evidence. <em>Globokar v. Globokar, </em>Stark App. No. 2009CA00138, 2010-Ohio-1737, 2010 WL 1553564, \u00b6 13, citing <em>Barkley v. Barkley </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 155, 159, 694 N.E.2d 989. The party seeking to establish an asset as separate property has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, to trace the asset to separate property. We will not reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment as being against the manifest weight of the evidence if some competent, credible evidence supports the court\u2019s judgment. <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\"> {\u00b6 58} However, even if the court has determined that property is separate, it has discretion to distribute the property as it deems equitable. <em>Lee v. Lee, </em>Licking App. No. 2008CA112, 2009-0hio-5250, 2009 WL 3155054, \u00b6 85-87, citing <em>Cherry v. Cherry </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 348, 20 O.O.3d 318, 421 N.E.2d 1293. Accordingly, an appellate court is limited to a determination of whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion in dividing the property. <em>Holcomb v. Holcomb </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 128, 131, 541 N.E.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">{\u00b6 59} R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(a) defines \u201cmarital property\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">{\u00b6 60} \u201c(i) All real and personal property that currently is owned by either or both of the spouses, including, but not limited to, the retirement benefits of the spouses, and that was acquired by either or both of the spouses during the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">(\u00b6 61} \u201c(ii) All interest that either or both of the spouses currently has in any real or personal property, including, but not limited to, the retirement benefits of the spouses, and that was acquired by either or both of the spouses during the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-11\">{\u00b6 62} \u201c(Hi) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all income and appreciation on separate property, due to the labor, monetary, or in-kind contribution of either or both of the spouses that occurred during the marriage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>{\u00b6 63} R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(a) defines separate property as \u201c(ii) Any real or personal property or interest in real or personal property that was acquired by one spouse prior to the date of the marriage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">{\u00b6 64} However, \u201c[t]he commingling of separate property with other property of any type does not destroy the identity of the separate property as separate property, except when the separate property is not traceable.\u201d R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(b). Therefore, traceability is central when determining whether separate property has \u201clost its separate character\u201d after being commingled with marital property. <em>Peck v. Peck </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 731, 734, 645 N.E.2d 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">A. STOUTSVILLE HOME</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">{\u00b6 65} Appellant first argues that the trial court erred in designating the Stoutsville home as marital property. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">{\u00b6 66} There is no dispute that at the time appellant purchased the Stoutsville home it was separate and premarital property. Appellant used $29,000 received from his previous home as the down payment on the Stoutsville home. The parties moved into the home together in 1991 and were married in 1993. On May 8, 1997, appellant executed a survivorship deed giving appellee one-half interest in the Stoutsville home. Appellant testified at trial as to the transfer of the interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cQ. What events were going on in your life approximately this time that prompted you to deed this property to Wanda in survivorship?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cA. Wanda had a stroke and I thought if anything happened to me and I got killed or anything like that, I would like to have the house go to her if I died.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-11\">{\u00b6 69} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-12\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cA.

Now, when you said that to yourself, were you intending that for all purposes, if she divorced you, as well as if you died, or just if you died?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-14\">{\u00b6 72} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-15\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cA.

The trial court traced $30,000, the approximate value of the down payment on the Stoutsville home, as appellant\u2019s separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">{\u00b6 85} A spouse can convert separate property into marital property by making an inter vivos gift to his or her spouse. <em>Helton v. Helton </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 683, 685, 683 N.E.2d 1157. To prove that an inter vivos gift has been made, the following elements are required: (1) an intention on the part of the donor to transfer the title and right of possession of the particular property to the donee then and there and (2), in pursuance of such intention, a delivery by the donor to the donee of the subject matter of the gift to the extent practicable or possible, considering its nature, with relinquishment of ownership, dominion and control over it. Id. at 685-686.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cThe donee has the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the donor made an <em>inter vivos </em>gift.\u201d Id. at 686, 683 N.E.2d 1157. Clear and convincing evidence is that evidence \u201cwhich will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u201d <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">{\u00b6 87} The fact that both parties\u2019 names are on the deed is not determinative of whether the property is marital or separate, but such evidence may be considered on the issue. R.C. 3105.171(H) and <em>Gibson v. Gibson, </em>Tuscarawas App. No. 2006 AP 01 0009, 2007-Ohio-2087, 2007 WL 1248424. See also <em>Gearhart v. Gearhart, </em>Richland App. No. 2007CA0026, 2008-Ohio-23, 2008 WL 62286 (finding that the execution of a joint-survivorship deed and the testimony of the donor husband that half of the property was to be given to the donee wife as a result of the transfer, without any limitation or restriction, supported the trial court\u2019s decision that the transfer of interest in the property was an inter vivos gift).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>{\u00b6 88} A review of the record in this case results in a different conclusion than that reached by the trial court or our decision in <em>Gearhart. </em>In this case, appellant testified that he made the transfer of the property for estate-planning purposes so that appellee would have a future expectancy interest in the property, as opposed to a present possessory interest. It was the appellee\u2019s burden to show by clear and convincing evidence a donative intent on the part of appellant. A review of the record shows that appellee provided no evidence that appellant\u2019s transfer of the proper was an inter vivos gift. See <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>Muskingum App. Nos. CT2003-0008 and CT2003-0020, 2004-Ohio-408, 2004 WL 193041 (wife failed to show donative intent on the husband\u2019s part when the wife\u2019s name was placed on deeds).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 89} Because appellee failed to meet her evidentiary burden on this issue, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in holding that the Stoutsville home was marital property rather than separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 90} Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">B. RAYMOND JAMES IRA</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">{\u00b6 91} Appellant argues in his sixth assignment of error that the trial court erred in finding that the marital portion of the Raymond James IRA exceeded $13,200. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">{\u00b6 92} Appellant argues that the valuation of the account was affected by the trial court\u2019s erroneous determination of the termination date of the marriage. As we found in appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, the trial court correctly found the termination date of the marriage to be April 16, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">{\u00b6 93} A review of the record shows no error in the trial court\u2019s determination of the marital and separate value of the Raymond James IRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">{\u00b6 94} Appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">{\u00b6 95} Appellant argues in his fifth assignment of error that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding appellee indefinite spousal support in the amount of $1,250 per month. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">{\u00b6 96} Pursuant to R.C. 3105.18(B), a trial court may award reasonable spousal support to either party upon request and after the court determines the division or disbursement of property under R.C. 3105.171.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">{\u00b6 97} In determining whether spousal support is appropriate and reasonable, and in determining the nature, amount, terms of payment, and duration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>spousal support, R.C. 3105.18(C)(1) directs the trial court to consider all 14 factors set forth therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 98} \u201c(a) The income of the parties, from all sources, including, but not limited to, income derived from property divided, disbursed, or distributed under section 3105.171 of the Revised Code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">{\u00b6 99} \u201c(b) The relative earning abilities of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">{\u00b6 100} \u201c(c) The ages and the physical, mental, and emotional conditions of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">{\u00b6 101} \u201c(d) The retirement benefits of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">(\u00b6 102} \u201c(e) The duration of the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">{\u00b6 103} \u201c(f) The extent to which it would be inappropriate for a party, because that party will be custodian of a minor child of the marriage, to seek employment outside the home;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">{\u00b6 104} \u201c(g) The standard of living of the parties established during the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-12\">{\u00b6 105} \u201c(h) The relative extent of education of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-13\">{\u00b6 106} \u201c(i) The relative assets and liabilities of the parties, including but not limited to any court-ordered payments by the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-14\">{\u00b6 107} \u201c(j) The contribution of each party to the education, training, or earning ability of the other party, including, but not limited to, any party\u2019s contribution to the acquisition of a professional degree of the other party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-15\">{\u00b6 108} \u201c(k) The time and expense necessary for the spouse who is seeking spousal support to acquire education, training, or job experience so that the spouse will be qualified to obtain appropriate employment, provided the education, training, or job experience, and employment is, in fact, sought;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-16\">{\u00b6 109} \u201c(1) The tax consequences, for each party, of an award of spousal support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-17\">{\u00b6 110} \u201c(m) The lost income production capacity of either party that resulted from that party\u2019s marital responsibilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-18\">{\u00b6 111} \u201c(n) Any other factor that the court expressly finds to be relevant and equitable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-19\">{\u00b6 112} In addition, R.C. 3105.18(C)(2) states that in determining whether spousal support is reasonable and in determining the amount and terms of payment of spousal support, each party shall be considered to have contributed equally to the production of marital income.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>{\u00b6 113} Trial courts must consider all the factors listed in R.C. 3105.18(C). However, this court has previously held that a trial court need not acknowledge all evidence relative to each and every factor listed in R.C. 3105.18(C), and we may not assume that the evidence was not considered. <em>Hutta v. Hutta, </em>177 Ohio App.3d 414, 2008-Ohio-3756, 894 N.E.2d 1282, \u00b6 27, citing <em>Clendening v. Clendening, </em>Stark App. No. 2005CA00086, 2005-Ohio-6298, 2005 WL 3150321, at \u00b6 16, citing <em>Barron v. Barron, </em>Stark App. No. 2002CA00239, 2003-Ohio-649, 2003 WL 294353. The trial court need set forth only sufficient detail to enable a reviewing court to determine the appropriateness of the award. Id., citing <em>Kaechele v. Kaechele </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 93, 518 N.E.2d 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">{\u00b6 114} As an initial matter, we find that the trial court\u2019s decision includes sufficient information regarding the 14 factors to enable us to assess whether the award is fair, equitable, and in accordance with the law. We note that an award of spousal support will be reversed on appeal only if an abuse of discretion is shown. <em>Bechtol v. Bechtol </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 21, 24, 550 N.E.2d 178. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or judgment; rather, it implies that the court\u2019s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. A reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court unless, considering the totality of circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Holcomb v. Holcomb </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 128, 131, 541 N.E.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 115} Upon the evidence presented in the record, we can find no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in determining the spousal-support award. The Ohio Supreme Court held in <em>Kunkle v. Kunkle </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 64, 554 N.E.2d 83, at paragraph one of the syllabus: \u201cExcept in cases involving a marriage of long duration, parties of advanced age or a homemaker-spouse with little opportunity to develop meaningful employment outside the home, where a payee spouse has the resources, ability and potential to be self-supporting, an award of sustenance alimony should provide for the termination of the award, within a reasonable time and upon a date certain, in order to place a definitive limit upon the parties\u2019 rights and responsibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">{\u00b6 116} This case does not involve a long-term marriage; however, there are other circumstances in this case to support the trial court\u2019s decision as to the amount and duration of spousal support. The trial testimony from appellant and appellee showed that when appellee suffered her stroke in 1996, it was sufficiently severe that appellant took off a semester from his teaching position to care for appellee. Appellant testified that he felt after the stroke that appellee could not return to work. Appellee has not earned an income and has been financially reliant upon appellant since 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>{\u00b6 117} The trial court imputed a minimum-wage income to appellee. After the divorce, appellee will be responsible for her own health insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">{\u00b6 118} Appellant argues in his brief that at the age of 68, \u201che will be not be living much longer\u201d and he should be allowed to enjoy the last years of his life with what little he earned. There was no evidence at trial to point to appellant\u2019s near demise, but there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s decision on spousal support. We find that the trial court considered the factors listed in R.C. 3105.18(C) and did not abuse its discretion in determining spousal support as to the amount and indefinite duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">{\u00b6 119} Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">{\u00b6 120} Appellant argues in his final assignment of error that he should not be responsible for charges incurred on the AT <em>&amp; </em>T Universal card during the pendency of the divorce. During the pendency of the divorce, the trial court did not award temporary spousal support. Appellee used the AT &amp; T Universal card for her living expenses and the trial court had ordered that appellant be responsible for the card during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">{\u00b6 121} In the magistrate\u2019s decision as adopted by the trial court, the trial court found the debts on the AT &amp; T Universal card to be marital in nature and ordered appellant to pay and hold appellant harmless on the card with a balance of $14,538.38. The trial court further ordered that the account be closed and any further charges after the date of the magistrate\u2019s decision be divided equally between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">{\u00b6 122} Upon review of the evidence presented, we cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in its evaluation of the marital debt. Further, appellant\u2019s argument in his brief on this issue extends the brief beyond 30 pages to the 31st page. Pursuant to Local App.R. 9(C), appellant\u2019s brief is not to exceed 30 pages unless upon a motion requesting an increase in the number of pages and good cause shown. The record shows that no such motion was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">{\u00b6 123} Appellant\u2019s seventh assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">{\u00b6 124} Accordingly, the judgment of the Fairfield County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, is affirmed in part and reversed in part. The matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b358-14\">Farmer, P.J., and Wise, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
