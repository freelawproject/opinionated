John claims that the trial court erred in finding that the modification was barred because the inheritance Lisa received from her parents was a change in circumstances that was contemplated at the time of the original decree. For the reasons set forth below, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">{\u00b6 2} John and Lisa were divorced on January 31, 2007, after 26 years of marriage. John was 49 years old at the time, and Lisa was 51. Their two children were emancipated. The divorce was resolved by agreement with the judgment entry incorporating the terms stated in the \u201cAgreement &amp; Stipulation of the Parties,\u201d filed on December 8, 2006 (\u201cthe stipulation\u201d). The stipulation provided for the division of all real and personal property, vehicles, bank accounts, retirement plans, and debts. It also provided for the payment of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">{\u00b6 3} At the time John filed for divorce in June 2006, he was earning approximately $160,000 per year as a sales manager, and Lisa was working part-time for $7.50 per hour. The agreed judgment entry decree of divorce (\u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>decree\u201d) provided that, pursuant to the stipulation, John would pay Lisa spousal support in the amount of $50,000 per year for ten years and one final year of spousal support at $30,000, for a total 11-year obligation. The decree further stated that spousal support would terminate upon the death of either party or if Lisa remarried or cohabitated with an adult male who was not a family member.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">{\u00b6 4} The stipulation had provided for the trial court to retain jurisdiction over the matter of spousal support, but the decree omitted this provision. In conjunction with his motion for spousal-support termination, John filed a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment to amend the decree to comport with the stipulation. The trial court found that the parties intended for the court to retain jurisdiction over spousal support and granted the motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">{\u00b6 5} Shortly after the parties divorced in 2007, Lisa\u2019s mother died in January 2008, and her father died in September 2008. They were 83 and 81 years old, respectively, at the time of their deaths. As a result, Lisa and her sister Suzanne each received an inheritance of $1,269,000. On May 20, 2009, John filed a motion to terminate spousal support because of Lisa\u2019s inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">{\u00b6 6} On March 30, 2010, the trial court held a hearing on the motion and heard testimony from Lisa, John, Lisa\u2019s sister, Suzanne, and a financial-planning specialist (who testified as to the amount of investment income the inheritance might potentially provide). After hearing all the testimony, the trial court considered whether it had jurisdiction to consider a modification of the spousal-support order by applying the law as stated in R.C. 3105.18 and <em>Mandelbaum v. Mandelbaum, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 433, 2009-Ohio-1222, 905 N.E.2d 172. In <em>Mandelbaum, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed that a trial court has jurisdiction to modify a prior order of spousal support only if the decree of the court expressly reserved jurisdiction to make the modification and if the court finds that (1) a substantial change in circumstances has occurred and (2) the change was not contemplated at the time of the original decree. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court found that it had retained jurisdiction to modify the order and that the large inheritance constituted a substantial change in circumstances. However, the court determined that the second prong of the <em>Mandelbaum </em>test was not met because the inheritance was a change in circumstances that was specifically contemplated at the time of the original decree. Therefore, the trial court denied John\u2019s motion for modification/termination of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>{\u00b6 8} John timely appeals this decision, raising the following assignment of error for our review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\">The Family Court erred in concluding that [Lisa\u2019s] inheritance was a change contemplated at the time of the divorce barring a later modification or termination of spousal support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">{\u00b6 9} A trial court has broad discretion in determining whether or not to modify an existing spousal support award. <em>Hines v. Hines, </em>3d Dist. No. 9-10-15, 2010-0hio-4807, 2010 WL 3836130, \u00b6 17; <em>Mottice v. Mottice </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 731, 735, 693 N.E.2d 1179. Absent an abuse of discretion, a trial court\u2019s decision pertaining to modification of a spousal-support award will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>Bostick v. Bostick, </em>3d Dist. No. 1-02-83, 2003-0hio-5121, 2003 WL 22228604, \u00b6 8, citing <em>Booth v. Booth </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 142, 144, 541 N.E.2d 1028. An abuse of discretion is more than an error in judgment; it signifies that the trial court\u2019s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. When applying an abuse-of-discretion standard, an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Berk v. Matthews </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 161, 169, 559 N.E.2d 1301. The burden of establishing the need to modify spousal support rests with the party seeking modification. <em>Tremaine v. Tremaine </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 703, 706, 676 N.E.2d 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">{\u00b6 10} The Ohio Supreme Court has long emphasized that an agreement for spousal support that has been entered in a divorce decree by a trial court is entitled to expectations of finality. <em>Mandelbaum, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 433, 2009-Ohio-1222, 905 N.E.2d 172, at \u00b6 15, citing <em>Wolfe v. Wolfe </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 399, 415-416, 75 O.O.2d 474, 350 N.E.2d 413 (tracing nearly 100 years of decisions concerning alimony). A trial court will have jurisdiction to modify a prior order of spousal support only if the decree of the court expressly reserved jurisdiction to make the modification and if the court finds that a substantial change in circumstances has occurred <em>and that the change had not been contemplated at the time of the original decree. Mandelbaum, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">{\u00b6 11} The trial court found that it retained jurisdiction to review the matter and that Lisa\u2019s inheritance constituted a substantial change in circumstances. John\u2019s sole assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that modification or termination of spousal support was precluded because the parties contemplated Lisa\u2019s inheritance at the time of the original decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">{\u00b6 12} The Ohio Supreme Court has stated that \u201cthe change in circumstances must be one that had not been contemplated and taken into account by the parties or the court at the time of the prior order.\u201d <em>Mandelbaum, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 433, 2009-Ohio-1222, 905 N.E.2d 172, at \u00b6 32. John argues that the stipulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>and decree were silent regarding the potential inheritance because there was no way of knowing when it might occur or how much it might actually be. John maintains that an inheritance is something that can be \u201cforeseen\u201d in that it may come to a party someday, but it is \u201cunforeseeable\u201d to know when it will come or exactly how much it will be. For a contemplated change to exist, he believes that the parties must have some knowledge of a specific time-frame and amount, such as future retirement benefits, where the parties may be aware of the expected age of retirement and the calculation of the monthly benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">{\u00b6 13} John contends that the fact that Lisa\u2019s potential inheritance was discussed does not remove the speculative nature of an inheritance in order to make it a \u201ccontemplated\u201d event \u201ctaken into account\u201d by the parties. John claims that he intended to pay the $50,000 annual support to Lisa only to supplement her income until she received her inheritance. Therefore, he wanted the trial court to reserve jurisdiction to review the support order to determine whether the need still existed to continue the spousal-support payments, based upon the timing and the amount of the inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">{\u00b6 14} However, Lisa testified that the potential inheritance was contemplated and thoroughly discussed at the time of the divorce negotiations. She also testified that the impact of any inheritance she would receive on an award of spousal support was taken into account and specifically excluded from the settlement agreement. She believed that the trial court would retain jurisdiction over the matter of spousal support only to the extent that it could terminate spousal support as provided for in the decree, i.e., in the event that she remarried or cohabitated. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">{\u00b6 15} John claims that the inheritance was speculative because no one knew when Lisa\u2019s parents would die or how much she would inherit. However, Lisa and Suzanne both testified that John was very much aware of the fact that their parents were in extremely poor health and that they had a substantial estate, which the two sisters would inherit. In 2004, the entire family went to Chicago to celebrate what might be their last Christmas together and have a family portrait taken. Lisa\u2019s mother, who was over 80 years old and had previously had breast cancer, had been diagnosed with bone cancer. The doctors believed that she might live only three to five years at the most. Lisa\u2019s father had suffered a fractured skull, resulting in severe dementia, had had a stroke, and was a heavy drinker and smoker. His prognosis was also poor. At the family gathering, Suzanne, who had been named executor of her parents\u2019 estate, shared detailed financial information with Lisa and John concerning their parents\u2019 wills, trusts, and assets. Suzanne wanted the entire family to be aware of all the facts, and she testified that she showed Lisa and John a spreadsheet listing her parents\u2019 substantial assets. Lisa often had to make trips to Chicago because of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>parents\u2019 poor health. Lisa and Suzanne also testified that John was knowledgeable about the extent of their parents\u2019 wealth, and he had assisted their father in selling his business.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">{\u00b6 16} John generally denied having much knowledge about the parents\u2019 poor health or their assets, or he frequently \u201cdid not recall\u201d many of the events or alleged discussions. However, Lisa\u2019s and Suzanne\u2019s testimony enumerated many specific instances and facts that contradicted John\u2019s claims. John\u2019s own deposition, taken only a few weeks before the hearing, was used to impeach his testimony. His deposition testimony clearly revealed that he understood that Lisa \u201cwould receive a huge inheritance.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">Q. * * * [Were] there discussions about various inheritances between you and Lisa?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">A. Before we were divorced, I mean, in negotiating, I talked that I only wanted to pay until her parents died because I knew she would receive a huge inheritance and she wouldn\u2019t need my support anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">Q. So your recollection is, there [were] discussions about that there was a large estate that would be coming due if the will stayed as it was, which was half to Lisa and half to her sister?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">A. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-11\">Q. And you, according to what you just said, knew that the parents had a lot of money, a lot of assets, going to have a large estate, I mean, you\u2019ve done the math, you\u2019ve seen that she got about a million dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-12\">A. Yeah. I didn\u2019t know how much it was going to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-13\">Q. But you knew it was substantial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">{\u00b6 17} John originally had wanted his spousal-support obligation to terminate when Lisa received her parents\u2019 inheritance. However, Lisa strongly objected to this condition. In his deposition, John testified that the predivorce documents contained terminology stating that spousal-support would terminate when Lisa inherited her parents\u2019 money. After continued negotiations between the parties, this language was ultimately removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-16\">{\u00b6 18} Although John claims that the timing and the amount of Lisa\u2019s inheritance were speculative, there was considerable evidence showing that John knew her parents were very likely to not live much longer and that he had a good understanding as to the significant amount of money Lisa was very likely to inherit. The trial court apparently found Lisa\u2019s and Suzanne\u2019s testimony to be more credible than John\u2019s. The credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>given their testimony are primarily for the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Tremaine, </em>111 Ohio App.3d at 707, 676 N.E.2d 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">{\u00b6 19} John cited cases in which courts have found that an inheritance constituted an unforeseen change of circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Howell v. Howell, </em>167 Ohio App.3d 431, 2006-Ohio-3038, 855 N.E.2d 533. However, the facts in <em>Howell </em>and the other case are very different from those in this case. For instance, in <em>Howell, </em>the appellant was only a contingent beneficiary of his grandfather\u2019s trust fund at the time of the divorce. He had no rights to the trust fund until after the death of both his parents, and there was no information concerning the likelihood of their demise in the near future. We are cognizant of the fact that there certainly might be situations in which a party\u2019s inheritance would constitute a substantial change of circumstances that was not contemplated at the time of the original decree. Every situation may have varying facts and circumstances that can affect the final determination. That is why the trial court is vested with the discretion to review and evaluate the individual merits of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">{\u00b6 20} John also argues about the retroactive applicability of <em>Mandelbaum, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 433, 2009-Ohio-1222, 905 N.E.2d 172, which was not decided until 2009, to their divorce decree, which was finalized in 2007. However, <em>Mandelbaum </em>did not modify the long-standing rule of law that in order to warrant a modification of spousal support due to a change in circumstances \u201c \u2018the change must be one that is substantial and not contemplated at the time of the prior order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Trotter v. Trotter </em>(2001), 3d Dist. No. 1-2000-86, 2001 WL 390066, *2, quoting <em>Tremaine v. Tremaine </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 703, 706, 676 N.E.2d 1249. See also <em>Reveal v. Reveal, </em>154 Ohio App.3d 758, 2003-Ohio-5335, 798 N.E.2d 1132, \u00b6 14; <em>Moore v. Moore </em>(1997), 120 Ohio App.3d 488, 491, 698 N.E.2d 459; <em>Leighner v. Leighner </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 214, 215, 515 N.E.2d 625. In resolving a conflict between the appellate districts, <em>Mandelbaum </em>merely affirmed that the 1991 statutory modifications to R.C. 3105.18 <em>did not change </em>this long-held tenet of common law. <em>Mandelbaum </em>at \u00b6 29. <em>Mandelbaum </em>primarily focused on whether the change of circumstances still needed to be \u201csubstantial.\u201d Only three appellate districts, the Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh, had failed to continue to utilize the \u201cwell-established\u201d standard. Id. at \u00b6 29-30. John cannot claim that <em>Mandelbaum </em>introduced any new rule of law that would affect his decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">{\u00b6 21} John further asserts that it was wrong to equate \u201ccontemplated\u201d with a contingency that may have been merely \u201cknown and discussed.\u201d However, in this case, the contingency of the inheritance was more than just known and discussed. The option of discontinuing spousal support upon Lisa\u2019s receipt of the inheritance was known, discussed, negotiated, <em>and rejected </em>by the parties in the determination of their final stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Both parties have raised some meritorious arguments on appeal. However, whether or not we come to the same conclusion as the trial court, our role is only to review for an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., <em>Selanders v. Selanders, </em>3d Dist. No. 17-08-28, 2009-Ohio-2303, 2009 WL 1365226, \u00b6 33. We must \u201crefrain from the temptation of substituting [our] judgment for that of the trier-of-fact, unless the lower court\u2019s decision amounts to an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Martin v. Martin </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 292, 295, 18 OBR 342, 480 N.E.2d 1112. The trial court\u2019s decision was supported by competent, credible evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, and it was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. It was within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion to find that Lisa\u2019s inheritance was a contemplated change of circumstances that was taken into account by the parties as they were negotiating their final agreement. Therefore, it is not proper to disrupt the finality of the decree in order to provide John with another opportunity to obtain the terms that he was not able to negotiate in the original stipulation. Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">{\u00b623} Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein, in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b58-6\">Rogers, P.J., and Preston, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-9\">. John filed his Civ.R. 60(B) motion on March 16, 2010. The trial court ruled on this matter in the April 27, 2010 judgment entry concerning the motion to terminate spousal support that is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
