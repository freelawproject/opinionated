(\u201cAGA\u201d), Leed Construction, Ltd., Anchor Realty Construction, Inc., Jason Gunsorek, and Megan Gunsorek Burkholder (collectively, \u201cappellees\u201d), on DOC\u2019s claim for violations of Ohio\u2019s prevailing-wage laws. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">{\u00b6 2} Effective January 15, 2008, AGA, an Ohio limited-liability company, and the state of Ohio, acting through the Department of Administrative Services (\u201cDAS\u201d), entered into a lease, pursuant to which AGA leased real property located at 770 West Broad Street, in Columbus (\u201cthe property\u201d), to the state for use by the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (\u201cDRC\u201d). Under the lease, AGA agreed to construct and pay for specified improvements to the property (the \u201cproject\u201d). Section XI(C) of the lease required AGA to comply with <em>applicable </em>provisions of R.C. Chapter 4115 and Ohio Adm.Code 4101:9-4 relating to payment of prevailing wage. No public funds were spent on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">{\u00b6 3} DOC commenced this action against appellees in September 2009, alleging prevailing-wage violations, relating to the project. Appellees moved for summary judgment, arguing that Ohio\u2019s prevailing-wage law is facially unconstitutional and that, alternatively, prevailing-wage law did not apply to the project. The trial court refused to address appellees\u2019 constitutional challenge but granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>appellees\u2019 motion, concluding that prevailing-wage law was inapplicable because no public funds were spent on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">{\u00b6 4} DOC has filed a timely notice of appeal and asserts the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">The trial court erred in finding that improvements made to a property leased to the state of Ohio, to be occupied by a state agency, are not subject to prevailing wage law, R.C. 4115.03 et seq.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">{\u00b6 5} We review a summary judgment de novo. <em>Koos v. Cent. Ohio Cellular, Inc. </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 579, 588, 641 N.E.2d 265, citing <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153. When an appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s disposition of a summary-judgment motion, it applies the same standard as the trial court and conducts an independent review, without deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Maust v. Bank One Columbus, N.A. </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 103, 107, 614 N.E.2d 765; <em>Brown </em>at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">{\u00b6 6} Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate only under the following circumstances: (1) no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, that conclusion being adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46. Because summary judgment is a procedural device to terminate litigation, courts should award it cautiously after resolving all doubts in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Murphy v. Reynoldsburg </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 356, 358-359, 604 N.E.2d 138, quoting <em>Norris v. Ohio Std. Oil Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 1, 2, 24 O.O.3d 1, 433 N.E.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">{\u00b6 7} The crux of this case is whether Ohio\u2019s prevailing wage law applies to the project. \u201cOhio\u2019s prevailing wage law applies to all construction projects that are \u2018public improvements,\u2019 as defined in R.C. 4115.03(C).\u201d <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Indus. Relations </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 366, 369, 575 N.E.2d 134; <em>U.S. Corr. Corp. v. Ohio Dept. of Indus. Relations </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 210, 218, 652 N.E.2d 766; see also <em>Northwestern Ohio Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council v. Ottawa Cty. Improvement Corp., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 283, 2009-Ohio-2957, 910 N.E.2d 1025, \u00b6 15, citing <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes; </em>R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>4115.10(A) (\u201cNo person, firm, corporation, or public authority that constructs a public improvement with its own forces * * * shall violate the wage provisions of sections 4115.03 to 4115.16 of the Revised Code\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 8} Despite the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s clear statement of the law in <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes </em>and <em>U.S. Corr. Corp., </em>the trial court held that \u201cin order for Ohio\u2019s prevailing wage law to apply to a project, it must be a public improvement <em>and </em>it must be paid for with public funds.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) The trial court relied exclusively on the <em>Northwestern </em>syllabus to conclude that Ohio\u2019s prevailing-wage law did not apply, because no public funds were spent on the project. Before turning to <em>Northwestern, </em>however, we will first review the applicable statutory language and prior Supreme Court precedent regarding the applicability of prevailing-wage law.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court correctly acknowledged that prevailing-wage law applies only to a project that is a \u201cpublic improvement.\u201d R.C. 4115.03(C) defines \u201cpublic improvement,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">\u201cPublic improvement\u201d includes all buildings * * * and all other structures or works constructed by a public authority of the state or any political subdivision thereof or by any person who, pursuant to a contract with a public authority, constructs any structure for a public authority of the state or a political subdivision thereof. When a public authority rents or leases a newly constructed structure within six months after completion of such construction, all work performed on such structure to suit it for occupancy by a public authority is a \u201cpublic improvement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">On appeal, DOC contends that the project qualifies as a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d under both sentences of R.C. 4115.03(C), thereby mandating compliance with prevailing-wage law. More specifically, DOC contends that the project qualifies as a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d for two reasons: (1) it was completed pursuant to a contract with DRC for DRC\u2019s use and (2) DRC leased the structure within six months after work was performed to suit DRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\"> {\u00b6 10} The Supreme Court of Ohio has provided guidance on applying the statutory definition of \u201cpublic improvement\u201d for purposes of determining the applicability of prevailing-wage law. See <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 366, 575 N.E.2d 134; <em>U.S. Corr. Corp., </em>73 Ohio St.3d 210, 652 N.E.2d 766. As applicable here, to satisfy the first sentence of R.C. 4115.03(C), the project must be constructed \u201cpursuant to a contract with a public authority\u201d and \u201cfor a public authority.\u201d See <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes </em>at 369. A project is constructed pursuant to a contract with a public authority when the contract is the \u201canimating force\u201d for the construction. Id. To be constructed for a public authority, \u201cthe public authority [must] receive the benefit of the construction, either through maintaining a possessory or property interest in the completed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>project or through the use of public funds in the construction of the project.\u201d Id. at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">{\u00b6 11} The Supreme Court applied the statutory definition of \u201cpublic improvement\u201d in <em>U.S. Corr. Corp. </em>There, United States Corrections Corporation (\u201cUSCC\u201d), a private company, entered into a Lease and Correctional Housing Services Agreement (the \u201cagreement\u201d) with Hamilton County, Ohio. The agreement provided that USCC would renovate the Kruse Hardware Building in Cincinnati for use as a minimum-security correctional institution and would lease the completed facility to the county for a specified term. USCC directly contracted and paid for renovations to meet the terms of the agreement. The Supreme Court ultimately concluded that the renovations fit within both definitions of \u201cpublic improvement\u201d in R.C. 4115.03(C) and were, therefore, subject to Ohio\u2019s prevailing-wage requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 12} The Supreme Court first applied the test utilized in <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 366, 575 N.E.2d 134. The court determined, 73 Ohio St.3d at 219, 652 N.E.2d 766, that the agreement was the \u201canimating force\u201d behind the renovation because USCC renovated the building to comply with the agreement\u2019s terms, which outlined specifications for the renovation, a timeline for completion, and a schedule of occupancy. Accordingly, the court concluded that the renovated facility was constructed pursuant to a contract with a public authority. The court further determined that the county\u2019s possessory interest in the completed facility, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, indicated that the correctional facility was constructed for a public authority. Thus, the court concluded that the renovation project fit squarely within the definition of \u201cpublic improvement\u201d in the first sentence of R.C. 4115.03(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 13} The Supreme Court then considered whether the renovation also satisfied the second sentence of R.C. 4115.03(C), which provides that when a public authority leases a newly constructed structure within six months after completion of construction, all work performed to suit the structure for occupancy by a public authority is a \u201cpublic improvement.\u201d The appellees argued that the second sentence was inapplicable because the lease agreement was executed <em>before </em>construction was completed. The court rejected this argument because, although the parties\u2019 agreement predated construction, the county was undisputedly to lease the building within six months after completion of the renovation and, in fact, took occupancy upon completion. The court also rejected the appellees\u2019 argument that the building was not a \u201cnewly constructed structure,\u201d based on former R.C. 4115.03(B), which defined \u201cconstruction\u201d as \u201c \u2018any construction, reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, alteration, repair, painting, or decorating, of any public improvement.\u2019 \u201d <em>U.S. Corr. Corp. </em>at 220, 652 N.E.2d 766, quoting 137 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3851. Because the statutory definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u201cconstruction\u201d equally encompassed construction and reconstruction, the court concluded that \u201cnewly constructed structure\u201d encompassed a newly reconstructed structure, and that the renovation, therefore, constituted a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d under the second sentence of R.C. 4115.03(C). <em>U.S. Corr. Corp. </em>at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">{\u00b6 14} The facts of this case closely parallel those in <em>U.S. Corr. Corp. </em>As in that ease, a lease between a private entity and a public authority required the private entity to complete renovations to the leased premises to make them amenable to a specified use by the public authority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In both cases, the renovations were completed pursuant to duties created by the lease, and the private entity was responsible for the costs of the renovations, without the use of public funds. The leases in both cases were executed prior to construction of the renovations, with the public authority to have a possessory property interest in the renovated facility and to take possession of the premises upon completion. Despite these striking similarities, the trial court did not cite <em>U.S. Corr. Corp. </em>in its decision. Under the rationale of that case, however, we conclude that the project here was a \u201cpublic improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 15} With respect to the definition of \u201cpublic improvement\u201d in the first sentence of R.C. 4115.03(C), the project here is indistinguishable from the project at issue in <em>U.S. Corr. Corp. </em>The lease was the animating force behind the renovation project, as AGA renovated the premises to meet its obligations under the lease. Accordingly, as in <em>U.S. Corr. Corp., </em>the project was constructed pursuant to a contract with a public authority. Further, because DRC, a public authority, had a possessory interest in the renovated premises under the lease, the project was constructed for a public authority. Hence, the project was a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d under the first sentence of R.C. 4115.03(C) and the test applied in <em>U.S. Corr. Corp.; </em>we need not address appellants\u2019 arguments under the second sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 16} Appellees argue, however, that DOC has waived any argument that the project constituted a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d under the first sentence of R.C. 4115.03(C). We disagree. In its complaint, DOC broadly alleged that the project \u201cis a public improvement as defined by R.C. 4115.03(C), and is subject to Ohio\u2019s Prevailing Wage Law.\u201d Thus, DOC\u2019s complaint does not limit it to arguing that the project was a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d under the second sentence of R.C. 4115.03(C). Additionally, appellees did not address the question whether the project was a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d or dispute its status as a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d in their motion for summary judgment but instead argued that the absence of any expenditure of public funds on the project precluded application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>prevailing-wage law. They argued, based solely on <em>Northwestern, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 283, 2009-Ohio-2957, 910 N.E.2d 1025, that prevailing-wage law did not apply, \u201c[bjecause the State did not spend a single penny to renovate the Project.\u201d DOC did not file a cross-motion for summary judgment and was, therefore, not required to demonstrate that the project was a \u201cpublic improvement,\u201d but only that the lack of public funding did not preclude application of prevailing-wage law. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s decision is premised on its conclusion that, absent an expenditure of public funds, prevailing-wage law did not apply, regardless of whether the project was a \u201cpublic improvement.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 17} We now turn to <em>Northwestern, </em>upon which appellees rely and upon which the trial court based its decision. The <em>Northwestern </em>syllabus states, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">The prevailing-wage law applies only when a public authority, including an institution, spends public funds to construct a \u201cpublic improvement,\u201d which by definition must be constructed by a public authority or must benefit a public authority. (R.C. 4115.03, construed.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Based on that language, the trial court stated that before Ohio\u2019s prevailing-wage law will apply, not only must a construction project qualify as a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d but, additionally, public funds must be expended on the project. Appellees argue that the trial court appropriately applied the specific language of the <em>Northwestern </em>syllabus, which states the law of that case. DOC, on the other hand, argues that the trial court erred by failing to read <em>Northwestern </em>in its entirety and in the context of earlier Supreme Court precedent regarding prevailing-wage law.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">{\u00b6 18} Former Rep.R. 1(B) stated, \u201cThe syllabus of a Supreme Court opinion states the controlling point or points of law decided in and necessarily arising from the facts of the specific case before the Court for adjudication.\u201d Effective May 1, 2002, however, Rep.R. 1(B) was amended to read, \u201cThe law stated in a Supreme Court opinion is contained within its syllabus (if one is provided), and its text, including footnotes.\u201d Rep.R. 1(C) now reads, \u201cA syllabus * * * is not the controlling statement of the points of law decided, but is merely a research and indexing aid.\u201d Moreover, even prior to the amendment to Rep.R. 1, \u201c[t]he syllabus of a Supreme Court opinion [was] not to be construed as being broader than the facts of that specific case warrant.\u201d <em>State v. McDermott </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 570, 574, 651 N.E.2d 985. Thus, this court must read the <em>Northwestern </em>syllabus along with, and in the context of, the text of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion. Reading <em>Northwestern </em>in the context of its facts and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>context of prior Ohio Supreme Court jurisprudence regarding prevailing-wage law, <em>Northwestern </em>does not represent the significant shift suggested by appellees and accepted by the trial court, nor does it add to the statutory requirements for the application of Ohio\u2019s prevailing-wage law.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">{\u00b6 19} Before delving into the facts of <em>Northwestern, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 283, 2009-Ohio-2957, 910 N.E.2d 1025, we first recognize that nothing in R.C. 4115.03(C) requires an expenditure of public funds for a project to qualify as a \u201cpublic improvement.\u201d In fact, construing the first sentence of R.C. 4115.03(C), the Supreme Court held that a project may be said to be \u201cfor a public authority\u201d if the public authority receives the benefit of the construction, <em>\u201ceither </em>through maintaining a possessory or property interest in the completed project <em>or </em>though the use of public funds in the construction of the project.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 370, 575 N.E.2d 134. Thus, the use of public funds is not a necessary prerequisite for a construction project to qualify as a \u201cpublic improvement.\u201d Indeed, had R.C. 4115.03(C) required an expenditure of public funds, the court\u2019s analysis in <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes </em>and <em>U.S. Corr. Corp. </em>would have been unnecessary because neither case involved a project paid for with public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Northwestern, </em>Fellhauer Mechanical Systems, Inc. (\u201cFellhauer\u201d), a private contractor and retailer, purchased real property, the building standing thereon, and office equipment, after which it renovated a portion of the building. To finance the purchase and renovation, Fellhauer obtained private funding as well as public funding from \u201cinstitutionfs] supported in whole or in part by public funds.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fellhauer used both public and private funds to finance the purchase of the real property, building, and office equipment, but used only private funds to finance the renovation. A state taxpayer and the Northwestern Ohio Building &amp; Construction Trades Council (\u201cNorthwestern\u201d) filed an action for injunctive relief to compel compliance with the prevailing-wage law in connection with the public funds disbursed to Fellhauer.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">{\u00b6 21} After the trial court and the court of appeals held that the Fellhauer project was not subject to Ohio\u2019s prevailing-wage law, the Supreme Court of Ohio accepted a discretionary appeal on four propositions of law, one of which stated, \u201cExpenditures of an institution supported in part by public funds trigger prevailing wage applicability under R.C. 4115.03(A) as a matter of law.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 13. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>\u00b6 1, the Supreme Court concisely stated the issue before it, as well as its holding, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">We are asked to determine whether the mere expenditure of public funds by an institution, defined as a public authority in R.C. 4115.03(A) triggers the prevailing-wage requirement set forth in R.C. 4115.03 et seq. We hold that the wage requirement is triggered only when an R.C. 4115.03(A) institution spends public funds to construct a public improvement, which by definition must be constructed by a public authority or must benefit a public authority. Because the public funds herein were not spent on construction of a public improvement, we affirm the judgment * * * that the prevailing-wage law does not apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Thus, the specific issue before the Supreme Court was the following: where a public authority (specifically, in that case, an institution) spends public funds, must the expenditure be made on a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d to require compliance with the prevailing-wage law?</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 22} The Supreme Court reiterated its prior holdings that prevailing-wage law applies to construction projects that are \u201cpublic improvements.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 15, citing <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 369, 575 N.E.2d 134. The court rejected Northwestern\u2019s argument that an institution, as defined in R.C. 4115.03(A), is distinguishable from other public authorities, such that \u201conce such an institution expends public funds, the prevailing-wage requirement applies automatically, regardless of whether the project * * * involves actual construction of a \u2018public improvement\u2019 as defined in R.C. 4115.03(C), which is normally required to trigger payment of prevailing wage.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 17. The court reasoned that Northwestern\u2019s argument \u201cwould unjustifiably expand the scope of prevailing-wage law to include projects that are not public improvements, that are not constructed by a public authority, or that do not benefit a public authority.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 19. At \u00b6 20, the court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">Accordingly, we hold that the prevailing-wage law applies only when a public authority, including an institution, spends public funds to construct a \u201cpublic improvement,\u201d which by definition must be constructed by a public authority or must benefit a public authority. See <em>Episcopal Retirement [Homes] </em>at 369, 575 N.E.2d 134 (a project must be constructed \u201cfor a public authority\u201d in order for the prevailing-wage statutes to apply); Ohio Adm.Code 4101:9-4-02(BB)(l) and (2) (defining \u201cpublic improvement\u201d as a structure \u201c[cjonstructed\u201d by or for a public authority).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 23} The Supreme Court then proceeded to apply the standards for requiring prevailing-wage compliance to the facts in <em>Northwestern, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 283, 2009-Ohio-2957, 910 N.E.2d 1025, and concluded that the Fellhauer project was not a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d because the project was not to be constructed by or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>for a public authority but was, instead, intended for Fellhauer alone. Id. at \u00b6 22-23. The question before the court was not whether public funds must be spent to implicate prevailing-wage requirements but whether, when public funds are expended, the project must still be a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d to require compliance with prevailing wage law. The court concluded that the Fellhauer project was not subject to prevailing-wage laws, because none of the public funds at issue there were spent to finance any actual construction of a public improvement. Id. at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">{\u00b6 24} According to appellees and the trial court, <em>Northwestern </em>broadly holds that a public improvement is not subject to prevailing-wage law unless public funds are spent on construction. Such a broad reading of <em>Northwestern </em>represents a vast departure from the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes </em>and <em>U.S. Corr. Corp., </em>both of which the Supreme Court favorably cited in <em>Northwestern. </em>Contrary to appellees\u2019 suggestion, <em>Northwestern </em>does not effectively add a requirement to the statutory framework for determining whether a construction project is subject to prevailing-wage law, i.e., that a construction project need not only qualify as a \u201cpublic improvement,\u201d but must also be publicly funded. In the context of its facts, <em>Northwestern </em>is not inconsistent with <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes </em>and <em>U.S. Corr. Corp. </em>The <em>Northwestern </em>court\u2019s holding that despite the expenditure of public funds by a public authority, prevailing-wage law applies only if the expenditure is made on a \u201cpublic improvement,\u201d is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s statements in <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 369, 575 N.E.2d 134, and <em>U.S. Corr. Corp., </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 218, 652 N.E.2d 766, that prevailing-wage law applies to \u201call construction projects that are \u2018public improvements.\u2019 \u201d Absent any indication to limit or overrule <em>Episcopal Retirement Homes </em>and <em>U.S. Corr. Corp., </em>and in light of the court\u2019s reliance on those cases, we read <em>Northwestern </em>consistently \"with those cases and conclude that the lack of public funds does not preclude the application of prevailing-wage law here. In holding otherwise, the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 25} For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees based on the absence of public funds spent on the project. We expressly decline, however, to address appellees\u2019 additional arguments regarding the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s prevailing-wage statutes and/or alleged noncompliance with statutory duties by DAS or DOC, relating to prevailing wage. The trial court has not considered and decided those issues, and we will not determine them in the first instance on appeal. For these reasons, we sustain DOC\u2019s assignment of error to the extent supported by this decision. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Common Pleas and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this decision and the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b568-6\">Bryant, P.J., and Connor, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\">. It is undisputed that both DAS and DRC are \u201cpublic authorities/\u2019 as defined in R.C. 4115.03(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\">. The trial court stated: \u201cIt does not matter what supposed tract in relation to R.C. 4115.03(C) a project is on; no public funds, no prevailing wage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b565-8\">.
