Facts and Procedure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, Sandra Givens, appeals a decision of the Hamilton County-Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, appointing appellee, Paul Wenker, as guardian of the estate and Wanda Bevington as guardian of the person of Harold Waller. We find no merit in Givens\u2019s two assignments of error, and we affirm the probate court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">{\u00b6 2} Harold Waller was a pharmacist who had for many years owned his own pharmacy and the building in which it was located. He had also acquired numerous rental properties. He never married, and he had no children.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">{\u00b6 3} A neurologist diagnosed Waller with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in a mild to moderate stage, with significant cognitive impairment. She recommended that a guardian be appointed for him and that he live in an assisted-living facility for persons with memory impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">{\u00b6 4} Wenker, Waller\u2019s long-time attorney, filed an application to be appointed the guardian of his person and estate. Wenker had met Waller over 30 years earlier when he helped Waller acquire a piece of real estate. Wenker is an attorney with an L.L.M. in tax, and his practice includes, among other things, taxation, corporations, and real estate. He had continued to help Waller acquire and manage his properties over the years. He had arranged to put Waller\u2019s properties into limited-liability corporations and then into a trust. Waller was the trustee and Wenker was the successor trustee. Waller had also granted to Wenker his power of attorney in a succession of documents over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">{\u00b6 5} Waller had been in the hospital for a surgical procedure. Following his release from the hospital, Wenker had arranged for him to live at the Hyde Park Care Center. He lived in a locked unit and could only have visitors whose names were on an approved list. Waller was unhappy there and referred to it as \u201ca prison.\u201d The evidence showed that it was \u201cmore restrictive than necessary given his * * * level of functioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">{\u00b6 6} Givens, Waller\u2019s niece, also filed an application to be appointed the guardian of his person and estate. She is a registered nurse and had worked at University Hospital for over 30 years. She testified that she had invited Waller to family functions, but that he had never attended. She described her uncle as a confirmed bachelor who was married to his work. Givens further testified that she had always cared for her relatives, including Waller\u2019s mother. She said that she was willing to have Waller live with her. She acknowledged, though, that she had no knowledge of his real estate holdings or business dealings.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Givens\u2019s relationship with Waller was strained due to an incident at Waller\u2019s medical building when she and other relatives had allegedly taken documents and, possibly, controlled substances out of the pharmacy. That incident had resulted in criminal charges and a restraining order. Givens contended that the incident was a misunderstanding and that she had been cleaning out the pharmacy. Although the charges were later dropped, Givens did not think that she would be permitted to see Waller at the care center without repercussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 8} Waller, who had periods of lucidity, had stated that he did not want Givens to be his guardian. He had also expressed distrust of Wenker. Further, the record shows that Wenker and Givens had \u201cmistrust of each other[,] if not downright animosity,\u201d and that they would have had difficulty working together.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">{\u00b6 9} Givens felt that Wenker was trying to break up their family and cut Waller off from the people closest to him. The trial court found, and the evidence showed, that Wenker had done a \u201cgood job\u201d managing Waller\u2019s properties. But he was instrumental in terminating the employment of Elizabeth Robinson, Waller\u2019s long-time assistant, filing the stalking charges and obtaining a restraining order against Givens, Robinson, and other family members, evicting Waller\u2019s other niece from one of his rental units, and restricting Waller\u2019s visitors at the care center.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">{\u00b6 10} Wenker had also hired his assistant\u2019s husband to manage Waller\u2019s properties even though the husband had no experience in the field. Nevertheless, Waller testified that he was generally happy with the work performed and with the way his properties were maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">{\u00b6 11} A magistrate found that Wenker was \u201ca suitable person to be appointed the Guardian of the Estate for Harold Waller. He has been helping Waller manage his business affairs for over twenty years. It would be difficult to find anyone else as knowledgeable about Mr. Waller\u2019s portfolio of properties and assets and who could manage them competently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">{\u00b6 12} The magistrate gave \u201ca great amount of consideration\u201d to the relationship among Givens, Wenker, and Waller\u2019s friends, family members, and business associates. She expressed concern about Waller\u2019s living conditions. She stated, \u201cMr. Waller has the right and deserves to be in the least restrictive setting possible. * * * Mr. Waller has been, as he puts it, \u2018imprisoned,\u2019 on a locked unit for many months when he appears to be able to get around physically and capable of more freedom. Mr. Wenker\u2019s plan is to leave him there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">{\u00b6 18} The magistrate found that neither Wenker nor Givens was suitable to be appointed as guardian of Waller\u2019s person. Consequently, it appointed Bevington, the CEO of Personal Guardianship Services, \u201ca highly experienced independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>guardian.\u201d The magistrate specifically stated that \u201c[appointing an independent guardian is in Mr. Waller\u2019s best interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 14} Both Waller and Givens objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision. The trial court overruled the objections, adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision, and issued some supplemental orders. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">{\u00b6 15} In her first assignment of error, Givens contends that the trial court erred in appointing Bevington as guardian of Waller\u2019s person. She argues that the court abuses its discretion when it fails to appoint the next of kin as guardian of the ward\u2019s person. In her second assignment of error, she contends that the trial court erred in appointing Wenker as the guardian of the estate. She argues that the court\u2019s decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence. These assignments of error are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">\n<em>II. Appointment of Guardians in General</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 2111.02(A) provides that \u201c[w]hen found necessary, the probate court on its own motion or on application by any interested party shall appoint * * * a guardian of the person, the estate, or both, of a minor or incompetent^]\u201d Guardianship proceedings are not adversarial, and the probate court must act in the best interests of the incompetent person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court has broad discretion in appointing a guardian.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A reviewing court will not reverse a judgment appointing a guardian as an abuse of discretion if it is supported by competent, credible evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">{\u00b6 17} Generally, the court should appoint the same person as guardian of the person and estate of the ward, unless the court determines that \u201cthe interests of the ward will be promoted by the appointment of different persons as guardians of the person and of the estate.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A guardian of the person is responsible for the care and well-being of the ward.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He or she has the duty to protect and control the ward\u2019s person.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A guardian of the estate is responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>for the management of the ward\u2019s property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He or she must manage the estate for the best interests of the ward, pay just debts, defend suits against the ward, and institute suits for the ward.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">\n<em>III. Appointment of Wenker as Guardian of the Estate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b6 18} In this case, competent, credible evidence supported the probate court\u2019s decision that it was in Waller\u2019s best interest to appoint Wenker as guardian of Waller\u2019s estate because of his long-time association with Waller and his knowledge of Waller\u2019s properties and investments. In contrast, Givens had no knowledge or understanding of Waller\u2019s business affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">{\u00b6 19} Givens argues that Wenker had engaged in questionable practices and had failed to act in Waller\u2019s best interest. The evidence showed, and the trial court found, that Wenker had done a good job of managing Waller\u2019s assets and had taken \u201cproper care\u201d of his business affairs. The only \u201cpossible exception,\u201d the court found, was the hiring of Wenker\u2019s assistant\u2019s husband to manage Waller\u2019s properties when he had no experience in the field. Nevertheless, that decision did not result in prejudice to Waller, and he acknowledged that he was generally happy with the management of his properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">{\u00b6 20} Givens further contends that the evidence showed that Waller did not trust either applicant and that the trial court had employed a \u201cdouble standard\u201d in holding that lack of trust against Givens, but not against Wenker. The evidence showed, though, that Waller had trusted Wenker with his business for many years and had only recently, since the onset of his mental disability, expressed distrust in him. In contrast, Waller had specifically stated that he did not want Givens to be his guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">{\u00b6 21} Further, the court appointed an attorney for the guardian of the estate \u201cto ensure that Mr. Waller\u2019s interests are fully and completely protected.\u201d It ordered that attorney to review all of Waller\u2019s financial records.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">{\u00b622} Under the circumstances, competent, credible evidence supported the probate court\u2019s decision that it was in Waller\u2019s best interest to appoint Wenker as guardian of Waller\u2019s estate. Consequently, we cannot hold that the trial court abused its discretion in appointing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">\n<em>TV. Appointment of Bevington as Guardian of the Person</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">{\u00b6 23} Further, we cannot hold that the trial court abused its discretion in appointing Bevington, an independent third party, as the guardian of Waller\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>person rather than Givens. Given the evidence showing the animosity between Wenker and Givens, Waller\u2019s mistrust of Givens, her lack of contact with Waller despite being his niece, and the restraining order resulting from the incident at the pharmacy, we cannot hold that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to appoint Givens as guardian of Waller\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 24} Givens argues that the trial court should have appointed her as the guardian of Waller\u2019s person because she was his next of kin. But Ohio does not have a statutory preference for the appointment of guardians.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough courts generally select the next of kin or those with familial ties or someone acceptable to such persons on the theory that they will be the ones most concerned with the ward\u2019s welfare, they have great discretion in this matter and are not required to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Courts may appoint a stranger as guardian if it is in the ward\u2019s best interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 25} Competent, credible evidence supported the trial court\u2019s decision to appoint a stranger as guardian rather than Givens. The animosity between Givens and Wenker, as guardian of the estate, would have been sufficient, by itself, to support that decision. When the interested parties cannot cooperate, \u201cthe better approach is to consider and appoint a disinterested third party who will relay information and work together with all interested parties.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently, we cannot hold that the probate court abused its discretion in appointing Bevington, an experienced professional guardian, as the guardian of Waller\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">\n<em>V. Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">{\u00b6 26} In sum, we hold that the probate court did not abuse its discretion in appointing Wenker as guardian of Waller\u2019s estate and Bevington as guardian of his person. We overrule Givens\u2019s two assignments of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b705-10\">Cunningham, P.J., and Hendon, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-10\">. <em>In re Guardianship of Slone, </em>3d Dist.
