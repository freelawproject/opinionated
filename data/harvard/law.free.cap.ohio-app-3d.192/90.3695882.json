Boyle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, Eugene Fisher Jr., for the estate of plaintiff, Eugene Fisher Sr. (\u201cFisher\u201d), appeals from a judgment granting summary judgment in favor of defendants-appellees, Arthur Louis Supply Company (\u201cA. Louis\u201d) and Clark Industrial Insulation Company (\u201cClark\u201d). In this appeal, the estate contends that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to A. Louis and Clark. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm with respect to Clark, but reverse with respect to A. Louis.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">{\u00b6 2} Fisher worked as an electrician at Reactive Metals, Inc., from September 16, 1957, to June 14, 1963, where his estate claims he was exposed to asbestos products supplied by A. Louis and Clark. He developed mesothelioma from his exposure to asbestos and filed a complaint on June 6, 2006, against numerous entities, including A. Louis and Clark, for damages arising from his disease. Fisher died on June 21, 2006, just over two weeks after he filed his complaint. His son was substituted as plaintiff in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">{\u00b6 3} A. Louis and Clark moved for summary judgment, arguing that Fisher\u2019s estate did not present any competent evidence that he was exposed to asbestos from products they supplied during his employment with Reactive Metals. They further argued that even if the court found that there was sufficient evidence to create genuine issues of fact that Fisher was exposed to their products during the relative time period, Fisher\u2019s estate still did not establish that these products were a substantial factor in causing Fisher\u2019s mesothelioma.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court granted both summary-judgment motions, finding that Fisher\u2019s estate failed to produce any evidence that Fisher was exposed to any products supplied by A. Louis or Clark and that it failed to produce evidence that exposure to asbestos products supplied by A. Louis or Clark were a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>factor in causing his mesothelioma. It is from these judgments that Fisher\u2019s estate appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">{\u00b6 5} Appellate review of summary judgment is de novo, governed by the standard set forth in Civ.R. 56. <em>Comer v. Risko, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 185, 2005-Ohio-4559, 833 N.E.2d 712, \u00b6 8. Accordingly, we afford no deference to the trial court\u2019s decision and independently review the record to determine whether summary judgment is appropriate. <em>Hollins v. Shaffer. </em>182 Ohio App.3d 282, 2009-Ohio-2136, 912 N.E.2d 637, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">{\u00b6 6} As in any case, summary judgment is appropriate in an asbestos case \u201cwhen, looking at the evidence as a whole, (1) no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence, construed most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that reasonable minds could only conclude in favor of the moving party.\u201d Civ.R. 56; <em>Horton v. Harwick Chem. Corp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 679, 653 N.E.2d 1196, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Asbestos Law</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">{\u00b6 7} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201c[f]or each defendant in a multidefendant asbestos case, the plaintiff has the burden of proving exposure to the defendant\u2019s product and that the product was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Horton, </em>paragraph one of the syllabus. In <em>Horton, </em>the Supreme Court adopted the definition of \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965), Section 431, Comment a:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe word \u2018substantial\u2019 is used to denote the fact that the defendant\u2019s conduct has such an effect in producing the harm as to lead [a reasonable person] to regard it as a cause, using that word in a popular sense, in which there always lurks the idea of responsibility, rather than the so-called \u2018philosophical sense,\u2019 which includes every one of the great number of events without which any happening would not have occurred.\u201d Id. at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">{\u00b6 9} Fisher\u2019s estate cites <em>Horton </em>to support what it claims a plaintiff needs to prove regarding \u201csubstantial factor.\u201d Specifically, it quotes paragraph two of the <em>Horton </em>syllabus, where the Ohio Supreme Court explicitly \u201cdisapproved\u201d the \u201cfrequent-proximity\u201d test set forth in <em>Lohrmann v. Pittsburgh Corning Corp. </em>(C.A.4, 1986), 782 F.2d 1156. In paragraph two of the <em>Horton </em>syllabus, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a] plaintiff need not prove that he was exposed to a specific product on a regular basis over some extended period of time in close proximity to where the plaintiff actually worked in order to prove that the product was a substantial factor in causing his injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">{\u00b6 10} But Fisher\u2019s estate fails to acknowledge that \u201c[t]he General Assembly effectively overruled paragraph two of the syllabus to <em>Horton </em>with the adoption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>of R.C. 2307.96(B), effective to cases filed on or after September 2, 2004.\u201d <em>Vince v. Crane Co., </em>8th Dist. No. 87955, 2007-Ohio-1155, 2007 WL 766114, fn. 3. Since this case was filed in 2006, R.C. 2307.96(B) is applicable. Thus, this provision sets forth Fisher\u2019s estate\u2019s burden in establishing that each defendant\u2019s product was a substantial factor in causing Fisher\u2019s mesothelioma. It provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(B) A plaintiff in a tort action who alleges any injury or loss to person resulting from exposure to asbestos has the burden of proving that the plaintiff was exposed to asbestos that was manufactured, supplied, installed, or used by the defendant in the action and that the plaintiffs exposure to the defendant\u2019s asbestos was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs injury or loss. In determining whether exposure to a particular defendant\u2019s asbestos was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs injury or loss, the trier of fact in the action shall consider, without limitation, all of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(1) The manner in which the plaintiff was exposed to the defendant\u2019s asbestos;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(2) The proximity of the defendant\u2019s asbestos to the plaintiff when the exposure to the defendant\u2019s asbestos occurred;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(3) The frequency and length of the plaintiffs exposure to the defendant\u2019s asbestos;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(4) Any factors that mitigated or enhanced the plaintiffs exposure to asbestos.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">{\u00b6 16} In adopting R.C. 2307.96(B), the General Assembly explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cIt is the intent of the General Assembly in enacting section 2307.96 of the Revised Code in this act to establish specific factors to be considered when determining whether a particular plaintiffs exposure to a particular defendant\u2019s asbestos was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs injury or loss. The consideration of these factors involving the plaintiffs proximity to the asbestos exposure, frequency of the exposure, or regularity of the exposure in tort actions involving exposure to asbestos is consistent with the factors listed by the court in <em>Lohrmann v. Pittsburgh Corning [Corp.] </em>(4th Cir.1986), 782 F.2d 1156. The General Assembly by its enactment of those factors intends to clarify and define for judges and juries that evidence which is relevant to the common law requirement that plaintiff must prove proximate causation. It recognizes this section\u2019s language is contrary to the language contained in paragraph 2 of the syllabus of the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>[Horton </em>]. * * * The <em>Lohrmann </em>standard provides litigants, juries, and the courts of Ohio an objective and easily applied standard for determining whether a plaintiff has submitted evidence sufficient to sustain plaintiffs burden of proof as to proximate causation. Where specific evidence of frequency of exposure, proximity and length of exposure to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>particular defendant\u2019s asbestos is lacking, summary judgment is appropriate in tort actions involving asbestos because such a plaintiff lacks any evidence of an essential element necessary to prevail. To submit a legal concept such as a \u2018substantial factor\u2019 to a jury in these complex cases without such scientifically valid defining factors would be to invite speculation on the part of juries, something that the General Assembly has determined not to be in the best interests of Ohio and its courts.\u201d Section 5, 150 Ohio Laws, Part III, 8970, 3992.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Deposition Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">{\u00b6 18} At the outset, A. Louis and Clark argue that Fisher\u2019s deposition cannot be considered for purposes of summary judgment, because they had not been served with process at the time he was deposed and therefore they did not have the opportunity to cross-examine him.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">{\u00b6 19} Fisher testified by video deposition on June 9, 2006, while under the care of hospice. Nearly 20 attorneys, each representing a different defendant, were present at the deposition. Fisher\u2019s counsel stipulated prior to the deposition and on the record that all objections would be preserved for the record to ensure that the deposition was completed efficiently. Fisher\u2019s counsel further represented that he would not ask Fisher any defendant-specific asbestos product identification, which meant that he would ask Fisher only about his exposure to \u201cgeneric asbestos products.\u201d And of the nearly 20 attorneys present at the deposition, only three cross-examined Fisher, and those examinations were <em>very brief; </em>the cross-examination took up five pages of the 48-page transcript. We therefore find that A. Louis and Clark were not prejudiced in any way by not being present at Fisher\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">{\u00b6 20} Fisher worked as an electrician at Reactive Metals from 1957 to 1963. He then worked at Cabot Titania for a short time, until he obtained employment as an electrician at Packard Electric in Warren, Ohio, where he worked until he retired in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">{\u00b6 21} Fisher testified that at Reactive Metals, he worked alongside pipefitters throughout the plant. He explained that heated pipes carrying sodium were insulated with asbestos insulation. Electricians were directly involved with this process because they were responsible for placing cal-rods, or heating elements, on the insulation to keep the pipes heated and the sodium flowing. At that time, they did not have asbestos insulation that would fit around the \u201celbows\u201d of the pipes, so the pipefitters would take chunks of asbestos and place it in five-gallon buckets to make a paste-like substance to put around the elbows of the pipes. Anytime the pipefitters had to place new asbestos insulation around the pipes, Fisher said, there was dust everywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Fisher also explained that he was around pipefitters when they cut asbestos gaskets. Pipefitters had to cut gaskets by hand because they were odd sizes. When asked, \u201cWere you throughout the plant, around [pipefitters], when they were working with gaskets,\u201d Fisher replied, \u201cProbably 90% of the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">{\u00b6 23} Fisher further agreed that he was familiar with packing material used around valves and pumps, and that it was throughout the plant. Fisher said that he was also around millwrights when they were welding and used asbestos blankets to prevent fire, and he worked in and around furnaces where asbestos blankets were used to insulate the furnaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">{\u00b6 24} Dennis Songer testified that he began working at Reactive Metals in 1957 with Fisher. At that time, Reactive Metals had just built that facility. Songer was also an electrician, and worked side by side with Fisher. Songer estimated that there were about 14 electricians, and they all worked together.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b6 25} Songer testified that electricians worked side by side with the pipefitters and sometimes the millwrights. He explained that the electricians worked directly with the asbestos insulation on the pipes because they had to replace the cal-rods, which heated the pipes. He further described that the pipefitters would place the insulation on the pipes, creating a lot of dust that they all breathed. Then the electricians would wrap the cal-rod over the insulation on the pipes. Sometimes, the electricians had to pull the insulation off to replace the cal-rods, which also created a lot of dust. The electricians also removed insulation on filters to place new heating elements on \u201cvessels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">{\u00b6 26} Songer also explained that he recalled seeing boxes of half-piece J.M. pipe insulation. He further recalled a brand name of Garlock, but stated, \u201cI can\u2019t remember what it was. I think it was kind of like a rope affair.\u201d Songer said that the pipefitters used it around \u201cvalves and things,\u201d and said that Fisher would have been around whatever the pipefitters were working on.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">{\u00b6 27} Songer further testified that the electricians worked around asbestos blankets that were placed on the furnaces that heated the reactors where the metals were made. The electricians placed the cal-rods that heated the pipes attached to the reactors.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">{\u00b6 28} John Gozzard testified that he also began working at Reactive Metals in 1957 and retired from there after 33 years. He explained that in 1960, Reactive Metals had 500 or 600 employees. He worked in the storeroom during the years Fisher worked there. He was responsible for working the window, handing out materials, and receiving materials. He explained that the two-story storeroom was located in the middle of the building, next to the electrician shop. On the other side of the electrician shop was the machine shop, and next to the machine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>shop was the pipefitter shop. The storeroom was enclosed, but the \u201cshops\u201d were all open.</p>\n<p id=\"Atq\">{\u00b6 29} Gozzard said that there was a tremendous amount of piping in the plant, thousands of feet of piping, which was all covered with asbestos insulation. Gozzard explained that most of the asbestos insulation in the storeroom was left over from the construction of the plant, but he did not know who had supplied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">{\u00b6 30} Gozzard testified that Fisher would come to the storeroom three or four times a day to get wiring or electrical parts, but said he never gave Fisher any asbestos products. The wiring was stored on the second floor of the storeroom, where blanket asbestos, asbestos sheet gasket, and asbestos pipe insulation were kept. Pipefitters were the ones who used the asbestos sheet gasket material, which they cut in the pipefitter shop. The electricians, who were responsible for replacing cal-rods, worked directly with the pipefitters.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">{\u00b6 31} Gozzard recalled that the asbestos pipe insulation and asbestos gaskets were manufactured by Johns Manville (\u201cJ.M.\u201d). He said that F.B. Wright supplied most of the J.M. pipe insulation to Reactive Metals. He further explained that F.B. Wright supplied most of the asbestos products to Reactive Metals, including gaskets, blankets, gloves, and packing. He recalled that Reactive Metals also received asbestos packing from Trumbull Supply. And it had asbestos tubing and block insulation in the plant, but he could not recall who supplied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">{\u00b6 32} Gozzard testified that A. Louis supplied asbestos gaskets and braided asbestos packing to RMI during the years Fisher worked there. He estimated that A. Louis supplied 10 to 15 percent of the gaskets and packing material to Reactive Metals. But he said that A. Louis was only a backup supplier. Gozzard explained that he knew the gaskets contained asbestos because they had a tag on them that said \u201casbestos,\u201d and they were bundled in groups of 25, marked with \u201cJohns Manville.\u201d He stated that the invoices from A. Louis also said \u201casbestos gaskets.\u201d He estimated that Reactive Metals purchased about 100 gaskets from A. Louis. And he agreed that A. Louis supplied only precut gaskets. According to Gozzard, Reactive Metals also purchased asbestos packing material from A. Louis, but he agreed that such purchases were infrequent. He did not know who manufactured the packing material that A. Louis supplied, because it was not labeled. But he explained that it came in boxes of one-pound or five-pound spools. He further explained that although it was not marked, he believed the packing from A. Louis contained asbestos because it looked like \u201cbraided asbestos packing.\u201d Pipefitters and mechanics used the packing material, and pipefitters and production personnel used the gaskets.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>{\u00b6 33} Gozzard also recalled that in addition to J.M. pipe insulation, the workers also used Kaylo brand, but he could not recall who supplied it to Reactive Metals.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Unverified Documents under Civ.R. 56</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">{\u00b6 34} In response to defendants\u2019 summary-judgment motions, Fisher\u2019s estate presented a letter from Jerome Bennett dated December 15, 2006. The letter is on RTI International Metals, Inc. (\u201cRTI\u201d) letterhead, indicating that RTI was located in Niles, Ohio. Bennett\u2019s name and title, director of human resources, was listed at the top of the letter. The letter is addressed to one of the attorneys for Fisher\u2019s estate, and states that it is in response to the attorney\u2019s letter dated November 2, 2006, regarding documents she requested. The November 2, 2006 letter is not in the record on appeal. Bennett then states:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cIt was necessary to search our inventory of archived documents to attempt to find such documents. The documents that we were able to find indicate that Mr. Fisher resigned his employment with RMI Titanium Company (formerly Reactive Metals, Inc.) on June 14, 1963. * * * Additionally, I did discover a listing of vendors and material sold to RMI that may or may not have contained asbestos during that period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">{\u00b6 36} Attached to Bennett\u2019s letter was an internal letter of RMI dated March 14, 1983. The subject of the letter is \u201cPast Procurement Record of Asbestos Material \u2014 Metals Reduction Plant.\u201d It then lists vendors and number of orders for each vendor. Relative to this appeal, the list indicates that RMI received several orders of asbestos products from Clark and many more orders from A. Louis.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">{\u00b6 37} Clark and A. Louis argue that the vendor list cannot be used to oppose their summary-judgment motions because it is not appropriate evidence under Civ.R. 56(C), and it was not submitted with an affidavit. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">{\u00b6 38} Civ.R. 56(C) provides that summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. No evidence or stipulation may be considered except as stated in this rule.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">{\u00b6 39} If a document does not fall within the categories listed in the rule, the evidence can be submitted into evidence only by way of an affidavit. <em>Watts v. Watts </em>(Mar. 18,1994), 6th Dist. No. CV 91-0302,1994 WL 88765; <em>Martin v. Cent. Ohio Transit Auth. </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 83, 89, 590 N.E.2d 411. Civ.R. 56(E) provides how evidence submitted by affidavits that meet certain standards can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>considered. Civ.R. 56(E) provides that \u201c[supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts of papers referred to in an affidavit shall be attached to or served with the affidavit. The court may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions or by further affidavits. When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the party\u2019s pleadings, but the party\u2019s response, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 40} Thus, Civ.R. 56 does not permit a party to submit unauthenticated copies of documents. <em>HSBC Mtge. Servs., Inc. v. McGuire, </em>7th Dist. No. 07 CO 44, 2008-Ohio-6586, 2008 WL 5233547, \u00b6 17; <em>Watts; </em>and <em>Leibold v. Columbus </em>(Nov. 15, 1977), 10th Dist. No. 77AP-142, 1977 WL 200571. The court in <em>Watts </em>explained, \u201cThe import of Civ.R. 56(E) is that all documents relied upon must be authenticated by and attached to an affidavit that meets the requirements of Civ.R. 56(E); the affiant must be a person through whom the exhibits could be admitted into evidence.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 41} Fisher\u2019s estate contends that the Jerome Bennett letter is a written admission and thus qualifies as proper evidence under Civ.R. 56. But we disagree that it is a written admission. It indicates that Bennett is the human resource director of a company called RTI, not Reactive Metals. It does not explain the relationship between RTI and Reactive Metals. Even if we could assume that RTI and Reactive Metals are the same company, as Fisher\u2019s estate suggests, the accompanying vendor list is dated March 14, 1983, 16 years after Fisher left Reactive Metals. Thus, even if we found it to be proper evidence, it does not indicate that A. Louis\u2019s or Clark\u2019s asbestos products were at Reactive Metals during the time that Fisher was employed there. Accordingly, we disagree that it qualifies as a written admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">{\u00b6 42} Fisher\u2019s estate also attached several invoices from Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corporation, purporting to show that Clark distributed asbestos products, specifically, Kaylo pipe insulation, to Reactive Metals in the early 1960s. Some of the invoices are dated after Fisher left Reactive Metals, but some are dated from 1960 to 1963, when Fisher still worked there. But these purported invoices are merely copies, not \u201csworn or certified,\u201d and not attached to an affidavit verifying that the documents are what they purport to be. Accordingly, they are not proper evidence under Civ.R. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Specific Evidence Relating to Clark</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">{\u00b643} Without the vendor list or the Owens-Corning invoices, there is no evidence that Clark\u2019s asbestos products were in the Reactive Metals facility during the time that Fisher worked there, since none of the deposition witnesses testified as to any Clark products. Thus, no question of material fact as to Fisher\u2019s exposure to Clark\u2019s products can remain if Fisher\u2019s estate did not even establish that Clark\u2019s products were in the Reactive Metals plant when Fisher worked there. We therefore find that the trial court properly granted summary judgment to Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Specific Evidence Relating to A. Louis</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">{\u00b6 44} Fisher\u2019s estate contends that \u201c[t]he undisputed evidence in the record establishes that during Mr. Fisher\u2019s employment at Reactive Metals, [A. Louis] supplied asbestos-containing products to the facility.\u201d It further argues that it established, through Fisher\u2019s and Songer\u2019s testimony, that Fisher frequently worked around pipefitters and was exposed to dust created by their use of asbestos products, including those supplied by A. Louis. This evidence, coupled with \u201cthe uncontradicted evidence of [Fisher\u2019s estate\u2019s] experts,\u201d establishes that A. Louis\u2019s asbestos products were a substantial factor in causing his mesothelioma.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">{\u00b6 45} Louis concedes that the record establishes that there was evidence, through Gozzard\u2019s testimony, placing \u201ca relatively small amount\u201d of its asbestos products in the Reactive Metals facility during Fisher\u2019s employment. But A. Louis claims that neither Gozzard\u2019s testimony, nor any other witnesses\u2019 testimony, established that Fisher was actually \u201cexposed to any asbestos from any material supplied\u201d by it or that it was a substantial factor in causing his mesothelioma.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">{\u00b6 46} The evidence against A. Louis consisted of Fisher\u2019s, Songer\u2019s, and Gozzard\u2019s testimony. Viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, Fisher\u2019s estate, Gozzard\u2019s testimony established that A. Louis supplied two asbestos products during Fisher\u2019s employment at Reactive Metals: precut gaskets and braided packing material.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">{\u00b6 47} This court has held, even before the adoption of the more stringent standard set forth in R.C. 2307.96(B), that merely placing a defendant\u2019s asbestos product in the workplace is not enough. <em>Vince, </em>2007-Ohio-1155, 2007 WL 766114, at \u00b6 13. A plaintiff must still establish that the product was a substantial factor in causing his injury. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">{\u00b6 48} To determine whether a plaintiff did establish that a particular defendant\u2019s product was a substantial factor, this court must consider the factors set forth in R.C. 2307.96(B)(1) through (4) (i.e., manner, proximity, frequency, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>mitigating factors). Our research indicates that since this statute went into effect, only six cases have cited it. And none of the six cases actually addressed these four requirements, because the plaintiffs in those cases filed their cases before the effective date of R.C. 2307.96(B), which the legislature explicitly made prospective only.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">{\u00b6 49} Considering the R.C. 2307.96(B) factors, we find that Fisher\u2019s estate presented sufficient evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, to create a question of fact regarding whether A. Louis\u2019s products were a substantial factor in causing Fisher\u2019s mesothelioma.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">{\u00b6 50} Fisher worked at Reactive Metals for almost six years. Fisher, Songer, and Gozzard specifically testified that electricians worked alongside pipefitters as part of their regular job. Indeed, Fisher and Songer testified that they worked side by side with pipefitters when they were cutting and placing asbestos gaskets and packing material throughout the plant. Although the gaskets supplied by A. Louis were precut, Fisher testified that they were odd sizes and had to be cut to fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">{\u00b6 51} In <em>Horton, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court described the concerns the <em>Lohrmann </em>court had. Because the General Assembly explicitly adopted the <em>Lohrmann </em>test, we find the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s explanation of <em>Lohrmann </em>helpful despite the fact that in <em>Horton, </em>it was rejecting the <em>Lohrmann </em>test. The Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cIndeed, the <em>Lohrmann </em>test is the product of the attempts of Maryland federal courts to deal with claims brought by employees of shipyards, workplaces so large that fiber drift might seem impossible. The <em>Lohrmann </em>court stressed the immensity of the shipyard in that case as a reason for affirming the district court\u2019s use of what later became known as the <em>Lohrmann </em>test:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c \u2018[W]hen one considers the size of a workplace such as Key Highway Shipyard, the mere proof that the plaintiff and a certain asbestos product are at the shipyard at the same time, without more, does not prove exposure to that product.\u2019 <em>Lohrmann, </em>782 F.2d at 1162.\u201d <em>Horton, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 679, 653 N.E.2d 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">{\u00b6 54} But here, we are not concerned with fiber drift. Fisher\u2019s estate presented sufficient evidence to create a question of fact whether he worked alongside pipefitters as a regular part of his job and as a result, was directly exposed to asbestos fibers.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">{\u00b6 55} Accordingly, this court finds that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment to A. Louis.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>{\u00b6 56} Judgment affirmed with respect to Clark, but reversed with respect to A. Louis. This case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b138-6\">Kilbane, A.J., and Rocco, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
