After review, we affirm his convictions, but remand the case for a limited hearing on court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">{\u00b6 2} In October 2009, Butler was charged in a six-count indictment. Counts 1 and 2 charged him with aggravated burglary, Counts 3 and 4 charged aggravated robbery, and Counts 5 and 6 charged him with kidnapping.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The matter proceeded to a jury trial, at which he was found guilty of all charges as an aider and abettor. The trial court sentenced him to five years on each of Counts 1 and 2, to be served concurrently with each other, five years on each of Counts 3 and 4, to be served concurrently with each other, and five years on each of Counts 5 and 6, to be served concurrently with each other. The court ordered that the counts run concurrently with each other and consecutively to Counts 1 and 3. The trial court also sentenced Butler to three years in prison on the firearm specification on each count, to be served prior to and consecutively to each of Counts 1 through 6, for an aggregate of 18 years in prison.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">{\u00b6 3} The following evidence was adduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">{\u00b6 4} On October 3, 2009, Gilbert Hart and Gerald Jones were refurbishing a house in Lakewood, Ohio owned by John Allen. Hart and Jones were working in the bathroom upstairs when three men entered the bathroom and ordered Jones by gunpoint to bind Hart\u2019s wrists and ankles with duct tape. One of the assailants then restrained Jones in the same manner. The men told Hart and Jones that they were \u201cbounty hunters\u201d looking for Allen. Apparently, Allen had recently won $3,500 in an illegal craps game with the bounty hunters. Hart told the bounty hunters that Allen had left for the day. They ordered Hart at gunpoint to call Allen and request more supplies. Allen responded that he was on the other side of town and that he would be there later.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The bounty hunters then questioned Jones for Allen\u2019s home address. Jones responded that he did not know where Allen lived. While the victims were restrained, the bounty hunters took $4 from Jones and $80 from Hart. During this ordeal, the bounty hunters spoke with someone on their cell phones. Hart testified that he did not see who was outside, but his impression was that there was someone outside the house acting as a lookout because the bounty hunters talked to the lookout on their cell phone and got upset when he did not tell them that the neighbors came home.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">{\u00b6 6} Hart testified that the bounty hunters told the person outside, who was later determined to be Butler, to go to the local convenience store for snacks, drinks, papers to smoke marijuana, and duct tape. The surveillance video from the convenience store revealed that an African-American male exited a white van and entered the store. This male wore a tan baseball cap and a jacket, shirt, pants, and shoes all dark in color. From what could be observed from the video, the male purchased potato chips and a drink. The tan hat worn by the male in the surveillance video was similar to a tan hat found in Hart\u2019s vehicle when Butler was arrested. The DNA on this hat matched Butler\u2019s DNA. Furthermore, the shirt worn by the male in the video appeared to have some sort of white coloring on the front. When Butler was arrested, he was wearing a black shirt with a white design that was very similar to the design observed on the shirt worn by the man in the video.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 7} The bounty hunters then had Hart call Allen again. Allen responded that he was busy and that he would be there shortly. At one point, the bounty hunters took Hart and Jones to the basement and made Hart call Allen for a third time. Allen said that he was home and that he was not coming to the Lakewood property. After being in the basement for approximately an hour and a half, Jones told the bounty hunters that Allen lived in Lorain. The bounty hunters left Hart in the basement and put Jones in Hart\u2019s car. Jones testified that there were three other men in the car with him, and his hands and feet were bound with duct tape while he was in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">{\u00b6 8} During the drive to Allen\u2019s house, the bounty hunters were on their cell phones, a circumstance that gave Jones the impression that there was another car following them. When they arrived at Allen\u2019s house, Jones was ordered to lie down in the back seat. Approximately ten minutes later, Butler got into the driver\u2019s seat of Hart\u2019s car, with Jones bound and lying down in the back seat. They did not speak, but Jones heard Butler\u2019s cell phone vibrate as if he were receiving calls.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The police arrived shortly thereafter and found Butler sitting in the driver\u2019s seat and Jones bound in the back seat of Hart\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Butler now appeals, raising nine assignments of error for review, which shall be discussed together and out of order where appropriate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">Assignment of Error One</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">Butler\u2019s convictions are not supported [by] legally sufficient evidence as required by state and federal due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">Assignment of Error Four</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">Butler\u2019s burglary convictions are not supported [by] legally sufficient evidence as required by state and federal due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">{\u00b6 10} The Ohio Supreme Court has explained the standard for sufficiency of the evidence in <em>State v.

In reviewing such a challenge, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">{\u00b6 11} In the instant case, Butler was convicted of aggravated burglary under R.C. 2911.11(A)(2), aggravated robbery under 2911.01(A)(1), and kidnapping under 2905.01(A)(2). R.C. 2911.11(A)(2) provides, \u201cNo person, by force, stealth, or deception, shall trespass in an occupied structure * * *, when another person other than an accomplice of the offender is present, with purpose to commit in the structure * * * any criminal offense, if * * * [t]he offender has a deadly weapon * * * on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) provides, \u201cNo person, in attempting or committing a theft offense,* * * or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall * * * [h]ave a deadly weapon on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control and either display the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender possesses it, or use it[.]\u201d R.C. 2905.01(A)(2) provides, \u201cNo person, by force, threat, or deception * * * shall remove another from the place where the other person is found or restrain the liberty of the other person * * * [t]o facilitate the commission of any felony or flight thereafter[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">{\u00b6 13} Butler argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to find that he participated in these crimes. He claims that his mere presence at the scene is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>not sufficient to prove that he aided and abetted the bounty hunters when they burglarized the Lakewood property and kidnapped and robbed Jones and Hart.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">{\u00b6 14} Ohio\u2019s complicity statute, R.C. 2923.03(A)(2), provides, \u201cNo person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense, shall * * * [a]id or abet another in committing the offense[.]\u201d Id. A person aids or abets in a crime when the evidence demonstrates that \u201cthe defendant supported, assisted, encouraged, cooperated with, advised, or incited the principal in the commission of the crime, and that the defendant shared the criminal intent of the principal.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 754 N.E.2d 796, syllabus. Criminal intent \u201c \u2018may be inferred from [the] presence, companionship and conduct [of the defendant] before and after the offense is committed.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 245, 754 N.E.2d 796, quoting <em>State v. Pruett </em>(1971), 28 Ohio App.2d 29, 57 O.O.2d 38, 273 N.E.2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c[T]he mere presence of an accused at the scene of a crime is not sufficient to prove, in and of itself, that the accused was an aider and abettor.\u201d <em>State v. Widner </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 267, 269, 23 0.0.3d 265, 431 N.E.2d 1025. However, aiding and abetting may be established by overt acts of assistance such as driving a getaway car or serving as a lookout. <em>State v. Cartellone </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 145, 150, 3 OBR 163, 444 N.E.2d 68. \u201cEvidence of aiding and abetting another in the commission of crime may be demonstrated by both direct and circumstantial evidence.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">{\u00b6 16} We find that the evidence in the instant case implicates Butler in the commission of these crimes beyond his mere presence at the scene and later in Hart\u2019s car. Hart testified that three men unexpectedly entered the upstairs bathroom while he and Jones were working. Once the assailants were in the bathroom, they ordered Jones at gunpoint to bind Hart\u2019s wrists and ankles with duct tape. One of the assailants then restrained Jones\u2019s wrists and ankles in the same manner. The men told Hart and Jones that they were \u201cbounty hunters\u201d looking for Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">{\u00b6 17} A further review of the record indicates that the bounty hunters also took $4 from Jones and $80 from Hart and sent Butler to the local convenience store to pick up supplies. Hart testified that he did not see who was outside, but believed that someone was outside acting as a lookout because the bounty hunters talked to someone on their cell phones, and they got upset when the lookout did not tell them that the neighbors came home.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">{\u00b6 18} The surveillance video from the convenience store revealed that an African-American male exited a white van and entered the store. This male wore a tan baseball cap and a jacket, shirt, pants, and shoes, all dark in color. From what could be observed from the video, the male purchased potato chips <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>and a drink. The tan hat worn by the male in the surveillance video was similar to a tan hat found in Hart\u2019s vehicle when Butler was arrested. The DNA on this hat matched Butler\u2019s DNA. Furthermore, the shirt worn by the male in the video appeared to have some sort of white coloring on the front. When Butler was arrested, he was wearing a black shirt with a white design that was very similar to the design observed in the video.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 19} The bounty hunters also took Hart and Jones to the basement for approximately an hour and a half, at which point Jones told the bounty hunters that Allen lived in Lorain. The bounty hunters then put Jones in Hart\u2019s car. Jones testified that his hands and feet were bound with duct tape and that the men put him in the back seat of Hart\u2019s car. During the drive to Allen\u2019s house, the bounty hunters were on their cell phones, so Jones had the impression that there was another car following them.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">{\u00b6 20} When they arrived at Allen\u2019s house, Jones was ordered to lie down in the back seat. Approximately ten minutes later, Butler got into the driver\u2019s seat of Hart\u2019s car, with Jones lying down and bound in the back seat. They did not speak, but Jones heard Butler\u2019s cell phone vibrate as if he were receiving calls. The police arrived shortly thereafter and found Butler sitting in the driver\u2019s seat and Jones bound in the back seat of Hart\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 21} The police found potato chip bags in Hart\u2019s car similar to the potato chip bags purchased at the convenience store, which was captured on the store video. The police also found a vehicle stolen from Cleveland in close proximity to Hart\u2019s car. Furthermore, three days later, Lakewood police observed a white van registered to Butler parked approximately 16 houses away from Allen\u2019s Lakewood property.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">{\u00b6 22} Butler further argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to convict him of aggravated burglary because the state failed to prove that the trespass into the Lakewood property occurred by \u201cforce, stealth, or deception,\u201d as required by R.C. 2911.11(A)(2). He claims that there was insufficient evidence regarding how the bounty hunters had entered the Lakewood property because Jones and Hart did not witness the entry and there was no physical evidence of a forced entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">{\u00b6 28} Although there was no direct testimony as to how the men gained entry into the house, circumstantial evidence supports the inference that they gained entrance by stealth. \u201cStealth\u201d has been defined as \u201c \u2018any secret, sly or clandestine act to avoid discovery and to gain entrance into or to remain within a residence of another without permission.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Sims, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84090, 2005-Ohio-1978, 2005 WL 984499, \u00b6 5, fn. 3, quoting <em>State v. Ward </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 537, 540, 620 N.E.2d 168; see also <em>State v. Gibbs, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 94349, 2011-Ohio-76, 2011 WL 198467.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Here, Hart testified that the men sneaked upstairs. He believed that the front door was locked, but other workers must have left the back door unlocked. The bounty hunters did not announce their presence in the home. As a result, Hart and Jones were shocked to see them because they had thought that the doors were locked. Based on this evidence, we find a nexus between the surprise of Hart and Jones upon seeing the men in the bathroom and the manner and means by which they gained entrance. Thus, we can infer that the bounty hunters entered the house by stealth. \u201cBecause circumstantial evidence is given the same weight as direct evidence, sufficient evidence was presented that * * * the [burglaries were committed] with stealth.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 92668, 2009-Ohio-6826, 2009 WL 4986108, \u00b6 12, citing <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph one of the syllabus. See also <em>State v. Pickens, </em>Crawford App. No. 3-07-30, 2008-Ohio-1140, 2008 WL 697110, \u00b6 19 (the Third District Court of Appeals found sufficient evidence to meet the definition of \u201cforce, stealth, or deception\u201d when the defendant \u201centered through an unlocked door during the morning hours of January 20, 2007 [and] did not knock before entering * * * to alert [the victim] to his presence in the home\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">{\u00b6 25} Based on these facts, when viewing them in a light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could find that the state presented evidence that established the essential elements of aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">{\u00b626} Accordingly, the first and fourth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Assignment of Error Five</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">The trial court committed plain error when it instructed the jury that finding an open door and entering it can constitute trespass by \u201cstealth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">{\u00b6 27} Butler argues that his aggravated-burglary convictions were a direct result of an erroneous instruction by the trial court regarding a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">{\u00b6 28} In the instant case, the trial court instructed the jury that to convict Butler of aggravated burglary, it \u201cmust find beyond a reasonable doubt that * * * [Butler] * * * by force, stealth or deception, trespassed in an occupied structure * * * when another person other than the accomplice of the offender is present with purpose to commit * * * in the structure * * * any criminal offense. In this case you\u2019re using an aggravated burglary.\u201d The trial court defined stealth as \u201cany secret or sly act to gain entrance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">{\u00b6 29} During deliberations, the jury asked the trial court, \u201cDoes finding an open door and entering it constitute a secret or sly act?\u201d The trial court responded, \u201cEntering an occupied residence without permission of the owner or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>occupant can be a stealthful entry in an * * * aggravated burglary, but all the other elements must also be met.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">{\u00b6 30} We note that trial counsel did not object to the trial court\u2019s answer, so we review for plain error. To prevail on a claim of plain error, Butler must demonstrate that but for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise. <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, at paragraph two of the syllabus; see also Crim.R. 52(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b6 31} Butler contends that the trial court should have instructed the jury that finding an open door and entering it during daytime does not constitute trespass by stealth. However, the trial court\u2019s instruction was not erroneous, as \u201cstealth\u201d has been defined to include \u201c \u2018any secret, sly or clandestine act to avoid discovery and to gain entrance into or to remain within a residence of another without permission.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sims, </em>2005-Ohio-1978, 2005 WL 984499, \u00b6 5, fn. 3, quoting <em>Ward, </em>85 Ohio App.3d at 540, 620 N.E.2d 168. Moreover, Butler has failed to demonstrate how the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">{\u00b6 32} Thus, the fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Assignment of Error Six</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">Butler was denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution when his attorney failed to object to an erroneous instruction on the \u201cstealth\u201d element of aggravated burglary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">{\u00b6 33} In order to substantiate a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, Butler must demonstrate \u201c(a) deficient performance (\u2018errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment\u2019) and (b) prejudice (\u2018errors * * * so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is rehable\u2019). <em>Strickland v.

Maxwell </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St.2d 299, 31 O.O.2d 567, 209 N.E.2d 164. In evaluating whether a petitioner has been denied the effective assistance of counsel, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that the test is \u201cwhether the accused, under all the circumstances, * * * had a fair trial and substantial justice was done.\u201d <em>State v. Hester </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 71, 74 O.O.2d 156, 341 N.E.2d 304, paragraph four of the syllabus. When making that evaluation, a court must determine \u201cwhether there has been a substantial violation of any of defense counsel\u2019s essential duties to his client\u201d and \u201cwhether the defense was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.\u201d <em>State v.

To demonstrate that a defendant has been prejudiced, the defendant must prove \u201cthat there exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">{\u00b6 35} Butler argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s \u201cstealth question.\u201d However, having found that the instruction was proper, we conclude that Butler has failed to demonstrate how the result of the trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">{\u00b6 36} Therefore, the sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Assignment of Error Two</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-8\">Butler\u2019s Fifth [and] Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated when the trial court erroneously permitted the prosecutor to elicit testimony on Butler\u2019s pre-trial silence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">{\u00b6 37} In the instant case, the state asked Lakewood Police Officer Joshua Greer about Butler\u2019s demeanor while he was in police custody. Greer replied, \u201cKind of emotionless, didn\u2019t say anything. Wasn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t appear to be upset, didn\u2019t appear to be worried.\u201d The state then asked, \u201cNow, at this point, do you instruct [Butler] on his <em>Miranda </em>warnings?\u201d Greer replied, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t immediately at that point but a short time later, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">{\u00b6 38} Butler claims that his constitutional rights were violated when the state elicited testimony regarding his <em>post-Miranda, </em>silence because there was no direct evidence of his involvement in any criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">{\u00b6 39} In <em>State v. Leach, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 135, 2004-Ohio-2147, 807 N.E.2d 335, at syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the state\u2019s \u201c[u]se of a defendant\u2019s pre-arrest silence as substantive evidence of guilt violates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d Id. at syllabus. However, this court has declined to overturn convictions based upon a limited inquiry of a defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>warning silence, where it does not constitute a \u201ccontinuous and invading inquiry regarding defendant-appellant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence.\u201d <em>State v. Dixon </em>(Mar. 13, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 68338, 1997 WL 113756, citing <em>Greer v. Miller </em>(1987), 483 U.S. 756, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618; see also <em>State v.

Greer testified that Butler was not advised of his Miranda rights until after his initial observation. Thus, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>indication that the state attempted to use Butler\u2019s invocation of his Fifth Amendment right against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">{\u00b6 41} Accordingly, the second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Assignment of Error Three</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">The trial court denied [Butler] a fair trial and misapplied evidentiary rules on expert testimony when it permitted a police officer to opine, based on his \u201cyears of experience,\u201d that [Butler] had the look of someone \u201ccaught in the commission\u201d of a crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">{\u00b642} In the instant case, the state asked Lorain Police Sergeant Edward Super whether he made any observations as to Butler\u2019s reaction when he was taken into custody. Super testified that Butler looked \u201clike he had resigned himself that he was caught.\u201d He further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">He just, in my years of experience where I see people when * * * [o]ften times when you find people and they\u2019re caught in the commission of their acts, when they realize that there is no chance for them to escape or get away, they kind of have that, just where they\u2019ve surrendered. They know they can\u2019t run, they know they can\u2019t hide, it\u2019s over. That was the * * * impression I got from [Butler],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">{\u00b6 43} Butler argues that the trial court improperly allowed Super to testify as an expert that he [Butler] had the look of someone caught in the commission of a crime. He claims that Super\u2019s testimony may have influenced the jury because there was insufficient evidence to support the state\u2019s theory that he was an integral part of the criminal scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">{\u00b6 44} In <em>State v. Potter, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81037, 2003-Ohio-1338, 2003 WL 1355230, \u00b6 38, this court has previously held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-11\">[T]he opinion of a witness as to whether another witness is being truthful is inadmissible. <em>State v. Miller </em>(Jan. 26, 2001), Montgomery App. No. 18102 [2001 WL 62793] In our system of justice, it is the fact finder, not the witness, who bears the burden of assessing the credibility and veracity of the witnesses. <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 545 N.E.2d 1220. Moreover, jurors are likely to perceive police officers as expert witnesses, especially when such officers are giving opinions about the present case based upon their perceived experiences with other cases. <em>[Miller.] </em>However, in determining whether an error was prejudicial or harmless, a reviewing court must first read the entire record, disregarding the objectionable material. If there is overwhelming evidence of the appellant\u2019s guilt, aside from the disputed material, then it must hold that the error is not prejudicial but is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment. Crim.R. 52, <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18, [87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705]; [s]ee <em>State v. Davis </em>(1975), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>44 Ohio App.2d 335 [73 O.O.2d 395], 338 N.E.2d 793; <em>State v. Dunaway </em>(Oct. 31, 1996), Cuyahoga App. No. 69561 [1996 WL 631091],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">{\u00b6 45} Here, Super essentially testified to his opinion concerning Butler\u2019s guilt. He testified that based on his years of experience, Butler\u2019s actions gave him the impression that he got caught in the commission of a crime. Because jurors are likely to perceive police officers as expert witnesses, especially when such officers are giving opinions about the present case based upon their experience, Super\u2019s testimony, in effect, declared that Butler was guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">{\u00b6 46} Nevertheless, we cannot conclude that this error warrants a reversal of the jury\u2019s verdict. In reviewing the record and disregarding this objectionable testimony, we find overwhelming evidence of Butler\u2019s guilt. Thus, the admission of Super\u2019s testimony was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">{\u00b6 47} Accordingly, the third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Assignment of Error Seven</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">[Butler\u2019s] sentence is contrary to law and violated due process because the trial court failed to consider whether the sentence was consistent with the sentences imposed for similar crimes committed by similar offenders and because an eighteen-year sentence for a first time offender is inconsistent with such sentences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">Assignment of Error Eight</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-11\">[Butler\u2019s] consecutive sentences are contrary to law and violative of due process because the trial court failed to make and articulate the findings and reasons necessary to justify it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">{\u00b6 48} The Ohio Supreme Court set forth the applicable standard of appellate review for felony sentences in <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124, \u00b6 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-13\">In applying <em>[State v.] Foster </em>[109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470] to the existing statutes, appellate courts must apply a two-step approach. First, they must examine the sentencing court\u2019s compliance with all applicable rules and statutes in imposing the sentence to determine whether the sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law. <em>If this first prong is satisfied, the trial court\u2019s decision shall be reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion </em>standard,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1v\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">{\u00b6 49} Butler argues that his sentence is contrary to law and violates due process because the trial court imposed consecutive sentences without making the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>requisite findings required by R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and 2929.41(A). However, Ohio courts have not been required to make these statutory findings since they were severed from Ohio\u2019s sentencing statutes in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">{\u00b6 50} Here, Butler\u2019s 18 years is within the permissible statutory range for his convictions. In the sentencing journal entry, the trial court acknowledged that it had considered all factors of law and found that prison was consistent with the purposes of R.C. 2929.11. Thus, we cannot conclude that his sentence is contrary to law, and we now consider whether it constituted an abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion \u201c \u2018implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140, quoting <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">{\u00b6 51} A review of the record reveals that the trial court considered the facts of the case. The court noted that the victims were brutally attacked and robbed while they were at work. The attack on Jones and Hart lasted for more than eight hours. The bounty hunters then took Jones with them to locate Allen\u2019s home. Butler also made a statement at sentencing. He stated that he exercised bad judgment for the first time in his life. He admitted being at the convenience store. He also admitted bringing marijuana to the Lakewood property to sell to the bounty hunters. He further stated that he served as a lookout and was going to drive the car wherever the bounty hunters needed him to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">{\u00b6 52} Based on the foregoing, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">{\u00b6 53} Butler also argues that the trial court erred when it sentenced him to 18 years in prison. He claims that the sentencing hearing was fundamentally flawed because the trial court failed to consider the consistency and proportionality of his sentence with sentences imposed on similar offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">{\u00b6 54} However, this court has previously held that in order to support a claim that a \u201csentence is disproportionate to sentences imposed upon other offenders, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>defendant must raise this issue before the trial court and present some evidence, however minimal, in order to provide a starting point for analysis and to preserve the issue for appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Edwards, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 89181, 2007-Ohio-6068, 2007 WL 3877209, \u00b6 11. See also <em>State v. Redding, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 90864, 2008-Ohio-5739, 2008 WL 4812477.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">{\u00b6 55} In the instant case, defense counsel argued that Butler should be treated more leniently in light of his age and participation in the crime, but he failed to raise the argument that Butler\u2019s sentence was disproportionate to sentences given to other offenders with similar records who have committed the same offense. Furthermore, Butler failed to \u201cpresent evidence as to what a \u2018proportionate sentence\u2019 might be.\u201d Id. Therefore, he has not preserved the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 56} Accordingly, the seventh and eighth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Assignment of Error Nine</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">The trial court erred and deprived [Butler] of his property without due process of law and his rights under the Sixth Amendment when it imposed costs outside his presence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">{\u00b6 57} Butler argues that the trial court erred when it imposed court costs in the sentencing journal entry without first addressing court costs at his sentencing hearing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">{\u00b6 58} R.C. 2947.23(A)(1) provides, \u201cIn all criminal cases, including violations of ordinances, the judge or magistrate shall include in the sentence the costs of prosecution * * * and render a judgment against the defendant for such costs.\u201d Thus, under R.C. 2947.23, a trial court is required to assess costs against all criminal defendants, and to do so even if the defendant is indigent. <em>State v. White, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 580, 2004-Ohio-5989, 817 N.E.2d 393, \u00b6 14. Waiver of the payment of such costs is permitted, but not required, if the defendant is indigent. Id. at \u00b6 8,14; see also R.C. 2949.092.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">{\u00b6 59} In <em>State v. Joseph, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 76, 2010-Ohio-954, 926 N.E.2d 278, \u00b6 22, the Ohio Supreme Court held that it is reversible error for the trial court to impose costs in its sentencing entry when it did not impose those costs in open court at the sentencing hearing. The court found that the trial court\u2019s error did not void the defendant\u2019s sentence, but held that the defendant had been harmed because the trial court\u2019s failure to mention court costs during resentencing denied him the opportunity to claim indigency and seek waiver of the payment of the costs. Id. Therefore, the court remanded the matter to the trial court to allow the defendant to move the court for a waiver of the payment of court costs. Id. at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>{\u00b6 60} In the instant case, a review of the record reveals that the trial court failed to impose court costs during Butler\u2019s sentencing. Thus, we find that the court erred when it imposed costs in the sentencing entry without first imposing them at the sentencing hearing. As a result, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment only in the respect that it failed to address costs, and we remand the case to the trial court for a limited hearing on court costs, at which Butler could move the court for a waiver of the payment of court costs. Id.; see also <em>State v. Eskridge, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 88581, 2007-Ohio-2766, 2007 WL 1643199, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">{\u00b6 61} Therefore, Butler\u2019s ninth assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">{\u00b6 62} Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for a limited hearing on court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Judgment affirmed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b675-8\">Jones and Rocco, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-11\">. Each count carried a one- and three-year firearm specification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-12\">. The court ordered that all one- and three-year firearm specifications be served concurrently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\">. Approximately 30 minutes after the bounty hunters left with Jones, Hart managed to free himself and call the Lakewood police, who notified the Lorain Police Department that the men had left for Allen's house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b672-15\">. We recognize that <em>Kalish </em>is merely persuasive and not necessarily controlling because it has no majority. The Supreme Court split over whether we review sentences under an abuse-of-discretion standard in some instances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b673-9\">. Butler relies on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Ice </em>(2009), 555 U.S. 160, 129 S.Ct. 711, 172 L.Ed.2d 517, arguing that <em>Ice </em>demonstrates that Ohio's consecutive-sentencing statutes do not violate the Sixth Amendment. However, in <em>State v. Hodge, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 1, 2010-Ohio-6320, 941 N.E.2d 768, the Ohio Supreme Court recently addressed this argument and determined that <em>Ice </em>does not revive these sentencing statutes and that \"[t]rial court judges are not obligated to engage in judicial fact-finding prior to imposing consecutive sentences unless the General Assembly enacts new legislation requiring that findings be made.\u201d Id. at paragraphs two and three of the syllabus.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
