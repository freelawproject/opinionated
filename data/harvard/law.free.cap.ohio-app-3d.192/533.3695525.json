Gallagher, Administrative Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant Pamela Plavecski<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals the jury verdict rendered in favor of appellee Cleveland Clinic Foundation (\u201cCCF\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> finding that Dr. Marc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Williams\u2019s negligence was not the proximate cause of Plavecski\u2019s medical condition and resultant surgery. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 2} On February 3, 2005, Plavecski sought medical treatment for a vaginal infection. Her family doctor, Dr. Williams, was not available to see her on the date she came into the office, but another physician in his practice, Dr. Tulisiak, examined her and prescribed the antibiotic clindamycin. On February 7, Dr. Tulisiak learned from Plavecski\u2019s lab results that pseudomonas was present, so he prescribed an additional antibiotic, Cipro.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 3} On February 8, Plavecski called the office to report that she was experiencing abdominal cramping and diarrhea. Dr. Meacham, the physician on call, advised her to discontinue the clindamycin, to continue the Cipro, and to see Dr. Williams the next day. On February 9, Dr. Williams met with Plavecski in his office to review her symptoms and medical condition. Plavecski advised the medical assistant that the medication had made her sick. During Dr. Williams\u2019s examination, he discovered that Plavecski\u2019s vaginal infection was improved, but he also scheduled her for a pelvic ultrasound that afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 4} The results of Plavecski\u2019s ultrasound were normal according to the report provided to Dr. Williams on February 10, and Plavecski was notified of the results that day. Plavecski did not call or otherwise contact Dr. Williams\u2019s office between February 11 and February 20. On February 21, Plavecski called Dr. Williams\u2019s office to report that she was experiencing diarrhea and vomiting, which began on February 20. She indicated to the medical assistant who took her call that she had finished taking Cipro on the previous Thursday, February 17. On February 22, Dr. Williams received the information regarding Plavecski\u2019s condition, and he recommended she take over-the-counter Imodium, an antimotility agent, to control the diarrhea. Dr. Williams did not examine Plavecski or speak to her on the phone; the information and recommendation to take Imodium was communicated to Plavecski over the phone by Dr. Williams\u2019s medical assistant, as was the procedure in this medical office.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 5} On February 23, Plavecski called Dr. Williams\u2019s office reporting that her mother had passed away the day before, that she had some stomach cramping, and that her diarrhea had improved slightly. She asked for a prescription for something to help her get through her mother\u2019s wake. Relying on this information, Dr. Williams prescribed Ativan, an antianxiety medication, for Plavecski. He also suggested that she continue taking Imodium for her diarrhea. Dr. Williams did not examine Plavecski or speak to her on the phone, but again relied on his assistant to speak with her, as was his office\u2019s practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">{\u00b6 6} On February 24, Plavecski called Dr. Williams\u2019s office to inform him that her diarrhea was persistent. Dr. Williams had Plavecski bring in a stool sample; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>he also prescribed Flagyl.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 25, Plavecski called Dr. Williams\u2019s office to obtain her lab results from the stool sample; she also reported persistent diarrhea. The medical assistant who took Plavecski\u2019s call made a note that the patient sounded short of breath, although Plavecski did not herself report that she was experiencing shortness of breath. Based on this information, Dr. Williams advised Plavecski to seek emergency care. Plavecski went to the emergency room at Medina General Hospital on February 25, where she was admitted. The results of Plavecski\u2019s stool sample showed she was positive for the bacteria Clostridium difficile (\u201cC.diff.\u201d). C.diff. is a bacteria normally found in the colon, but can cause infection or colitis in patients who have been taking certain antibiotics. Infection is generally caused by a build-up of toxins related to an overpopulation of C.diff. bacteria. Under normal circumstances, patients who contract a C.diff. infection improve once they stop taking antibiotics.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqb\">{\u00b6 7} While an in-patient at Medina General Hospital, Plavecski was treated for C.diff. colitis. On March 5, 2005, she was transferred to Cleveland Clinic Hospital, where she underwent a colectomy to remove most of her colon. She later required additional surgery for removal of the temporary ileostomy bag that was created during her March 5 surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 8} On August 27, 2008, Plavecski filed her complaint against Dr. Williams and CCF, alleging medical malpractice. Prior to trial, Plavecski filed several motions in limine. The motions that are relevant to this case sought to preclude reference to certain articles published in The Plain Dealer, which postdated her surgery, to preclude CCF\u2019s expert, Dr. Keith Armitage, from testifying about the existence of an epidemic strain of the C.diff. bacteria, and to preclude any reference to an unfinished clinical trial that examined the connection between the use of antimotility medications by patients with C.diff. Of these three motions, the trial court granted only Plavecski\u2019s motion that would preclude CCF\u2019s expert from referring to the unfinished clinical trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 9} On June 22, 2009, a jury trial commenced. Plavecski\u2019s expert, Dr. John Schaefer, opined that Dr. Williams\u2019s advice to Plavecski that she take Imodium to control her diarrhea was what caused her need for a colectomy. Dr. Schaefer testified that had Dr. Williams considered Plavecski\u2019s recent course of antibiotics for the vaginal infection, he would have known that Plavecski was likely to have a build-up of C.diff. bacteria in her colon. He testified that Imodium, an antimotility medication, typically stops diarrhea from flushing out toxins that come from a build-up of the C.diff. bacteria, and the toxins destroy the colon wall. Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Schaefer further testified that the use of Imodium is contraindicated for C.diff., and had Dr. Williams tested Plavecski for C.diff. bacteria before advising that she take Imodium, she would not have needed a colectomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 10} Dr. Williams testified that he did not initially suspect that Plavecski had C.diff. based on her reported flu-like symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting, especially since she had stopped taking all antibiotics as of February 17. He stated that she had not communicated to his office that her diarrhea had persisted between February 9 and February 20. Dr. Williams determined on February 22 that two reported days of diarrhea and vomiting indicated that Plavecski had intestinal flu. He also testified that Imodium was not the cause of her need for a colectomy. His conclusion was based on information that Dr. Williams had learned from medical literature published after Plavecski\u2019s surgery showing that otherwise healthy patients who presented with the same symptoms she had were infected with the epidemic strain of C.diff. and did not respond to traditional therapy used in treating the ordinary strain of C.diff. Dr. Williams also testified that the Imodium did not actually stop her diarrhea, which meant that the body continued to flush toxins from her colon; therefore, the Imodium could not be the cause of the severity of Plavecski\u2019s infection, and instead she must have been infected with the more virulent strain of C.diff.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 11} Dr. Armitage testified that he conducted a comprehensive review of Plavecski\u2019s medical records and compared her symptoms with those of other patients who were known to have contracted an epidemic strain of C.diff. He opined that Plavecski needed a colectomy because she was infected with the epidemic strain of C.diff. He testified that he drew his conclusion about her condition from reviewing medical literature dated in late 2005 and 2006 and comparing it to the Plavecski\u2019s symptoms. These articles identified a previously unknown strain of C.diff. that was more virulent and not responsive to therapy used in treating the ordinary strain of C.diff.; this epidemic strain was being reported in Canada and in 16 states in the United States, including Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 12} The research showed that the more virulent strain was affecting individuals who were not in high-risk populations; in other words, it was presenting in patients who were relatively young, not immunosuppressed, and not recently hospitalized. Dr. Armitage testified that had Plavecski had the ordinary strain, she would have gotten better once she stopped taking antibiotics regardless of her use of Imodium; the fact that her condition did not improve indicated that she was affected with the epidemic strain, and therefore Dr. Williams\u2019s advice to Plavecski that she take Imodium did not cause her need for a colectomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">{\u00b6 13} The jury found that Dr. Williams deviated from the standard of care, but that Plavecski had not demonstrated that his negligence in prescribing Imodium was the proximate cause of her injuries. On July 7, 2009, Plavecski <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d) and/or motion for a new trial. On August 13, 2009, the trial court denied both of Plavecski\u2019s posttrial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 14} On September 11, 2009, Plavecski filed the instant appeal, citing one assignment of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cI. The trial court erred when it (a) allowed the defense to present to the jury medical literature and studies which were based upon information that occurred months or years after the plaintiff was injured by medical malpractice; (b) allowed the defense to present expert testimony which failed to meet the reliability test of Evid.R. 702(C) and <em>Daubert; </em>(c) allowed the defense to persuade the jury to base inferences upon inferences and thereby find in favor of the defendant in the issue of causation. Finally the trial court erred by denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">{\u00b6 16} In her sole assignment of error, Plavecski raises several issues related to evidentiary rulings by the trial court and its failure to set aside the jury verdict. We address them in the order she presents them. We also recognize that we are in the somewhat unusual position of analyzing how a jury finds negligence but not proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">{\u00b6 17} Plavecski first argues that the trial court should not have allowed Drs. Williams and Armitage to use articles that postdated Plavecski\u2019s surgery. She points specifically to newspaper articles and medical literature that discuss the existence of an epidemic strain of C.diff. that was being diagnosed in parts of the United States in late 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">{\u00b6 18} The admission of evidence lies within the broad discretion of the trial court. <em>Beard v. Meridia Huron Hosp., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 237, 2005-Ohio-4787, 834 N.E.2d 323. A reviewing court will uphold an evidentiary decision absent an abuse of discretion that has affected the substantial rights of the adverse party or is inconsistent with substantial justice. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">{\u00b6 19} The trial court allowed Drs. Williams and Armitage to make limited reference to newspaper articles published in The Plain Dealer<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on the subject of the epidemic strain of C.diff. Newspaper articles are self-authenticating, pursuant to Evid.R. 902(6); however, newspaper articles are generally inadmissible as evidence of the facts stated in them. <em>In re Waste Technologies Industries </em>(1998), 132 Ohio App.3d 145, 724 N.E.2d 819. Upon review of the portion of the transcript provided by Plavecski, reference to the articles was used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>to demonstrate at what point in time the public was made aware of the epidemic strain of C.diff. and its presence in Ohio. Because these articles were offered to establish time parameters, and not the truth of the content in them, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing Drs. Williams and Armitage to mention these newspaper articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 20} Plavecski also complains that Drs. Williams and Armitage should not have been permitted to refer to medical literature published after her surgery to show that she had the epidemic strain of the C.diff. bacteria. With respect to using postdated medical literature to demonstrate when the medical community became aware of the epidemic strain, we apply similar reasoning to the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the doctors to use the newspaper articles and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 21} However, Plavecski argues that CCF used postdated articles to prove that she had the epidemic strain, which was improper as a case of building inference upon inference without a factual basis. We disagree. Plavecski cites no case law in which it is said to be per se error to allow a doctor to rely on postdated medical research to opine on the identity or cause of a disease or illness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In fact, it makes no sense to have a rule that doctors cannot rely on the most up-to-date medical research to diagnose previously contracted illnesses or diseases. See, e.g., <em>Sturm v. Univ. of Cincinnati Med. Ctr. </em>(2000), 137 Ohio App.3d 557, 739 N.E.2d 364. We find no error in the introduction of evidence from postdated medical literature.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 22} Plavecski also challenges Dr. Armitage\u2019s testimony about the epidemic strain of C.diff. as being in violation of <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469, and Evid.R. 702.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She argues that Dr. Armitage\u2019s testimony is neither reliable nor relevant to the facts in her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Daubert, </em>the United States Supreme Court explained that a trial court must act as \u201cgatekeeper\u201d to assure both the relevance and reliability of expert testimony before it is admitted into evidence at trial. Id. The court listed factors that a trial court may consider in determining whether expert testimony is relevant and reliable. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court adopted the <em>Daubert </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>analysis in <em>Miller v. Bike Athletic Co. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 607, 687 N.E.2d 735, in which it stated: \u201cIn analyzing the admissibility of expert testimony, it is important for trial courts to keep in mind the separate functions of judge and jury, and the intent of <em>Daubert </em>to * * * make it easier to present legitimate conflicting views of experts for the jury\u2019s consideration. Thus, a trial court\u2019s role in determining whether an expert\u2019s testimony is admissible under Evid.R. 702(C) focuses on whether the opinion is based upon scientifically valid principles, not whether the expert\u2019s conclusions are correct or whether the testimony satisfies the proponent\u2019s burden of proof at trial.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">{\u00b6 24} We do not find a successful <em>Daubert </em>challenge here. Dr. Armitage did not rest his opinion on a theory or method, the reliability of which would be subject to peer review or acceptance in the medical community. Instead he rested his opinion on medical literature from recognized, well-respected medical journals, which identified an epidemic strain of C.diff., the symptoms of which mirror Plavecski\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 25} Dr. Armitage testified that the literature demonstrated a connection between the use of fluoroquinolones, of which Cipro is one, and the epidemic strain of C.diff., as well as an increase in the number of otherwise healthy patients presenting with the epidemic strain. He drew the conclusion that Plavecski most likely had the epidemic strain, although no pathology report was conducted to confirm or deny this, because she had taken Cipro, and her symptoms were similar to those found in otherwise healthy patients who received similar treatment, but still went on to have their colons removed. He also testified that the physicians at Medina General Hospital had prescribed fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics for a short period of time when Plavecski was first admitted there. Dr. Armitage\u2019s opinions were based on scientifically valid principles derived from his knowledge of medical research on C.diff. He also opined that the use of Imodium had no affect on Plavecski\u2019s condition, regardless of the strain of C.diff. she had contracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 26} In the absence of interrogatories detailing the jury\u2019s findings, we cannot determine whether the jury concluded that Plavecski had the epidemic strain of C.diff. bacteria. The evidence at trial may have led the jury to conclude, in the alternative, that Plavecski had the ordinary strain of C.diff., which progressed to a point where removal of her colon was necessary. According to Plavecski\u2019s own expert, Dr. Schaefer, some patients with C.diff. infections who never took Imodium nonetheless needed to have their colons removed. Nevertheless, assuming the jury believed Dr. Armitage\u2019s conclusion over Dr. Schaefer\u2019s conclusion, this in and of itself is not violative of <em>Daubert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 27} This is not an instance of inference stacking. Dr. Armitage considered the facts before him, and opined on the connection between Plavecski\u2019s symptoms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>and outcome and the symptoms and outcomes for patients infected with the epidemic strain of C.diff. The epidemic strain had been found in patients in Northeast Ohio when Plavecski was ill. We do not find that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing Dr. Armitage\u2019s testimony about the epidemic strain of the C.diff. infection and whether his review of Plavecski\u2019s medical record led him to conclude that she was infected with that strain.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 28} Plavecski next argues that the trial court should not have allowed Dr. Armitage to testify about Dr. Koo\u2019s article entitled \u201cAntimotility Agents for the Treatment of <em>Clostridium difficile </em>Diarrhea and Colitis\u201d (\u201cKoo article\u201d). She argues that CCF ignored the trial court\u2019s granting of her motion to preclude reference to the Koo article. However, Plavecski\u2019s motion in limine to preclude reference to unfinished clinical trials was granted; this is a separate body of work from the Koo article.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 29} The Koo article reviews several studies that questioned the connection between antimotility agents and C.diff. The author concludes that use of medications like Imodium does not make C.diff. more severe, but that further study is needed. However, the Koo article itself is not the unfinished clinical trial cited in Plavecski\u2019s motion in limine. Thus, CCF did not violate the court\u2019s order to exclude the clinical trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 30} Furthermore, Plavecski cannot now complain about defense testimony regarding the Koo article when her expert was the first to testify about its theories in his videotaped deposition. See <em>Hal Artz Lincolrtr-Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 20, 28 OBR 83, 502 N.E.2d 590, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cA party will not be permitted to take advantage of an error which he himself invited or induced\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 31} While we understand that CCF included the Koo article among the articles intended for its expert to rely upon, it was initially introduced by Plavecski through Dr. Schaefer\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 32} Finally, Plavecski argues that the trial court improperly allowed the defense to present inference based on inference to lead the jury to reject a finding of causation, as well as erred in denying her motion for JNOV and motion for new trial. Specifically, Plavecski argues that because there was no evidence that she was afflicted with the epidemic strain of C.diff., the jury had to find that taking Imodium on Dr. Williams\u2019s advice caused her injuries. We acknowledge that we are faced with trying to understand how a jury could find negligence but not proximate cause. Yet we find Plavecski\u2019s argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u2018When ruling on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a trial court employs the same test applicable to a motion for directed verdict. That is, the evidence as adduced at trial and as borne by the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>must be construed most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is made. Where there is substantial evidence to support the non-movant\u2019s side of the case, upon which reasonable minds may reach different conclusions, the motion must be denied. Neither the weight of the evidence nor the credibility of the witnesses is for the court\u2019s determination when ruling upon either of the above motions. Appellate review of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is de novo.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Perla v. Cleveland Clinic Found., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 83058, 2004-Ohio-2156, 2004 WL 906115.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cWhen an appellate court reviews the denial of a motion for a new trial, the appellate court reviews whether the trial court\u2019s decision constituted an abuse of discretion. Absent some indication that the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable, the judgment of the trial court will not be disturbed.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Collins v. Colonna, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 93901, 2010-Ohio-3613, 2010 WL 3044641.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 35} On the evidence before us, we find that the trial court properly denied both of Plavecski\u2019s motions. There was evidence presented by both sides that ordinary C.diff. colitis is caused by the use of antibiotics that attack the bacteria in the colon, causing a build-up of toxins that leads to damage to the colon wall. Dr. Armitage testified that Plavecski\u2019s use of Cipro, which was later found to increase an otherwise healthy patient\u2019s chance of contracting the epidemic strain of C.diff., was ultimately the cause of her colectomy. He also testified that he believed that Plavecski had the epidemic strain of C.diff., although he acknowledged that no test was done to confirm his belief. Finally, Dr. Armitage testified, as did Dr. Williams, that there were no studies that definitively linked the use of Imodium by patients with C.diff. to the removal of their colons.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 36} Plavecski\u2019s expert, Dr. Schaefer, testified that he knew of cases in which patients with the ordinary strain of C.diff. who had not taken Imodium needed colectomies; he also testified that he had seen cases in which patients with the ordinary strain of C.diff. who took Imodium did not need colectomies. Both Dr. Williams and Dr. Armitage testified that taking Imodium was not the cause of Plavecski\u2019s colectomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 37} Thus, this is not a case where the evidence presented to the jury was one of stacking inference upon inference to lead to a sole, unsupported conclusion. Instead, CCF\u2019s expert opined that the symptoms experienced by Plavecski were similar enough to those of similarly situated patients known to have the epidemic strain of C.diff. for him to conclude that she was afflicted with the epidemic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>strain. We do not find that there is too great an analytical gap between Plavecski\u2019s condition and that of other patients with the epidemic strain for the jury to reject Plavecski\u2019s proximate cause theory.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 38} We cannot know whether the jury agreed with Dr. Armitage\u2019s conclusion or whether the jury found that Plavecski\u2019s use of Imodium was inconsequential to her outcome regardless of which strain she had contracted. We only know that the jury found that Plavecski\u2019s use of Imodium did not cause her injuries.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 39} This finding is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Resolution of the factual question on causation was before the jury on properly admitted evidence. Relying on the evidence available to us on review, we find no error below.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b580-8\">Blackmon and Stewart, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-18\">.
