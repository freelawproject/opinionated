For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">{\u00b6 2} The relevant facts of this case are as follows. ABC is a membership association of nonunion construction contractors who submit bids for the purpose of securing public-improvement construction contracts. Its members include GC Contracting Corporation, Cinfab, Inc., Triton Services, M &amp; S Flooring, Spectra Contract Flooring, and HGC Construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">{\u00b6 3} Out of several public-improvement projects planned in Butler County, Ohio, the parties\u2019 dispute centers on the Government Services Center Court Remodel project and the Board of Elections project. Rapier, an electrical contractor, was awarded the electrical base contracts for both projects. Additionally, several ABC members submitted bids on the Board of Elections project, seeking the general, HVAC, and flooring contracts, while another ABC member submitted a \u201cgeneral base bid\u201d on the Government Services project.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">{\u00b6 4} After Rapier completed its work on the projects, ABC filed an administrative complaint with the Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Labor, Bureau of Wage and Hour, claiming that Rapier had violated Ohio prevailing-wage laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the director of commerce failed to issue a final determination within 60 days, ABC filed a complaint in the Butler County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. 4115.16(B) on September 25, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">{\u00b6 5} On May 6, 2010, Rapier moved for summary judgment, arguing that ABC lacked standing as an \u201cinterested party\u201d to pursue a prevailing-wage complaint because it failed to show that any member of its organization bid directly against Rapier for the specific electrical contract on either project.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">{\u00b6 6} On June 1, 2010, ABC filed its memorandum in opposition, arguing that it had standing as an interested party under R.C. 4115.03(F)(4) and that competitive bidding on the same contract within a pubhc-improvement project was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">{\u00b6 7} On August 10, 2010, the trial court granted Rapier\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that ABC lacked standing, but denied Rapier\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>{\u00b6 8} ABC raises a single assignment of error for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred when it granted defendant/appellee Rapier Electric, Inc.\u2019s motions for summary judgment in both cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">{\u00b6 10} In its sole assignment of error, ABC argues that the trial court erred in granting Rapier\u2019s motion for summary judgment on standing, because ABC was an interested party under R.C. 4115.03(F)(4). Specifically, ABC argues that several ABC members submitted bids for various contracts for the public improvement, which grants ABC standing under the statute. ABC further argues that R.C. 4115.03(F) and 4115.16(B) do not require parties to submit a \u201cdirectly competitive bid on the exact same contract\u201d before attaining interested-party standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">{\u00b6 11} An appellate court reviews a lower court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment de novo. <em>Doe v. Shaffer </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 388, 390, 738 N.E.2d 1243. Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact remaining for trial, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reasonable minds can only come to a conclusion adverse to the nonmoving party, construing the evidence most strongly in that party\u2019s favor. See Civ.R. 56(C); <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46. The movant bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for the motion and demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. Once this burden is met, the nonmovant has a reciprocal burden to set forth specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. Id. Likewise, both standing and statutory interpretation are questions of law reviewed de novo on appeal. See <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. State, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 59, 2006-Ohio-6499, 858 N.E.2d 330, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">{\u00b6 12} Ohio\u2019s prevailing-wage laws are codified in R.C. Chapter 4115. \u201cThese provisions generally require contractors and subcontractors for public-improvement projects to pay laborers and mechanics the \u2018prevailing wage\u2019 in the locality where the project is to be performed.\u201d <em>Ohio Valley Associated Builders &amp; Contrs. v. Indus. Power Sys., Inc., </em>190 Ohio App.3d 273, 2010-Ohio-4930, 941 N.E.2d 849, \u00b6 14. \u201c[T]he legislative intent of the prevailing-wage law in R.C. Chapter 4115 is to \u2018provide a comprehensive, uniform framework for * * * worker rights and remedies vis-a-vis private contractors, subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the construction of public improvements in this state.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Bergman v. Monarch Constr. Co., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 534, 2010-Ohio-622, 925 N.E.2d 116, \u00b6 10. The law\u2019s primary purpose \u201c \u2018is to support the integrity of the collective bargaining process by preventing the undercutting of employee wages in the private construction sector.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bergman </em>at \u00b6 10, quoting <em>Evans v. Moore </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 88, 91, 23 O.O.3d 145, 431 N.E.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>{\u00b6 13} R.C. 4115.16(A) allows an interested party to file a complaint with the director of commerce alleging a violation of the prevailing-wage law. R.C. 4115.16(B) allows the interested party to file a complaint with the court of common pleas in the county in which the violation allegedly occurred if the director has not ruled on the merits of the complaint within 60 days. R.C. 4115.03(F) defines an \u201cinterested party\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-4\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(1) <em>Any </em>person who submits a bid for the purpose of securing the award of a contract for construction of the public improvement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(2) <em>Any </em>person acting as a subcontractor of a person mentioned in division (F)(1) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(3) <em>Any </em>bona fide organization of labor which has as members or is authorized to represent employees of a person mentioned in division (F)(1) or (2) of this section and which exists, in whole or in part, for the purpose of negotiating with employers concerning the wages, hours, or terms and conditions of employment of employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(4) <em>Any </em>association having as members <em>any </em>of the persons mentioned in division (F)(1) or (2) of this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cCourts have construed the definition of an interested party broadly to further the purposes of the prevailing-wage law.\u201d <em>Internatl. Assn. of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental &amp; Reinforcing Iron Workers, Local 372, AFL-CIO v. Sunesis Constr. Co., </em>183 Ohio App.3d 438, 2009-Ohio-3729, 917 N.E.2d 343, \u00b6 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">{\u00b6 19} In the case at bar, the trial court found that ABC lacked interested-party standing to bring an action against Rapier pursuant to R.C. 4115.16(A), because ABC\u2019s members bid on entirely different contracts from those bid upon by Rapier. Specifically, the trial court stated: \u201c[T]his court interprets the word \u2018contract\u2019 in [R.C. 4115.03(F)(1) ] to mean the contract at issue, and the phrase \u2018the public improvement\u2019 to refer to the specific improvement encompassed by that contract.\u201d Thus, it is clear that the trial court applied a restrictive interpretation to the term \u201cinterested party\u201d under R.C. 4115.03(F)(1) to afford standing only to parties that submit a directly competitive bid on the same contract within a public-improvement project.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">{\u00b6 20} We first note that the trial court\u2019s reliance upon common-law standing principles was inappropriate. \u201cBy enacting R.C. 4115.16(B), the Ohio Legislature conferred a specific statutory grant of authority for an \u2018interested party,\u2019 as defined in R.C. 4115.03(F), to file a prevailing-wage action in the common pleas court in the event that the commerce director fails to rule on the administrative complaint within 60 days.\u201d <em>Indus. Power Sys., </em>190 Ohio App.3d 273, 2010-Ohio-4930, 941 N.E.2d 849, at \u00b6 21, citing <em>Sunesis, </em>183 Ohio App.3d 438, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>2009-Ohio-3729, 917 N.E.2d 343, at \u00b6 11. Accordingly, the sole issue is whether ABC is an interested party as defined in R.C. 4115.03(F), \u201ccommon law standing not withstanding.\u201d <em>Indus. Power Sys. </em>at \u00b6 21. Therefore, we find that the trial court\u2019s incorporation of common-law standing in this case was erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But see <em>N. Ohio Chapter of Associated Builders &amp; Contrs., Inc. v. Barberton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>188 Ohio App.3d 395, 2010-Ohio-1826, 935 N.E.2d 861, which incorporates both common-law standing and statutory standing in a two-part test.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">{\u00b6 21} Secondly, we reject Rapier\u2019s argument that R.C. 4115.03(F)(4) limits the definition of an \u201cinterested party\u201d to an association whose member(s) have submitted a bid on the particular contract from which the alleged prevailing-wage violation stems. R.C. 4115.03(F)(1). Such an interpretation is contrary to the broad interpretation other courts have given to R.C. 4115.03(F). See <em>Indus. Power Sys. </em>at \u00b6 22; <em>United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of Am., Local Union No. 1581 v. Edgerton Hardware Co., Inc., </em>Williams App. No. WM-06-017, 2007-Ohio-3958, 2007 WL 2216964, \u00b6 19; <em>Internatl. Bhd. of Elec. Workers Local Union No. 317 v. Southeastern Elec. Constr. </em>(Dec. 30, 1986), Gallia App. No. 85 CA 12, 1986 WL 15203.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Indus. Power Sys., </em>the Sixth District Court of Appeals held that Ohio Valley Associated Builders and Contractors (\u201cOVABC\u201d) could bring a prevailing-wage action on behalf of its member, Westfield Group, which submitted bids for electrical contracts for a public-improvement project. The court held that OVABC had interested-party standing, despite the fact that Westfield Group did not bid on the contract from which the alleged prevailing-wage violation stemmed, namely the HVAC/plumbing contracts. Id., 190 Ohio App.3d 273, 2010-Ohio-4930, 941 N.E.2d 849, at \u00b6 24. In so holding, the court concluded that OVABC was \u201can interested party under the plain language of R.C. 4115.03(F)(1) and (4), since [OVABC] is <em>any </em>(of whatever kind) association having as members <em>any </em>(of whatever kind) person [Westfield Group] who submitted a bid for the purpose of securing the award of a contract for * * * public-improvement projects.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 26. (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">{\u00b6 23} Similarly, in the case at bar, the fact that ABC did not bid on Rapier\u2019s precise contract does not deny ABC interested-party standing under R.C. 4115.03(F)(4). Like the Sixth District, we \u201csee no legally valid reason to interpret an association\u2019s interested-party status pursuant to R.C. 4115.03(F)(4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>on behalf of its members who submit a bid for the purpose of securing the award of a contract for construction of the public improvement narrowly * * * Aside from being inconsistent with prior precedent, [Rapier\u2019s] position is also antithetical to the purpose of the prevailing-wage law.\u201d <em>Indus. Power Sys., </em>190 Ohio App.3d 273, 2010-Ohio-4930, 941 N.E.2d 849, at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">{\u00b6 24} Moreover, the words used in a statute are to be taken in their usual, normal, and customary meaning. R.C. 1.42. If the words of the statute are plain and unambiguous, we cannot engage in statutory interpretation. See <em>Edgerton, </em>2007-Ohio-3958, 2007 WL 2216964, at \u00b6 19. \u201cAny\u201d is defined as \u201cone or some indiscriminately of whatever kind\u201d and is \u201cused to indicate one selected without restriction.\u201d Id., quoting Merriam-Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed.1996) 53. As applied to the case at bar, and noting the legislative intent in enacting the prevailing-wage law, we conclude that members of ABC submitted bid(s) on the pertinent overall projects for the purpose of securing <em>\u201ca </em>contract for construction of the public improvement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4115.03(F)(1). Consequently, ABC is an interested party within the meaning of R.C. 4115.03(F)(4). Therefore, ABC had standing to file a complaint with the director of commerce and subsequently file a complaint in the court of common pleas pursuant to R.C. 4115.16(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">{\u00b6 25} Thus, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment based on ABC\u2019s purported lack of standing. Accordingly, ABC\u2019s assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">{\u00b6 26} The judgment of the Butler County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this judgment. Rapier is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">{\u00b6 27} The judgment reversed, and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b71-10\">Powell, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b71-11\">Bressler, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-12\">. The filing date of ABC\u2019s administrative complaint is not clear from the record. The administrative complaint was signed on June 25, 2009, but ABC\u2019s civil complaint claimed the complaint was filed on or about July 1, 2009. However, even if ABC\u2019s administrative complaint was filed on the latest date of July 1, 2009, the civil complaint was filed on September 25, 2009, which was well beyond the R.C. 4115.16(B) 60-day waiting period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\">. For this same reason, we find it irrelevant whether ABC demonstrated an \u2018\u2018injury in fact\u201d as a result of Rapier\u2019s alleged prevailing-wage law violations. \"Injury in fact\u201d is not part of R.C. 4115.03(F)\u2019s definition of an interested party. Cf. <em>Indus. Power Sys., </em>190 Ohio App.3d 273, 2010-Ohio-4930, 941 N.E.2d 849, at \u00b6 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b71-12\">Bressler, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A_E\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">{\u00b6 28} I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion because the trial court correctly found that ABC lacked interested-party standing under R.C. 4115.03(F)(4). Like the trial court, I would reject an interpretation of R.C. 4115.03(F) that grants standing to <em>any </em>association having a member that bid on <em>any </em>part of a public improvement project to challenge an entirely different contract within that project. In the case at bar, while members of ABC did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>submit bids on the HVAC, flooring, and general base contracts, none of its members bid directly against Rapier on the electrical contracts for either project.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">{\u00b6 29} In interpreting R.C. 4115.03(F)(1), the trial court properly declined to interpret the word \u201ccontract\u201d in its broadest sense, i.e., every contract bid upon within a particular public-improvement project. Instead, the trial court properly interpreted \u201ccontract\u201d to mean \u201cthe contract at issue,\u201d or in other words, the contract from which the alleged prevailing-wage violation stems. Similarly, the trial court properly declined to interpret the term \u201cpublic improvement\u201d broadly, when doing so would contradict basic principles of standing, including the common-law requirement that a party possess a \u201cpersonal stake in the outcome of the controversy.\u201d <em>Middletown v. Ferguson </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 71, 75, 25 OBR 125, 495 N.E.2d 380. See also <em>Griffith v. Cleveland, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 35, 2010-Ohio-4905, 941 N.E.2d 1157, \u00b6 14; R.C. 1.49.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">{\u00b6 30} While the majority presents a well-reasoned analysis, I do not believe that the General Assembly intended R.C. 4115.03(F) to permit parties lacking direct involvement in a particular contract to file prevailing-wage complaints. Instead, I believe that the General Assembly intended to afford interested-party standing under R.C. 4115.03(F) to a narrower class of litigants, namely, parties that bid on the same contract. This interpretation supports the primary purpose of the prevailing-wage law because parties competing for the same work possess distinct knowledge of their trade, thereby placing them in the best position to prevent the \u201cundercutting of employee wages in the private construction sector.\u201d <em>Bergman v. Monarch Constr. Co., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 534, 2010-Ohio-622, 925 N.E.2d 116, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">{\u00b6 31} Because the majority\u2019s opinion improperly applies a broader interpretation to the definition of \u201cinterested party\u201d under R.C. 4115.03(F)(4), I respectfully dissent and would affirm the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to Rapier.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
