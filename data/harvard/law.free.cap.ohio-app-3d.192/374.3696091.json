The court found that Freeman\u2019s judgment lien on one-half of the property owned by defendants Alter and Lynder Boswell was junior to Deutsche Bank\u2019s mortgage lien on the same property. We find some merit in Freeman\u2019s sole assignment of error. Consequently, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in part and reverse it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">I. Facts and Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">{\u00b6 2} On August 29, 2005, Deutsche Bank filed a complaint in which it sought to foreclose on property the Boswells owned at 840 Oak Street, in Hamilton County. Freeman was one of several parties named as defendants because of their potential interests in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-16\">{\u00b6 3} The record shows that the following series of events had occurred in this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b412-17\">{\u00b6 4} On June 4, 2004, Freeman filed a complaint against Alter Boswell seeking to recover damages for personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>{\u00b6 5} On December 10, 2004, Freeman obtained a $75,000 default judgment against Alter Boswell.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">{\u00b6 6} On December 17, 2004, Alter Boswell signed a quitclaim deed giving his wife, Lynder Boswell, a one-half interest in the Oak Street property. He also executed a mortgage on the property to New Century Mortgage Company, Deutsche Bank\u2019s predecessor in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">{\u00b6 7} On December 29, 2004, Freeman recorded his certificate of judgment lien against Alter Boswell.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">{\u00b6 8} On January 14, 2005, the mortgage and deed were recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">{\u00b6 9} Deutsche Bank filed a motion for summary judgment in which it contended that Freeman\u2019s lien was invalid. It also argued that Freeman\u2019s lien was junior to its mortgage under the doctrine of equitable subrogation. A magistrate originally concluded that Freeman\u2019s lien was invalid because the underlying judgment against Alter Boswell was void for lack of service. He recommended that the trial court grant Deutsche Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">{\u00b6 10} Freeman objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision. The trial court found that the documents supporting Deutsche Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment did not show that service was defective. It sustained Freeman\u2019s objections, rejected the magistrate\u2019s decision in its entirety, and returned the case to the magistrate for further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">{\u00b6 11} Deutsche Bank again filed a motion for summary judgment against Freeman in which it argued that Freeman\u2019s underlying judgment was void for lack of service. The magistrate found that void judgments could be collaterally attacked only by a party to the judgment, and, therefore, that Deutsche Bank lacked standing to attack the underlying judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">{\u00b6 12} The magistrate also rejected Freeman\u2019s argument that Alter Boswell\u2019s transfer of a one-half interest in the property to his wife was fraudulent. He found that Freeman\u2019s lien attached only to Alter Boswell\u2019s one-half interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">{\u00b6 13} Finally, the magistrate found that Deutsche Bank\u2019s mortgage lien was senior to Freeman\u2019s lien under the doctrine of equitable subrogation. He recommended that the trial court grant Deutsche Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">{\u00b6 14} Both parties objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision. The trial court overruled all the objections, adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision, and granted Deutsche Bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Subsequently, the court ordered a foreclosure on the property. It stated that Freeman\u2019s lien was valid but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>that it was junior to Deutsche Bank\u2019s lien and attached only to Alter Boswell\u2019s one-half interest in the property. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">{\u00b6 15} In his sole assignment of error, Freeman contends that the trial court erred in determining that his lien was junior to Deutsche Bank\u2019s lien and that his lien attached only to Alter Boswell\u2019s one-half interest in the property. He argues that the doctrine of equitable subrogation did not apply and that Alter Boswell\u2019s transfer of one-half of his interest in the property was fraudulent. We agree that the trial court erred in applying the doctrine of equitable subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">II. Equitable Subrogation</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">{\u00b6 16} Under Ohio law, a lien recorded first has priority over a lien recorded later in time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Freeman filed his certificate of judgment and created his lien on December 29, 2004.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> New Century recorded its mortgage and created its lien on January 14, 2005.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, under the general rule, Freeman\u2019s lien would have had priority over Deutsche Bank\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">{\u00b6 17} An exception to the general rule of \u201cfirst in time, first in right\u201d is the doctrine of equitable subrogation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Equitable subrogation \u201carises by operation of law when one having a liability or right or a fiduciary relation in the premises pays a debt due by another under such circumstances that he is in equity entitled to the security or obligation held by the creditor whom he has paid.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">{\u00b6 18} The application of equitable subrogation depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. To claim equitable subrogation, a party\u2019s equity must be strong and its case clear.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A party is not entitled to equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>subrogation if that party is negligent in its business transactions or has failed to act according to ordinary and reasonable business practices.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">{\u00b6 19} The trial court found in this case that New Century had \u201cexercised due diligence\u201d when checking the property records at the time the note and mortgage were executed. Freeman had filed his complaint and had obtained his judgment long before the Boswells executed the mortgage. Yet, Deutsche Bank presented no evidence to excuse and offered no explanation for its predecessor\u2019s failure to discover the judgment, which was a public record. Thus, the trial court\u2019s finding of due diligence was not supported by competent, credible evidence, and it was, therefore, against the manifest weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 20} The trial court also found that four weeks was \u201cnot an unreasonable amount of time to record an executed mortgage.\u201d Again, Deutsche Bank presented no evidence to show why New Century had waited over a month to record the mortgage and note. It also presented no evidence showing that waiting a month was an ordinary and reasonable business practice. Since no competent, credible evidence existed to support that finding, it was also against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">{\u00b6 21} Deutsche Bank bore the burden to show that it was entitled to equitable subrogation, which is the exception, not the rule. It failed to show that New Century, its predecessor, had not been negligent in its business transactions or that it had acted according to ordinary and reasonable business practices. Deutsche Bank would not have been seeking equitable subrogation but for New Century\u2019s negligence in failing to timely record its mortgage. The equities in the case did not \u201cclearly favor\u201d Deutsche Bank.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">{\u00b6 22} Consequently, we hold that the trial court erred in finding that the doctrine of equitable subrogation applied and that Deutsche Bank\u2019s mortgage was senior to Freeman\u2019s judgment lien. As the first lien recorded, Freeman\u2019s lien was entitled to priority over the mortgage. Deutsche Bank was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Deutsche Bank on the issue of seniority.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>III. Collateral Attack on the Underlying Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"> {\u00b6 23} Deutsche Bank has presented an assignment of error to prevent a reversal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It argues that Freeman\u2019s lien was invalid because the underlying judgment was void for lack of service. A judgment without proper service is void and may be collaterally attacked at any time.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\"> {\u00b6 24} The trial court held that void judgments could be collaterally attacked only by a party to the judgment, and, therefore, that Deutsche Bank lacked standing to attack Freeman\u2019s underlying judgment. We find no case law that stands for that proposition. To the contrary, \u201cstrangers to a judgment are permitted to [collaterally] attack the judgment based on \u2018fraud and want of jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 25} The trial court\u2019s reasoning was based on the proposition that it could not take judicial notice of the proceedings in the prior case. We agree.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Deutsche Bank argues that judicial notice was not the issue. It claims that it presented evidence showing that Freeman had never obtained valid service in the underlying case. But it merely attached copies of the documents in that case to its motion for summary judgment, which did not meet the requirements of Civ.R. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">{\u00b6 26} When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the trial court may only review evidence properly submitted under Civ.R. 56(C).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That rule provides that a court ruling on a motion for summary judgment may consider \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact.\u201d It refers to pleadings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>and other documents filed in the case before the court, not to pleadings and documents submitted in a different case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 27} Civ.R. 56(E) provides the proper procedure for introducing evidentiary matter not specifically authorized by Civ.R. 56(C).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It permits other types of evidence, such as pleadings and entries in a separate action, to be used to support or oppose a motion for summary judgment if they are properly authenticated and referred to in a properly framed affidavit.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 28} In fact, the trial court rejected the magistrate\u2019s decision granting Deutsche Bank\u2019s first motion for summary judgment on the basis that service was void because Deutsche Bank had failed to present the evidentiary materials as required by Civ.R. 56(E). Yet Deutsche Bank still did not correct that problem in its second motion for summary judgment. Since Deutsche Bank failed to present the documents from the separate action with an authenticating affidavit, the trial court could not consider them. Therefore, no evidence was before the court showing that the original judgment was void for lack of service, and we overrule Deutsche Bank\u2019s assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">IV. Validity of the Transfer of One-Half Interest in the Property</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">{\u00b6 29} Finally, Freeman contends that his lien should be a first lien on the entire property, not just the one-half interest that Alter Boswell owned after transferring one-half of his interest to his wife. He argues that the transfer was fraudulent within the meaning of R.C. Chapter 1336. While the timing of the transfer raises some questions, Freeman failed to present evidence establishing all the elements of a fraudulent transfer.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore, the transfer was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c[T]he interest of a person to whom a judgment debtor has conveyed real estate before the attachment of the judgment lien is preferred to the interest of the judgment creditor, unless such priority is affected by the provisions of recording statutes, or statutes relating to fraudulent conveyances, or the conveyance is void for other reasons.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> R.C. 5301.25(A) provides that until a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>deed is properly recorded, it is fraudulent as to a subsequent bona fide purchaser for value. But a judgment-lien creditor is not a bona fide purchaser.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 31} Consequently, a judgment-lien creditor cannot reach property that the debtor has validly disposed of before the recording of the lien.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Because Alter Boswell only owned a one-half interest in the property when Freeman recorded his certificate of judgment, his lien attached only to Alter Boswell\u2019s one-half interest in the property.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Y. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 32} In sum, we hold that the trial court erred in applying the doctrine of equitable subrogation and in determining that Deutsche Bank\u2019s mortgage lien had priority over Freeman\u2019s judgment lien. We also hold that the trial court did not err in holding that Freeman\u2019s lien applied only to Alter Boswell\u2019s one-half interest in the property. Consequently, we sustain Freeman\u2019s assignment of error in part. We reverse that part of the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for Deutsche Bank on the issue of hen priority and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this decision. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b418-9\">Hendon and Fischer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-10\">.
