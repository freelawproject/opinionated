Huston, appeals a decision from the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, overruling his objections and adopting the decision of the magistrate granting custody of the parties\u2019 minor child, T.H., to defendant-appellee, Joni L. Kraus-Hood (\u201cHood\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">{\u00b6 2} The magistrate\u2019s decision awarding Hood primary custody of T.H. was filed on September 23, 2009. The magistrate\u2019s decision, however, failed to address the subject of Huston\u2019s visitation rights with T.H. Accordingly, on September 28, 2009, the magistrate filed an amended decision awarding Huston standard visitation rights with T.H. The judgment and entry adopting the decision of the magistrate was filed by the trial court on June 30, 2010. On July 29, 2010, Huston filed a timely notice of appeal with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 3} Huston and Hood were in a relationship, but not married, prior to the birth of their daughter, T.H., on November 15, 2007. At the time of T.H.\u2019s birth, Hood was incarcerated in the Montgomery County Jail for violating the terms of her probation in a separate criminal case. While she was in jail, Hood went into early labor and gave birth to T.H. via an emergency Caesarian section operation performed at Miami Valley Hospital. At the time of her birth, T.H. weighed approximately two pounds. Due to her precarious physical condition, T.H. remained in the intensive care unit at Miami Valley Hospital for approximately two months after her birth. After a brief recovery period, Hood returned to jail in order to complete the remainder of her sentence. Hood was released from jail shortly before T.H. was released from the hospital and was home to receive the child when she arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 4} Huston and Hood lived together with T.H. until October 2008, when they split. Huston sought temporary custody of T.H. The magistrate awarded Huston temporary custody of T.H. pending the outcome of a full hearing. During this period, Hood was granted liberal visitation with T.H., from 9:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m. Monday through Friday and every other weekend. Evidence was adduced at the hearing that established that Huston and Hood suffered from physical ailments for which they were both prescribed various medications. We also note that the guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) appointed in this case conducted an investigation and determined that it was in the best interests of T.H. for Hood to be granted custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b6 5} Hearings on this matter were held before the magistrate on February 12 and August 26, 2009. After weighing the evidence submitted by the parties, the magistrate granted legal custody of T.H. to Hood and granted standard visitation rights to Huston. Huston subsequently filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision on October 5, 2009. Huston filed supplemental objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision on February 19, 2010. On June 30, 2010, the trial overruled Huston\u2019s objections and adopted the decision of the magistrate granting custody to Hood in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b6 6} It is from this decision that Huston now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">{\u00b6 7} Because they are interrelated, Huston\u2019s first and second assignments of error will be discussed together as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-11\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court and the magistrate erred and committed prejudicial error in not allowing the appellant the court ordered time to present his evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred and committed prejudicial error when limiting appellant\u2019s testimony to only fifteen (15) minutes and was an abuse of discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">{\u00b6 10} In his first assignment of error, Huston contends that the trial court erred in adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision when the magistrate limited the time in which he could present evidence at the hearing to one-half day of testimony on February 12, 2009, and one and one-half hours of testimony on August 26, 2009. Huston asserts that the time limitations placed upon him by the magistrate restricted his ability to call all the witnesses he had subpoenaed to testify on his behalf. Huston also argues that because of the time limitation set by the magistrate, he was unable to adequately present his own testimony, as well as the testimony of the witnesses he was able to call.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">{If 11} The magistrate limited the length of Huston\u2019s case-in-chief in the following exchange at the hearing on August 26, 2009:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe Court: * * * We\u2019re here on multiple motions.

When Huston\u2019s hour had passed, the Court initiated the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe Court: Okay, Mr Hansen, I believe your time has ended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cMr. Hansen: I need to call the \u2014 the father to the stand, Your Honor.

Mathewson, </em>Greene App. No. 05-CA-035, 2007-Ohio-574, 2007 WL 431480:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-19\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cTrial courts are given great deference in controlling their dockets, and therefore, a reviewing court uses an abuse of discretion standard when reviewing a trial court\u2019s requirements in this area. <em>State v. Unger </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 65, 67 [21 O.O.3d 41, 423 N.E.2d 1078], \u2018The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019 <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219 [5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140] (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>{\u00b6 39} \u201cEvid. R. 611(A) provides that the trial court \u2018shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to * * * (2) avoid needless consumption of time * * Further, a trial court has the discretion to limit questioning of witnesses if the \u2018probative value is substantially outweighed by considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u2019 Evid. R. 403(B). Time limitations on evidence have been upheld where a party has not identified what additional evidence the party would have offered or how that evidence could have changed the court\u2019s judgment. <em>Readnower v. Readnower, </em>Greene App. No. 2004 CA 100, 162 Ohio App.3d 347, 2005-Ohio-3661 [833 N.E.2d 752], \u00b6 11 (citation omitted).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">{\u00b6 40} In his brief, Huston argues that he was denied his right to trial and to fully present his case. Huston asserts that he had three additional witnesses under subpoena whom he was not able to call because of the time limitations set by the magistrate. Additionally, Huston asserts that the trial court improperly limited his own testimony on direct to only 15 minutes. Thus, Huston argues, the improper time limitations enforced by the magistrate amounted to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">{\u00b6 41} After a thorough review of the record, we conclude that the magistrate improperly limited the time in which Huston could present his case. Although the magistrate was already acquainted with the parties and the specific facts of the case prior to the custody hearing, the first hearing was held on February 12, 2009, for a half day. After the first hearing date, the trial was set over to May 20, 2009, at 1:30 p.m., as well as May 21, 2009, at 9:00 a.m., for the case to continue. Both hearing dates in May were continued because of scheduling conflicts. The magistrate set new hearing dates on August 18 and 26, 2009, in order to continue the hearing. On August 18, 2009, the magistrate was unavailable, and she continued the hearing date again, until August 26, 2009. At the beginning of the hearing on August 26, 2009, the magistrate limited the remainder of Huston\u2019s case-in-chief to one hour and 15 minutes, while giving Hood the remainder of the day to present her case. Huston\u2019s attorney immediately objected to the time limitations and stated that he was under the impression that he would be given a half day to complete his case. In fact, the record indicates that the remainder of the trial was to be held over to August 18 and 26, 2009. As stated, the August 18, 2009 date was cancelled and continued to August 26, 2009. On August 26, 2009, the magistrate clearly wanted to conclude the custody trial, but by limiting the remainder of Huston\u2019s case to one hour and fifteen minutes, the magistrate unfairly restricted Huston\u2019s ability to present his own testimony, as well as that of his remaining witnesses. Thus, the trial court abused its discretion when it adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision wherein the magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>unfairly limited the time in which Huston could present testimony and adduce evidence during the custody trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">{\u00b6 42} Huston\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">{\u00b6 43} Huston\u2019s third assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in quashing the subpoenas for the defendant\u2019s probation records and the records of the Montgomery County Children\u2019s Services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">{\u00b6 45} In his third assignment, Huston argues that the magistrate erred when it quashed his subpoenas for Hood\u2019s probation records, as well as records from Montgomery County Children Services relating to T.H. Huston\u2019s counsel requested the records during the hearing on February 12, 2009. After she received the documents, the magistrate performed an in camera review of the records prior to the hearing on August 26, 2009. Based on her review, the magistrate determined that the records contained no probative or relevant evidence and quashed the subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">{\u00b6 46} Regarding the subpoena for the probation records, Huston asserts that the documents were important to provide evidence of Hood\u2019s \u201cdeviant character.\u201d During the custody hearing, evidence was adduced that Hood had been charged with and convicted of two counts of felony theft of drugs. Evidence was also adduced that Hood successfully completed probation almost a year before the date of the custody hearing. Additionally, evidence was adduced that established that Hood was regularly tested for illegal drug use, and her urine screens were clean. Hood even testified herself regarding her past convictions. As is clear from the transcript of the hearing, Huston was able to adduce ample evidence of Hood\u2019s past criminal convictions. Accordingly, we see no prejudice to Huston stemming from the magistrate\u2019s decision to quash the subpoena for Hood\u2019s probation records.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">{\u00b6 47} With respect to the subpoena for the records from Montgomery County Children Services, Huston asserts that he should have been entitled to discovery of the documents but does not provide any reason that his request should have been granted. The magistrate stated that she conducted an in camera inspection of the records and determined that they were neither discoverable nor relevant. Other than his bare assertion that the documents were somehow relevant, Huston fails to establish how he was prejudiced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>magistrate\u2019s decision to quash the subpoena for the children services records. Thus, the trial court did not err when it adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 48} Huston\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">{\u00b6 49} Huston\u2019s fourth assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cIt was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to rely on the guardian ad litem\u2019s report that was never supplemented for trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">{\u00b6 51} In his fourth assignment, Huston contends that the magistrate improperly relied on the GAL\u2019s report because the GAL failed to supplement her report prior to the second day of the custody hearing on August 26, 2009. The record reflects that the GAL filed an initial report on February 9, 2009, in which she recommended that T.H. be placed in the custody of Hood. While fading to cite any legal authority requiring the GAL to file a supplemental report, Huston essentially disagrees with the GAL\u2019s recommendation that custody of T.H. be awarded to Hood. Rather, Huston asserts that the evidence adduced at the hearing overwhelmingly established that he should have retained custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">{\u00b6 52} R.C. 2851.281(1) outlines the duties of a GAL of a dependent child as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cThe guardian ad litem for an alleged or adjudicated abused, neglected, or dependent child shall perform whatever functions are necessary to protect the best interest of the child, including, but not limited to, investigation, mediation, monitoring court proceedings * * * and shall file any motions and other court papers that are in the best interest of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">{\u00b6 54} When questioned regarding her participation in the case, the GAL, Maureen Moloney, testified as follows at the August 26, 2009, hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-13\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cMs. Rutter: And, Ms. Moloney, you\u2019ve been involved in this case for quite some time, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-14\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cMs. Moloney: Since about October of \u201908, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-15\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cQ: So do you know how many \u2014 well, strike that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-16\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cI know you\u2019ve done at least one report on this case.

Additionally, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Moloney did not adequately fulfill her duties as a GAL in the present case. As noted above, Moloney\u2019s recommendation that Hood be awarded custody of T.H. did not change at any time. Moloney testified that she believed that T.H. had a better parental bond with Hood than she did with Huston, and that it was in T.H.\u2019s best interests to, therefore, be placed with Hood. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by relying on the GAL\u2019s report and subsequent testimony when it adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision awarding custody of T.H. to Hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">{\u00b6 73} Huston\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">{\u00b6 74} Huston\u2019s fifth and final assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-17\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error as the decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-18\">{\u00b6 76} In his final assignment, Huston argues that the trial court\u2019s judgment adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision that awarded custody of T.H. to Hood was against the manifest weight of the evidence. In light of our disposition with respect to Huston\u2019s first and second assignments of error, his fifth assignment is rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">{\u00b6 77} Huston\u2019s first and second assignments of error having been sustained, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the matter is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b246-7\">Grady, P.J., and Fain, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
