These applications arise out of a second appeal filed by the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">{\u00b62} In its first appeal, the state of Ohio presented the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">First Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">The trial court erred in imposing community control when it failed to make the required findings and failed to give adequate reasons for overcoming the presumption in favor of a prison term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">Second Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\">The trial court\u2019s imposition of community control is contrary to law, as defendant cannot overcome the presumption in favor of a prison term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-10\"><em>State v. Martin, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-1103, 2009-Ohio-3485, 2009 WL 2101833, \u00b6 4 <em>(\u201cMartin I \u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">{\u00b6 3} With respect to the first assignment of error, Judge French wrote for the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-12\">Here, the trial court attempted to provide the requisite findings and reasons in its sentencing entry. Nevertheless, a trial court must provide the findings and reasons at the sentencing hearing. See <em>State v. Wooden, </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-330, 2006-Ohio-212 [2006 WL 158434], \u00b6 5. Although the trial court said at the sentencing hearing that community control \u201cis the best way to protect the public,\u201d the court did not find that, under the R.C. 2929.12 factors, a community control sanction would adequately punish appellee and protect the public from future crime. Likewise, the trial court failed to find at the sentencing hearing that, under the R.C. 2929.12 factors, a community control sanction would not demean the seriousness of appellee\u2019s offense. Without these findings, the court failed to provide the required reasons to support a community control sanction. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court contravened R.C. 2929.13(D)(2) and 2929.19(B)(2)(b) when it imposed community control without providing the required findings and supporting reasons at the sentencing hearing. Accordingly, we sustain appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-13\"><em>Martin I </em>at \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">{\u00b6 4} With respect to the state\u2019s second assignment of error, Judge French wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-15\">In its second assignment of error, appellant asks us to review the record and determine that appellee must be sentenced to prison because the statutory findings and supporting reasons for a community control sanction cannot be made. We decline. Because the trial court sentenced appellee to community control without providing the required statutory findings and supporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>reasons at the sentencing hearing, the sentencing laws mandate that we remand this case to give the trial court the opportunity to do so. R.C. 2953.08(G)(1); <em>State v. Mathis, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855 [846 N.E.2d 1], \u00b6 35-36. Therefore, we overrule appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aay\"><em>Martin I </em>at \u00b6 8. The case was then remanded, and the trial court held a resentencing hearing on October 22, 2009. After the resentencing hearing, the trial court again found that the presumption in favor of prison had been overcome and sentenced the defendant to community control. By this time, the defendant had been incarcerated 312 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">{\u00b6 5} The state of Ohio appealed the trial court\u2019s sentencing a second time and again raised the same two assignments of error that were raised in the first appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">{\u00b6 6} On December 2, 2010, Judge Tyack, writing for the majority, found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">A panel of this court overruled the second assignment of error, which is identical to the second assignment of error the State alleges in this appeal. This issue has already been decided by this appellate court. The second assignment of error in this appeal is therefore overruled, based upon the doctrine of res judicata.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">In the first appeal, a panel of this court found that the trial court had not made all the findings required to overcome the legal presumption in favor of incarceration in a state prison for the offense of felonious assault. The trial court needed to find, under R.C. 2929.13(D)(2)(a) and (b):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">(a) A community control sanction * * * would adequately punish the offender and protect the public from future crime, because the applicable factors under section 2929.12 of the Revised Code indicating a lesser likelihood of recidivism outweigh the applicable factors under that section indicating a greater likelihood of recidivism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-10\">(b) A community control sanction * * * would not demean the seriousness of the offense, because one or more factors under section 2929.12 of the Revised Code that indicate that the offender\u2019s conduct was less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense are applicable, and they outweigh the applicable factors under that section that indicate that the offender\u2019s conduct was more serious than conduct normally constituting the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-11\">Following a remand to the trial court, the trial judge took great pains to attempt to comply with our mandate. The trial court held an additional sentencing hearing and issued a detailed sentencing entry which included the following.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-12\"><em>State v. Martin, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-1073, 2010-Ohio-5863, 2010 WL 4925841, \u00b6 6-8 <em>(\u201cMaHin II </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Judge Tyack quoted the trial judge\u2019s findings made in open court, writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\">The trial court went on to explain its findings, including a detailed review of Martin\u2019s mental health challenges and states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">In summary, the court finds that the presumption in favor of a term of imprisonment is rebutted on the evidence before it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">We find that the trial court followed our mandate and made the appropriate findings necessary to grant community control in this case. We, therefore, overrule the first assignment of error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-7\"><em>Martin II </em>at \u00b6 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">{\u00b6 8} The state alleges several errors in its applications for reconsideration and en banc consideration. When presented with an application for reconsideration, an appellate court must determine whether the application calls to the court\u2019s attention an obvious error in its decision, or raises an issue for consideration that was either not considered at all or not fully considered by the court when it should have been. <em>State v. Rowe </em>(Feb. 10, 1994), 10th Dist. No. 93AP-1763, 1994 WL 41312, citing <em>Matthews v. Matthews </em>(1981), 5 Ohio App.3d 140, 5 OBR 320, 450 N.E.2d 278. However, \u201c[a]n application for reconsideration is not designed for use in instances where a party simply disagrees with the conclusions reached and the logic used by an appellate court.\u201d <em>State v. Owens </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 334, 336, 678 N.E.2d 956. \u201cApp.R. 26 does not provide specific guidelines to be used by an appellate court when determining whether a decision should be reconsidered or modified.\u201d Id. at 335. Furthermore, if two or more appellate court decisions from the same district are in conflict, that appellate court must convene en banc to resolve the conflict. <em>Fleisher v. Ford Motor Co., </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-139, 2009-Ohio-4847, 2009 WL 2940168, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">{\u00b6 9} The first two alleged errors .address the state\u2019s second assignment of error and the majority\u2019s determination that the second assignment of error was barred by res judicata. We shall address those alleged errors first.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">{\u00b6 10} Upon reconsideration, we find that there is merit to the state\u2019s contention that res judicata is not applicable here. Although we declined to review the record in the first appeal and to determine that a prison sentence was required because the statutory findings and supporting reasons for a community-control sanction could not be made, a subsequent assignment of error on this same issue following a new hearing upon remand is not barred by res judicata. Because the issue before us on the second appeal involved a new sentencing hearing with new arguments, new information, and additional facts not previously available, and because the trial court made new findings as a result of that, the doctrine of res judicata is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>{\u00b6 11} \u201c \u2018The doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>is that an existing final judgment rendered upon the merits, without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent jurisdiction, is conclusive of rights, questions and facts in issue, as to the parties and their privies, in all other actions in the same or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Quality Ready Mix, Inc. v. Mamone </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 224, 227, 520 N.E.2d 193, quoting 30 American Jurisprudence 908, Section 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">{\u00b6 12} After remand, there was no final judgment of conviction, and the defendant\u2019s conviction upon resentencing was based upon new and additional information. Therefore, we find that res judicata is not applicable to the state\u2019s second assignment of error, and we grant the state\u2019s application for reconsideration on that limited issue and to that limited extent. However, this does not alter the majority\u2019s ultimate determination regarding the outcome of this appeal, as will be explained more fully below when we address the state\u2019s fourth and fifth alleged errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">{\u00b6 13} In its third assertion of error, the state argues that the majority erred by relying on the written sentencing entry to conclude that the trial court satisfied the requirement to make findings under R.C. 2929.13(D)(2) and 2929.19(B)(2)(b) at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">{\u00b6 14} The state is correct in arguing that a court\u2019s reliance upon findings set forth in a sentencing entry in order to meet the requirement for establishing the necessary findings and providing applicable reasoning <em>at the sentencing hearing </em>is improper. See <em>State v. Wooden, </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-330, 2006-Ohio-212, 2006 WL 158434, \u00b6 5 (a trial court must make its findings and also give its reasons for those findings at the sentencing hearing). See also <em>Martin I, </em>2009-Ohio-3485, 2009 WL 2101833, at \u00b6 7 (the trial court must provide its findings and reasons at the sentencing hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">{\u00b6 15} However, we disagree with the state\u2019s characterization that the majority here relied upon the written sentencing entry, which was journalized several days after the sentencing hearing, in order to determine that the proper findings and the corresponding reasons were established at the sentencing hearing. Although the majority may have cited the sentencing entry in demonstrating the ways in which the trial court set forth its findings and reasons, we did not rely upon the sentencing entry as a substitute to make up for findings not made at the hearing in order to determine that the appropriate findings and corresponding reasons had been set forth. While it could possibly be inferred that we relied upon the sentencing entry, we now clarify, as set forth in the analysis below, that we find that the trial court satisfied the requirements set forth in R.C. 2929.13(D) and cited the factors in R.C. 2929.12 at the sentencing hearing itself, independently from any findings set forth in the sentencing entry. As a result, and because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>there is no conflict, we deny the state\u2019s application for en banc consideration, as well as its application for reconsideration on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj5\">{\u00b6 16} In making its fourth and fifth assertions of error, the state alleges that upon reimposing community control, the trial court again failed to make the findings required by R.C. 2929.13(D) on the record at the sentencing hearing. Specifically, the state argues that the majority erred in determining that the trial court sufficiently explained how community control would protect the public and punish the offender and would not demean the seriousness of the offense, using the factors set forth in R.C. 2929.12.</p>\n<p id=\"A39\">{\u00b6 17} For the reasons set forth below, we find that the trial court made the required findings and gave adequate reasons for overcoming the presumption in favor of a prison term. We also find that the imposition of community control was not contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"AzB\">{\u00b6 18} Upon review of the record of the resentencing hearing, the court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATE\">[THE COURT:] Nevertheless, I make the findings in 2929.13(D)(2)(a) and (b) that a community control sanction is the best option to both adequately punish the defendant and to protect the public from future crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And that incarceration, which would interrupt the modest rehabilitation that Mr. Martin has undertaken for himself and that Southeast has tried to guide him, consistent with the Netcare report from last year about the deep-seated psychological issues that he\u2019s got to grapple with from his childhood, that community control is far better and far less costly than using incarceration, which will at the end of the day of incarceration, even if it\u2019s the maximum of eight years, still leave Mr. Martin a fairly young man with the rest of his life in which he\u2019s going to have to conform his behavior to the law and overcome the psychological issues that have driven us to some degree here today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aic\">The factors in 2929.12 that indicate a lesser likelihood of recidivism if there is community control linked with mental health care that is actually given, and not merely promised, by society justify a community control sanction and outweigh the factors in 2929.12 that indicate a greater likelihood of recidivism, in my view.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGr\">The poor mental health of the defendant was a significant factor at the time of the crime based upon the psychological information we have available, <em>rather than this being purely a case of criminality.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1c\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>In committing the offense, it appears the defendant acted under some perceived <em>strong </em>provocation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Now that may be totally fallacious, and he did enter a guilty plea to the crime, but he does claim, as has been pointed out, <em>not remembering assaulting the victim, and that gives some ground to mitigate the offender\u2019s conduct, although it is surely not a </em>defense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">The defendant, according to psychological evidence, suffers from PTSD, bipolar issues, and at least, normally, requires psychological medication to function. I take very seriously Mr. Edwards\u2019 comment that he\u2019s not on his meds now, but I still think that is a factor that can be addressed more swiftly and more accurately on a continuing basis using community control rather than tossing him in to the prison system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">I won\u2019t reiterate all the facts in the Netcare report of September 24th, \u201908, that produced the PTSD, anxiety, and deep psychological trauma, but at the same time, it\u2019s a man who is able to get through one year of college at Muskingum and who has the ability, I believe, in a <em>proper structure in the community to be a productive member of society.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">The court is concerned with a man who has done the crime like Mr. Martin of the ultimate protection, long term, of the public, and I think <em>given that focus, that the findings under 2929.13(D)(2)(b) can be made. That community control with that long-term focus will not demean the seriousness of the offense.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-9\">The trial court further found:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\"><em>I do not believe the facts show that the \u00a1factors ] suggesting the defendant\u2019s conduct was more serious than normally constituting the offense is fair, given the psychological background. </em>And as I\u2019ve already said, <em>we\u2019ve already incarcerated Mr. Martin for 10 months and 12 days on this thing.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-11\">In summary, the court finds that the presumption in favor of a term of imprisonment is rebutted on the evidence before it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">{\u00b6 19} Based upon the statement above, it is obvious that the court considered the 312 days of incarceration in the Franklin County Corrections Facility as part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>of the combined community-control sanctions he was about to impose.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVZ\">{\u00b6 20} The trial court also found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">The court further finds that by providing the opportunity for community control there is a <em>higher likelihood </em>that the victim will receive the financial restitution that was requested and is being ordered again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">And that by providing mental health treatment and community supervision, Mr. Martin is more likely to be rehabilitated successfully and have a much lower likelihood of recidivism.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Using community control, those goals can be accomplished at a far less financial cost to the public than tossing Mr. Martin in ODRC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">The court further finds that although the injuries inflicted on the victim were serious, that the mental health issues of the defendant at the time mitigate his misconduct, even though they were not a defense * * *.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">The court further believes and finds that the defendant shows <em>genuine remorse,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and with appropriate community supervision and mental health care, this criminal conduct is <em>unlikely to recur.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">\n<em>The court further finds in committing the offense, it remains unclear ivhether the defendant genuinely expected to cause significant physical harm to the victim since they were residing together and, as far as the record shows, there ivas no domestic violence instances that ever occurred before.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>13</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">{\u00b6 21} The record further reflects that the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record consists of two minor violations: a misdemeanor attempted importuning, for which he received a suspended sentence, and a disorderly conduct.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">{\u00b6 22} During the sentencing hearing, the trial court referred to the defendant\u2019s Neteare evaluation and made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>And then the question, of course, under this Netcare report from last year, which I\u2019m considering again, which is dated September 24th, that talks about Mr. Martin\u2019s rather abysmal background and that he was deeply affected by his early life experiences, has had a difficult time recovering from deep trauma-related psychological and emotional pain that he continuously experiences and is in need of long-term psychological treatment with a consistent provider. Those are the other facts that I think inform what I\u2019m supposed to do here today.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">{\u00b6 23} The trial court asked the defendant if he had anything that he wanted to say to the victim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">THE DEFENDANT: I do have remorse. I apologize for the things that happened to you. I really, really am sorry for the things you went through. That person wasn\u2019t me. That\u2019s not the person I am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">{\u00b6 24} It is clear from a review of the entire record at the resentencing hearing that the trial judge complied with the applicable provisions of R.C. 2929.13(D)(2)(a) and (b) and gave the appropriate findings and his reasons pursuant to R.C. 2929.12. The court imposed a combination of community-control sanctions, which consisted of intensive community control, combined with 312 days\u2019 incarceration, and also found that combination of sanctions adequately punished the offender and protected the public from future crime, because the applicable factors under R.C. 2929.12, which indicated a lesser likelihood of recidivism, outweighed the applicable factors under that section, which indicated a greater likelihood of recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">{\u00b6 25} Importantly, the trial court clearly and unequivocally found that the offense was committed under circumstances not likely to recur and cited its reasons for so finding. In addition, the court made no specific findings under R.C. 2929.12(D)(1) through (4). As previously stated, the record reflects that the defendant\u2019s criminal history consisted of an attempted importuning, a misdemeanor for which he received a suspended sentence, and a disorderly conduct. However, as the trial court generally inferred, these two misdemeanors do not constitute a significant history of criminal convictions that outweigh the factors set forth in R.C. 2929.12(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">{\u00b6 26} The trial court also found that a community-control sanction or a combination of community-control sanctions would not demean the seriousness of the offense because one or more factors under R.C. 2929.12 indicating that the offender\u2019s conduct was less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense are applicable, and those factors outweigh the applicable factors indicating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>the offender\u2019s conduct was more serious than conduct normally constituting the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">{\u00b6 27} Furthermore, the court found under R.C. 2929.12(C)(2) that in committing the offense, the offender acted under perceived strong provocation. The court further found that under R.C. 2929.12(C)(4), there are substantial grounds to mitigate the offender\u2019s conduct, although the grounds are not enough to constitute a defense. And finally, the court found that under R.C. 2929.12(C)(3), in committing the offense, the offender did not cause or expect to cause physical harm to any person.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">{\u00b6 28} The trial court also complied with the purposes and principles of felony sentencing, which are set forth in R.C. 2929.11:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">(A) A court that sentences an offender for a felony shall be guided by the overriding purposes of felony sentencing. The overriding purposes of felony sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the sentencing court shall consider the need for incapacitating the offender, deterring the offender and others from future crime, rehabilitating the offender, and making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">{\u00b6 29} It is clear from the trial court\u2019s findings made at the resentencing hearing that it did in fact fulfill the overriding purposes of felony sentencing pursuant to R.C. 2929.11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">{\u00b6 30} In short, it is evident that the trial court made the appropriate findings pursuant to R.C. 2929.13(D)(2)(a) and (b) and also set forth sufficient reasons under R.C. 2929.12, and as a result, the trial court overcame the presumption for a prison sentence. Therefore, we cannot find that the trial court\u2019s resentencing determination was clearly and convincingly contrary to law. Instead, it is in accordance with law and in accordance with the overriding purposes of felony sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">{\u00b6 31} In conclusion, although we agree that the majority\u2019s prior decision overruling the second assignment of error on res judicata grounds was improper, and thus we grant the state\u2019s application for reconsideration on that very limited issue, we deny the state\u2019s applications in all other respects, as we find the state\u2019s first and second assignments of error without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">Application for reconsideration granted in part and denied in part; application for en banc consideration denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b727-13\">Tyack and Dorrian, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AX_\">.
