Phillabaum executed a $89,528 promissory note with a 6)4 percent interest rate payable in monthly installments for 30 years, and a mortgage as security on that loan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He and appellee Linda Ferguson (n.k.a. Linda Phillabaum) subsequently married. In late 2008, both lost their jobs and were sent into default.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Appellant commenced the instant action on August 3, 2009, and requested that the principal balance of the loan be accelerated and the mortgage foreclosed. Both parties eventually requested summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">{\u00b6 5} The dispositive issue in the case sub judice is whether the bank complied with federal regulations, promulgated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d), prior to pursuing foreclosure. In the end, the trial court found that it had not and ruled in favor of the appellees. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">{\u00b6 6} In its sole assignment of error, the bank asserts that the trial court erred by denying its Civ.R. 56(C) motion and by granting summary judgment to the appellees. We disagree with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">{\u00b6 7} Before we turn to the merits of the assignment of error, we first pause to address the appropriate standard of review. Appellate courts review summary judgments de novo. See <em>Broadnax v. Greene Credit Serv. </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 881, 887, 694 N.E.2d 167; <em>Coventry Twp. v. Ecker </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 38, 41, 654 N.E.2d 1327. In other words, we afford no deference whatsoever to a trial court\u2019s decision; <em>Hicks v. Leffler </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 424, 427, 695 N.E.2d 777; <em>Dillon v. Med. Ctr. Hosp. </em>(1993), 98 Ohio App.3d 510, 514-515, 648 N.E.2d 1375. Instead, we conduct our own independent review to determine whether summary judgment is appropriate. <em>Woods v. Dutta </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 228, 233-234, 695 N.E.2d 18; <em>Phillips v. Rayburn </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 374, 377, 680 N.E.2d 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">{\u00b6 8} Summary judgment under Civ.R. 56(C) is appropriate when a movant shows that (1) no genuine issues of material fact exist, (2) he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) after the evidence is construed most strongly in favor of the nonmovant, reasonable minds can come to one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>Zivich v. Mentor Soccer Club, Inc. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 367, 369-370, 696 N.E.2d 201; <em>Mootispaw v. Eckstein </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 383, 385, 667 N.E.2d 1197. The moving party bears the initial burden to show that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 429, 674 N.E.2d 1164; <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. If that burden is met, the onus then shifts to the nonmoving party to provide rebuttal evidentiary materials. See <em>Trout v. Parker </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 720, 723, 595 N.E.2d 1015; <em>Campco Distribs., Inc. v. Fries </em>(1987), 42 Ohio App.3d 200, 201, 537 N.E.2d 661. Additionally, to the extent that this case turns on the interpretation of federal regulations, these are legal issues to which we also apply de novo review. See generally <em>Howell v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs., </em>Belmont App. No. 08BE25, 2009-Ohio-1510, 2009 WL 825735, at \u00b6 29; <em>Dawson v. Williamsburg of Cincinnati Mgt. Co. </em>(Feb. 4, 2000), Hamilton App. No. C-981022, 2000 WL 125891 (cases applying principle to interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>the Ohio Administrative Code). With these principles in mind, we turn our attention to the case sub judice.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">{\u00b6 9} As we mentioned above, the dispositive issue is whether the bank complied with all pertinent HUD regulations before it initiated the foreclosure process. After our review, we agree with the trial court that it did not.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">{\u00b6 10} The acceleration clause of the note that the appellee executed states: If [bjorrower defaults by failing to pay in full any monthly payment, then [ljender may, <em>except as limited by regulations of the Secretary </em>in the case of payment defaults, require immediate payment in full of the principal balance remaining due and all accrued interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">{\u00b6 11} Both parties agree that the pertinent federal regulation at issue is set out in Title 24, C.F.R. 203.604(b), and requires a \u201cface-to-face\u201d interview between a mortgagor and mortgagee before three full monthly installments on the mortgage are unpaid. Here, there is no dispute that the bank did not conduct such a meeting. Instead, the bank argues that it falls under an exception to that requirement because the \u201cmortgaged property is not within 200 miles of the mortgagee, its servicer, or a <em>branch office </em>of either[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) 24 C.F.R. 203.604(C). However, appellee\u2019s affidavit in support of his cross-motion for summary judgment states, \u201cWells Fargo has at least one branch office -within 200 miles of my home\u201d and asserts that he has visited that office at least once. This evidence is sufficient for appellee to carry his initial Civ.R. 56(C) burden, and thus, the burden shifted to the bank to provide rebuttal materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">{\u00b6 12} The bank countered that the branch that appellee identified is simply a regular bank branch. It cited the HUD website (under \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d) where \u201cbranch\u201d was qualified to mean a mortgage \u201cservicing\u201d office. The bank argued that the nearest \u201cservicing center\u201d is in Frederick, Maryland, over 200 miles away, thus bringing Wells Fargo within the regulatory exception to the face-to-face meeting requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">{\u00b6 13} First, even if we accept the bank\u2019s interpretation of the regulation, we point out that this argument was raised in its reply memorandum, and we find nothing in the way of Civ.R. 56(C) evidentiary materials to establish that (1) there are no mortgage servicing personnel at the branch in Hamilton County or (2) the closest servicing center is in Maryland. The only affidavit that the bank submitted is attached to its original summary judgment motion, and it merely established default and the amount due and owing under the note. Absent some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Civ.R. 56(C) evidentiary materials to support its claims regarding the Hamilton County branch, the bank has not carried its burden of rebuttal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">{\u00b6 14} Second, aside from failing to carry its burden of rebuttal, we also agree with the trial court that the bank\u2019s argument is not particularly persuasive. The exception that the bank claims to fall under excuses the face-to-face meeting only if a \u201cmortgagee, its <em>servicer, </em>or a branch office of <em>either </em>\u201d is not within 200 miles of the property. (Emphasis added.) See 24 C.F.R. 203.604(c). Here, the trial court aptly noted that this language is phrased in the disjunctive, meaning that there must be neither a \u201cservicer\u201d branch nor a \u201cmortgagee\u201d branch within 200 miles of the property. Construing a \u201cmortgagee\u201d branch to mean a \u201cservicing\u201d center seems redundant to the reference to \u201cservicer\u201d earlier in that very same sentence. There is no dispute that the mortgagee in this case is Wells Fargo. Therefore, a plain reading of this subsection suggests that the exception applies only if there is no branch of Wells Fargo within 200 miles. This court has repeatedly held that statutes mean what they say. See, e.g., <em>State v. McPherson </em>(2001), 142 Ohio App.3d 274, 280, 755 N.E.2d 426; <em>State ex rel. Athens Cty. Child Support Enforcement Agency v. Patel, </em>Athens App. No. 05CA20, 2006-Ohio-2951, 2006 WL 1613407, at \u00b6 20. We see no reason to apply a different standard simply because the issue here is a federal regulation rather than an Ohio statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">{\u00b6 15} We also point out that our First Appellate District colleagues recently came to the same conclusion on this issue. See <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A v. Isaacs, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-100111, 2010-Ohio-5811, 2010 WL 4884447, at \u00b6 10. Our decision is also consistent with a Second District Court of Appeals decision. See <em>Washington Mut. Bank v. Mahaffey, </em>154 Ohio App.3d 44, 2003-Ohio-4422, 796 N.E.2d 39, at \u00b6 26.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although not explicitly addressing the HUD website\u2019s construction of \u201cbranch,\u201d the court nevertheless rejected the bank\u2019s argument that a branch in Louisville, Kentucky excepted it from the 200-mile requirement simply because that branch did not \u201cservice\u201d mortgage loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">{\u00b6 16} If HUD desires to construe the word \u201cbranch\u201d differently from its plain meaning, it can amend its regulation. Until directed otherwise, however, we will give those words their plain meaning. We also emphasize, as the trial court aptly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>noted, that nothing prohibits the bank from again seeking foreclosure once it complies with the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">{\u00b6 17} Accordingly, based upon the reasons discussed above, we hereby overrule appellant\u2019s assignment of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b753-7\">Harsha, P.J., and McFarland, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-15\">. Appellant was not the original lender, but rather an assignee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b751-11\">. The term \"Secretary\u201d is thereafter defined to mean \"the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\">. The bank also argues that the HUD handbook supports its interpretation of the word \"branch.\u201d We reject that argument for the same reason (lack of evidentiary materials) and because it was raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b752-9\">. One federal district court came to the same conclusion and declined to interpret the word \"branch\u201d in light of what was said on HUD\u2019s website. The court noted that \"branch\u201d is an unambiguous term and should be construed as it is used in common parlance. <em>See Kersey v. PHH Mtge. Corp. </em>(E.D.Va.2010), 682 F.Supp.2d 588, 602-605. This opinion was later vacated, but it is unclear why.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
