REISNER, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Plaintiffs, Camden Iron &amp; Metal, Inc. and SPC Corporation, Inc., filed suit in New Jersey to enjoin defendants, the law firm of Klehr, Harrison, Harvey, Branzburg &amp; Ellers, LLP and one of its attorneys, Ronald J. Patterson, from representing a Pennsylvania client, Packer Park Civic Association, Inc., in a proceeding in Pennsylvania before the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP). The Law Division denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint and issued an injunction prohibiting defendants from representing the Civic Association in the Pennsylvania matter. We granted defendants\u2019 motion for leave to appeal and stayed the trial court\u2019s order. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Assuming the allegations in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint to be true, these facts were before the trial court. Camden Iron is incorporated in New Jersey. Its subsidiary, SPC, is incorporated in Pennsylvania. From approximately 1993 to 1996, Ronald Patterson, then an associate with the New Jersey firm of Archer &amp; Greiner, provided legal advice and representation to Camden Iron and SPC on environmental matters, including matters before the PADEP. Patterson lives in Philadelphia and is admitted to practice law in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In 1999, he left Archer &amp; Greiner and became an associate in the Philadelphia office of Klehr, Harrison, a firm with offices in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In 2005, Klehr, Harrison began representing the Civic Association, a Pennsylvania citizens\u2019 group, in PADEP hearings on two permit applications by SPC to process scrap tires and household scrap metal at its recycling facility in the Packer Park <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>neighborhood of Philadelphia. Patterson lived in that neighborhood and belonged to the Civic Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that Patterson participated in representing the Civic Association in his capacity as an attorney with Klehr, Harrison. Plaintiffs contended \u201c[u]pon information and belief\u2019 that Patterson may have disclosed confidential information that he obtained during the course of his earlier representation of Camden Iron and SPC, and that even if he did not do so, the representation violated both the New Jersey and Pennsylvania Eules of Professional Conduct. In essence, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint sought to disqualify Patterson and his law firm from representing the Civie Association in the PADEP hearings. But the complaint did not name the Civic Association as a party, and plaintiffs concede that New Jersey courts do not have <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, asserting lack of subject matter jurisdiction and <em>forum non conveniens </em>and contending that the complaint should have been filed in Pennsylvania. Plaintiffs cross-moved for an injunction prohibiting defendants from representing or providing legal advice to the Association and from disclosing any of plaintiffs\u2019 confidential information. In opposition to the cross-motion, Patterson submitted a certification denying that he had actually represented the Association, admitting that he had had some general discussions with his partners concerning his own \u201cplain view\u201d observations of blue smoke emanating from the SPC facility, and asserting that as soon as plaintiffs made them aware of their concerns the firm had screened him from any participation in the PADEP matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Following oral argument on both motions, the Law Division judge issued an oral opinion denying the motion to dismiss and granting the injunction. He concluded that the New Jersey courts had <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over defendants because the claim was based on an attorney-client relationship between plaintiff and defendants in New Jersey and defendants had sufficient minimum contacts with New Jersey. He also rejected defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>forum non conveniens </em>argument, because of the \u201cclose proximity of Camden and Pennsylvania and the defendant\u2019s contacts with New Jersey.\u201d He concluded that Patterson\u2019s successive representation of plaintiffs and then the Association would violate RPC 1.10 and RPC 1.9 because the Association\u2019s interests were \u201cmaterially adverse\u201d to those of plaintiffs and \u201cthe current representation involved a matter substantially related to the former representation.\u201d He therefore concluded that this situation \u201cwarrants ... disqualification\u201d of Patterson and Klehr, Harrison from representing the Association. He also accepted plaintiffs\u2019 contention that \u201can injunction is necessary to prevent potential [breach] of client confidentiality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We conclude that the trial court erred in denying the motion to dismiss for several reasons. First, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is based on their assertion that defendants are violating the New Jersey and Pennsylvania RPCs. But the courts of this State do not have subject matter jurisdiction to enforce the Rules of Professional Conduct of another State. <em>See Goodwin Motor Corp. v. Mercedes-Benz of N. Am., Inc., </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>263, 274, 411 A.2d 1144 (App.Div.1980). The Supreme Court of New Jersey and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania have exclusive jurisdiction to control the practice of law in their respective states. <em>See In re LiVolsi, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>576, 583, 428 A.2d 1268 (1981); <em>Commonwealth v. Stern, </em>549 <em>Pa. </em>505, 701 A.2d 568, 570-71 (1997). And in this case, the legal activity to which plaintiffs object is taking place exclusively in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Moreover, in this State, the Rules of Professional Conduct do not provide an independent basis for a cause of action. In <em>Baxt v. Liloia, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>190, 714 A.2d 271 (1998), the Supreme Court declined to hold \u201cthat the RPCs in themselves create a duty or that a violation of the RPCs, standing alone, can form the basis for a cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201, 714 A.2d 271; <em>Banco Popular N. Am. v. Gandi, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>161, 182 n. 8, 876 A.2d 253 (2005). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>extent to which the RPCs are central to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is evident in the relief they seek. Some counts of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint can be read as asserting \u201c[u]pon information and belief\u2019 that Patterson is disclosing plaintiffs\u2019 confidential information to the Civic Association, a breach of a fiduciary duty from which Patterson might be enjoined. But the remedy plaintiffs seek, disqualification of Patterson\u2019s entire law firm from representing the Association even if Patterson is completely walled off from the PADEP litigation and even if he has not disclosed any confidential information, is an RPC-based remedy. <em>See Dewey v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>201, 536 <em>A.2d 243 </em>(1988). It would not necessarily be the appropriate remedy in an action based solely on alleged disclosure of confidential information or on common law breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We also address defendants\u2019 contention that the complaint should have been dismissed under the doctrine of <em>forum, non conveniens. </em>We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on the application of this doctrine under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Kurzke v. Nissan Motor Corp., </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>159, 165, 752 A.2d 708 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u201cAlthough phrased in a variety of ways, the essence of the doctrine is that a court may decline jurisdiction whenever the ends of justice indicate a trial in the forum selected by the plaintiff would be inappropriate.\u201d <em>D'Agostino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc., </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>250, 259, 542 A.2d 44 (App.Div.1988), <em>aff'd, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>491, 559 A.2d 420 (1989). In making that decision, courts weigh a variety of public-interest and private-interest factors. The public interest factors include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">(1) the administrative difficulties which follow from having litigation pile up in congested centers rather than being handled at its origin, (2) the imposition of jury duty on members of a community having no relation to the litigation, (3) the local interest in the subject matter such that affected members of the community may wish to view the trial and (4) the local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\"><em>[Kurzke, supra, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>at 165, 752 A.2d 708]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An5p\">The private interest factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">(1) the relative ease of access to sources of proof, (2) the availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses and the cost of obtaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>attendance of willing witnesses, (3) whether a view of the premises is appropriate to the action and (4) all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive, including the enforceability of the ultimate judgment. <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The <em>forum non conveniens </em>analysis is qualitative rather than quantitative, and the burden is on defendants to demonstrate the inappropriateness of plaintiffs\u2019 chosen forum.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">The determination as to the proper forum is not to be derived by a simple balancing test of conveniences. A defendant must still bear the burden of establishing that the plaintiffs choice of forum is \u201cdemonstrably inappropriate\u201d and designed to subject defendant to \u201charassment and vexation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\"><em>[Madan-Russo v. Grupo Posada, S.A. de C.V., </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>420, 427, 841 A.2d 489 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>448, 852 A.2d 187 (2004); citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">In this case, we are persuaded that defendants have carried their burden. First, the conduct complained of (defendants\u2019 representation of the Civic Association) and the underlying legal action before the PADEP are occurring exclusively in Pennsylvania. Second, defendants\u2019 client, the Association, is an indispensable party to the litigation because its right to the counsel of its choice will be affected by the outcome. <em>See R. </em>4:28-1(a) and (b). The Law Division implicitly recognized this when it characterized the remedy it was granting as \u201cdisqualification.\u201d Yet plaintiffs did not join the Civic Association in the lawsuit. At oral argument on this appeal, plaintiffs admitted that the New Jersey courts do not have <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over the Civic Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">SPC has an ongoing dispute with the Civic Association in Pennsylvania. We find fundamental unfairness in plaintiffs\u2019 effort to deprive the Association of its chosen counsel by filing suit in New Jersey, a jurisdiction foreign to the underlying dispute. In <em>Dewey v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 221, 536 A.2d 243, the Supreme Court recognized that \u201cthe disqualification of an attorney in pending litigation does a great disservice to the affected client.\u201d For that reason</p>\n<p id=\"Am\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>It follows that an action aimed at disqualifying an opposing party\u2019s counsel should be filed in the State where the underlying dispute is being litigated, so that the opposing party may readily participate to defend its right to \u201cfreely choose\u201d its counsel. <em>Ibid. </em>It is manifestly inappropriate to attempt, as plaintiffs have done here, to achieve disqualification of opposing counsel by filing a lawsuit in another State. <em>See Madan-Russo, supra, </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 427, 841 A.2d 489.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFk\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>a motion for disqualification calls for us to balance competing interests, weighing the \u201cneed to maintain the highest standards of the profession\u201d against \u201ca client's right freely to choose his counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 218, 536 A.2d 243, quoting <em>Gov\u2019t of India v. Cook Indus., Inc., </em>569 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir.1978).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Finally, we conclude that there is a strong local interest in Pennsylvania that outweighs plaintiffs\u2019 interest in litigating in New Jersey. <em>See Kurzke, supra, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>at 165, 752 A.2d 708. In addition to the interest of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in overseeing the practice of law in Pennsylvania, it appears undisputed that there is considerable local interest in the PADEP proceeding. The ability or inability of local citizens to participate in that proceeding, which concerns a recycling facility in then-neighborhood, is a matter of public interest in Philadelphia. Consequently, the potential disqualification of the Association\u2019s counsel is of far more local interest in Pennsylvania than it is in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Our conclusion is bolstered by plaintiffs\u2019 concession that they can obtain relief under Pennsylvania law in the courts of Pennsylvania. At oral argument, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated, and we agree, that the courts of Pennsylvania recognize the cause of action plaintiffs seek to assert here. <em>Maritrans GP, Inc. v. Pepper, Hamilton &amp; Scheetz, </em>529 <em>Pa. </em>241, 602 A.2d 1277, 1283 (1992). Consequently, plaintiffs can obtain complete relief in Pennsylvania. Litigating this matter in Pennsylvania will not cause any \u201csignificant hardship\u201d to plaintiffs. <em>Mowrey v. Duriron Co., </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>402, 409, 616 A.2d 1300 (App.Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">We do not need to decide in this case whether our Supreme Court would follow the Pennsylvania Court\u2019s approach in <em>Maritrans. </em>Under <em>forum non conveniens </em>principles, we find plaintiffs\u2019 choice of New Jersey as the forum to be \u201cdemonstrably inappropriate.\u201d <em>Mowrey, supra, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 409, 616 A.2d 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Therefore, we reverse the decision of the trial court, vacate the injunction and remand for issuance of an order dismissing the complaint without prejudice to its being filed in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
