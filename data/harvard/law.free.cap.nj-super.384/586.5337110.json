(Partially Raised Below.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-17\">\n<em>POINT VI</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-18\">THE SENTENCE IMPOSED WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-19\">We reverse, because we find that the appearance before the jury of a witness for the prosecution (defendant\u2019s alleged co-conspirator) in handcuffs and leg shackles, in the absence of an evidentiary record establishing that security concerns posed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the witness outweighed the potential prejudice caused by his appearance in restraints, denied defendant his right to a fair trial under the Federal and New Jersey Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Testimony at trial disclosed that on July 15, 2002 defendant told drinking companion Bashir Muhammad that he knew of a place to obtain money and marijuana, and he suggested a nighttime break-in. The two men proceeded to and entered an apartment occupied by Thomas Sloane and his girlfriend, Desiree Kise, where they were discovered by Sloane. Defendant, armed with a knife, lunged at Sloane, and a struggle ensued, during which defendant \u201cpoked at\u201d Sloan with his knife and threatened to kill him. Both intruders had their faces covered by their T-shirts. However, Kise recognized defendant\u2019s voice as that of \u201cTwiz,\u201d the street name by which defendant was known. Although defendant denied the identification, stating \u201c[i]t ain\u2019t Twiz, it ain\u2019t Twiz,\u201d as the struggle continued, defendant\u2019s shirt was partially removed from his face, permitting Sloane to confirm the identification. When Kise then sought to call 911, Muhammad struck the phone out of her hand and said to defendant \u201clet\u2019s go.\u201d They did so, and were soon thereafter apprehended by the police in front of a bar located a short distance from the crime site. A protective search following defendant\u2019s arrest resulted in the discovery of a pocket knife with a serrated blade.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Muhammad confessed to the police and later entered a plea of guilty to conspiracy to commit second-degree burglary and hindering apprehension. He agreed to testify for the State against defendant as a condition of the post-trial imposition of a six-year custodial term subject to NERA. Muhammad\u2019s testimony was given while he was in custody awaiting sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">We find no merit in defendant\u2019s first argument that the trial court erred in failing to charge renunciation of the criminal purpose of robbery as the result of the departure of defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Muhammad from the apartment before anything was stolen. The affirmative defense of renunciation is governed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1(d) (applying to attempts), 2C:2-6e(3) (applying to accomplices), and 2C:5-2e (applying to conspirators). All three statutes require the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence specified forms of conduct occurring under circumstances manifesting a \u201ccomplete and voluntary renunciation\u201d of the defendant\u2019s criminal purpose. Both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6e(3) and 2C:5-2e refer specifically to the explanation of voluntary renunciation contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1(d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">[Renunciation of criminal purpose is not voluntary if it is motivated, in whole or in part, by circumstances, not present or apparent at the inception of the actor\u2019s course of conduct, which increase the probability of detection or apprehension or which make more difficult the accomplishment of the criminal purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The record in this matter discloses that, prior to the time that defendant and Muhammad determined to abandon their criminal enterprise, Sloan had discovered their unlawful presence in his apartment and had engaged in a struggle with defendant, preventing him from proceeding with the intended theft of property. Both Sloan and his girlfriend Kise had learned defendant\u2019s identity, and Kise had made an attempt, albeit unsuccessful, to call the police. It was only then that the two co-conspirators, at Muhammad\u2019s urging, fled. The record offers no evidence to suggest that defendant renounced his criminal purpose. Indeed, at trial Muhammad testified that defendant later queried whether the two should resume their criminal activities. Thus the evidence establishes, rather than renunciation, only temporary abandonment of purpose when the crime proved at the time to be more difficult and risky than planned. In this circumstance, there was no rational basis for the jury to conclude that the affirmative defense of renunciation had been proven, and therefore no grounds existed for the charge that defendant requested. <em>State v. Alston, </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>113, 121, 709 A.2d 310 (App.Div.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">At trial, Muhammad testified for the State while dressed in prison garb and while restrained both by handcuffs and leg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>shackles. Prior to his testimony as a witness, defense counsel objected to Muhammad\u2019s appearance in restraints and clothing identifying him as a prisoner, arguing that it prejudiced defendant. The court overruled the objection, stating with respect to Muhammad\u2019s restraints:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">I\u2019m a firm believer that everybody in life has a job to do. The sheriff\u2019s deputies have a job to do. They\u2019re responsible for security in this courtroom. If they wish the witness to appear unshackled, that\u2019s fine. If they don\u2019t, that\u2019s also fine. I leave that up to them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Upon being informed of the sheriffs officers\u2019 wish that Muhammad remain shackled because two inmates were present in the courtroom, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">Two inmates? Oh, all right. Either that or you get more deputies, I guess. That \u2014 very well. You\u2019re going to maybe have to assist Mr. [Muhammad] to get up in the witness stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The judge did not address the subject of Muhammad\u2019s clothing or permit him to change into civilian clothes. Additionally, he did not instruct the jurors at the commencement of Muhammad\u2019s testimony that they could draw no inference of defendant\u2019s guilt from Muhammad\u2019s appearance, and he gave no such instruction at the close of the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A motion for a mistrial based upon Muhammad\u2019s clothing and restraints was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Our Federal and State Constitutions both guarantee defendant the right to a fair trial before an impartial jury and to a determination of guilt or innocence based solely on the evidence introduced at trial, \u201cand not on grounds of official suspicion, indictment, continued custody, or other circumstances not adduced as proof at trial.\u201d <em>State v. Artwell, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>526, 533-34, 832 A.2d 295 (2003) (quoting <em>State v. Zhu, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>544, 553, 761 A.2d 523 (2000), quoting <em>Taylor v. Kentucky, </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>478, 485, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1930, 1934, 56 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>468, 475 (1978) and citing <em>U.S. Const. </em>amends. V, VI and XIV; <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, \u00b6 10). As a result, a trial court may allow an inherently prejudicial practice \u201conly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>where justified by an essential state interest specific to each trial.\u201d <em>Artwell, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 534, 832 A.2d 295 (quoting <em>Holbrook v. Flynn, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>560, 568-69, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1340, 1345-46, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>525, 534 (1986)). A practice is \u201cinherently prejudicial\u201d when \u201can unacceptable risk is presented of impermissible factors coming into play.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 <em>U.S. </em>501, 505, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1691, 1693, 48 L.Ed.2d 126, 131 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Courts have long held that to insure his fair trial, a criminal <em>defendant </em>has the right to appear before a jury free from restraints. <em>See, e.g., State v. Roberts, </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>159, 162-63, 206 A.2d 200 (App.Div.1965) (discussing common-law origins of the rule). We have found the reason for the rule to lie, in part, in the recognition that a jury \u201cmust necessarily conceive a prejudice against the [restrained] accused, as being in the opinion of the judge a dangerous man, and one not to be trusted, even under the surveillance of officers,\u201d in which case the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial is infringed. <em>Id. </em>at 164, 206 A.2d 200 (quoting <em>State v. Kring, </em>64 <em>Mo. </em>591, 592-93 (1877)); <em>see also State v. Damon, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>492, 498, 669 A.2d 860 (App.Div.1996); <em>State v. Jones, </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>596, 599, 328 A.2d 41 (Law Div.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">We held in <em>Roberts </em>that although the trial judge has the discretion to order that restraints be imposed, that discretion is strictly confined and can be exercised only upon demonstration of a sound reason for the ordered precautions, based upon a consideration of the individual circumstances presented. <em>Id. </em>at 164-68, 206 A.2d 200.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that context, we found that evidence solely indicating a deferral to the wishes of the officers in charge of the prisoner does not provide grounds for the conclusion that the court\u2019s discretion has been meaningfully exercised. <em>Id. </em>at 166, 206 A.2d 200. When such total deference is extended, we observed, \u201c[t]here [has been] thus a complete resignation of the exercise of discretion\u201d; custodial authorities dictated the shackling, not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>judge. <em>Id. </em>at 166, 206 A.2d 200.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we determined that the entire security issue should be aired \u00e1t a transcribed hearing, \u201chowever informal, but on the record,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 167, 206 A.2d 200, so that a record will exist \u201con which an appellate court can determine if the trial judge has properly exercised his discretion, <em>i.e., </em>whether there were reasonable grounds for apprehension as to defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d Ibid.; <em>see also Damon, supra, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 499, 669 A.2d 860. We further held that when, after a hearing, the court concludes that restraints are necessary, \u201cit is of the essence that [the court] instruct the jury in the clearest and most emphatic terms that it give such restraint no consideration whatever in assessing the proofs and determining guilt. This is the least that can be done toward insuring a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168, 206 A.2d 200; <em>see also Damon, supra, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 499, 669 A.2d 860. However, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">It may be doubted whether any jury, even with the best of cautionary instructions, can ever dismiss from its mind that the accused has appeared before it in handcuffs or chains. His being restrained must carry obvious implications even to the most fairminded of juries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\"><em>[Roberts, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 168, 206 A.2d 200.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">We extended our holding to defendant\u2019s only witness in <em>State v. Smith, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>233, 787 A.2d 276 (App.Div.2002), observing that \u201c[wjhile shackling a defense witness is not the exact equivalent of shackling the defendant, in some circumstances ... the resulting prejudice can be equally detrimental.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239, 787 A.2d 276. We noted that our determination accorded with the American Bar Association\u2019s Standards for Criminal Justice, which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">(b) The court should not permit a defendant <em>or witness </em>to appear at trial in the distinctive attire of a prisoner, unless waived by defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>(c) No defendant should be removed from the courtroom, nor should defendants and <em>witnesses </em>be subject to physical restraint while in court unless the court has found such restraint necessary to maintain order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">(d) ... Whenever physical restraint or removal of a defendant <em>or witness </em>occurs in the presence of jurors trying the case, the court should instruct those jurors that such restraint or removal is not to be considered in assessing the proof and determining guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\"><em>[Smith, supra, </em>at 239-40, 787 A.2d 276 (quoting <em>Control Restraint or Removal of Defendants and Witnesses, </em>A.BA. Standards for Criminal Justice 15-3.2 (3d ed. 1996) (emphasis added in <em>Smith).)]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Additionally, in <em>Smith </em>we found that the balancing of the need for courtroom security against the potential prejudice of the restraints and the procedures adopted for that determination that we had recognized in earlier decisions regarding defendants applied equally to their witnesses, as did the need for jury instruction if the court found it necessary for a witness to testify while in restraints. <em>Id. </em>at 240-41, 787 A.2d 276. Although we hypothesized that the testimony of certain defense witnesses could be found so peripheral to issues of guilt or innocence that the appearance of a witness in prison garb and restraints did not constitute reversible error, we found such error to exist in <em>Smith, </em>since the witness at issue was the only independent person to testify to defendant\u2019s innocence of the crime for which he was charged. <em>Id. </em>at 240-41, 787 A.2d 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\"><em>Smith </em>was followed in short order by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Artwell, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>526, 882 A.2d 295, holding that a defense witness could not be required to appear in restraints, without a demonstration of their necessity, or in prison garb. <em>Artwell </em>was decided within a week after the conclusion of defendant\u2019s trial. Although it was cited as precedent by defense counsel in his motion for a new trial, the court distinguished that precedent because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision concerned a defense, not a prosecution witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">We find the trial court\u2019s distinction as applied to this case to be illusory. It must be recalled that defendant was accused of a crime of violence. Muhammad, a State\u2019s witness, had been charged as defendant\u2019s co-conspirator in that same crime. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>trial, he testified that the two entered a house for the purpose of robbery; they were discovered; defendant pulled a knife and while thus armed engaged in a struggle with a male apartment resident; defendant made a demand for \u201cthe shit;\u201d and defendant was identified by the apartment\u2019s female occupant as \u201cTwiz.\u201d Muhammad also testified to defendant\u2019s inquiry, after they had run from the apartment, whether he \u201cwant[ed] to go back and finish the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">During the course of his direct testimony, Muhammad\u2019s plea of guilty to conspiracy to commit second-degree burglary and to hindering apprehension, his potential sentence of six years in custody subject to NERA, the fact that the sentence was conditioned upon Muhammad\u2019s truthful testimony at trial, and the fact that Muhammad awaited sentencing was disclosed to the jury. Additionally the jury was apprised of Muhammad\u2019s prior convictions on two occasions for possession of drugs and his convictions for tampering with evidence, for receipt of stolen property, and for endangering the welfare of a child. Nonetheless, the Court in <em>Artwell </em>has observed that: \u201cEven in those instances when the prosecution demonstrates a witness\u2019s criminal history to the jury by the entry of a conviction into evidence, that fact does not mitigate the additional harm caused by the sight of defendant\u2019s witness in restraints.\u201d 177 <em>N.J. </em>at 536, 832 A.2d 295. The fact of a witness\u2019 incarceration does not \u201cimply that he [is] violent and ha[s] to be restrained in the jury\u2019s presence.\u201d <em>Damon, supra, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 498, 669 A.2d 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In the case of a defense witness, the <em>Artwell </em>Court\u2019s concern was that the fact of restraints would diminish the credibility of the witness in the jury\u2019s view. 177 <em>N.J. </em>at 537, 832 A.2d 295. That concern may have less direct significance to the defendant here. Nonetheless, the court as an legal institution must be concerned when the import of the testimony of any witness, whether on behalf of the defense or the prosecution, can be judged in part by the witness\u2019 status, rather than solely by its content and credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Further, as Justice Brennan has recognized in a concurring opinion, shackling \u201coffends not only judicial dignity and decorum, but also that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>337, 350-51, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1057, 1064, 25 L.Ed.2d 353, 363 (1970). The restraints upon Muhammad served to de-individualize him, permitting the jury to consider him simply as one of the \u201ccriminal class.\u201d Transference of this mindset to defendant at a time when the presumption of innocence applied to him would be wholly inappropriate and fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Of additional significance, the existence of restraints necessarily conveyed the impression that the judge regarded Muhammad \u201cas a dangerous man, and one not to be trusted, even under the surveillance of officers.\u201d <em>Artwell, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 534, 832 A.2d 295 (quoting <em>Kennedy v. </em>Cardwell 487 F.2d 101, 106 (6th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 <em>U.S. </em>959, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>1976, 40 L.Ed.2d 310 (1974), quoting <em>Kring, supra, </em>64 <em>Mo. </em>at 592-93).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">This is not a case such as we hypothesized in <em>Smith </em>in which the testimony of the restrained witness was insignificant to the outcome. Although both victims of the crime testified to defendant\u2019s conduct, Muhammad\u2019s testimony provided crucial corroboration of defendant\u2019s actions and intent. That defendant\u2019s co-conspirator could be perceived by a jury to have had a inherently violent nature or to have committed a crime with defendant of sufficient violence to require restraints cannot be considered a <em>de minimis </em>concern in this circumstance. As the <em>Artwell </em>Court expressed it, the display of Muhammad in handcuffs and leg shackles \u201cpresented defendant as one who associates with individuals of questionable\u201d and indeed dangerous character in a dangerous enterprise. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 832 A.2d 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Moreover, <em>Artwell </em>affirmed the principle that \u201cthe trial court may subject a witness to physical restraint only when it \u2018has reason to believe it is necessary to maintain the security of the courtroom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537, 832 A.2d 295 (quoting <em>Harrell v. Israel, </em>672 F.2d 632, 635 (7th Cir.1982)). And to make that determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>tion, the court must \u201chold a hearing, however informal, and state on the record out of the jury\u2019s presence [its] reasons for shackling the [witness], whether they are based on evidence from trial, information obtained from criminal records, or statements made by law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Damon, supra, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 499, 669 A.2d 860). As stated by the <em>Artwell </em>Court, the trial court should consider, among other things,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">(1) the seriousness of the present charge, (2) the person\u2019s character, (3) the person\u2019s past record, (4) past escapes by the person, (5) attempted escapes by the person, (6) evidence the person is planning an escape, (7) threats of harm to others, (8) threats to cause disturbance, (9) evidence the person is bent on self-destruction, (10) risk of mob violence, (11) risk of attempted revenge by victim\u2019s family, [and] (12) other offenders still at large, ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 538, 832 A.2d 295 (quoting <em>State ex rel.

Mohn, </em>163 <em>W.Va. </em>129, 254 S.E.2d 805, 810 n. 7 (1979) (quoting A.BA Advisory Committee on the Criminal Trial, <em>Standards Relating to Trial by Jury </em>(Approved Draft 1968), at 96 n. 9), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>831, <em>104 S.Ct. </em>110, 78 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>112 (1983)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The necessity of a jury instruction when restraints are ordered, following a hearing, was also affirmed by the <em>Artwell </em>Court. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">As a final matter, the Court in <em>Artwell </em>additionally found the requirement that a prisoner testify in prison garb, unlike restraints, can further no vital State interest. <em>Id. </em>at 539, 832 <em>A.2d </em>295 (citing <em>State v. Maisonet, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>9, 17, 763 A.2d 1254 (2001)). Instead, among other things, it \u201csuggest[s] defendant\u2019s guilt by association.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>supra, 425 <em>U.S. </em>501, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1691, 48 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>126; <em>State v. Carrion-Collazo, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>103, 534 A.2d 21 (App.Div.1987), <em>certif. denied, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>171, 540 A.2d 171 (1988). Accordingly, the <em>Artwell </em>Court held that \u201cgoing forward, a trial court may not require a defendant\u2019s witness to appear at trial in prison garb.\u201d 177 <em>N.J. </em>at 539, 832 A.2d 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">In the present case, the trial judge did not establish the need for restraints as <em>Artwell </em>and the decisions that preceded it require, but instead surrendered his discretion to the sheriffs officers in the courtroom. When presented with the choice of summoning additional officers or imposing restraints, the judge without further discussion chose the latter. When a similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>circumstance arose in the context of restraint of a defendant in <em>Damon, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">It was inexcusable for the trial judge to require petitioner to remain handcuffed in the presence of the jury merely because there was a shortage of courtroom security personnel. A trial judge should not surrender the control of his or her courtroom to a claimed need for courtroom security at the sacrifice of petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial. Security measures should have been established which would have permitted petitioner to appear in the presence of the jury without handcuffs. [286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 497-98, 669 A.2d 860.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">When a risk exists that the jury will render its decision on a basis other than the evidence, such as here, \u201cdefendant\u2019s right to a fair trial requires that the risk be justified by an essential state interest.\u201d <em>Artwell, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 538, 832 A.2d 295. If a record had established the need for the restraints, they could in a proper exercise of discretion have been ordered. <em>Ibid. </em>However, the absence of record requires that we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction. For the reasons that we have previously discussed, we apply <em>Artwell\u2019s </em>holding regarding prison clothing, as well, to any State\u2019s witness in a future trial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">We note that conclusions similar to ours with respect to prison garb and restraints upon State\u2019s witnesses have been accepted by the Washington Supreme Court in its lengthy opinion in <em>Washington v. Rodriguez, </em>146 Wash.2d 260, 45 P.3d 541 (2001), a case cited favorably in <em>Artwell </em>in connection with its discussion of defense witnesses. 177 <em>N.J. </em>at 536, 832 A.2d 295.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Rodriguez, </em>which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>like the present matter concerned a participant in the crime who testified pursuant to a plea agreement against the defendant while in prison garb, handcuffs and leg shackles, the Court held that \u201c[t]o fully protect the defendant against being convicted by impermissible factors rather than solely by the evidence, the rule against physical restraints, without a showing of necessity, must apply to all inmate witnesses.\u201d 45 P.3d at 545.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court advanced, as a reason for the prohibition of prison garb and restraints other than the effect on the witness\u2019 credibility, the fact that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">The witness in this ease, while clad in clothing clearly denoting guilt and his status as a prisoner, testified to a criminal association with the defendant. This associate ed guilt and prisoner status had the potential to prejudice the presumption of innocence to which the defendant was entitled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 544.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Similarly, Muhammad\u2019s appearance undeniably prejudiced defendant, since it provided visual reinforcement to other evidence of his guilt, and suggested to the jury that the State regarded the crime committed to have been of sufficient violence to justify the use of substantial and cumbersome restraints. Reversal is thus required.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In light of our determination that defendant\u2019s conviction must be vacated and the matter retried, we do not address defendant\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal. We trust, however, that any of defendant\u2019s relatives attending a retrial will be instructed as to conduct that is appropriate in the circumstances, so that the jury\u2019s concerns regarding their personal safety, brought to the attention of the court in the initial trial and appropriately addressed at the time, will not be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-10\"> The charge was not requested, and thus its absence must be judged by a plain error standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\"> <em>See, e.g., State v.
