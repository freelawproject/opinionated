Summary judgment had been entered on April 16, 2004, dismissing the complaint for failure to satisfy the \u201climitation on lawsuit\u201d threshold (frequently called the \u201cverbal threshold\u201d) under the Automobile Insurance Cost Reduction Act of 1998 (\u201cAICRA\u201d), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>36:6A-1.1 to -35. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8(a). No appeal or timely motion for reconsideration was filed after summary judgment was entered. <em>See R. </em>2:4-1(a); <em>R. </em>4:49-2. However, on October 5, 2005, over seventeen months after summary judgment was granted,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plaintiff filed the \u201cmotion for relief\u2019 following the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 506, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005), which eliminated the requirement that a plaintiff must demonstrate a serious life impact to satisfy the verbal threshold. We accelerated the argument in this case to settle the question of whether <em>DiProspero </em>should be applied retroactively beyond the \u201cpipeline\u201d of cases that were pending when it was decided. <em>See Beltran v. DeLima, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 173, 877 A.2d 307 (App.Div.2005) (applying \u201cpipeline retroactivity\u201d to DiProspero). See also, e.g., <em>Juarez v. J.A. Salerno &amp; Sons, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>332, 886 A.2d 178 (2005) (applying <em>DiProspero </em>and <em>Serrano v. Serrano, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>508, 874 A.2d 1058 (2005), to an appeal pending when those opinions were filed); orders on petitions for certification, 185 <em>N.J. </em>at 23-29 (2005); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>Pungitore v. Brown, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>165, 877 A.2d 305 (App.Div. 2005). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Plaintiff argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">The Supreme Court has unambiguously ruled that the serious life impact standard no longer applies and that a plaintiff need only prove an enumerated injury was suffered and this ruling should apply retroactively to all claims subject to the verbal threshold of the Automobile Insurance Cost Reduction Act that were dismissed for failure to meet this standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">In essence, plaintiff asks us to extend <em>Beltran </em>and give retroactivity \u201cto all cases filed under [AICRA] that were dismissed for failure to meet the serious life impact standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">In <em>James v. Torres, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>586, 596, 808 A.2d 873 (App.Div.2002), <em>certif. denied, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>547, 816 A.2d 1049 (2003), we held that the serious life impact requirement developed in <em>Oswin v. Shaw, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>290, 317-19, 609 A.2d 415 (1992), survived the passage of AICRA and was implicitly incorporated within it for purposes of evaluating a summary judgment motion in a verbal threshold case. The Supreme Court\u2019s denial of certification in <em>James, </em>although \u201cnot a disposition on the merits[,]\u201d \u201csuggested to some the Supreme Court\u2019s concurrence in the view we expressed in that case. . . .\u201d <em>Beltran, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 172, 877 A.2d 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">On June 14, 2005, the Supreme Court \u201cresolved [the] longstanding controversy over the proper interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a.\u201d <em>Beltran, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 171, 877 A.2d 307. In <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 506, 874 A.2d 1039, the Supreme Court overruled <em>Jamas </em>and held that \u201c[n]othing in AICRA\u2019s preamble, its legislative history, or its policy objectives suggests that the Legislature intended this Court to write in [a serious life impact] standard.\u201d <em>See also Serrano v. Serrano, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 509-10, 514-16, 874 A.2d 1058 (companion case). Thus, the Supreme Court held that to survive summary judgment under the verbal threshold in an action for non-economic damages, a plaintiff only had to prove that he or she suffered from one of the six bodily injuries set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8(a). <em>Ibid. DiProspero, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 506, 874 A.2d 1039; <em>Serrano, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 510, 874 A.2d 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Thereafter, in <em>Beltran, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 176-77, 877 A.2d 307, we concluded that <em>DiProspero </em>and <em>Serrano </em>were \u201capplicable to all prejudgment matters pending in the trial courts and to those matters that [were] on direct appeal\u201d at the time they were decided. We expressly declined to consider \u201cwhether to give the new rule complete retroactive effect, applying it to all cases, even if final judgments have been entered and avenues of direct appeal have been exhausted[,]\u201d since this issue had not been presented. <em>Id. </em>at 174 n. 1, 877 A.2d 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">In reaching our decision to give <em>DiProspero </em>\u201cpipeline retroactivity,\u201d we noted that the Supreme Court had \u201cestablished a new rule of law as to which retroactivity analysis is appropriate. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173, 877 A.2d 307 (citations omitted). We addressed the policy considerations relevant to the retroactivity of \u201ca new rule of law,\u201d and found it \u201cdifficult to fault those who relied upon <em>James </em>as setting forth the proper interpretation of the limitation on lawsuit provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, particularly after certification was denied to that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174, 877 A.2d 307. Moreover, we concluded that \u201c[i]t would be unfair not to accord the Supreme Court\u2019s newly-announced rule\u201d limited retroactivity to cases other than <em>DiProspero </em>and <em>Serrano </em>that had launched similar \u201cchallenges to the utilization of the <em>Oswin </em>model and the interpretation of <em>Oswin\u2019s </em>precepts [which] remain pending, simply because they did not constitute the vehicle for the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 877 A.2d 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">On the other hand, we acknowledged \u201cthe tsunami effect that retroactive application of <em>DiProspero </em>and <em>Serrano </em>may have on the administration of justice,\u201d including the possibility of \u201coverwhelming] the calendars of the trial courts\u201d and creating \u201ca substantial backlog in matters to be tried. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176, 877 A.2d 307. We also recognized that this was an issue for the Legislature \u201cto consider when pondering whether its manner of resolving the automobile insurance cost crisis achieved its desired goal.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>In <em>Camacho v. Camacho, </em>381 <em>N.J.Super. </em>395, 401, 886 A.2d 212 (Law Div.2005), the Law Division subsequently declined to extend our holding in <em>Beltran </em>to a case similarly involving an untimely application for reconsideration. Judge Steven Perskie took the same approach in the present case, which was dismissed on summary judgment fourteen months prior to the decision in <em>DiProspero. </em>We agree with the Law Division in both matters, and therefore affirm the order under review. Were we to allow this case to be reopened, all cases since 1998 that were dismissed for failure to satisfy the serious life impact prong under the verbal threshold would have to be reopened irrespective of whether the plaintiffs had endeavored to appeal or seek certification following the grant of summary judgment against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">There are four basic options for deciding a case involving an issue of retroactivity. <em>State v. Burstein, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>394, 402-03, 427 A.2d 525 (1981). These options are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">(1) make the new rule of law purely prospective, applying it only to cases whose operative facts arise after the new rule is announced; (2) apply the new rule to future cases and to the parties in the case announcing the new rule, while applying the old rule to all other pending and past litigation; (3) grant the new rule limited retroactivity, applying it to cases in (1) and (2) as well as to pending cases where the parties have not yet exhausted all avenues of direct review; and, finally, (4) give the new rule complete retroactive effect, applying it to all cases, even those where final judgments have been entered and all avenues of direct review exhausted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\"><em>[Ibid. </em>(citing <em>State v. Nash, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>464, 468-70, 317 A.2d 689 (1974)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-9\"><em>See also, e.g., State v. Knight, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>233, 249-53, 678 A.2d 642 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">In deciding whether to apply a new rule of law retroactively or prospectively, the factors to be considered include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-11\">(1) the <em>purpose o\u00ed </em>the new rule and whether it would be furthered by retroactive application; (2) the <em>reliance </em>placed on the old rule by those charged with administering it; and (3) the effect that retroactive application would have on the <em>administration of justice.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-12\"><em>[Burstein, supra, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>at 406, 427 A.2d 525 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-13\"><em>See also, e.g., Henderson v. Camden County Mun. Util. Auth., </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>554, 561-63, 826 A.2d 615 (2003); <em>Frazier v. New Jersey </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>590, 606-07, 667 A.2d 670 (1995); <em>Montells v. Haynes, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>282, 295-98, 627 A.2d 654 (1993); <em>Williams v. Bell Tel. Labs. Inc., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>109, 122-23, 623 A.2d 234 (1993); <em>Beltran, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 174, 877 A.2d 307 (citing <em>Coons v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>419, 426, 476 A.2d 763 (1984) , <em>cert. denied, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>1123, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>808, 83 L.Ed.2d 800 (1985) ).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">In the case before us, the \u201cnew rule of law\u201d deals with an initial interpretation by the Supreme Court of a statute that has been on the books since 1998.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, and quite significant for present purposes, the motion for relief was filed long after the time in which to move for reconsideration or file an appeal had passed, and plaintiff asks us to extend <em>Beltran\u2019s </em>\u201cpipeline retroactivity\u201d to this case despite the longstanding final judgment. However, this is not a criminal case involving constitutional issues or implicating the trustworthiness of the fact-finding process. <em>See, e.g., Hankerson v. North Carolina, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>233, 240-44, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2339, 2344-45, 53 L.Ed.2d 306, 314-16 (1977); <em>Ivan v. City of New York, </em>407 <em>U.S. </em>203, 204-05, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1951, 1952, 32 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>659, 661-62 (1972). <em>Compare, e.g., Knight, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 253-58, 678 A.2d 642 (declining to apply new rule of law to post-conviction applications after direct appeals had been exhausted because new rule of law \u201cdid not substantially impair the reliability of the truth-finding process\u201d). Hence, there is no basis for granting full retroactivity beyond the \u201cpipeline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Instead, we deal with principles of finality under <em>R. </em>4:50-1, and the possibility of prejudice caused by the fact that files have been closed and witnesses lost.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>R. </em>4:50-1 permits a court to relieve a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>party from a final judgment after the time for filing a motion for reconsideration or an appeal has expired for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL\">(a) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (b) newly discovered evidence which would probably alter the judgment or order and which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under <em>R. </em>4:49; ... (e) the judgment or order has been satisfied, released or discharged, or <em>a prior judgment or order upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, </em>or it is no longer equitable that the judgment or order should have prospective application; or (f) <em>any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment or order.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">[R. 4:50-1 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">A motion for relief on any of these grounds \u201cshall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (a), (b) and (c) of <em>R. </em>4:50-1 not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:50-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u201cRule 4:50-1 provides for extraordinary relief and may be invoked only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Baumann v. Marinaro, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>380, 393, 471 A.2d 395 (1984). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">a \u201cchange in the law or in the judicial view of an established rule of law is not such an extraordinary circumstance\u201d as to justify relief from a final judgment where the time to appeal has expired. This is unquestionably the general rule and rests principally upon the important policy that litigation must have an end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\"><em>[Hartford Ins. Co. v.

But in the final analysis, we simply find it inappropriate to circumvent the jurisprudence so clearly developed under <em>R. </em>4:50.
