The challenged regulation creates a 300-foot buffer on each side of water bodies designated as \u201cCategory 1\u201d waters and their associated perennial or intermittent streams. <em>N.J.A.C. 7:</em>8-5.5(h). Appellant, New Jersey Builders Association, contends that this provision falls outside the scope of the DEP\u2019s statutorily delegated authority and is <em>ultra vires </em>on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>To better understand the argument, we provide the larger statutory and regulatory context against which the challenged provision must be considered. In 1981, the Legislature amended the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL) by adding Article 13, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-93 to -99, the Stormwater Management Act (SMA or the Act). <em>L. </em>1981, c. 32. The Act delegates to the DEP \u201cthe authority to regulate storm water management.\u201d <em>N.J. State League of Municipalities v. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>224, 240, 708 A.2d 708 (App.Div.1998), <em>aff'd, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>211, 729 A.2d 21 (1999). Stormwater is \u201cwater resulting from precipitation (including rain and snow) that runs off the land\u2019s surface. . . .\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:8 \u2014 1.2. \u201cStormwater runoff\u2019 is \u201cwater flow on the surface of the ground or in storm sewers, resulting from precipitation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It is well documented that stormwater runoff picks up pollutants from the land surface and creates problems for the quality and quantity of water in New Jersey. Thus, one of the primary objectives of the SMA is \u201cto prevent, to the greatest extent feasible, an increase in nonpoint pollution.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>49:55D-95. This goal is accomplished through \u201cstormwater management measure[s]\u201d, defined as \u201cany structural or nonstructural\u201d methods intended, among other things, \u201cto control or reduce stormwater runoff and associated pollutants. <em>. . .\u201d N.J.A.C. </em>7-.8-1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Under the Act, every municipality in the State must prepare a stormwater management plan and an implementing stormwater control ordinance, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-93, in accordance with \u201ccomprehensive storm water management regulations by the Commissioner of the [DEP]. . . .\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The required components of the plan and ordinance are set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-95 and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIm\">shall conform to all relevant Federal and State statutes, rules and regulations concerning storm water management or flood control and shall be designed: a. to reduce flood damage, including damage to life and property; b. to minimize storm water runoff from any new land development where such runoff will increase flood damage; c. to reduce soil erosion from any development or construction project; d. to assure the adequacy of existing and proposed culverts and bridges; e. to induce water recharge into the ground where practical; f. to prevent, to the greatest extent feasible, an increase in nonpoint pollution; g. to maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological functions, as well as for drainage; and h. to minimize public safety hazards at any storm water detention facilities constructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>as part of a subdivision or pursuant to a site plan. A storm water management plan shall also include such structural changes and such additional nonstruetural measures and practices as may be necessary to manage storm water. For purposes of this act \u201cnonpoint pollution\u201d means pollution from any source other than from any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, and shall include, but not be limited to, pollutants from agricultural, silvicultural, mining, construction, subsurface disposal and urban runoff sources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-95.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The DEP adopted its first set of regulations implementing the Act, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8, in 1983. 15 <em>N.J.R. </em>142-45 (Feb. 7, 1983). These regulations \u201cestablish[ed] minimum requirements and controls to compensate for the differences in the hydrologic response of the watershed from the undeveloped to the developed condition.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-1.1 (1983). They were readopted over the years without change until 2004, when, in its first major update in twenty years, reflecting a decade of study, the DEP promulgated new stormwater management regulations after holding three public hearings and receiving comments from more than 1200 respondents. 36 <em>N.J.R. </em>670, 670-76 (Feb. 2, 2004); 36 <em>N.J.R. </em>781, 781-82 (Feb. 2, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The newly adopted regulations establish requirements for stormwater planning at the municipal, county and regional levels. The stated goals mirror practically word-for-word those expressed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-98 and range from flood, erosion and pollution control to maintaining the integrity of waterways for their biological functions. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-2.2(a). One such objective is to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">Minimize pollutants in stormwater runoff from new and existing development in order to restore, enhance and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the waters of the State, to protect to protect public health, to safeguard fish and aquatic life and scenic and ecological values, and to enhance the domestic, municipal, recreational, industrial and other uses of water ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-2.2(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">Save for a few exceptions listed in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-1.6(b), the stormwater regulations apply to \u201call major development,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-1.6(a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">\u201cDevelopment\u201d means the division of a parcel of land into two or more parcels, the construction, reconstruction, conversion, structural alteration, relocation or enlargement of any building or structure, any mining excavation or landfill, and any use or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>change in the use of any building or other structure, or land or extension of use of land, for which permission is required under the Municipal Land Use Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-1 et seq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-12.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">And \u201c[m]ajor development\u201d means any new or expanded development that proposes \u201cdisturbing one or more acres of land or increasing impervious surface by one-quarter acre or more.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cDisturbance\u201d is defined as \u201cthe placement of impervious surface or exposure and/or movement of soil or bedrock or clearing, cutting, or removing of vegetation.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The regulations</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">establish! ] general requirements for stormwater management plans and stormwater control ordinances, as well as content requirements and procedures for the adoption and implementation of regional [and municipal] stormwater management plans ... under the [MLUL]; the Water Quality Planning Act [WQPA], <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:11A-1 [to -16]; the Water Pollution Control Act [WPGA], <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58-.10A-1 [to -35]; and the Flood Hazard Area Control Act [FHACA], <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:16A-50 [to -101].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\"><em>[N.J.AC. </em>7:8-1.1(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">More specifically, for present purposes, the regulations</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">establish! ] design and performance standards for [those] stormwater management measures required by [other legislative schemes, such as] the [FHACA] ...; the Coastal Area Facility Review Act [CAFRA], <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-1 [to -33]; the Wetlands Act of 1970, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9A-1 [to -10]; the Waterfront Development Law [WDA], <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12:5-3 [to -11]; the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act [FWPA], <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-1 [to -30]; and the Dam Safety Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:4-1 [to - 14].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>7:8 \u2014 1.1(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">These standards affect: (1) flood control, that is, \u201cerosion control, ... groundwater recharge, and ... stormwater runoff quantity\u201d, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8 \u2014 5.4(a); and (2) pollution control, that is, \u201c[s]tormwater runoff quality.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5.5.

Guidance for these strategies can be found in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual 2002 (BMP manual).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-5.5 contains the minimum design and performance standards regulating stormwater runoff quality, that is, nonpointsource pollution control. This provision requires that sites must be designed with \u201c[sjtormwater management measures\u201d that: (1) reduce the overall nutrient load in the stormwater runoff from the developed site \u201cto the maximum extent feasible,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-5.5(e); and (2) \u201creduce the post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater runoff ... by [at least] 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,\u201d and in some instances, by 95% or more. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-5.5(a), (g) and (h)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-5.5 also expressly recognizes two sensitive water-bodies and requires increased safeguards in those areas. First, extra stormwater-runoff protections are required for all \u201cwaters classified as \u2018FWT \u201d under the State\u2019s surface-water quality standards, as defined in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:9B-1.4. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-5.5(g).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">\u201cFWl\u201d means those fresh waters, as designated in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:9B-1.15(h) Table 6, that are to be maintained in their natural state of quality (set aside for posterity) and not subjected to any man-made wastewater discharges or increases in runoff from anthropogenic activities. These waters are set aside for posterity because of their clarity, color, scenic setting, other characteristic of aesthetic value, unique ecological significance, exceptional recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance, or exceptional fisheries resource(s).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>7:9B-1.4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>According to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-5.5(g), construction projects designed in FW1 areas \u201cshall be designed to <em>prevent any increase in storm-water runoff. </em>. . .\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">At issue here, however, is the extra stormwater-runoff protection required for the other category of waterbody classified by the DEP as \u201cCategory One\u201d (C1) in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:9B and for those \u201cperennial or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category One waters. . . .\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-5.5(h).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\u201cCategory one waters\u201d means those waters designated in the tables in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:9B-1.15(c) through (h), for purposes of implementing the antidegradation policies set forth at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:9B-1.5(d), <em>for protection from, measurable changes </em>in water quality characteristics because of their clarity, color, scenic setting, other characteristics of aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance, or exceptional fisheries resource(s).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">[N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The exceptional characteristics of Cl waters thus require special protection. Unlike \u201cFW1\u201d waters, which are deserving of the greatest protection, discharges are allowed in Cl waters but they cannot result in \u201cany measurable changes (including calculable or predicted changes) to the existing water quality.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:9B-1.5(d)(6)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The specific regulatory measure at issue here is contained in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-5.5(h), which establishes \u201c[s]pecial water resource <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>protection areas\u201d along these C1 waters and their associated \u201cperennial or intermittent streams.\u201d Projects designed near C1 waters and their tributaries must have \u201c[a] <em>300-foot special water resource protection area \u201d </em>on each side of the waterway <em>\u201cconsisting of existing vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural succession. </em>. . .\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8 \u2014 5.5(h)(1)(i) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These 300-foot buffers or \u201cvegetation zones\u201d are \u201cestablished for the protection of water quality, aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance, and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category One waters.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8 \u2014 5.5(h). As the DEP has declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">The goal of the special water resource protection area is to maintain and/or create an unbroken, undisturbed vegetated buffer to meet these purposes and to prevent water quality degradation, along all Category One waters and all waters flowing into them within the same HUC 14 watershed area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">[36 <em>N.J.R. </em>at 748.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">During the approval process, substantial data and scientific evidence was adduced in support of the DEP\u2019s determination that the creation of 300-foot buffers was the appropriate level of protection for Cl water bodies. The detrimental effects of storm-water runoff from land development were well documented in the record as was the need to use buffers to protect sensitive waterways. Based on the available literature and studies, the DEP concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>that the 300-foot special water resource protection area is the best and most reliable means to prevent the degradation of surface water quality from nonpoint source pollution and protect the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the State\u2019s surface waters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">[36 <em>N.J.R. </em>at 742.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">It is important to first identify what is not in issue in this case. Appellant does not contest the basic proposition that the DEP has the statutory authority to regulate municipal and regional storm-water management planning, establish safety standards for storm-water detention basins, promote groundwater recharge, and prevent flooding and protect water quality by requiring that any development will control the quantity and quality of stormwater. Nor does appellant question the DEP\u2019s authority to classify the State\u2019s waterways according to their level of ecological and environmental sensitivity; or to establish standards that vary according to the nature and classification of the waterways into which stormwater flows and passes; or to impose the more stringent standards in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-5.5(g) for waters classified as FW1; or, most significantly for present purposes, to impose other stringent controls on stormwater flowing into \u201cCl\u201d waterways and their tributaries in order to protect the quality of those waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Rather, appellant\u2019s claim is based on the contention that there is no statutory enabling authority for these 300-foot buffers which, appellant argues, function as \u201cno build\u201d provisions directly regulating the use of land without regard to stormwater control or management and promulgated by the DEP without state-wide land-use regulatory jurisdiction. Although residual power over land use has been delegated to the municipalities under the MLUL, appellant\u2019s argument overlooks the close correlation between riparian land use and water quality, over which the DEP does exercise plenary power. Thus, the authority to support the DEP\u2019s use of buffers to prevent nonpoint source pollution, 36 <em>N.J.R. </em>750, is to be found first in the enabling statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1D-1 to -19, which creates the DEP and accords it broad powers of conservation and ecological control, and second in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>mix of legislative schemes that seek to promote water quality and prevent water pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">It is well-settled that the statutory grant of power by the Legislature to an agency can either be express or implied. <em>N.J.

In determining whether the requisite authority is implied, if not expressed, a court will \u201cconsider not only the particular statute in question, but also the entire legislative scheme of which it is a part.\u201d <em>Kimmelman v. Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>123, 129, 527 A.2d 1368 (1987). \u201c \u2018[E]very effort should be made to harmonize the law relating to the same subject matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 7:26B, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>442, 469, 608 A.2d 288 (1992) (quoting <em>Superior Air Prods. Co. v. NL Indus., Inc., </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>46, 63-64, 522 A.2d 1025 (App.Div. 1987)). In other words, in deciding whether a particular regulation is statutorily authorized, a \u201ccourt may look beyond the specific terms of the enabling act to the statutory policy sought to be achieved by examining the entire statute in light of its surroundings and objectives.\u201d <em>N.J. Guild, supra, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 562, 384 A.2d 795. <em>Accord E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v.

In this manner, \u201ccourts should readily imply such incidental powers as are necessary to effectuate fully the legislative intent.\u201d <em>N.J. Guild, supra, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 562, 384 A.2d 795. That is because \u201cthe grant of authority to an administrative agency is to be liberally construed in order to enable the agency to accomplish its statutory responsibilities.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In fact,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS2\">the absence of an express statutory authorization in the enabling legislation will not preclude administrative agency action where, by reasonable implication, that action can be said to promote or advance the policies and findings that served as the driving force for the enactment of the legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\"><em>In re N.J.

The Legislature, in a variety of measures, has given the DEP a wide array of power to address water quality and pollution concerns beyond traditional floodwater control, and to promulgate rules to protect the waters of this State. We read these statutory schemes, of course, in pari materia. <em>Saint Peter\u2019s Univ. Hosp. v.

And, as previously noted, the Stormwater Management Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40.-55D-93 to -99, which is part of the MLUL, vests the DEP with the authority to promulgate comprehensive stormwater management regulations without regard to geographic limits, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-93, and \u201cto develop a water runoff plan for the entire State.\u201d <em>Statement of the Senate Natural Resources &amp; Agricultural Committee </em>on <em>L. </em>1981, c. 21. Indeed, the MLUL recognizes the high correlation between land use and stormwater when it directs stormwater management plans \u201cto minimize storm water runoff from any new land development where such runoff will increase flood damage [and] to reduce soil erosion from any development or construction project.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>The broad scope of water quality and pollution concerns voiced by the Legislature in these various enactments and the totality of powers vested in the DEP to enable it to address these concerns persuade us that the agency has ample authority to create protective buffers around \u201cCl\u201d waters and their tributaries. The fact that other statutory enactments, such as the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act (FWPA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-1 to -30; the Coastal Area Facility Review Act (CAFRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:19-1 to -21; the Flood Area Control Act, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:13-1.1 to -1.7; the Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal Park Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:13A-1 to -15; the Pine-lands Protection Act, <em>N.J.SA </em>13:18A-1 to -29; and the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:20-1 to -35, have expressly granted DEP authority to plan land development, or clearly delineate precise areas within which DEP may regulate, or specifically mandate discrete buffers, <em>see, e.g., Am. Cyanamid Co. v. State Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>292, 555 A.2d 684 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>89, 563 A.2d 847 (1989); <em>Deskovick v.

In <em>N.J. Builders Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>76, 404 A.2d 320 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>402, 408 A.2d 796 (1979), the appellant argued that DEP lacked express statutory authority to establish water quality standards in the Pinelands and to designate certain lands within the Pinelands as a \u201ccritical area\u201d for sewerage purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 81-82, 404 A.2d 320. We disagreed. <em>Id. </em>at 90, 404 A.2d 320. We analyzed the Water Pollution Control Act, the Water Quality Planning Act and the Safe Water Drinking Act, finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">[a]ll of the acts seek to prevent the degradation of water quality and to preserve the environment. All of the acts give the DEP Commissioner the power to protect ground water and surface water. All of the acts seek to lessen the impact of pollution from point sources and nonpoint sources. Undoubtedly, given the breadth of the legislation, its goal to promote public health and welfare through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>preservation of water quality and the environment, any question about the jurisdiction of the DEP Commissioner presumptively should be resolved in his favor. <em>[Id. </em>at 85-86, 404 A.2d 320.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">And, the DEP\u2019s power to adopt protective buffers was recently confirmed in the Highlands Water Protection &amp; Planning Act, wherein the Legislature adopted 300-foot buffers around all open waters in the Highlands area and stated that those buffers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">shall not be construed to limit any authority of the department to establish <em>buffers of any size or any other protections for category one waters designated by the department pursuant to the \u201cWater Pollution Control Ad, </em>\u201d ... <em>or any other law, </em>or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, for major Highlands development or for other development that does not qualify as major Highlands development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>13:20-32(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">We, therefore, conclude that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-5.5(h) is not <em>ultra vires.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">A secondary contention, not advanced at oral argument, is that the regulation is unreasonable and, therefore, invalid. However, \u201cregulations which fall within the scope of the statutorily delegated authority and are not <em>ultra vires </em>on their face,\u201d are presumed to be valid. <em>Soc\u2019y for Envt\u2019l Econ. Dev., supra, 208 N.J.Super. </em>at 4, 504 A.2d 1180; <em>see also N.J. State League of Municipalities, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 222, 729 A.2d 21; <em>In re Adoption of Amendments to N.J.A.C. 5:93-1.3 and 5:93-5.3, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>371, 383, 772 A.2d 9 (App.Div.2001). The party challenging such action has the burden of overcoming that strong presumption. <em>Med. Soc\u2019y of N.J. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>18, 25, 575 A.2d 1348 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Moreover, \u201ccourts ordinarily recognize that an agency\u2019s specialized expertise renders it particularly well-equipped to understand the issues and enact the appropriate regulations pertaining to the technical matters within its area.\u201d <em>In re Protest of Coastal Permit Program Rules, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>293, 330, 807 A.2d 198 (App.Div.2002); <em>see also N.J. State League of Municipalities, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 222, 729 A.2d 21. \u201c \u2018If there is any fair argument in support ... [of the agency\u2019s action, it] will not be disturbed unless patently corrupt, arbitrary or illegal.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>Guild, supra, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 384 A.2d 795 (quoting <em>Flanagan v. Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv., </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>1, 12, 148 A.2d 14 (1959)).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">So tested, we conclude that the challenged provision meets the criteria of validity. As already noted, our review of the record satisfies us that there was an adequate factual basis to support creation of the 300-foot buffers, and appellant contests neither the technical and scientific justification for such protective measures nor the need for some regulation in the area. Indeed, a clear nexus exists between <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:8-5.5(h) and a legitimate environmental objective. And in determining whether the means used to attain the statutory goals are reasonable, we, of course, defer to the judgment of the DEP that buffers provide \u201cthe best available and most reliable methods [both] to prevent degradation [of] Category One waters from ... nonpoint source pollution\u201d, 36 <em>N.J.R. </em>at 745, and \u201cto prevent new point source discharges of stormwater to the waterway in order to preserve the existing aesthetic and ecological values of the area.\u201d 35 <em>N.J.R. </em>119, 136-38 (Jan. 6, 2003). <em>See </em>36 <em>N.J.R. </em>at 807-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">We reject as well appellant\u2019s related contention that because DEP\u2019s buffer requirement applies regardless of whether stormwater runoff will ever flow into Cl waterways, it is therefore unrelated to stormwater management. No one disputes that development in close proximity to Cl waters can have a deleterious effect on these waters whether or not stormwater is discharged directly to the stream. On this score, the full intent of the buffer is to preserve the attributes and uses for which these waters were designated as Cl. As such, the DEP may impose a buffer to avoid development-related impacts on water quality unrelated to stormwater, 36 <em>N.J.R. </em>750, or for reasons altogether unrelated to protecting water quality, such as, for instance, recreation and aesthetics. In any event, aesthetics is a component of water quality. \u201cAesthetic satisfaction\u201d is one of the elements of the public interest in the \u201crestoration, maintenance and preservation of the quality of the waters of the State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:11A-2.
