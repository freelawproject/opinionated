He was acquitted of kidnapping, armed robbery, aggravated assault, terroristic threats, and second-degree possession of a handgun for an unlawful purpose. The trial court sentenced defendant to -an aggregate term of four years,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>subject to an eighty-five percent parole ineligibility period under the No Early Release Act (NERA). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court also imposed the mandatory fines and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Defendant now appeals raising the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">POINT ONE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY PERMITTED THE STATE TO INTRODUCE A STATEMENT BY THE DEFENDANT ELKWISNI REGARDING THE LOCATION OF THE GUN USED IN THE ROBBERY SINCE THE STATEMENT WAS MADE WHILE HE WAS IN CUSTODY AND WITHOUT A VOLUNTARY, KNOWING AND INTELLIGENT WAIVER OF HIS FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO REMAIN SILENT AND TO HAVE COUNSEL PRESENT AFTER ADEQUATE ADVICE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">POINT TWO</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S REPEATED CROSS-EXAMINATION AND COMMENTS IN SUMMATION ON DEFENDANT\u2019S SILENCE AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST INFRINGED ON THE DEFENDANT\u2019S PRIVILEGE AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION UNDER THE FIFTH AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND NEW JERSEY STATE LAW.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">POINT THREE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED BY DENYING DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR A JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE TO ORDER A NEW TRIAL AS THE VERDICT WAS AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">We agree with defendant\u2019s argument as to Point One. We are satisfied that the record developed before the trial court at a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing was insufficient, as a matter of law, to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant voluntarily and knowingly waived his constitutional rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). <em>See also State v. Adams, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>438, 447, 605 A.2d 1097 (1992). We are equally satisfied, however, that the appropriate remedy to correct this error is not reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction, but to remand this discrete issue to the trial court to conduct a new hearing on voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>We discern no legal basis to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction based on the arguments raised in Points II and III. The argument raised in Point III lacks sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e) (2). In the interest of clarity, we will nevertheless examine the argument raised in Point II, in order to delineate the proper boundaries of cross-examination by the State when a defendant testifies regarding statements he made to the police after his arrest. Here, defendant offered these statements in support of his affirmative defense of duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">As the facts here illustrate, the line of demarcation between legitimate impeachment of a defendant\u2019s credibility through the use of prior inconsistent statements, and improper inquiry or comment on defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent, is not always clear. This question was only obliquely noted by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>551, 566 n. 3, 868 A.2d 302 (2005), and was not directly raised in <em>State v. Black, </em>380 <em>N.J.Super. </em>581, 883 A.2d 1065 (App.Div.2005), our most recent <em>post-Muhammad </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">This case gives us the opportunity to address the issue directly, and, in the process, provide guidance to the trial courts on how to: (1) safeguard a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent, by setting strict limits on the scope of the State\u2019s cross-examination; and (2) craft jury instructions that will enable jurors to distinguish between legitimate evidence that may affect a defendant\u2019s credibility, and an unconstitutional inference of culpability based on a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">We will consider all of defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal in the context of the following facts, which we summarize here based on the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\n<em>I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">On March 24, 2003, at approximately 8:30 p.m., Ibrahim Samha and defendant entered a convenience store in Fairfield owned and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>operated by Jamal Darwish. The two men approached Darwish while he was sitting behind the cash register and Samha pointed a handgun at Darwish\u2019s head and demanded money. Samha was wearing blue transparent gloves. Samha then pulled the storekeeper from behind the counter, and struck him in the face and head several times with the handgun. According to Darwish, while he was on the floor, defendant kicked him repeatedly in the stomach. Both men then dragged the victim to an aisle, in an apparent attempt to shield him from the view of any passerby. Samha kneeled on Darwish\u2019s neck, maintaining the gun pointed at his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">According to Darwish, defendant obtained the keys to the store and, after some initial difficulty, was able to lock the entrance doors. Darwish was then tied up with duct tape, while Samha continued to kneel on him, demanding money and making repeated threats to kill him. Darwish finally capitulated to the assailants\u2019 demands, and gave defendant directions on how to open the register. Dissatisfied with the amount of money in the register, defendant allegedly told Samha to \u201cfinish [Darwish] off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">While the robbery was in progress, a customer, subsequently identified as Alan Pollock, tried to enter the store, only to discover the door was locked. Pollock testified that he saw defendant walk to the cash register and attempt to open it. Pollock also observed defendant wave his arms at him, as if to indicate that the store was closed. Although Pollock initially left, he quickly returned and observed Samha standing behind the counter ripping phone cards off the wall. The police arrived shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Upon their arrival, the police observed Darwish inside the store, lying on the floor, with his hands tied with duct tape. He was also bleeding from the head. Darwish testified that as the police attempted to break down the locked door, defendant told Samha to cut the duct tape from Darwish\u2019s hands. It was also around this time that defendant took possession of the gun, and hid it. According to defendant, he did this to avoid the potential for a violent confrontation with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Prior to the police forcibly entering the store, Darwish testified that one of the defendants gave him the store key. All three men then walked, single file, toward the front of the store, with Darwish in the front, Samha behind him, and defendant in the rear. Darwish opened the door, and the police immediately rushed in and ordered the two defendants to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\n<em>The Miranda Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">During the trial, at the completion of the victim\u2019s testimony, the trial court excused the jury, and conducted a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing to determine the admissibility of an oral statement allegedly made by defendant after he was in police custody.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Richard Uram was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the first Garfield police officer to interact with defendant. Uram handcuffed defendant while he was on the ground, and placed him in the back of a police car. According to Uram, he read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights. At the time of defendant\u2019s arrest, Uram\u2019s main concern was the recovery of the handgun used in the robbery. Uram gave the following account of what transpired after he placed the handcuffed-defendant in his police car:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">I began talking to [Elkwisni]. Well, first, after I arrested him, <em>I </em>\u2014 I <em>read him his rights. I remind him again of his rights </em>inside the ear and I asked him \u2014 I said, you know, believe there\u2019s a gun involved, this is a store, kids go in the store, if you hid it in the store, tell us where it is. I mean, God forbid a kid goes in there and grabs this gun and he ends up thinking it\u2019s a toy, he shoots somebody and he kills him. You know, we have to put the public safety\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\"><em>* </em>* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">Q. And you said that <em>you reminded him of his rights </em>in the car. Where was the first place that you advised him of his <em>rights?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">A. Once he was cuffed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">Q. All right. And was that a verbal or written form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">A. Verbal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">Q. And then you said you reminded him of his <em>rights </em>again in the car. What car are you referring to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-13\">A. My police unit at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-14\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-15\">Q. Okay. So the only two people in the car when you were reminding him of <em>his rights </em>in the car was you and the defendant Ahmed Elkwisni?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-16\">A. He was in the car, I was standing alongside the car speaking with him with the door open.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-17\">Q. Okay. You\u2019re standing alongside. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-18\">A. Yes. He was in the back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Q. Now when you\u2019re having this conversation with him, I take it you\u2019re speaking in English?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">Q. And what about him? What is he speaking to you and after you advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights did he say anything to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">A. He was \u2014 he was speaking. When he spoke to me, he speak [sic] English. At first he declined that there \u2014 he didn\u2019t know anything about a gun. As he\u2019s telling me this, he\u2019s looking around. He just appeared very nervous. He just kept looking right to left, right to left, looking \u2014 looking around and he just \u2014 he kept denying it, denying it, denying it. Then eventually he told me \u2014 he goes, \u201cIt\u2019s behind the Huggies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">Q. And nobody else was around other than \u2014 the other defendant was not there at the time, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">A. The other defendant had \u2014 had no contact whatsoever where I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">Q. Now at a later point in time at headquarters, was there a written form given to the defendant with regards to his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Ahmed Elkwisni? Were you involved in that at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\">A. Not by me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-13\">Q. That was another police officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-14\">A. I \u2014 if\u2014if someone else gave it to him, I don\u2019t know. Maybe a detective did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZY\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">Uram gave the following additional facts during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-16\">Q. Okay. And what is this document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-17\">A. Advising somebody of their <em>Miranda </em>rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-18\">Q. Okay. And what time is that document executed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-19\">A. It says 11:30 p.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-20\">Q. Okay. You had arrested him much earlier in the evening, hadn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-21\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-22\">Q. In the incident report that you filled out\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-23\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-24\">Q. \u2014you never indicated that you read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights, did you? A. I don\u2019t believe I put it in the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-25\">Q. Customarily it would be included in there, wouldn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-26\">A. I usually don\u2019t put it in there, only on DWI cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-27\">Q. Well, aren\u2019t you required to by statute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>A. To put it in the report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlQ\">Q. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">A. Not to my knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">Q. You also [in your report] used the words \u201cwith the safety of the public in mind\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">Q. Do you normally qualify the reason that you\u2019re asking a suspect a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aog\">A. Can you repeat that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">Q. Do you normally qualify, indicate the reasoning for asking a suspect a particular question in your reports? You say the reason that you\u2019re asking the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-12\">A. I just put it down. I mean, I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re trying to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-13\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-14\">Q. Okay. So when you normally fill these out, okay, in other cases other than this one, do you normally, customarily, in your regular course of filling these out state in your reports the reason that you\u2019re asking a suspect a particular question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-15\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-16\">A. I just \u2014 if\u2014if, I mean, sometimes you have to do things in order, like probable-cause order, you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-17\">Q. So you were trying to establish some reason or justification for asking him the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-18\">A. What was the \u2014 what was the line again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-19\">Q. Well, the line was, \u201cThis officer, with the safety of the public in mind, asked.\u201d A. Right. Well, because that was my \u2014 I wanted to make sure whoever read it understood that\u2019s why I was asking him that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-20\">% * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-21\">Q. Your testimony now is that you can remember an arrest a lot of arrests ago, maybe seventy-five arrests ago, we\u2019ll say, today even though there\u2019s no record of it of what you did that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-22\">A. When I place somebody in custody, I read them their rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-23\">Q. Is that something that you normally do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-24\">A. That\u2019s how we\u2019re trained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-25\">Q. So you\u2019re testifying from what you normally do. You don\u2019t necessarily know that you did it that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-26\">A. I know I did it that day because I do it every time I make an arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Q. So you only know you did it that day because you customarily do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">A. Because I always do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Uram was the only witness to testify at the <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing. In fact, his testimony was the only evidence presented by the State in support of admitting the statements made by defendant shortly after he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">At the close of the testimony, defense counsel made the following argument in support of his application to exclude defendant\u2019s statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">I think he clearly testified that he doesn\u2019t have any independent record of having read his <em>Miranda </em>rights to this witness that day. His testimony was that he normally does it, but that he doesn\u2019t have any independent recollection as to this particular arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">Clearly, there\u2019s nothing in his statement to support a claim that he did read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The <em>Miranda </em>form itself is not executed until 11:30 p.m. that evening. He indicates in his statement a reason or some justification for having questioned him, which seems a little unusual. I think, Your Honor, the statement should be excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Relying exclusively on Uram\u2019s testimony, the trial court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">[In determining the adequacy of) <em>Miranda </em>warnings, basically the Court is instructed to go to the totality of the circumstances. This particular case the testimony is that [Uram] responded to an armed robbery arrest____and at the time he arrested [defendant], that he had read him his rights and reminded him of those in the car; that he had cuffed him; that initially Mr. Elkwisni said he knew nothing about the gun, but then the officer had said something to him about safety of children. And as a result of that, he said they were behind the Huggies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-14\">Based upon the totality of the circumstances, it appears the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were read to him; that the defendant understood them based upon the officer\u2019s question. There didn\u2019t seem to be any trickery. I guess we\u2019re touching upon the Christian burial a little bit as to the safety of children, but it was voluntarily made. I will allow it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-15\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">\n<em>Waiver of Miranda Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">We start our analysis of this issue by reaffirming certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>basic principles of constitutional law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In determining the adequacy of <em>Miranda </em>warnings given by the police as a prerequisite to finding that defendant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived the rights contained therein, a court\u2019s function is not simply to ascertain whether the police meticulously performed some mechanical exercise. A court must carefully review the <em>substance </em>of what was communicated by the police to a defendant, in order to determine whether the alleged waiver was the product of an informed, intelligent and voluntary decision. As Justice Clifford wrote more than thirty years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">In resolving the adequacy of the language of a <em>Miranda </em>warning a court should give precedence to substance over form. The decision does not require that any specific language be used to inform an accused of his rights----The \u201cwords of <em>Miranda </em>do not constitute a ritualistic formula which must be repeated without variation in order to be effective. Words <em>which convey the substance of the warning along with the required information are sufficient.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\"><em>[State v. Melvin, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>1, 13-14, 319 A.2d 450 (1974) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-10\"><em>See also State v. Dixon, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>223, 242, 593 A.2d 266 (1991); <em>State v.

Smith, </em>374 <em>N.J.Super. 425, 433, 864 A.2d </em>1177 (App.Div.2005). Prior to questioning defendant, Officer Uram was required to warn him (1) of the right to remain silent; (2) that any statement he made could be used against him; (3) he had a right to an attorney; (4) if he could not afford an attorney, one would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>provided; and (5) he had the right to stop answering questions at any time. <em>Duckworth v.

We will only reverse these findings if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>99, 102, 561 A.2d 243 (1989). Under this standard of review, it is \u201cimproper for the Appellate Division to engage in an independent assessment of the evidence as if it were the court of first instance.\u201d <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 471, 724 A.2d 234 (1999). We are \u201cnot permitted to \u201cweigh the evidence, assess the credibility of witnesses, or make conclusions about the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472, 724 A.2d 234 (quoting <em>State v. Barone, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>599, 615, 689 A.2d 132 (1997)). Our review is restricted to assessing \u2018\u201cwhether the findings made [by the trial court] could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Mindful of this standard, we nevertheless conclude, as a matter of law, that the evidence presented to the trial court was insufficient from which to conclude that defendant made a knowing, informed, and voluntary waiver of his rights under <em>Miranda. </em>Here, we are unable to discern from the phrases \u201cI read him his rights,\u201d or \u201cI advised him of his rights,\u201d what information Uram conveyed to the handcuffed defendant when Uram began to question him in the back of the police car. Without more, there is no factual or legal basis to sustain the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[b]ased upon the totality of the circumstances, it appears the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were read to [defendant]\u201d and that \u201cdefendant understood them based upon the officer\u2019s question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>It is self-evident that there can be no knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of the rights under <em>Miranda, </em>when the record does not reflect that a fair and accurate recitation of those rights was in fact given by the police to the defendant. <em>Cf. State v. DiFrisco, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>195, 235-36, 804 A.2d 507 (2002), <em>cert. denied, 537 U.S. </em>1220, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>1323, 154 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1076 (2003). Without competent evidence from which to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant waived his rights under <em>Miranda, State v. Adams, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>438, 447, 605 A.2d 1097 (1992), the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Based on the record developed at the <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104(c) hearing, the police did not use any improper interrogation techniques to extract an inculpatory statement from defendant. In fact, defendant\u2019s attack on the admissibility of the statement is based entirely on a \u201csufficiency of the evidence\u201d standard, not on the methods used by the police to question defendant. Stated differently, the record here lacks an adequate evidential foundation from which to conclude that defendant, who was in custody, was given the required information under <em>Miranda; </em>that he understood the information; and that he voluntarily decided to speak to the police about the location of the gun, without first consulting with an attorney. We consider this situation to be the functional equivalent of the total absence of a hearing, requiring a remand to the trial court to conduct a new hearing on voluntariness. <em>State v. Kelly, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>283, 294-95, 294 A.2d 41 (1972); <em>State v. Marczak, 344 N.J.Super. </em>388, 398, 782 A.2d <em>440 </em>(App.Div. 2001), <em>certif. denied, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>44, 791 A.2d 222 (2002). On remand, if the State fails:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">[T]o establish voluntariness beyond reasonable doubt, the defendant will be entitled to a new trial at which the statements will be excluded. If, however, the State does establish beyond reasonable doubt that the statements were voluntary, and the trial judge so determines, then the defendant\u2019s conviction may stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\"><em>[State v. Kelly, supra, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>at 294, 294 A.2d 41 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">We are thus satisfied that the remedy here is to remand the matter for a new hearing to determine voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\n<em>Public Safety Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The State argues in the alternative that even if the record does not support the conclusion that defendant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, his statements about the whereabouts of the handgun were nevertheless admissible pursuant to the exigency or public safety exception to <em>Miranda. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The public safety exception to the requirement that a person subjected to custodial interrogation by police be given <em>Miranda </em>warnings was first articulated in <em>New York v. Quarles, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>649, 655-56, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2626, 2631, 81 L.Ed.2d 550, 557 (1984). In <em>Quarles, </em>the police were investigating a sexual assault committed with a handgun. The investigating officer spotted the suspect approaching a supermarket checkout counter. The suspect was apprehended inside the store carrying an empty guii holster. Immediately after handcuffing the suspect, and prior to reading him his <em>Miranda </em>rights, one of the officers asked him about the whereabouts of the gun. The suspect \u201cnodded in the direction of some empty cartons and responded, \u2018the gun is over there.\u2019 \u201d <em>Quarles, supra, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>at 652, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2629, 81 L.Ed.2d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">In creating an exigency exception, the majority of the Court in <em>Quarles </em>emphasized that \u201cin the very act of apprehending a suspect, [the police] were confronted with the immediate necessity of ascertaining the whereabouts of a gun which they had every reason to believe the suspect had just removed from his empty holster and discarded in the supermarket.\u201d <em>Quarles, supra, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>at 657, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2632, 81 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 557-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The Court thus reasoned that \u201cconcern for public safety must be paramount to adherence to the literal language of the prophylactic rules enunciated in <em>Miranda.\u201d Quarles, supra, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>at 653, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2630, 81 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">In <em>State v. Stephenson, </em>350 <em>N.J.Super. </em>517, 796 A.2d 274 (App.Div.2002), we declined to invoke the exigency exception, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>emphasized the need to narrowly construe its application. <em>Id. </em>at 524-25, 796 A.2d 274. The facts in <em>Stephenson </em>illustrate this point. The police received information that the defendant had threatened to shoot a person with whom he had allegedly argued earlier. The police proceeded to the defendant\u2019s motel, handcuffed him, and demanded to know the location of the gun. Contrasting the facts in <em>Stephenson </em>to the <em>Quarles </em>ease, we noted that the circumstances of the threat were not immediate, and the gun was not believed to be concealed in a public area, with unrestricted access to it by third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The <em>Stephenson </em>court established that the <em>Quarles </em>exigency exception applies only where the circumstances indicate \u201c(1) there [is] an objectively reasonable need to protect the police or the public; (2) from an immediate danger; (3) associated with a weapon; and that (4) the questions asked were related to that danger and reasonably necessary to secure public safety.\u201d <em>State v. Stephenson, supra, 350 N.J.Super. </em>at 525, 796 A.2d 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Here, defendant and his cohort were apprehended by the police, without any opportunity to conceal the weapon used in the robbery, in any other location but inside the store. The store was surrounded by law enforcement personnel, and the entire area was secured as a crime scene after defendant\u2019s arrest. The record is silent as to what efforts, if any, the police undertook to locate the weapon without defendant\u2019s assistance. One thing is clear, however; there was no immediate threat to public safety triggering the application of the <em>Quarles </em>exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Uram\u2019s questions about the gun began after defendant had been handcuffed and placed in the police car. There is no evidence to support the State\u2019s claim that the police\u2019s interrogation was the product of a spontaneous concern for the safety of the public. According to Uram, he read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights on at least two separate occasions. Once immediately after arresting defendant and escorting him to the police car, and again after Uram learned that the gun used in the robbery had not been located. In this context, the \u201cpublic safety\u201d issue arose as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>interrogation tactic, not as an impromptu attempt to address an obvious and immediate public danger. Applying the <em>Quarles </em>exception to these facts subverts the constitutional protections embodied in <em>Miranda, </em>and opens the door to the pretextual invocation of \u201cpublic safety\u201d whenever the police are not immediately able to recover weapons used in the commission of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\n<em>Posh-Arrest Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">We will now address a question left partially unanswered by the Supreme Court in <em>Muhammad. </em>Namely, what are the limits of prosecutorial inquiry as to defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence, when defendant testifies at trial as to the substance of exculpatory statements he allegedly made at or near the time of his arrest. This issue pits defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent against the State\u2019s right to challenge the credibility of defendant\u2019s affirmative defense of duress. Stated differently, are the concerns raised by the Supreme Court in <em>Muhammad </em>nunimized or rendered irrelevant once a defendant affirmatively testifies about what he told the police at or near the time of his arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">As with most things in life, the answer to this question cannot be stated through a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Once a defendant testifies about statements he made to the police at or near the time of his arrest, the State must be permitted to cross-examine him regarding whether or not these alleged statements were actually made. Cross-examination of the defendant however, must be carefully circumscribed. The prosecutor may not wander into areas not covered by a defendant\u2019s direct testimony, to suggest, even implicitly, that a defendant had an affirmative duty to come forward with exculpatory evidence. The State is not permitted to use omitted details or other indicia of the right to remain silent, to shift the burden of proof to the defendant. <em>See State v. Galiyano, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>393, 397, 429 A.2d 385 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>424, 434 A.2d 1096 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>The trial court must also craft jury instructions that will enable jurors to distinguish between legitimate evidence that may affect a defendant\u2019s credibility, (internal inconsistencies in the testimony and rebuttal evidence), and drawing a constitutionally impermissible inference of culpability from a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Here, defendant asserted the affirmative defense of duress. He testified that he was never part of any plans to carry out the robbery, and only entered the store to purchase a soft drink and get something to eat. During his direct examination, he gave the following description of the events that transpired once inside the store:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">Q. What did you observe when you walked in the store?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">A. When I walked into the store, I saw [the co-defendant]. He was standing at the \u2014 at the register, and he was talking to the cashier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">Q. Okay. And what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">A. I walked down the aisle to the refrigerators to get like an orange drink or something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\">Q. Okay. And what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">A. Well, when I was at the refrigerator, I could hear like yelling in the front. It was like loud yelling, and there was like stuff falling. I could hear like stuff falling. So I turned around to see what was going on but the shelves were pretty high, so I had to walk back to the front of the store to see what was going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\">Q. And what did you observe when you got to the front of the store?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-14\">A. When I got <em>to the </em>front of the store, [the co-defendant], he was fighting with the store guy. There were like \u2014 they were grabbing each other and they were both fighting over a gun, so I was shocked. I was just standing there, and the [col-defendant had blue gloves on and, in a matter of seconds, the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-15\">THE COURT: You mean [the co-defendant] had blue gloves on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-16\">PROSECUTOR: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-17\">A. Sorry about that. The \u2014 [co-defendant], he had blue gloves and, in a matter of seconds, the store guy was on the floor, and now the gun was being pointed at me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARx\">Q. The gun was being pointed at you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-18\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-19\">Q. And what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-20\">A. I couldn\u2019t do anything; he was standing right in front of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-21\">Q. So what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-22\">A. He started yelling at me to like come here. He kept yelling come here. And I was shocked. This guy had blue gloves on; he had the gun; I didn\u2019t know what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>was going on; and the other guy, he was just laying on the floor. So [the co-defendant], he comes up to me, he grabs me by my shirt, and starts pulling me to the back of the store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">Q. What happened after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">A. When I got to the back of the store, like he was standing behind me, he kept like pushing me to the back of the store, but the store guy, he was like laying on the floor, and like X couldn\u2019t walk over him, so he kept like pushing me up against the aisles and stuff were falling off the aisles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">Q. And Mr. Darwish was on the ground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">Q. Okay. What happened once he got you to the back of the store?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">A. When I was in the back of the store, he told me not to move. He told me just stay there, and he started yelling at the store owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">Q. What was he yelling to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-12\">A. He was yelling to him I want my money, and then he kept yelling to him give him the keys to the store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-13\">Q. Okay. And did Mr. Darwish give him the keys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-14\">A. Yeah. He took it out of his pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-15\">Q. And what happened then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-16\">A. Then [the co-defendant] like \u2014 he came up to me again, he started grabbing me, and he walked me towards the front door and told me to lock the door. I dropped the keys. I didn\u2019t want to \u2014 I was scared, I didn\u2019t want to lock the door. I didn\u2019t lock myself in there, too, so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-17\">Q. Why were you afraid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-18\">A Because he had a gun to the \u2014 like he was grabbing the back of me, and he had the [gun] in his other hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-19\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-20\">A So\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-21\">Q. What did you do with the keys?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-22\">A. I dropped the keys, then like he pushed me down to pick them up, and I picked up the keys and I gave them back to him. And then he handed me back the keys and he said go lock the door. I got to the front, I put the key in the door, I didn\u2019t lock it, but he was still standing behind me just like persistent for me to lock the door. He kept yelling at me, so I locked the door and I took the keys and I put it on the counter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-23\">Q. Okay. And what happened after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-24\">A Then he grabbed me to the back of the store, and he told me just stand there. And he walked to the front; he started grabbing stuff off the shelves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-25\">Q. Okay. And where was Mr. Darwish during that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-26\">A He was on the floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-27\">Q. Okay. And was he tied up or anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-28\">A. No. He was just told not to move.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Q. And what were you doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">A. I was just standing in the back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">Q. Okay. And [the co-defendant], what was he doing at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">A. I don\u2019t know. He went to the front of the store. I couldn\u2019t see him because of the shelves again. He just kept yelling, he was yelling at the store owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Immediately after he was arrested, defendant testified that his first concern was to avoid being placed in the same police car as the co-defendant. Once he was certain that he would not be exposed to any further intimidation or possible retaliation by co-defendant, defendant testified that he attempted to inform Officer Uram about the coercion and intimidation he experienced in the store. The following excerpt from his direct testimony illustrates the point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">After I saw the officer take [co-defendant] to the other car ... because I told [the police officer] \u2014 I said, don\u2019t bring him over here. And he said, all right. He\u2019s going to send him over to another ear. When they sent Ico-defendant] to the other car, <em>I told [the officer] what happened inside the store.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">It is clear to us that defendant used this testimony as a critical part of his duress defense. These post-arrest statements, allegedly made at the scene, without the opportunity to reflect or consult with counsel, are intended to bolster defendant\u2019s credibility, by rebutting any implication of recent fabrication. Under these circumstances, the State must be given a fair and reasonable opportunity to cross-examine defendant as to what details he allegedly gave to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">The State is also entitled to present rebuttal testimony from the officer allegedly involved in these conversations. Such rebuttal evidence may, if necessary to contradict defendant\u2019s testimony, include not only what the officer remembers defendant saying, but also <em>what he remembers him not saying. </em>This conclusion does not contravene <em>Muhammad. </em>This kind of rebuttal testimony, (what the witness remembers defendant not saying), is proper, so long as it is restricted to refuting defendant\u2019s trial testimony. That is, if defendant testifies that he told the police officer: \u201cthe car was red,\u201d the officer, in rebuttal, may testify that defendant made no such statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>On the other hand, if defendant does not testify that he made a statement about the color of the car, the State cannot use that omission as a means of attacking defendant\u2019s credibility, by having the rebuttal witness testify that no such statement was made to him or her. Rebuttal testimony impinges upon a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent when it suggests that the mere absence of a statement at the time of arrest is a basis to doubt the veracity of defendant\u2019s trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The circumstances in this case are critically different than the facts the Supreme Court confronted in <em>State v. Muhammad. </em>In <em>Muhammad, </em>defendant, who had identified himself as a Paterson police officer, used this authority to lure the victim into his car. He then drove the victim to a secluded area where he sexually assaulted her. <em>State v. Muhammad, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 559, 868 A.2d 302. After the assault, defendant took the victim to the Paterson police headquarters. Once there, defendant identified himself as a police officer to the desk sergeant, and claimed that he had \u201cbrought [the victim] in\u201d because she had been harassing his brother and sister. The victim immediately denied these allegations, accused defendant of sexually assaulting her, and produced the condom defendant had allegedly used during the assault as proof of her claims. <em>Id. </em>at 560-61, 868 A.2d 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">At the trial, during opening and closing remarks, defense counsel argued to the jury that the victim was a prostitute, and the sexual encounter was consensual. Defendant did not testify. <em>Id. </em>at 562, 868 A.2d 302. As part of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, the prosecutor called the desk sergeant, who testified not only about the statements defendant made to him, but also about the lack of any mention by defendant that he had engaged in consensual sex with the victim. Specifically, the prosecutor focused his questions to highlight defendant\u2019s failure to characterize the victim as a prostitute. <em>Id. </em>at 562-63, 868 A.2d 302. The prosecutor emphasized this latter point during his closing argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Writing for the majority of the Court, Justin Albin concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s repeated references to defendant\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>mention any facts that supported his ultimate defense strategy, \u201c \u2018at or near\u2019 the time of his arrest,\u201d constituted an unconstitutional infringement upon defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 573-74, 868 A.2d 302.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">We cannot accept the State\u2019s depiction of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks as merely-highlighting the inconsistency between defendant\u2019s statement at police headquarters and the defense advanced by his attorney. In assailing defendant\u2019s consent defense, the prosecutor\u2019s leitmotif was defendant\u2019s silence at police headquarters. The prosecutor was entitled to let the jury know that defendant\u2019s claim to the police that he picked [the victim] up for harassment stood in stark contrast to his attorney\u2019s trial argument of a consensual sexual encounter. However, the prosecutor went far beyond pointing out that significant inconsistency; <em>instead the prosecutor called for the jury to reject the consent defense because defendant remained silent when he had the opportunity to present it to the police. </em>Here, the prosecutor\u2019s thrust was that both before and after [the victim] accused him of rape, defendant did not give to the police the exculpatory account that his counsel provided to the jury. In other words, the prosecutor impaled defendant on his silence, intimating that an innocent man would not have stopped speaking to the police officers, but would have revealed to them the defense offered as truth at trial. We conclude that the prosecutor elicited testimony and commented on defendant\u2019s silence at police headquarters to impugn his defense at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 566-67, 868 A.2d 302 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The Court, however, acknowledged that a defendant\u2019s statements or inconsistencies, \u201c\u2018at or near\u2019 the time of his arrest,\u201d are, nevertheless, proper areas of prosecutorial inquiry. <em>Id. </em>at 566 n. 3, 868 A.2d 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Here, although some of the prosecutor\u2019s questions came dangerously close to crossing the line of demarcation between proper impeachment of defendant\u2019s credibility, and unconstitutional comments on his right to remain silent, the thrust of the interrogation stayed within the boundaries of proper cross-examination. The following exchange between the prosecutor and defendant illustrates this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">Q. In fact, Officer Uram, after he advised you of your rights, you didn\u2019t say anything else to him'\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">A. I did. I was trying to talk to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-12\">Q. \u2014about what happened in the store? Isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-13\">A. I did. I tried to talk to him, but he wouldn\u2019t listen to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Q. You\u2019re saying that Officer Uram, after he was trying to get you to talk about where this gun was, that he just didn\u2019t want to hear anything else from you? Is that what your testimony is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">Q. Isn\u2019t it true that on March 24th, 2003, you said that you \u2014 a gun was pointed at you by [co-defendant], correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">Q. Has that ever happened to you before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">Q. A gun being pointed at you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-13\">Q. Was this the first time on March 24th, 2003?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-14\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-15\">Q. But you never decided to tell Officer Uram on March 24th, 2003 about that, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-16\">A.

Yes, I thought they were going to bring [co-defendant] with me. I thought they were going to put us together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-20\">Q. But the fact that a gun was pointed at you, you didn\u2019t think that that was important to tell the police officer while you were in his custody, in the back of his car, alone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-21\">[Although the trial court overruled defense counsel\u2019s timely objection, the prosecutor did not secure an answer to this question from defendant.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-22\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-23\">Q. So when the Police Officer Uram had you in his custody, again, you did not tell him anything about the fact that a gun had just been pointed to your head? A. I did. I tried to tell him, he wouldn\u2019t listen to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-24\">As this excerpt from the State\u2019s cross-examination reveals, defendant repeatedly asserted that he attempted to tell the arresting officer what had occurred inside the store, as evidencing his lack of volition to commit any criminal act. Unlike what occurred in <em>Muhammad, </em>what makes this line of inquiry proper, is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>defendant affirmatively testified at trial that he had mentioned the details of his duress defense to the arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Through its cross-examination, the State was not casting a shadow of culpability based on defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence at the scene. Under these circumstances, the prosecutor was properly attacking defendant\u2019s credibility by suggesting to the jury that his trial testimony was inconsistent with the events described by the arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We hold, however, that at this juncture in the trial, and as part of its overall charge on the law, the trial court should have reminded the jury, using clear and emphatic language, that (1) defendant had the right to remain silent; and (2) no inference of culpability should be drawn from his exercise of that right. Absent such instructions, a jury may improperly conclude that defendant had a duty to come forward with information supporting his duress-defense, at or near the time of his arrest, and that his failure to do so should be considered against him in weighing his overall credibility. This would be precisely the type of unconstitutional inference the Supreme Court found improper in <em>Muhammad.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Because defendant did not request such a charge here, we must review any alleged error in this respect under the plain error standard of review. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. \u201cUnder that standard, we disregard an error unless it is \u2018clearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Daniels, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>80, 95, 861 A.2d 808 (2004) (quoting <em>B. </em>2:10-2). Given the substantial evidence presented, we cannot conclude that the absence of such an instruction constitutes plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed. The matter is remanded for the trial court to conduct a new hearing with respect to the admissibility of defendant\u2019s statements to the police.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-14\"> Although defendant was convicted of a second-degree offense, the court imposed a sentence within the third-degree range, because, in this case, \"the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>court [was] clearly convinced that the mitigating factors substantially outweighed] the aggravating factors.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-15\"> The NERA parole disqualifier only applied to the robbery conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\"> Although not directly discemable from the record, we assume that the State fulfilled its discovery obligation under <em>R. </em>3:13 \u2014 3(c)(2). Therefore, defense counsel should have been aware of the need to challenge the admissibility of any statement made by his client to the police, well before the commencement of the trial. <em>R. </em>3:10-2(a) requires counsel to advise the court, at the post-indictment arraignment/status conference, of his/her intention to file any motion. Thereafter, the timely filing of a motion to suppress a defendant\u2019s post-arrest statement triggers a commensurate obligation upon the trial court, absent good cause, to decide the motion before fixing a trial date. <em>R. </em>3:10-2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Here, the question of the admissibility of defendant's post-arrest statements to the police arose after the commencement of the trial. While we recognize that under <em>State v. Jordan, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>409, 419, 688 A.2d 97 (1997), a trial court is obligated to determine the admissibility of a defendant's post-arrest statements under <em>Miranda, </em>modem criminal case management practices require that this determination be made in advance of trial. <em>R. </em>3:9 \u2014 1(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Without this pre-trial determination, a defendant is left in the dark about a critical part of the State\u2019s proofs against him. A defendant is entitled to know, in advance of trial, the full arsenal of evidence the State has amassed against him, including whether the State can legally present to the jury statements he may have made to the police. Such knowledge is not only indispensable to formulate a sound defense strategy at trial, but it is also essential in assisting a defendant in making the decision to accept or reject a prosecutor\u2019s plea-agreement offer. <em>R. </em>3:9 \u2014 1 (b),(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">The State is also prejudiced if a determination as to the admissibility of a defendant\u2019s statements is not made before trial. Without advance notice of what evidence will be admitted at trial, the prosecutor: (1) is unable to assess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>rationally the strengths and weaknesses of the State\u2019s case; and (2) risks creating grounds for a mistrial, by unknowingly advising the jury, in the course of his/her opening statement, of information the court may subsequently determine to be inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-20\">While we have no basis to fault the trial judge here, it is the responsibility of trial courts, at the final pretrial conference, to insure that all pretrial motions have been addressed and decided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b395-13\"> We note that defendant's challenge here is limited to the admissibility of his statements, not to the admissibility of the gun itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>WECKER, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AhI\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">I respectfully dissent because I disagree with my colleagues with respect to both of the significant issues raised by this appeal. First, I conclude that reversal is compelled by <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>551, 565-66, 868 A.2d 302 (2005), <em>State v. Lyle, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>403, 406 n. 1, 407 n. 4, 408 n. 5, 410, 375 A.2d 629 (1977), and <em>State v. Deatore, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>100, 107, 115-16, 358 A.2d 163 (1976). Second, apart from the fact that the violation of defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination compels a new trial, I would not find error in the admission of defendant\u2019s statement to the police, and therefore no reason to remand for a hearing on the adequacy of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings he received.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In my view, the prosecutor violated defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination when she cross-examined him respecting his alleged failure to give the arresting officer the exculpatory explanation he offered to the jury in support of his duress defense\u2014 that co-defendant Samha forced him at gunpoint to participate in the robbery. <em>See Muhammad, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 565-66, 868 A.2d 302 (\u201cMaking reference at trial to what a defendant did not say to the police is commenting on his silence.\u201d) (citing <em>Lyle, supra, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 406 n. 1, 407 n. 4, 408 n. 5, 410, 375 A.2d 629, and <em>Deatore, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 107, 115-16, 358 A.2d 163). Neither federal law under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, nor New Jersey common law, permits a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence to be used to impeach that defendant\u2019s testimony at trial. <em>Muhammad, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 568, 868 A.2d 302 (citing <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>610, 619, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240, 2245, 49 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>91, 98 (1976)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>); <em>see also Deatore, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 108-09, 113, 358 A.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Here, the arresting officer, Officer Uram, testified in the State\u2019s case-in-chief about his initial questions to defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">Q Officer Uram, you said that you were at the car, you advised him of his rights again, and based on the information that you received, you had a conversation with Mr. Elkwisni with the public safety in mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">AI asked him whether, you know, he hid the gun in the store or anything to that nature and first he denied, no, no, no, but he was looking around. He kept looking right to left and appeared very nervous. I just kept talking to him, kept talking to him, and eventually he said \u2014 eventually he goes, \"it\u2019s behind the Huggies.\u201d And I said, \u201cwhere\u2019s that?\u201d And he said \u201cthe back aisle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Notably, according to Officer Uram, what defendant initially denied was \u201cwhether ... he hid the gun in the store or anything to that nature. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prosecutor then misstated the officer\u2019s prior answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">Q So when he first told you that there was no gun, what was \u2014 how long did it take for him to actually say that there was a gun?

Confronted at the scene, Lyle immediately admitted that he shot the victim, but later claimed the shooting was in self-defense and so testified at trial. The prosecutor elicited direct testimony from the investigating officer that defendant immediately said \u201cI shot him,\u201d but said nothing about the victim having been the aggressor. <em>Id. </em>at 406, 375 A.2d 629. The prosecutor cross-examined the defendant about his post-arrest omission, that is, his failure to tell the investigating officer that he shot the victim in self-defense. <em>Id. </em>at 408 and n. 5, 375 A.2d 629. Finally, the prosecutor argued in summation that the earlier omission suggested that defendant was now lying. <em>Id, </em>at 409, 375 A.2d 629. Just like defendant here, Lyle insisted, in answer to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, that on the way to the police station, he did tell a detective that the victim had attacked him. 73 <em>N.J. </em>at 408 n. 5, 375 A.2d 629. Defense counsel did not object to the cross-examination or summation; the Court found plain error and reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 409-10, 375 A.2d 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Noting that the record was in conflict as to whether Lyle knew or understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights when he was arrested, the Court in <em>Lyle </em>also noted that under <em>Deatore,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAO\">as a matter of State law the use of a defendant\u2019s silence is improper irrespective of whether such warnings are given. Hence, in the case before us it was manifestly improper to use defendant\u2019s silence to attack his self-defense theory as a fabrication. Because this defense was at the very heart of the case, the prosecutor\u2019s action was \u201cof such a nature as to have been clearly capable of producing an unjust result ...\u201d and hence in the magnitude of plain error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\"><em>[Lyle, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 410, 375 A.2d 629 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Lyle testified that the victim came at him with a screwdriver. Defense counsel argued in summation that the reason no screwdriver was found at the scene was because police faded to look for it after they heard Lyle\u2019s self-defense claim. <em>Id. </em>at 417-18, 375 A.2d 629 (Conford, P.J.A.D., dissenting). The State argued that the prosecutor\u2019s emphasis on Lyle\u2019s alleged failure to tell the police about the screwdriver attack was justifiable rebuttal. <em>Id. </em>at 411, 375 A.2d 629. But the Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">[w]hile it may have been permissible for the State to argue that the police never found the screwdriver because no one suggested they should search for it, the comments in question constituted an attack on defendant\u2019s version of the events by the impermissible use of his silence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Describing the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lyle, </em>where the defendant did testify, Justice Albin wrote for six members of the Court in <em>Muhammad: </em>\u201cThat the defendant gave only a partial account to the police at or near the time of his arrest did not open the door to prosecutorial questioning about what the defendant did not tell to the police.\u201d <em>Muhammad, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 571, 868 A.2d 302 (citing <em>Lyle, supra, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 405, 410, 375 A.2d 629). Justice Albin\u2019s opinion for the Court in <em>Muhammad </em>rejected the very argument the State makes (and my colleagues accept) here. Muhammad did not testify at trial. The State attempted in summation to characterize his pre-arrest omissions as inconsistent with defense counsel\u2019s version of events. <em>Muhammad, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 565-67, 868 A.2d 302. Thus in <em>Muhammad, </em>the Court was not addressing use of pre-arrest silence to impeach a testifying defendant, but rather use of silence as substantive evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 573 n. 8, 868 A.2d 302. The Court nonetheless drew a clear line of demarcation between proper use of a defendant\u2019s inconsistent statements and improper use of silence and prohibited the State from \u201cimpal[ing] defendant on his silence----to impugn his defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566-67, 868 A.2d 302. The Court relied heavily on its prior reasoning in <em>Lyle, </em>where the issue did arise in the context of cross-examination of a testifying defendant. Thus any attempt to distinguish <em>Muhammad </em>on the ground that the defendant in that case did not testify is unpersuasive. In my view, the facts here clearly fall on the wrong side of \u201cthe line of demarcation between legitimate impeachment of a defendant\u2019s credibility through the use of prior inconsistent statements, and improper inquiry or comment on defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent.\u201d <em>See </em>op. of majority at 358, 894 A.2d at 1184.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The majority cites defendant\u2019s testimony \u2014 that he tried to tell the arresting officer that he was forced into complicity \u2014 as justification for cross-examining him on his alleged omission, describing such cross-examination as a legitimate challenge to defendant\u2019s credibility. Op. of majority at 373-74, 894 A.2d at 1193-94. In <em>Lyle, </em>however, where the defendant also testified that he tried to tell the police that he shot the victim in self-defense, the Court rejected a similar rationale, finding plain error in the State\u2019s use of defendant\u2019s factually disputed silence to attack his defense of self-defense. 73 <em>N.J. </em>at 408 and n. 5, 410-11, 375 A.2d 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The majority also suggests that because defendant did not remain entirely silent, but did answer Officer Uram\u2019s question about the location of the gun, his alleged silence about the claimed duress was inconsistent with his trial testimony. Justice Rivera-Soto drew a similar distinction in his opinion concurring in the result in <em>Muhammad; </em>but the Court did not adopt that view. <em>See Muhammad, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 580-84, 868 A.2d 302 (Rivera Soto, J., concurring). In his concurring opinion, Justice Rivera-Soto distinguished between the defendant\u2019s two separate statements, holding that the protection of <em>Deatore, Lyle, </em>and <em>State v. Brown, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>595, 573 A.2d 886 (1990), applied only to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>defendant\u2019s silence in response to post-detention interrogation, but not to his pre-arrest statement accusing the victim of having harassed defendant\u2019s brother and sister. Justice Rivera-Soto would have allowed defendant\u2019s earlier comments because they were \u201cdefendant\u2019s statements, and not silence.\u201d <em>Muhammad, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 583, 868 A.2d 302 (Rivera Soto, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Obviously, if Officer Uram had testified that defendant said something in the police car that was inconsistent with his trial testimony \u2014 for example, that Samha threatened him with a knife, whereas at trial he said he was threatened with a gun \u2014 the State would have been entitled to use defendant\u2019s prior statement both to impeach him in cross-examination and to argue in summation that the inconsistency suggested that defendant was lying. But if the officer testified that defendant omitted some part of his trial explanation when he spoke to the officer at the scene \u2014 for example, that he told the officer that Samha threatened him, but did not mention a particular weapon \u2014 the State would not have been permitted to use that omission to impeach defendant or to argue that the omission implied that defendant was lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The State\u2019s right to use a defendant\u2019s silence to impeach his testimony in cross-examination was the narrow issue the Court chose to address in <em>Deatore, </em>despite having reversed defendant\u2019s conviction, along with that of his co-defendant, for a different reason: \u201cfundamental error\u201d in failing to excuse or at least more thoroughly question a juror who admitted he knew the victim. <em>Deatore, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 104-05, 358 A.2d 163. There, the defendant put forth an alibi defense. He testified that at the time of the robbery with which both defendants were charged, he was with a woman in a local motel room; the woman he identified also testified in his behalf. The Court addressed the State\u2019s argument that it was entirely proper \u2014 or at most harmless error \u2014 to cross-examine the defendant on his failure to volunteer his alibi when he was arrested. <em>Id. </em>at 106-19, 358 A.2d 163. Chief Justice Hughes, writing for the majority, noted that the issue was one of \u201cgeneral importance,\u201d and while subject to \u201ca remarkable variance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>judicial views, [it] should be settled so far as New Jersey courts are concerned\u201d even if overwhelming evidence of guilt could be said to make the error \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106, <em>358 A.2d 163. </em>Although strong, the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt in this case, in the face of his duress defense, was not so overwhelming that it reasonably could be held to be harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We followed <em>Deatore </em>in <em>State v. Micheliche, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>532, 533 A.2d 41 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>40, 532 A.2d 1108 (1987). There the defendant testified at his murder trial, denying his guilt, and claiming that he signed a written confession for police out of fear that the guilty individual who was also in custody, and who had implicated him in the killing, would kill him in jail if he denied his involvement. <em>Id. </em>at 540, 533 A.2d 41. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the defendant if he or his attorney, at any time prior to trial, had informed the prosecutor\u2019s office of that motivation for his confession. <em>Ibid. </em>The trial judge allowed the questioning, over objection by the defense, on the ground that the defendant was now offering \u201c \u2018an entirely different version.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Judge Antell, writing for this court, concluded that \u201c[t]o highlight [the defendant\u2019s] failure to advise the State in advance of trial as to how he proposed to meet that evidence [of his written confession] infringe[d] upon his right to remain silent in the same manner as <em>State v. Deatore.\u201d Id. </em>at 542, 533 A.2d 41. As a result, we were \u201cconstrained to reverse\u201d defendant\u2019s murder conviction and remand for a new trial. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The majority emphasizes the State\u2019s right to offer rebuttal testimony, apparently in response to defendant\u2019s testimony that he told or tried to tell Officer Uram \u201cwhat happened inside the store.\u201d Significantly, however, when the officer was called on rebuttal, and asked more than once whether defendant made any other statements at the scene, the officer said only \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d and then \u201cnot that I recall.\u201d The State\u2019s rebuttal thus emphasized defendant\u2019s alleged failure to provide his duress defense early on, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>without a good faith basis for claiming a prior inconsistent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In her summation in this trial, the prosecutor alluded to defendant\u2019s alleged \u201csilence\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">PROSECUTOR: With regards to this claim of duress, you are now arrested, you\u2019re in a police car. The first thing that you\u2019re going to do is that you\u2019re going to he happy that the police are there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">THE COURT: Sustain the objection. Once again, that\u2019s an opinion. PROSECUTOR: Just use your common sense and your life experiences.

The jury will make that determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvA\">PROSECUTOR: Moments later the police officer continues to engage him in conversation and talks about the fact that this is serious.

I differ only in concluding that the prosecutor crossed that line. As in <em>Muhammad, </em>the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cleitmotif\u2019 was defendant\u2019s silence \u2014 his failure to tell officer Uram that Samha coerced his complicity by threatening him with a gun. The State contends that defendant\u2019s admission to the officer \u2014 that he hid the gun behind the Huggies \u2014 was inconsistent with his trial testimony \u2014 that the gun was Samha\u2019s and Samha used it to threaten him. But the prosecutor went beyond that claimed inconsistency in cross-examining defendant and in arguing in summation that defendant was not \u201ccooperative\u201d with the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>and did not tell him immediately about \u201ca gun being pointed\u201d at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The majority also recognizes the trial judge\u2019s obligation to give proper limiting instructions and the judge\u2019s error in failing to give a limiting instruction on the permissible and impermissible inferences to be drawn from defendant\u2019s silence. But the majority finds no plain error. Op. of majority at 371, 377, 894 A.2d at 1192, 1196. I would find that omission to be plain error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Defendant\u2019s duress defense \u201cwas at the very heart of the case,\u201d <em>see Lyle, supra, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>at 410, 375 A.2d 629. I conclude, as did the Court in <em>Muhammad, </em>\u201cthat the prosecutor\u2019s violation of defendant\u2019s state law privilege against self-incrimination was \u2018clearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u2019 \u201d 182 <em>N.J. </em>at 574, 868 A.2d 302 (quoting <em>R. </em>2:10-2). I would therefore reverse defendant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Although I would grant defendant a new trial on the grounds addressed in Part I of this opinion, I find no insufficiency of evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s determination that defendant\u2019s statement about the location of the gun was admissible, and therefore no reason to order a remand for a new <em>Rule </em>104(c) hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Before his testimony was offered to the jury, Garfield Police Officer Richard Uram testified in a <em>Rule </em>104(e) hearing during the trial. His direct testimony in that hearing, with respect to advising defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, began as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">Q Now at some point in time you were assigned to put under arrest Ahmed Elkwisni. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">Q Tell us how you did it. What did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">A As \u2014 as they were walking towards the door they were ordered to the ground. I immediately went to him and he laid right on the ground and I placed him in custody. I cuffed him behind his back as he was laying on the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">Q And what was the next thing that happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">A Then I led him out towards my \u2014 my police unit, where I searched him, incident to arrest; money out of his \u2014 out of his pants that he had on him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">Q What was the next thing that happened. After you searched him incident to the arrest, did he have any weapons on him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">A No, he had no weapons on him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">Q What was the next thing that happened as part of the arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-12\">AI was given information that there was possibly a gun involved in this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-13\">Q So as a result of that information, what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-14\">AI informed Officer Marsh that he did not have a gun on him and I believe Officer Sanchez reported his guy didn\u2019t have a gun on him either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-15\">Q <em>What was the next thing that happened?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-16\">A <em>I began talking to him.

Is this what you\u2019re saying to him or this is what you\u2019re thinking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-21\">THE WITNESS: No, this \u2014 well, I\u2019m thinking for the public safety as I\u2019m telling this also. I \u2014 I let him know that, you know, little kids go in the store and God forbid they \u2014 they get a hold of this gun and, you know, end up shooting or playing around they \u2014 they kill somebody or shoot an innocent person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-22\">PROSECUTOR:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-23\">Q <em>And you said that you reminded him of his rights in the car.

And was that a verbal or a written form?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-26\">A <em>Verbal.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-27\">Q <em>And then you said you reminded him of his rights again in the car.

So the only two people in the car when you were reminding him of his rights in the car was {sic] you and the defendant Ahmed Elkwisni?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">A <em>He was in the car, I was standing alongside the car speaking with him with the door open.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">Q Okay. You\u2019re standing alongside. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">A Yes. He was in the back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">Q Now when you\u2019re having this conversation with him, I take it you\u2019re speaking <em>in </em>English?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-11\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-12\">Q And what about him?

When he spoke to me, he speak [sic] English. At first he declined that there \u2014 he didn\u2019t know anything about a gun. As he\u2019s telling me this, he\u2019s looking around. He just appeared very nervous. He just kept looking right to left, right to left, looking \u2014 looking around and he just \u2014 he kept denying it, denying it, denying it. Then eventually he told me \u2014 he goes, \u201cIt\u2019s behind the Huggies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-14\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">The majority concludes that the State failed to offer sufficient evidence that Officer Uram advised defendant of each of the rights. required by <em>Miranda. </em>I disagree. \u201cI read him his rights\u201d implies that the officer was reading from a printed card \u2014 just as he later testified before the jury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge undoubtedly inferred, as he was entitled to, that Officer Uram in fact gave defendant all the required warnings, the same warnings that are printed <em>on </em>cards normally carried by police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">On cross-examination during the <em>Rule </em>104 hearing, defense counsel questioned Officer Uram about certain descriptions that he included in his written report of the incident: that he searched defendant \u201cincident to arrest,\u201d and that he questioned defendant about the gun \u201cwith the safety of the public in mind.\u201d Defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>counsel asked the officer why he included those explanations in his report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">Q Didn\u2019t you put- that statement there because you hadn\u2019t read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">A No, I didn\u2019t put that there for that reason.

Defendant could have testified at the <em>Rule </em>104(c) hearing; his testimony at the hearing could be used only if he gave conflicting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>trial testimony and then only for impeachment. <em>See Simmons v. United States, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>377, 394, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>967, 976, 19 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1247, 1259 (1968) (a defendant\u2019s testimony at a suppression hearing is not admissible at trial to prove his guilt); <em>State v.

Bey II, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>123, 140, 548 A.2d 887 (1988) (internal citation omitted) (citing <em>State v.

Here, defendant did not testify in the Rule 104(c) voluntariness hearing. He never denied that he was given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings or that he invoked his rights before Officer Uram questioned him. The State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to support the judge\u2019s finding that defendant was given the required warnings, a finding to which we are obligated under these circumstances to defer. <em>See State v.

Once again, defendant offered no contrary evidence and never claimed that his statement was other than voluntary. Nothing in the officer\u2019s testimony raised a reasonable doubt in the trial judge\u2019s mind, and there is nothing in the hearing record that raises a reasonable doubt in my mind that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary and therefore admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">I agree with the majority that the public safety exception originally set forth in <em>New York v.

Diloreto, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>264, 281-82, 850 A.2d 1226 (2004) (emphasizing that a missing person\u2019s safety was at stake in finding that police actions fell within the public safety aspect of the communitycaretaking function).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Officer Uram knew that a gun had been involved, and that neither of the detainees had a gun in his possession when taken into custody. The gun had not been found in the store, and certainly the store could not be reopened to the public until it was found. But the victim\u2019s store in this case apparently was smaller than the supermarket involved in <em>Quarles. </em>And as the majority notes, police officers still surrounded the store when Officer Uram asked defendant to tell him where the gun was. While even a locked store poses a public safety hazard with a loaded gun hidden inside, there were two alternatives then available to the police, which had not been exhausted. One alternative was to send police into the store to search for the gun. The other alternative was to keep a police guard around the store in the hope that one of the detainees would spontaneously reveal the location of the gun. Since the record does not demonstrate that either of those alternatives was exhausted, I agree that the public safety exception is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">I would reverse defendant\u2019s conviction and order a new trial because of the violation of defendant\u2019s right not to have his silence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>used against him at trial. Were it not for that violation, I would not suppress his statement to Officer Uram, and I see no reason to remand for a new <em>Rule </em>104(c) hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-8\"> <em>Miranda v.
