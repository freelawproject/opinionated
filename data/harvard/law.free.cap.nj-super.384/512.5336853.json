Such a uniform, non-discretionary program is less intrusive on the officer\u2019s legitimate expectation of privacy than the random drug and alcohol testing permitted by the Supreme Court in <em>New Jersey Transit PBA Local 304 v. New Jersey Transit Corp., </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>531, 701 A.2d 1243 (1997), a case involving the same parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">New Jersey Transit PBA Local No. 304(PBA), the collective bargaining representative and negotiating agent for police officers employed by the New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJT), appeals from the May 7, 2004 summary judgment dismissing its verified complaint against NJT.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The objective of PBA\u2019s lawsuit was to enjoin NJT\u2019s Police Chief, Joseph C. Bober, from \u201ccontinuing to implement and enforce a medical examination program,\u201d which was compulsory for all NJT police officers. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">These are the salient facts. On January 16, 2003, Chief Bober issued Administrative Order No. A-03-005, which requires all NJT police personnel to submit to annual medical examinations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>during their birth date month. The annual medical examination was recommended by NJT\u2019s Director of Medical Services, Elizabeth Schneider, RN, MPS, MS. The purpose of the examination is to determine whether or not an officer is physically capable of performing his or her duties. According to Schneider, the examination \u201crepresents a basic physical as recommended by the American Medical Association.\u201d It consists of the following components:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">1. Medical History</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">2. Complete Laboratory Work which includes: (Complete Blood Count with Differential; Super Smac which consists of Liver Function, Cardiac Profile and Electrolytes, PSA \u2014 age appropriate)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">3. Clinitex 10 urine drip stick</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">4. Pulmonary Function</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-11\">5. Electrocardiogram</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-12\">6. Drug and Alcohol Testing (non-DOT)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-13\">7. Mantoux</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-14\">8. Physician Examination</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-15\">9. Vision and Hearing Screens</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-16\">10. Lead Testing</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-17\">Part of the blood analysis is the \u201cBlood Borne Pathogen Program.\u201d If a police officer refuses to submit to the exam, the officer may be disciplined with sanctions that include suspension or termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-18\">Upon completion of the examination, form MD-40, which contains no medical information, but does contain the examiner\u2019s conclusion on whether the officer is medically qualified to perform his/her duties as a police officer, is forwarded to the officer\u2019s commanding officer. The commanding officer then forwards form MD-40 to NJT\u2019s Records Section. All other medical information and testing results are maintained by NJT\u2019s Medical Services. The results of the testing is shared only with the officer. The policy of NJT is to maintain these medical records confidentially in accordance with Corporate Policy 3.22, which states that \u201call services received and records of service are confidential and shall be released only on a need to know basis.\u201d This policy complies with state and federal regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1320, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>which concerns the protection of personal medical information and regulates its use and disclosure. <em>Community Hospital Group, Inc. v. Blume Goldfaden Berkowitz Donnelly Fried &amp; Forte, P.C., </em>381 <em>N.J.Super. </em>119, 125, 885 A.2d 18 (App.Div.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Upon receiving Administrative Order A-03-005, the PBA objected to three aspects of the medical examination, specifically the medical history, Blood Borne Pathogen Program and the urine analysis, and requested that NJT desist from implementing the examination program. Then, PBA filed a complaint alleging that the examination contravenes the United States and New Jersey Constitutions. The PBA sought an injunction, a declaration that the program is void and compensatory damages. Following a hearing, the Chancery Division, Bergen County, denied the injunction. We denied leave to appeal. No. M-6237-02 (App.Div. August 27, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The matter was tried summarily on stipulated facts. Judge Gerald C. Escala found for NJT and dismissed the complaint. Judge Escala concluded that \u201cthe invasion of the officers\u2019 legitimate expectations of privacy is outweighed by [NJT\u2019s] need to supervise and control the operation of the police officers.\u201d Relying on <em>Rawlings v. Police Dept. of Jersey City, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>182, 188-90, 627 A.2d 602 (1993), the judge concluded that in balancing the interests of PBA members in being free from testing against the NJT\u2019s interest in determining an officer\u2019s continued fitness to perform his or her duties, the latter is paramount. The judge noted, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">[NJT] must implement security provisions coupled with an express ... policy prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of confidential medical information. The \u2018need to know\u2019 standard in place now is inadequate to protect [the PBA members\u2019] privacy interest. [NJT] must articulate what constitutes a \u2018need to know.\u2019 Specifically, a who, what, where, when, why and how standard for disclosure must be established by [NJT].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">On appeal, PBA contends that the judge erred by: (1) construing this matter as a drug testing case and by failing to apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201cspecial needs\u201d balancing test; (2) finding that NJT has a special need to \u201csupervise and control the operation of police officers;\u201d (3) confusing random drug testing with forced blood and urine analysis for all other purposes; and (4) failing to enjoin medical tests which do not have adequate confidentiality safeguards. PBA also contends that the requirement that an officer submit to the \u201cBlood Borne Pathogen Program\u201d impinges upon the constitutional right to bodily integrity, privacy and liberty interests to be free from non-consensual bodily examinations. Amicus curiae New Jersey State Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association (State-PBA) has filed a brief urging reversal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> State-PBA argues that the judge failed to properly analyze an officer\u2019s constitutional privacy right. We are not persuaded by these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">On the merits, the PBA argues that the judge misunderstood this case to be a drug testing case. The PBA stresses the point that it \u201cdoes not contest random drug and alcohol testing,\u201d because \u201csuch testing has been consistently upheld by the courts.\u201d We agree with this statement. The leading case is <em>New Jersey Transit PBA Local 304 v. New Jersey Transit Corp., supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>531, 701 A.2d 1243. What the PBA contests here is, \u201cblood and urine testing for any other privacy invading purpose.\u201d PBA maintains that, \u201c[i]f [NJT] simply limited the scope of its blood and urine tests to seek[ ] out abusers of alcohol or drugs, the PBA would have little cause for complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Despite this declaration, we note that the PBA frames its analysis of the issues in this case in terms appropriate for testing the legality of a random urine and alcohol test, rather than a bona fide, annual physical examination conducted pursuant to a uniform, non-discretionary policy by a public employer in a well-regulated industry. That is the proper analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>We have ruled, in the seope-of-negotiations context, that medical examinations, such as the one here, are a managerial prerogative in public sector employment. <em>Township of Bridgewater v. PBA Local 174, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>258, 482 A.2d 183 (App.Div. 1984). Physical fitness tests bear on a police officer\u2019s ability to do his or her job. <em>Id. </em>at 261, 482 A.2d 183 (citing <em>State v. State Supervisory Employees Ass\u2019n., 78 N.J. </em>54, 90-92, 393 A.2d 233 (1978)). The medical examination criteria must be directly related to the public employer\u2019s right to establish physical fitness performance requirements. <em>Bridgewater, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 262, 482 A.2d 183. The public employer has the right to determine the qualifications necessary for its police officers to perform their duties and to determine whether an officer meets those qualifications. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">There is no dispute that a physical examination constitutes a search. <em>See Schmerber v. State of California, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>757, 766-770, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908, 917 (1966); <em>see also State v. Hand, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>43, 60, 242 A.2d 888 (Law Div.1968) (holding that a physical examination of a person by a doctor constitutes a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment). Therefore, this managerial prerogative still must meet the constitutional requirement that an individual be free from unreasonable governmental searches as guaranteed by Article I, paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Gonstitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The NJT examination meets these requirements. We have held that the Fourth Amendment does not require individualized reasonable suspicion for drug testing of transportation workers as part of a bona fide annual physical examination. <em>Int\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Prof'l &amp; Technical Engineers, Local 194A v. Burlington County Bridge Comm\u2019n., 240 N.J.Super. </em>9, 11, 572 A.2d 204 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>183, 584 A.2d 244 (1990). <em>See Amalgamated Tr. Union v. Cambria Cty. Tr. Auth, </em>691 <em>F.Supp. </em>898, 902-04 (W.D.Pa.1988) (emphasizing a public employer\u2019s need for supervision and control of the workplace in contrast to the employee\u2019s expectation of privacy); <em>Jones v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number><em>McKenzie, </em>833 F.2d 335, 340 (D.C.Cir.1987) (upholding drug testing as part of a routine medical examination for teachers, citing a clear nexus between such tests and the employer\u2019s legitimate safety concern for the well being of school children) <em>amended by </em>878 F.2d 1476 (D.C.Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">A balancing test used to evaluate searches conducted by a public employer was described by the Supreme Court in <em>O\u2019Connor v. Ortega, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>709, 719, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1492, 1499, 94 L.Ed.2d 714, 724 (1987). There, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">[i]n the case of searches conducted by a public employer, we must balance the invasion of the employees\u2019 legitimate expectations of privacy against the government\u2019s need for supervision, control and the efficient operation of the workplace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">\n<em>mm</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Furthermore, the Fourth Amendment does not require individualized reasonable suspicion for conducting the NJT medical examination program. A federal court has held that conducting such tests pursuant to a uniform, non-discretionary policy satisfies the Fourth Amendment\u2019s purpose of \u201csafe-guarding the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.\u201d <em>Amalgamated, supra, </em>691 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 902. <em>See also Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Ass\u2019n of N.J. Local 318 v. Washington Twp., </em>850 F.2d 133 (3d Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>1004, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1637, 104 L.Ed.2d 153 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Here, the privacy interest of the police officer is not as significant as the government\u2019s interest present in the random drug or alcohol testing. In the latter instance, the officer faces disciplinary, perhaps criminal sanctions. Here, the consequence is a determination of fitness to perform the functions of the position. Although we are mindful that an adverse determination may result in termination, no officer has the right to hide his or her lack of fitness by asserting a privacy interest as a barrier to a physical examination. More importantly, no officer who is unfit for the position has the right to remain in the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Moreover, the examination program ordered by NJT passes constitutional muster pursuant to a recognized exception to the warrant requirement: administrative searches of pervasively regulated industries pursuant to a substantial government interest. The Supreme Court explained, \u201c[t]he pervasively regulated industry exception to the warrant requirement has generally been applied to businesses that have a \u2018long tradition of close government supervision.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J. Transit, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 545, 701 A.2d 1243 (quoting <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s Inc., </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>307, 313, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1816, 1821, 56 L.Ed.2d 305, 312 (1978)). The Court noted that both New Jersey and federal courts have found that people who work in industries \u201csubject to close supervision and inspection,\u201d have a diminished expectation of privacy. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, warrantless searches conducted in a pervasively regulated industry are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">deemed to be reasonable only so long as three criteria are met. First there must be a \u201csubstantial\u201d government interest that informs the regulatory scheme pursuant to which the inspection is made ... Second, the warrantless inspections must be \"necessary to further [the] regulatory scheme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">[And], finally, \u201cthe statute\u2019s inspection program, in terms of the certainty and regularity of its application [must] provid[e] a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 546, 701 A.2d 1243 (quoting <em>New York v. Burger, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>691, 702-03, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2636, 2644, 96 L.Ed.2d 601, 614 (1987) (citations omitted)) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">Police officers are members of a highly regulated industry and are therefore subject to the practice of suspicionless drug testing to monitor their physical fitness and capabilities. <em>Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>850 F.2d at 136-141.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">As stated above, the Supreme Court has held that random drug testing of NJT\u2019s police force is not unreasonable pursuant to the New Jersey Constitution, in light of the officers\u2019 decreased expectation of privacy, adequate limitations on the obtrusiveness of the testing, and the compelling state interest in promoting safe conduct by armed officers. <em>N.J. Transit, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 557-58, 701 A.2d 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has sustained drug testing if there is a special governmental need that would be jeopardized by adherence to the individualized suspicion standard. <em>Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>602, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1402, 103 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>639 (1989), <em>Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>656, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1384, 103 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>685 (1989). In <em>N.J. Transit, </em>our Supreme Court explained that, pursuant to the <em>Skinner/Von Raab </em>line of cases, a suspicionless search may be permissible when the search serves \u201cspecial needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement.\u201d <em>N.J. Transit, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 548, 701 A.2d 1243 (quoting <em>Chandler v. Miller, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>305, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1295, <em>1301, 137 L.Ed.2d </em>513, 523 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Applying that analysis here, it is clear that the mandatory annual physical examinations at issue, including the request for medical history and the testing of blood and urine, do not violate the New Jersey or United States Constitutions. First, the same public safety justifications are present. Clearly, an officer\u2019s ability to perform his or her job safely depends on being physically capable of performing [his or her] duties. Second, a lack of physical ability to safely perform police duties can result from an ailment or condition just as easily as it can be a result of drug or alcohol use. The same reasons expressed by the Supreme Court in <em>N.J. Transit </em>apply with greater force here, where the government interest is testing an officer\u2019s fitness to meet the qualifications of the position. The intrusion on the officer\u2019s privacy is no greater than in a random drug testing case. However, the consequences to the officer do not involve disciplinary or penal sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Considering that NJT has a substantial interest in protecting its employees and the public, there is a substantial government interest, akin to the drug testing in <em>N.J. Transit, </em>and therefore justifies the minimal privacy intrusions present here. <em>See also Int'l Fed\u2019n of Prof'l &amp; Technical Engineers, Local 194A v. Burlington County, supra, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 24-25, 572 A.2d 204 (applying the special needs test in upholding urine testing for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>drugs of bridge workers at their annual physical examinations). As for blood testing, the Supreme Court explained in <em>Skinner </em>that this type of testing is now \u201ccommonplace.\u201d PBA cites case law for the proposition that medical history and records are a private matter and employers may not disclose that information to a third party. However, an employer\u2019s disclosure of that information is an entirely separate issue from requesting an employee\u2019s medical history.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Our holding is consistent with federal cases. <em>See Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>850 F.2d at 136-41 (holding that a municipality\u2019s plan for mandatory random drug testing and annual medical examination programs, including urinalysis, for police officers falls within the administrative search exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement because pervasive regulation of police reduced their expectation of privacy); <em>see also Fowler v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Sanitation, </em>704 <em>F.Supp. </em>1264, 1270 (S.D.N.Y.1989) (explaining that urine specimens as part of a physical examination to determine fitness for employment does not constitute a Fourth Amendment search, noting that the federal government requires employees in or applicants for positions with physical or medical standards to submit to physical examinations prior to appointment or selection and pointing out that courts have upheld such physicals as constitutional for both federal and state employees); <em>see also Amalgamated, supra, </em>691 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 906 (holding that the county transit authority\u2019s drug and alcohol testing program which required taking and testing of urine and blood samples for drug and alcohol testing during each employee\u2019s required annual physical examination did not violate the Fourth Amendment as the testing program bore a reasonable relationship to authority\u2019s legitimate goal <em>of </em>ensuring employee and public safety by fostering a work environment free of the affects of drugs).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">PBA also contends that the program lacks regulations, standards or due process procedures. The State PBA joins this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>argument, indicating that the judge erred by failing to find in PBA\u2019s favor after finding that NJT\u2019s information security policy to be inadequate. We note that the judge appropriately addressed these concerns by ordering NJT to implement a policy prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of confidential medical information. We also note that NJT Corporate Policy 3.22 requires confidentiality of medical records. This Corporate Policy is consistent with the federal mandate that employees\u2019 records must be kept confidential and are reported only to the appropriate management official and the employee, except in certain limited circumstances or \u201cas required by law.\u201d <em>N.J. Transit, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 560-61, 701 A.2d 1243 (citing 49 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 653.75 and <em>Core Policy </em>\u00a7 XIII, Addendum I \u00a7 XIII).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">However, the record does not disclose whether NJT has developed, as ordered by Judge Escala, \u201csecurity provisions\u201d coupled with an \u201cexpress policy prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of confidential medical information.\u201d If NJT has not already done so, it must develop and implement such security provisions and express policy no later than July 1,2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">PBA also contends that NJT \u201chas not implemented a single procedure or standard by which it will be governed in the practice of forcing an officer to consent to blood and urine testing as well as relinquishment of their complete medical history.\u201d Thus, PBA argues that, \u201cthe lack of procedural safeguards in this matter renders [NJT\u2019s] practice prima facie constitutionally repugnant.\u201d We reject this contention. As stated above, the medical examination is mandatory and non-diseretionary. All officers must comply with it on an annual basis. Moreover, the results are kept confidential. There is no further consequence to the officer unless the medical examiner concludes that the officer is not physically fit. In that event, the existing procedures for contesting a fitness determination would be triggered. Therefore, this contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">We also reject PBA\u2019s argument that the medical examination is a \u201cblanket fishing expedition for every type of private medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>condition.\u201d PBA argues that these private medical conditions can include, for example, sexually transmitted diseases, such as herpes, that have no bearing on an officer\u2019s fitness to serve. That, however, is a medical judgment that neither this court nor the PBA can make. It is up to the physician making a fitness determination to decide what impact an officer\u2019s history, or a particular test result has on the officer\u2019s fitness for duty. In light of the confidentiality of the information, we find no basis for PBA\u2019s argument that this information will be used in \u201cscreening for disabilities, pregnancy, for use in criminal investigations, paternity testing, or disciplinary reasons.\u201d The existing NJT policy, as well as New Jersey and federal law preclude such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-12\"> PBA's Notice of Appeal erroneously indicated that it is appealing from a July 17, 2003 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\"> We granted State-PBA\u2019s motion to file a brief and participate in oral argument.
