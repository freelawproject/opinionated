She died in February 1857, intestate and without issue, but leaving brothers and sisters and the children of a deceased sister, who were the appellants in this case. Her personal property consisted of goods and chattels of the value of $346, bonds and notes amounting to $3084.79, and $523.62 in cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-7\">The administrator of Elizabeth Wickert filed an account which resulted in a balance for distribution of $2982.91, the proceeds of the bonds and notes bequeathed to her by her deceased husband. This balance was claimed by the appellants as the heirs of Elizabeth Wickert, the intestate; and it was also claimed by the appellees, who were the heirs at law of Solomon Wickert deceased, on the ground that the intestate took only a life estate in the bonds and notes, under her husband\u2019s will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-8\">The auditor appointed to report distribution of the fund in the hands of the accountant, awarded it to the heirs of Elizabeth Wickert deceased; but the court below, on exceptions filed by the heirs of Solomon Wickert, set aside the report of the auditor, and decreed the fund to the exceptants, whereupon this appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b121-9\"><em>W.

Solomon Wickert, by his last will, dated the 8th August 1838, devised and bequeathed as follows: \u201cAnd as to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>worldly estate, wherewith it has pleased God to bless me in this life, I give and dispose of the same as follows:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">\u201c I give to my loving wife Elizabeth, all that tract of land in Lower Maeungie township, county aforesaid, during her lifetime, together with all my bonds and notes, to have and to hold the same,\u201d The obvious meaning of this clause, as far as regards the bonds and notes, is to give them to her absolutely, and this is not affected by the next clause: \u201c Also, all my personal estate, whatsoever will be left after my decease, to have -and to hold the same during her natural lifetime,\u201d particularly when taken in connection with the next clause but one, enlarging her interest in all the personal estate in these words: \u201c I also give my wife power and liberty, after my death, to do with all my property whatsoever she pleases:\u201d In re Maxwell\u2019s Will, 24 <em>Beavan </em>246.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">As the balance in the hands of the accountant consists practically of the proceeds of .the bonds and notes thus bequeathed to his intestate, or of the bonds and notes themselves, it is unnecessary to go further than to say, that by the terms of the will, these became the absolute property of the testator\u2019s widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The court below were therefore wrong, and the auditor was right; and the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court must he reversed, and a decree entered in conformity to the report of the auditor distributing the balance in the hands of the accountant among the legal representatives of Elizabeth Wickert.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Decree of Orphans\u2019 Court reversed, and the report of the auditor distributing the balance in the hands of the accountant among the legal representatives of Elizabeth Wickert confirmed, and decree entered in accordance therewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
