J.) delivered the following charge to the jury : \u2014 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-13\">\u201c The plaintiffs claim the land in dispute, by the following title: Warrant to Samuel Painter, 4th February 1794, survey 12th November 1794, made by Alexander, McLean, deputy-surveyor, for 400 acres. The purchase-money was paid by James Wilson. Judgments were obtained against James Wilson; and this tract (amongst others) levied on, as lying in Fayette county, and sold to Alexander McLean, to whom a deed was duly executed and acknowledged, 4th May 1799. Alexander McLean and wife conveyed by deed to Andrew Stewart, 5th October 1824; and Andrew Stewart and wife sold and conveyed to these plaintiffs, 28th August 1854. By these deeds and proceedings, the title became vested in the plaintiffs, and they will be entitled to your verdict; unless the defendants have satisfied you that the land, at the time of the sale, lay in Somerset county, instead of Fayette, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>or that they have title by statute of limitations. The plaintiffs have introduced in evidence the records of the treasurer\u2019s office of Fayette county, showing that this land was sold for taxes in that county, and purchased'by Stewart; but it is not necessary to advert to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-6\">\u201cThe recovery is resisted on two grounds: 1. That the land lay in Somerset county, and therefore no title passed by the judicial sales : 2. Adverse possession for twenty-one years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-7\">\u201cIn 1773, an Act of Assembly was passed establishing a line between what was then Bedford and Westmoreland counties; and in 1795, when Somerset county was erected, the line of 1773 became its western boundary. The language of the act is as follows, viz.: \u00a3 That all and singular the lands lying within the province of Pennsylvania, and being within the boundaries following, that is to say, beginning in the province line, where the most westerly branch, commonly called the South or Great Branch of Youghiogheny river, crosses the same, then down the easterly side of the said branch and river to the Laurel Hill, .thence along the ridge of said hill, north-eastward so far as it can be traced,, or until it runs into the Allegheny hill.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9D\">\u201c By an Act of Assembly passed in 1844, two commissioners were appointed to run the line between the counties of Somerset and Fayette. The commissioners made a line in pursuance of the act, and it is said, that by this line the land in dispute is within Somerset county. In settling this part of the controversy between these parties, the jury must be governed by the line that existed at the time of the judicial sale. As far as we are informed, that was the one created by the Act of 1773, and if it embraced the land in Fayette county, the judicial sale was valid and conveyed a good title, no matter that afterwards the line was so changed as to throw tbe land into Somerset county. In our judgment, the line did not extend, by the act, down the stream to the centre of the main ridge of the mountain, but it was intended to go down to the mountain, thence up the first .ridge into the main ridge of the hill; and if the jury, from the evidence, believe that a line thus run would place this land on the west or Fayette side, their verdict must be for the plaintiffs, .unless the title was lost by the adverse holding of defendants and those under whom they claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-9\">\u201c It is admitted, that the defendants are on this survey, and they claim to have title to it by statute of limitations. It is in evidence, that Moon went on the land in 1825, and remained there until his death, some eight or ten years ago, and that the possession has been kept up until the present land was cleared and cultivated, and houses erected. It does not clearly appear how far the improvements extended. . If Moon had established his lines as an improver, and held up to these boundaries for twenty-one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>years, the law would have protected him to that extent. But in this case, by the defendants\u2019 own showing, the lines of Moon\u2019s claim were not run and marked until fifteen years ago. If this is believed, the improver and those who hold his title can only hold that portion of the land which was cultivated and enclosed for twenty-one years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">\u201cBut the possession, as against the owners of the warrant, must not only have been adverse and hostile, but uninterrupted during the whole period. If the owner, or his agents, made an entry on the land under claim of right, such entry would toll the statute; and, to make out the case, the defendants and those under whom they claim, must have had the possession the requisite period, either before or after such entry. If you believe the evidence, Mr. Stewart had his agent on this land, running the boundaries in the year 1840, and the agent testified that whilst he and others were surveying the tract, Moon was in company during part of the time, and said that he held under Stewart, and that Stewart\u2019s title was good against the- world. If this is believed, it was such an entry as tolled the statute. The improver held fifteen years before this entry, and seventeen years thereafter. But even if you believe that Moon, and those who hold his claim, have had the adverse and uninterrupted possession of part of the land for the statutory period, the defence .cannot be sustained to that part, unless the defendants.have furnished you with such evidence as will enable you to set it off to them. Yery little evidence has been given as to the <em>extent </em>or <em>shape </em>of the improvements, and no draft thereof has been produced. W'e submit the questions of fact to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">\u201c Answer to the points submitted by the defendants\u2019 counsel.\u2014 We repeat again that in settling this question the jury must he governed by the line of 1773; if it differs from the one made in 1844. If, by the old line, the land lay in Somerset county, the judicial sale conveyed no title to the purchaser; but if in Fayette county, the proceedings were legal; and the subsequent change of the line, and consequent change of the position of the land, did not in the least affect the plaintiffs\u2019 title under the sale. John Hanna, one of the commissioners that ran the line in 1844, testified that they did not know of the existence of the Act of 1773, and were not governed by it, hut that they made the line according to their own judgments, and that they occasionally varied their running to suit the wishes of persons residing along the route. Some of the witnesses say that the old line lay on the other side of the tract, whilst others are clear that it is a mile on this side. The surveyor that located the warrant returned it as lying in Fayette, where it was taxed from 1794. Mr. Colborn says that the residents on the land voted in this county. It is for the jury to determine the location of the land, from all the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>dence in the case, and if it was in Fayette by the line of 1773, then the judicial proceedings gave a valid title to the purchaser; and if it was never divested, the plaintiffs must have your verdict. The only effect of the change, by the Act of 1844, is to justify the plaintiffs in bringing this action in this county instead of Fayette.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-6\">To this charge the defendants excepted; and a verdict and judgment having been rendered for the plaintiffs, the defendants sued out this writ, and here assigned for error: 1. That the court erred in not instructing the jury, as a matter of law, that the \u25a0 ridge of the Laurel Hill was its highest point or crest: 2. That the court erred in submitting to the jury, as a matter of fact, where the line between the two counties was.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-7\"><em>Hugus </em>and <em>Baer, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_l\">It has been decided in Beale <em>v. </em>Patterson, 3 <em>W. \u00a7 S. </em>379, that no common usage or assent of the. authorities of two counties can alter a legal dividing line, so as to affect title to land. If the doctrine was good in that case, much more should it prevail here, when usage and common understanding for the last seventy years,'\u25a0before- the county of Somerset was organized, assert, with one voice, that this land was never within the limits of Fayette county. All the witnesses agree, that if the summit of Laurel Hill is the boundary mentioned in the Acts of Assembly between the two counties, then this land must be not less than one mile east of the county line, and within the county of Somerset. Such being the case, the title of the plaintiffs, being derived from sheriff\u2019s and treasurer\u2019s sales in the county of Fayette, is of no value, as every act done by these officers was beyond their jurisdiction. Should the position of the plaintiffs below be correct, that this land was in the county of Fayette at the time these sales took place, upon which their title is founded, then the land is yet in the county of Fayette; for all the evidence shows that the line has never been changed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-8\"><em>Forward </em>&amp; <em>Graither, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APh\">There was conflicting evidence as to the line dividing the two counties, which could only be settled by the jury, to whom it was properly referred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-9\">From 1773\u2019to 1844, there was no line between these counties marked on the ground, and within that time the Commonwealth granted this land as situate in Fayette county; and that title is vested in the plaintiffs below by sales made by the sheriffs and treasurers of that county. . Neither the Commonwealth nor any one claiming under her, is objecting to the regularity of these proceedings. The defendants below claimed under one, who, it was admitted, was a mere trespasser: Troutman <em>v. </em>May, 9 <em>Casey </em>460. Even if this survey was made out of the proper district of the sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>veyor, it is now binding and valid: Wright <em>v. </em>Wells, 1 <em>Yeates </em>286; Harris <em>v. </em>Monks, 2 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>560; Creek <em>v. </em>Moon, 7 <em>Id. </em>331; Goddard <em>v. </em>Gloninger, 5 <em>Watts </em>220; Vastbinder <em>v. </em>Wager, 6 <em>Barr </em>346.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b428-7\">Lowrie, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvT\">The objection to the charge of the court is, that it does not define the line \u201c along the ridge of the said hill\u201d as meaning, along its crest or highest part; and that it left the location of the county line to the jury. But however the court might have defined the line, we do not see how they could have avoided leaving to the jury the application of the definition to the ground. The definition of county lines is of course matter of public law, and as such must be interpreted by the court; but the jury alone can find the facts that give it a practical application in actions of ejectment for the trial of private rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">It is quite manifest, that the meaning of the law fixing the line was long in doubt; and we cannot say, that the court was bound to give it an interpretation derived from its language alone, and without any reference- to the actual public interpretation which it had received during\u2019three-quarters of a century. We cannot say, under the evidence, that the court put an erroneous interpretation on it. Long-established public regulations ought not to be disturbed by logical or philological criticisms of original principles. The county line ought -to be recognised as being where it was generally -understood to be, and not where we would now place it, if we had now to apply the law for the first time. We can best ascertain where the true line was, by looking to the public practice relative to it, in connexion with the levying of taxes, selecting jurors, serving process by sheriffs and constables, elections, official surveys, and such like matters. More of such evidence would have been better here.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
