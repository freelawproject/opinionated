The parties agreed upon a case stated, in which the following facts were submitted for the opinion of the court, with leave to either party to sue out a writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-14\">Johnston Williamson died in May 1859, leaving a large amount of real and personal property; and by his will, of which he appointed John T. Green and Adam Coover the executors, he provided as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-15\">\u201cAnd further, I give and bequeath unto my son Francis G. the one-seventh of my estate, in trust for the following purposes and uses, to wit, that he shall possess, hold, and manage the same during his natural life, and out of the profits thereof, from time to time, to make such investments or purchase such property real or personal for the same uses and purposes and trusts, to wit, for the use of such child or children as the said Francis may have lawfully begotten at the time of his death, and if he should die without issue, then for the use of such person or persons as shall be my heirs at law at that time. And if the said Francis G. should at any time deem it advisable and useful for the purposes of the trust hereby created, that the said property hereby bequeathed should be invested in any business or enterprise, he is hereby authorized and empowered to do so, and to commence, conduct, and carry on such business or enterprise for the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>of the trust, as he may deem most advantageous, subjecting the estate hereby bequeathed or its proceeds or investments to such debts only as shall be contracted in the execution of the trust; and in consideration that my son Francis G. Williamson shall and will undertake and continue to execute personally and perform the trust hereby committed to him, he shall be allowed a reasonable support out of the trust fund for his personal services rendered. I desire that it shall be understood, that it is not because of the want of any confidence which I might have in my son Francis G. that I make no bequest absolutely to him, but it is because I desire to provide against my bounty to his children, and my heirs, being appropriated to those debts which he contracted in an unfortunate business.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-5\">On the 26th August 1857, the plaintiffs, William H. Brown &amp; Co., obtained a judgment against Francis G. Williamson for $645.15, upon which the attachment in this case was issued. Francis G. Williamson was a married man; and had a wife and children living at the time of the service .of the attachment, as well as before and at the time of making his father\u2019s will. He was then, and for many years before his father\u2019s death, had been insolvent. It was agreed, that if the court should be of opinion that the property bequeathed by the foregoing clause of Johnston Williamson\u2019s will, vested in his son, so as to make it subject to levy and sale, by execution or attachment, for the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs, otherwise for the garnishees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-6\">The court below (Graham, P. J.) gave judgment for the garnishees, on the case stated, and delivered the following opinion:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-7\">\u201c The question submitted arises under the will of Johnston Williamson, deceased, in which he bequeaths to his son Francis G. Williamson, the one-seventh part of his estate, in trust for certain uses and purposes mentioned and particularly designated in said will. The legacy thus given to Francis G. Williamson, in trust, &amp;c., has been attached by his creditors, in the hands of the executors, and the question presented is, whether under the will of the testator, this legacy can be attached by the creditors of Francis G. Williamson. The language used by testator ih this case in creating the trust, is identical with that used by the testator in Ashhurst <em>v. </em>Given, 5 <em>W. S. </em>330.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-8\">\u201c We discover nothing in subsequent cases tending to impair the authority of this case, and that of Holdship <em>v. </em>Patterson, 7 <em>Watts </em>547. On the contrary, these cases are mentioned in terms of commendation and approved in subsequent cases. In Norris <em>v. </em>Johnston, 5 <em>Barr </em>289, the court say, in reference to the ruling in Holdship <em>v. </em>Patterson, and Ashhurst <em>v. </em>Given, \u2018 The kindliest feelings of our nature are sanctioned, by enabling a benefactor to provide for an unfortunate and improvident person, by means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>which are his own, and which he ought to be permitted to apply as he pleases, for the support of those whose appeal to him is but the voice of nature softened by infirmity or misfortune.\u2019 Again, in Eyrick and Deppen <em>v. </em>Hetrick, 1 <em>Harris </em>491, it is said in a case similar to the present, \u2018 The fact that the conveyance was made to assume the form of a trust, and for the special purpose of keeping John\u2019s creditors at bay, makes nothing against its validity, so far as the latter are concerned, for neither policy nor equity prohibits a parent to make such provision for the maintenance and comfort of an insolvent child. On the contrary, these trusts are favoured and sustained by the law, as suggested by the best feelings of our nature, and doing harm to no one.\u2019 See also Mathews <em>v. </em>Stephenson, 6 <em>Barr </em>496.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">\u201c Thus we find' the principle ruled in Holdship and Patterson, and Ashhurst and Given, has become a rule of property, and is not only sanctioned, but eulogized and commended in subsequent cases, as suggested by the kindliest and best feelings of our nature. The clause of the testator\u2019s will in this case, creating the trust, is copied or identical with the clause in the will of James Given, which was ruled in Ashhurst <em>v. </em>Given, to protect the bounty of testator from the creditors of his son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-6\">\u201cTo overrule Ashhurst <em>v. </em>Given and the subsequent cases cited, would be to unsettle rules and legal principles hitherto considered confirmed beyond doubt or cavil, and justly impair public confidence in the stability of the tenure by which we all hold our estates and possessions. We direct judgment to be entered for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-7\">The garnishees, thereupon, sued out this writ, and here assigned the same for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-8\">Henderson, <em>Newsham, </em>and <em>W. H. Miller, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGQ\">The bequest in Johnston Williamson\u2019s will is not a trust, but an absolute gift to Francis G. Williamson. The whole beneficial interest is given to him for life: <em>Hill on Trustees </em>55; <em>Smith on Executory Interests </em>216; Bush\u2019s Appeal, 9 <em>Casey </em>87-8. The case of Ashhurst <em>v. </em>Given, 5 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>329, cannot be supported as law; and the morality of it is inconsistent with that of later decisions: Keeney <em>v. </em>Good, 9 <em>Harris </em>354.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-9\">This case differs from Ashhurst <em>v. </em>Given, in this respect, that there the alleged trust was sought to be impressed on real estate, here the property is converted into personalty by the will of the testator, and the right to the enjoyment of personal property always accompanies the right of property: 2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>389; Martin <em>v. </em>Mathiot, 14 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>214. It is clear, under the authorities, that the bequest to Francis G. Williamson does not constitute him a trustee: Gilbert <em>v. </em>Chapin, 19 <em>Conn. </em>342; Hunter <em>v. </em>Steinbridge, 12 Ga. 194; Gibbs <em>v. </em>Marsh, 3 <em>Met. </em>243; Lucas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>v. </em>Lockhart, 19 <em>Sm.

H. </em>232; Jackson <em>v. </em>Jackson, 2 <em>Barr </em>212; Mitchells <em>v. </em>Johnson, 6 <em>Leigh </em>461; Harper <em>v. </em>Phelps, 21 <em>Conn. </em>270; Lillard <em>v. </em>Robinson, 3 <em>Litt. </em>415; Burbank <em>v. </em>Whitney, 24 <em>Pick. </em>146; Ellis <em>v. </em>Ellis, 15 <em>Ala. </em>296; McKonkey\u2019s Appeal, 1 <em>Harris </em>258; Pennock\u2019s Estate, 8 <em>Id. </em>268; <em>Williams on Personal Property </em>291, note 1; Kuhn <em>v. </em>Newman, 2 <em>Casey </em>231-2; 7 <em>Harris </em>372; 9 <em>Casey </em>85; 11 <em>Harris </em>29; 8 <em>Id. </em>302; Rowland <em>v. </em>Morgan, 13 <em>Jurist </em>23; 2 <em>Phillips </em>763.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-5\">The Act of 18th April 1853, \u00a7 9 <em>(Brightly\u2019s Purd. </em>701),. forbids such a trust for accumulation, for the benefit of children, and vests it absolutely in Francis G. Williamson: Hillyard <em>v. </em>Miller, 10 <em>Barr </em>335.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-6\"><em>Sharpe </em>and <em>L. Todd, </em>for the defendants in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atm\">cited and relied on the eases of Holdship <em>v. </em>Patterson, 7 <em>Watts </em>547; Ashhurst <em>v. </em>Given, 5 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>323; Norris <em>v. </em>Johnston, 5 <em>Barr </em>289; and Eyrick <em>v. </em>Hetrick, 1 <em>Harris </em>491.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b341-8\">Strong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anf\">The judgment of the court below is sustained by the doctrine held in Holdship <em>v. </em>Patterson, 7 <em>Watts </em>547, and in Ashhurst <em>v. </em>Given, 5 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>323. The latter of these cases can in no essential particular be distinguished from the present. From the principles recognised in them, there never has been any disposition in this court to depart. They have been approved in Norris <em>v. </em>Johnston, 5 <em>Barr </em>289, and in Eyrick and Deppen <em>v. v. </em>Hetrick, 1 <em>Harris </em>491.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The attempt to apply to this ease the doctrine of Williams <em>v. </em>Leech, 4 <em>Casey </em>89, is futile, for the very sufficient reason, that here is no particular estate. There is no beneficial interest vested in Francis G. Williamson.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Nor is the case affected by the Act of April 18th 1853: <em>Purdon\u2019s Big. </em>page 701; sec. 9. The trust indeed may be transgressive, but even under the Ripon Act, 39 &amp; 40 Geo. 3, eh. 98, in England, the excess only beyond the period allowed for trusts of accumulation is void. They are sustained for the statutory period. Our Act of 1853 was modelled after the Ripon Act, and it avoids only the excess in transgressive trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
