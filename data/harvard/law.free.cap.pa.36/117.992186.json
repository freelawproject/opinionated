A case was stated for the opinion of the court, in which the following facts were embodied:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-12\">Andrew Burgett, being seised of certain real estate in Washington county, by his will devised as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-13\">\u201c I give and bequeath to my son, Boston Burgett, all the right and title to all my real estate, and also all my personal property that is not otherwise disposed of; the real estate to be enjoyed by my said son during his natural life, and at his deceasp, to descend to his legitimate offspring for ever; but in case said Boston\u2019s issue becomes extinct, I will to Boston Burgett Smith, and his heirs, and Matilda Pyles, daughter of Polly McCarty, and her heirs, all my real estate for ever, to be equally divided between said Smith and Pyles; but in case my son Boston\u2019s wife should survive him, then it is my will, that she, the said wife, receive annually the one-third of the net proceeds of my farms during her natural life.\u201d On the 20th May 1848, Boston Burgett, by deed to bar the entail, conveyed the land to John S. Brady, who, on the same day, reconveyed the same to Boston Burgett ip fee. The property was afterwards .taken in execution as the property of Boston Burgett, and sold by the sheriff of Washington county to Jacob P. Markle, the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-14\">On the 18th May 1859, the plaintiff, by articles of agreement, sold a portion of the premises to John M. Allen, the defendant; and $1000 of the purchase-money was due at the institution of this suit, for the recovery of which the action was brought. The defence was, that the plaintiff had not a good and sufficient title in fee simple. It was admitted, that if Boston Burgett took an estate tail in the land, under his father\u2019s will, the plaintiff\u2019s title was good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The court below (Gilmore, P.

The intention to give but a life estate is apparent from the terms of the will; and the intention of the testator must govern unless .it violate some known rule of law: <em>Findlay v. </em>Riddle, 3 <em>Binn. </em>139; Stump <em>v. </em>Findlay, 2 <em>Rawle </em>168; Bennett <em>v. </em>Morris, 5 <em>Id. </em>9; Abbott <em>v. </em>Jenkins, 10 <em>S. &amp; B. </em>296; Dunwoodie <em>v. </em>Reed, 3 <em>Id. </em>435; 2 <em>Jarman on Wills </em>331, 333, 350; 6 <em>Harris </em>77; Stehman <em>v. </em>Stehman, 1 <em>Watts </em>474.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-7\"><em>MoKennan, Acheson, </em>and <em>Willson, </em>for the defendant in error.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMJ\">The word offspring imports' descendants; it is convertible with issue; and is <em>nomen collectivum: </em>Denn <em>v. </em>Puckey, 5 <em>T.

The particular intention of the testator is con-, trolled by the rule of law. It is an estate tail in Boston Burgett: Middleswarth <em>v. </em>Collins, 1 <em>Phila.

The rule in Shelly\u2019s case is an established rule of property in Pennsylvania. At this late day, it would be useless to attempt to vindicate it, or reply to the.oft-repeated objection that it defeats the particular intent of the donor or testator. It is sufficient for us, that the rule is too deeply seated to be overthrown by judicial decision. The devise in this will is directly within the rule. The testator gives his real estate to his son \u201c during his natural life, and at his decease to descend to his legitimate offspring for ever.\u201d He then directs that \u201c in case the said Boston\u2019s <em>issue </em>becomes extinct, the land shall go over to devisees named in the will.\u201d The words \u201c legitimate offspring\u201d and \u201cissue\u201d are used interchangeably as having the same meaning, and if he had not defined the term \u201c offspring,\u201d the law has, in repeated instances. It is regarded as <em>nomen eolleetivum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Offspring then is a word of limitation, not of purchase. Those embraced in its meaning take by descent through Boston Burgett, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>not as primary objects of the testator\u2019s bounty. Of course the estate of the first taker was an estate tail, and it having been barred under the Act of Assembly, the plaintiff below had a title in fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
