SUMMARY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This country was born with a declaration of universal human rights, proclaiming that: \"all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,\" and that \"among these\" is \"Liberty.\" U.S.C.A. Declaration of Independence (177 6). This concept was codified in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states in part that \"no person shall be ... deprived of ... liberty ... without due process of the law.\" U.S. Const. Amend. V. As the Supreme Court has written, \"[f]reedom from imprisonment-from government custody, detention, or other forms of physical restraint-lies at the heart of the liberty that Clause protects.\"\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    533 U.S. 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 690,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). As the words \"no person\" indicate, and as the Supreme Court has confirmed, \"the Due Process Clause applies to all 'persons' within the United States whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The United States has historically been distinguished by its dedication to treating lawfully and fairly all among us, including aliens who are in the country illegally. However, as Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis observed, in each generation we \"must labor to possess that which [we] have inherited.\" Paul Freund, \"Mr. Justice Brandeis,\" in\n   <em>\n    On Law and Justice\n   </em>\n   at 119\n   (1968). These cases are a reminder that Justice Brandeis was right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Lucimar De Souza, a Brazilian national, entered the United States unlawfully in 2002. She alleges that she did not receive notice of the hearing to determine whether she should be deported from the United States. In any event, in June 2002, De Souza was ordered to leave the country and did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Eduardo Junqueira, who was also born in Brazil, entered the United States unlawfully in 2004. He was apprehended and deported later that year. Junqueira soon reentered the United States unlawfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2006, De Souza married a United States citizen. They have an 11-year old son who is a United States citizen. Junqueira also married a United States citizen. They have two children, ages 10 and 12, who are United States citizens. Neither De Souza nor Junqueira has ever violated any law other than by entering and remaining in the United States illegally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   De Souza and Junqueira present the United States with dilemmas. As generous as the United States has traditionally been in admitting immigrants and refugees, it cannot accommodate everyone who aspires to live here. Therefore, its immigration laws must be enforced. However, the country also has a strong interest in not destroying families by deporting the wives, husbands, mothers, and fathers of United States citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To reconcile these competing interests, the United States has established a process for determining whether aliens in the country illegally should be allowed to remain here with their families and become lawful Permanent Residents. The first step in that process requires the alien to prove to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"CIS\"), an agency of the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), that his or her marriage is bona fide, rather than a sham to obtain immigration benefits. Both De Souza and Junqueira have attempted to utilize this process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 30, 2018, at a scheduled appointment at a CIS office, De Souza and her husband were found to have a genuine marriage. De Souza was, however, immediately arrested there by another agency of DHS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"). Similarly, on February 1, 2018, Junqueira and his wife were at a CIS office for a scheduled interview concerning their marriage. Before the interview began, ICE arrested Junqueira.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   De Souza and Junquiera each filed petitions for habeas corpus asserting they are being detained by ICE in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States, and seeking an order directing ICE to release them. De Souza is also attempting to represent a putative class in challenging the authority of ICE to arrest aliens at CIS offices and, wherever they are arrested, to deport them before CIS decides whether to grant them provisional waivers that would allow them to seek to remain in the United States with their families.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Federal law also creates a process for determining whether aliens like De Souza and Junqueira, who have been ordered removed, should be detained while the government attempts to effectuate their removal. A federal statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), requires that an alien ordered removed from the United States be detained for up to 90 days, ordinarily starting on the date the order becomes final. These 90 days are defined by the statute as the \"removal period.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1231(a)(1). ICE must give an alien notice and an opportunity to be heard before detaining him or her for longer than 90 days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.4\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the time of the May 8, 2018 hearing in these cases,\n   ICE had detained De Souza and Junqueira for more than 90 days without following the process prescribed by its regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ICE initially argued that the regulations do not apply to De Souza, and that they had not been violated with respect to Junqueira. ICE subsequently acknowledged that the regulations do apply and, even on its interpretation, which may be incorrect, the regulations were violated in each case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 8, 2018 Tr. at 15-18, 22-25, 35-36. However, ICE contends that the court does not have the power to provide a remedy for the unlawful detention of an alien who has not been in custody for at least six months. ICE relies on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   in making this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ICE's argument is unmeritorious. The Fifth Amendment guarantee of due process has two components. The substantive component prohibits restrictions on liberty that are not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, no matter what process is employed in deciding to impose them. In addition, a person who is detained has a right to procedural due process, meaning a right to a fair process for challenging the reasons for detention. Fundamental features of procedural due process are fair notice of the reasons for the possible loss of liberty and a meaningful opportunity to address them.\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   addressed the substantive due process component of the Fifth Amendment. The Supreme Court held, in effect, that an alien's right to substantive due process could be violated by prolonged detention even if the alien's right to procedural due process had been satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    533 U.S. at 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Implicitly assuming that the alien had been afforded procedural due process, the Court found that detention of an alien for up to six months is presumptively reasonable for the purpose of the substantive due process analysis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   However, as Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in his dissent in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   , without dispute from the majority, \"[w]ere the [DHS], in an arbitrary or categorical manner, to deny an alien access to the administrative processes in place to review continued detention, habeas jurisdiction would lie to redress the due process violation caused by the denial of the mandated procedures ...\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    at 724-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Justice Kennedy's position was a particular application of a long line of Supreme Court and other decisions holding that regulations are laws that the government must obey. In the \"McCarthy era,\" the Supreme Court held that having issued regulations delegating to the Board of Immigration Appeals (the \"BIA\") the discretion to decide whether an alien should be deported, the Attorney General could not dictate the BIA's decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Accardi v. Shaughnessy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300336\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/260/\">\n    347 U.S. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300336\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/347/260/\">\n    74 S.Ct. 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 502-04,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20L.%20Ed.%20681\">\n    98 L.Ed. 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1954). During the \"Watergate\" era, the Attorney General issued regulations delegating to a Special Prosecutor the authority to conduct investigations relating to the 1972 election of President Richard Nixon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Nixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n    418 U.S. 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 694-96,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n    94 S.Ct. 3090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n    41 L.Ed.2d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974). This authority included the power to issue subpoenas and to seek judicial enforcement of them, including by contesting any assertion of Executive Privilege.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n    at 694-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n    94 S.Ct. 3090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The President claimed that he had the unreviewable power to assert that privilege and refuse to comply with the Special Prosecutor's subpoena for tapes the President secretly made in the Oval Office.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n    at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n    94 S.Ct. 3090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court rejected this claim, holding that the regulation had \"the force of law,\" the \"Executive Branch [was] bound by it,\" and the Court was \"bound to respect and enforce it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n    at 695, 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n    94 S.Ct. 3090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finding\n   that the subpoena was properly issued and that the Executive Privilege did not provide a basis to quash it, the Court ordered the President to comply with the subpoena.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n    at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p694\">\n    94 S.Ct. 3090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The predecessor to DHS, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\"), issued regulations that were expressly intended to provide all aliens the due process that is constitutionally required before deciding whether their detention should be continued following the initial 90-day removal period. ICE now argues that those regulations provide that any alien ordered removed can later be detained for 90 days before his or her custody is reviewed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 8, 2018 Tr. at 15. It acknowledges that the alien and his or her attorney must be given notice of that custody review 30 days in advance to afford them the opportunity to provide information in support of the alien's release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.4\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (3), (h) (2). ICE has a duty to obey these regulations even if they provide greater protection than is constitutionally required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nelson v. INS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11152542\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/232/258/#p262\">\n    232 F.3d 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262 (1st Cir. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As indicated earlier, it is undisputed that neither De Souza nor Junquiera were provided the process required under ICE's interpretation of the regulations and, the court finds, by the Fifth Amendment. Indeed, ICE made no effort to follow the process prescribed by its regulations until alerted to issues raised in the litigation of these cases. As De Souza was arrested and detained on January 30, 2018, she was entitled to a custody review no later than about April 30, 2018, and to notice of it to her attorney and her by about March 30, 2018. Instead De Souza, but not her attorney, was given a notice on April 23, 2018 of a custody review to be conducted on or about April 30, 2018. On April 27, 2018, the ICE Deputy Field Office Director decided to continue De Souza's detention before her attorneys had an opportunity to provide information in support of her release. In the notice of that decision, the Deputy Field Office Director represented that De Souza had been personally interviewed. However, De Souza was never interviewed. The Acting Field Office Director subsequently filed a sworn declaration stating, falsely, that De Souza had received notice seven days before her custody review. A May 1, 2018 hearing in these cases evidently prompted ICE to recognize that it had violated its regulations in continuing to detain De Souza. It then decided to conduct another custody review 30 days later and to continue to deprive De Souza of her liberty at least until that review occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Junqueira was arrested on February 1, 2018 and, therefore, was entitled to a custody review no later than about May 1, 2018. Neither Junqueira nor his attorney received notice that any such review had been scheduled. Again, evidently alerted to ICE's unlawful conduct by the litigation in these cases, on May 3, 2018, the Acting and Deputy Field Office Directors decided that Junqueira would be released that day. However, after being contacted by an ICE lawyer, the Acting Field Office Director reversed that decision. ICE subsequently issued a notice that Junqueira would receive a custody review on about June 3, 2018, which would have deprived him too of his liberty at least until that review was conducted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As indicated earlier, with regard to both De Souza and Junqueira, ICE argues that this court lacks the authority to order a remedy for its unlawful conduct. However, as the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus proceedings provide a forum for statutory and constitutional challenges to post-removal detention.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    533 U.S. at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The presumption created by\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   , that up to six months of detention is reasonable, is based on the assumption that ICE followed the process prescribed by its regulations to ensure that continued detention was justified. This assumption is not true for either De Souza or Junqueira. As of May 8, 2018, ICE was detaining each of them in violation of its regulations and without the \"due process of law\" required by the Fifth Amendment. Therefore, each is entitled to judicial relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Habeas corpus is an equitable remedy. The court has the discretion to fashion relief that is fair in the circumstances, including to order an alien's release. In view of ICE's repeated violations of its regulations-and its indifference to its duty to obey the law-it would not now be fair to keep De Souza or Junqueira incarcerated for another 30 days. Therefore, the court will promptly decide if either or both should be released pending possible deportation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ICE's illegal actions concerning De Souza and Junqueira have had profound human consequences that would continue without the court's intervention. It appears likely that De Souza and Junqueira will each be able to prove that if released, they will not be dangerous or flee and, therefore, that each will be entitled to release. Each will nevertheless still face the threat of being deported and separated from their families. Each day with their families is now particularly precious. Any unjustified loss of liberty for even another day would be a painful form of irreparable harm to them and to the United States citizens who love them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   If accepted, ICE's argument that the court lacks the power to grant petitioners relief in these cases would deeply damage the Constitution's system of checks and balances that, as intended by the nation's Founders, has been fundamental to protecting the rights of every person-citizens as well as aliens. As the Supreme Court reminded in the case of a prisoner detained at Guantanamo, the writ of habeas corpus gives the \"Judiciary ... a time-tested device ... to maintain the delicate balance of governance that is itself the surest safeguard of liberty\" and \"protects the rights of the detained by [conferring] the duty and authority on the Judiciary to call the jailor to account.\"\n   <em>\n    Boumediene v. Bush\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674039\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/723/#p745\">\n    553 U.S. 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 745,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674039\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/723/#p745\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674039\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/723/#p745\">\n    171 L.Ed.2d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The unlawful treatment of De Souza and Junqueira occurred in cases that ICE knew would be subject to scrutiny by a federal judge. This suggests that other aliens who do not have lawyers to file suit on their behalf are also being illegally deprived of their liberty and irreparably harmed by being separated from their families before possibly being deported. The effort by De Souza and others to maintain her case as a class action to enjoin an alleged pattern of unlawful conduct by ICE presents these issues.

The observations of the judicious Blackstone ... are well worthy of recital: 'To bereave a man of life ... or by violence to confiscate his estate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and therefore a\n   <em>\n    more dangerous engine\n   </em>\n   of arbitrary government.'

Therefore, at a May 5, 2017 hearing on Arriaga's motion for a temporary restraining order, this court indicated it was likely to decide that ICE violated its regulations and allow the motion. During a break, before the court announced its final decision, ICE agreed to release Arriaga and to allow him to stay in the United States until CIS processed his application for a waiver.

It did not. On April 27, 2018, ICE decided to continue De Souza's detention before she had an opportunity to provide information in support of her release. It then made a series of false or misleading statements concerning that decision. When ICE finally recognized that it had violated \u00a7 241.4, characterizing the violation as an \"irregularit[y],\" ICE decided to belatedly give De Souza 30 days' notice of a custody review and to detain her at least until the review occurred on about June 3, 2018. Therefore, in essence, ICE decided that because it had acted unlawfully in violating its regulations, De Souza, who might be entitled to be released and to be reunited with her family before her possible deportation, should lose her liberty for at least another month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   ICE dealt with Junqueira in a comparable manner. Junqueira was arrested and detained on February 1, 2018. Therefore, under \u00a7 241.4 as now interpreted by ICE, Junqueira his attorney should have been given notice by April 1, 2018, that his custody would be reviewed on about May 1, 2018. No such notice was ever provided. Evidently recognizing this violation of the regulations, Rutherford and Brophy decided that Junqueira should be released on May 3, 2018. However, without any opportunity for Junqueira or his attorney to submit anything in favor of release, the decision to release him was reversed, and ICE decided to continue his detention until at least June 3, 2018. Once again, ICE decided that because it had acted unlawfully, an alien who might deserve to be released and reunited with his family before his possible deportation should be detained for at least another month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Respondents have at different times made different arguments for the lawfulness of ICE's conduct in detaining De Souza and Junqueira for more than three months without the notice and opportunity to be heard required by \u00a7 241.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   First, respondents asserted that \"[t]he Post Order custody Review Regulations [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.4\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] do not apply to Ms. De Souza\" because she had not been detained during her 90-day removal period.

On February 21, 2018, ICE Deputy Field Office Director Todd M. Lyons stated in an affidavit that ICE \"still [had] the authority to detain [De Souza's co-petitioner Lilian] Calderon,\" who had also not been detained during her removal period, \"without an individualized determination of dangerousness and risk of flight.\" Feb. 21, 2018 Lyons Decl.

In enacting \u00a7 1231, Congress contemplated that ICE might not discharge its duty to detain every alien within the removal period. Section 1231(a)(3), therefore, provides that \"[i]f the alien does not leave or is not removed within the removal period, the alien, pending removal, shall be subject to supervision under regulations prescribed by the [Secretary of Homeland Security].\" Section 241.4 is one of those regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   If, as respondents initially argued, aliens first detained after the removal period are never entitled to a custody review to determine whether they should be released, they would not be \"subject to supervision under [the] regulations prescribed by the [Secretary],\" which include \u00a7 241.4. ICE would, therefore, regularly and repeatedly be in violation of \u00a7 1231(a) (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In promulgating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.4\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , INS explained that all aliens, including aliens first detained following their removal period, would be eligible for possible release under \u00a7 241.4. More specifically, when it published \u00a7 241.4 in the Federal Register, INS stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   This rule establishes a permanent custody review procedure applying to aliens who are detained following expiration of\n   the 90-day removal period ...

If, as ICE initially claimed, \u00a7 241.4 authorizes the detention of aliens like De Souza, who are arrested after the expiration of their removal periods, without an individualized determination concerning their detention for up to six months, the regulation would likely be unconstitutional as applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Perhaps recognizing that it was legally untenable to continue to contend that ICE's failure to detain De Souza during her 90-day removal period gave it the unfettered discretion to later detain her for up to six months without notice and any opportunity to be heard, ICE changed its position. At the May 1, 2018 hearing, in its May 3, 2018 supplemental memorandum, and at the May 8, 2018 hearing, the respondents argued that \"the procedures in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.4\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   apply to petitioners,\" including De Souza and Junqueira, and that \"once an alien has been detained for 90 days under the post-order detention statute, they are entitled to a post-order custody review pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.4\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" Respondents' Response to Court's May 2, 2018 Order (Docket No. 55) at 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   May 1, 2018 Tr. at 30 (\"It's the government's position that after 90 days of being in detention, [De Souza] will receive all of the procedures available in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"); May 8, 2018 Tr. at 15. Therefore, ICE now concedes that it must review the detention of any alien, including aliens who were not detained during their removal period, but maintains that it is not required to do so until 90 days after the alien is arrested.

As described earlier, in enacting \u00a7 1231, Congress and the President anticipated that not all aliens ordered removed would be deported during the removal period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1231(a)(3) (referring to \"an alien\" who \"does not leave ... within the removal period\"). However, in promulgating \u00a7 241.4, INS evidently assumed that all aliens would be detained during the removal period. As explained earlier, the regulation applies to all aliens detained following the removal period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   65 Fed. Reg. at 80291. Yet, the regulation is entitled \"\n   <em>\n    Continued\n   </em>\n   detention of [certain] aliens beyond the removal period,\" suggesting that all aliens will have been detained within the removal period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). In addition, \u00a7 241.4(h)(2) and (k)(1)(i) require 30 days' notice \"to the detainee\" and an initial custody review \"prior to the expiration of the removal period.\" In cases in which an alien is not in custody during the removal period, it would not be possible to give timely notice and conduct a timely custody review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   However, ICE's current interpretation of the ambiguous regulation, giving it 90 days after arrest within which to conduct all custody reviews, is inconsistent with the regulation's express \"requirement that the review occur\n   <em>\n    prior to the expiration of the removal period\n   </em>\n   ,\" \u00a7 241.4(h) (2), (h) (1), (k) (2) (emphasis added), in the absence of exceptional circumstances,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 241.4(k)(2)(iv), (k)(3). The 90-day removal period runs from \"[t]he date the order [of removal] becomes administratively final,\" the date of a court's final disposition if the removal order is judicially reviewed, or \"the date the alien is released from [non-immigration] detention,\" whichever is latest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 241.4 (g) (1) (i) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (1) (B). The regulation does not state that the removal period runs from the date the alien is first detained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The regulation can be reasonably read in a manner that is consistent with its language and that would not require ICE to give aliens notice of a custody review before arresting and detaining them, while still affording these aliens due process. The regulations permit ICE to issue the 30-day notice and conduct the custody review \"as soon as possible [ ]after\" the removal period, \"allowing for any unforeseen circumstances or [an] emergent situation.\" \u00a7 241.4(k)(2)(iv). ICE could, consistent with this provision, give notice and decide whether detention is justified \"as soon as possible\" after the arrest of an alien who was not detained during his or her removal period.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This approach would also be consistent with the authority to postpone a custody review \"for good cause\" as long as \"reasonable care [is] exercised to ensure that the alien's case is reviewed once the reason for delay is remedied.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 241.4(k)(3). Therefore, for an alien arrested after the removal period like De Souza, it would be faithful to the language of \u00a7 241.4 to interpret the regulation as requiring notice promptly after arrest and a custody review approximately 30 days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   This interpretation of the regulation would not only be consistent with the language of \u00a7 241.4 (h)(1) and (k) (1) (i), it would also be reasonable. An alien who is detained after the expiration of the removal period, during which detention is mandatory, has not \"conspir[ed] or act[ed] to prevent [her] removal.\" \u00a7 1231(a) (1) (C). Indeed, ICE concedes De Souza has not done so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rutherford Aff., \u00b6 5 (stating that De Souza's detention \"is discretionary under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (6)\"). After the\n   expiration of an alien's removal period, there are good reasons not to automatically detain him or her for 90 days before considering the alien's release. As Judge David Barron has written, \"the more time an individual spends in the community, the lower her bail risk is likely to be, and the more probable it is that a fair custody review would result in her release.\"\n   <em>\n    Castaneda v.

This process precedes a full custody review conducted \"approximately three months after release is revoked.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/#p482\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 241.4(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(3). It would, therefore, be reasonable, and arguably constitutionally necessary, to interpret \u00a7 241.4 to require that an alien who is first detained after his or her removal period expires, and who will not be immediately removed, receive a prompt opportunity to demonstrate that \u00a7 1231(a)(6) and \u00a7 241.4, which address post-removal-period detention, do not authorize her detention. As explained earlier, \u00a7 1231(a)(6) and \u00a7 241.4 do not authorize detention after the removal period has expired if the alien will not be immediately removed and is not a flight risk or dangerous because detention would not be \"reasonably necessary to secure removal.\"\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    533 U.S. at 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.4\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)-(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   However, it is not now necessary to decide whether ICE's current interpretation of \u00a7 241.4 is correct. It is undisputed that ICE violated \u00a7 241.4 as it now interprets it with regard to both De Souza and Junqueira.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 8, 2018 Tr. at 15-18, 22-25, 35-36. Nevertheless, ICE continues to assert that the court does not have the authority to remedy those violations. As indicated earlier, respondents argued on April 23, 2018 that \"the Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   is the sole inquiry in cases like Ms. de Souza's and the alien Petitioners',\" and under\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   , \"detention pursuant to \u00a7 1231(a) (6) is presumptively reasonable for six-months, thereby making habeas petitions filed prior to the six-month mark not ripe for adjudication.\" Apr. 23, 2018 Opp. at 11. Respondents amplified this argument at the May 8, 2018 hearing, stating that \"the right implicated in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   is the right to detention that is connected with its purposes. And the purpose[ ] articulated in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   is to ensure the alien's presence at the time of removal. And that is the only right that this court has the authority to decide with regard to whether the detention is constitutional or not.\" May 8, 2018 Tr. at 31. Respondents assert that under\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   , post-removal-order detention lacks a reasonable connection with its purposes only when it becomes \"prolonged\" and \"removal isn't foreseeable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.4\">\n    at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, respondents argue, the court may not order relief for the detained alien as long as his or her removal is reasonably foreseeable and, in any event, not until the alien has spent at least six months in detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Respondents' contention is incorrect, however, because they fail to recognize the distinction between the substantive and procedural components of the Due Process Clause discussed earlier. Again, the \"substantive component ... forbids the government to infringe certain 'fundamental' liberty interests\n   <em>\n    at\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   , no matter what process is provided, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228898\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/292/#p301\">\n    507 U.S. at 301-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228898\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/292/#p301\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This would not be equitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   ICE has repeatedly demonstrated an inability to perform lawfully and to decide fairly whether detention is justified for either De Souza or Junquiera. Its indifference to its duty not to deprive aliens of liberty without due process is not unique to these cases. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206509344\">\n    2017 WL 6509344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (D. Mass. 2017) (Sorokin, D.J.), the court held that ICE's \"repeated errors suggesting negligence, incompetence or bad faith on the part of the agency ha[d] prolonged Doe's [deportation] proceedings and, thus, his detention.\" Among other things, ICE erroneously informed the Immigration Court that Doe had been released, and that a new bond hearing was not necessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. Therefore, the district court rejected ICE's argument that \"the only appropriate remedy was another bond hearing identical to the two [Doe] already had before the [Immigration Judge], which had been infected by ICE's misconduct,\" and ordered Doe's release.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8-9. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Rombot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523947\" index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/296/383/#p388\">\n    296 F.Supp.3d at 388-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court found that ICE had repeatedly failed to follow the procedures required by \u00a7 241.4 in detaining the petitioner, therefore violated his constitutional right to due process, and ordered that the petitioner be released.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D'Alessandro v. Mukasey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3708830\" index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/628/368/#p388\">\n    628 F.Supp.2d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 387-406 (W.D.N.Y. 2009) (finding ICE's failure to follow requirements of \u00a7 241.4 violated alien's right to procedural due process and ordering alien's release).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In view of the foregoing, it would not be appropriate to allow ICE to decide again whether De Souza's or Junquiera's detention should continue. It would be particularly unfair to require that petitioners remain detained for another 30 days while ICE attempts to remedy its failure to follow its regulations and to provide each of them due process. As explained earlier, both petitioners face the prospect of being deported and separated from their families. Each day with their families is, therefore, precious. Any unjustified loss of liberty for even one more day would be a particularly painful form of irreparable harm to them and to the United States citizens who love them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Furthermore, it appears likely that De Souza and Junqueira will each be able to persuade the court that they should be released under the standards in \u00a7 241.4(e) and (f). There is no evidence that ICE has obtained the documents necessary to deport either petitioner to Brazil. Therefore, their immediate removal does not appear possible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 241.4 (e) (1). It appears that if released, neither is likely to be a danger to the community because neither has a criminal history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 241.4(e) - (f). Nor does it appear that either is likely to flee. Among other factors, their \"ties to the United States,\" including \"close relatives residing here lawfully,\" appear to outweigh their \"prior immigration violations\" of having entered the United States unlawfully. \u00a7 241.4(f). In addition, both of them have lived in the United States for more than fourteen years, have spouses and children who are United States citizens, and seek to pursue lawful Permanent Resident status through a process prescribed by law. As indicated earlier, CIS's waiver process is designed to prevent \"extreme hardship\" to United States citizens that would result from the alien's inability to live with them in the United States and support them. Absconding or violating their conditions of release would seriously jeopardize De Souza's and Junqueira's chances of living in this country with their families.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   In these circumstances, it is most appropriate that the court exercise its equitable authority to remedy the violations of petitioners' constitutional rights to due process by promptly deciding itself whether each should be released.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 241.4(f) ;\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"325\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    533 U.S. at 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p690\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCarthy v.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court finds that De Souza and Junquiera are each being detained in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that the court should determine whether their continued detention is justified. Accordingly, on May 8, 2018, the court ALLOWED De Souza and Junqueira's Petitions for Writs of Habeas Corpus under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.A. No. 18-10225, Docket No. 27, and C.A. 18-10307, Docket No. 22) concerning their detention\n   and scheduled a bail hearing at which the court would decide whether they should be released. After this decision was announced in court on May 8, 2018, ICE released De Souza and Junqueira.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   As discussed at the May 8, 2018 hearing, ICE failed to follow the procedures required by \u00a7 241.4 and to provide petitioners with the due process the Constitution requires in these two cases, which ICE knew were subject to judicial scrutiny. This causes concern that ICE may be violating the rights of many other detained aliens who do not have counsel to file petitions for habeas corpus on their behalf in federal court. That concern may soon be addressed in the context of the claims in\n   <em>\n    Calderon\n   </em>\n   for class certification and preliminary injunction. However, at least some members of the class may suffer unjustified irreparable harm before these issues are decided, including by being deported without the opportunity to spend time with their families that they would have had if their constitutional right to due process had been respected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   At hearings on May 22 and 23, 2018, the court was informed that after the court issued its decisions regarding De Souza and Junqueira, ICE reviewed detainee files in the Burlington, Massachusetts Field Office, found 30 to 40 additional cases in which the \u00a7 241.4 procedures had not been followed, and released approximately 20 aliens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 22, 2018 Tr. at 86; May 23, 2018 Tr. at 51, 138. The court has not been informed of the status of the additional 10 to 20 aliens who were evidently also denied due process.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    After the court rendered this decision orally on May 8, 2018, ICE released De Souza and Junqueira.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    The statute refers to the Attorney General as the official exercising the authority to detain aliens subject to a final order of removal, and to adjudicate applications for immigration benefits.
