The Court has carefully considered the Motions [DEs 53, 69], Defendant's Responses [DEs 58, 64, 71, 72], Colony's Replies [DEs 63, 66], argument by counsel at the hearing on July 13, 2018, and the record herein. The Court is otherwise fully advised in the premises. For the reasons stated herein, Plaintiffs' Motions are granted and summary judgment is entered in favor of Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff issued Policy No. 103 GL 0011600-01 (\"the Policy\") to ARM Purchasing Group (\"ARM\") of Austin, Texas, covering the period from November 1, 2016, to November 1, 2017. \u00b6 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ARM is comprised\n   of similar businesses and entities that are exposed to similar liabilities, who have grouped together to purchase insurance. \u00b6 5. Courtyards HOA is one of the entities that purchased insurance through ARM. \u00b6 5. The Policy contains a Commercial General Liability Coverage Form, which provides coverage for bodily injuries and property damages that occur in the coverage territory and occur during the coverage period. \u00b6 6. According to the Policy, Plaintiff will have the right and duty to defend the Courtyards HOA against any \"suit\" seeking those damages. \u00b6 6. However, the Policy states that Plaintiff will have no duty to defend Courtyards HOA against any suit seeking damages for bodily injury or property damage to which the insurance does not apply. \u00b6 6. Notably, the Policy contains an exclusion entitled \"Total Pollution Exclusion\" (\"the Exclusion\") which includes a \"Building Heating, Cooling and Dehumidifying Equipment Exception\" (\"the Exception\"). \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ursula Maria Alvarez (\"Alvarez\"), rented a condominium unit (the \"Unit\") located in Broward County, Florida. \u00b6 12. Courtyards HOA was in control of all common elements for the Unit at all relevant times. \u00b6 13. On August 7, 2017, Alvarez and Jose E. Rodriguez Jr. (\"Rodriguez Jr.\"), who was either a co-tenant or invited guest, died from carbon monoxide poisoning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13,17. The carbon monoxide is believed to have come from a motor vehicle in the Unit's garage \u00b6 13. The carbon monoxide became airborne and seeped into the A/C ducts or vents, causing the carbon monoxide gas to be distributed to the second floor bedroom, where it was unknowingly inhaled by Alvarez and Rodriguez Jr., resulting in their deaths. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 17. Alvarez's mother, Luisa Antonia Guido (\"Guido\"), filed a wrongful death complaint (\"the State Complaint\") in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit, in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida, against Courtyards HOA and other defendants, identified as Case No.: 2017-026424-CA-01. \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 14, 2017, Colony, the insurer of Courtyards HOA, filed a Complaint [DE 1] against Guido, Courtyards HOA, and Steven Rodriguez (\"Rodriguez\"), the court-appointed personal representative of the estate of Rodriguez Jr., (collectively \"Defendants\") for declaratory relief. Colony seeks a judgment that it owes Courtyards HOA no duty to defend in the underlying state court action. Colony filed an Amended Complaint [DE 15] on January 25, 2018. Great American, who issued a Commercial Umbrella General Liability insurance policy (\"the Umbrella Policy to Courtyards HOA, filed an Intervenor's Complaint [DE 36] on March 16, 2018. Guido filed an amended complaint for her wrongful death action on May 15, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 27, 2018, Plaintiff filed its Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 53] arguing that, as a matter of law, it has no duty to defend or indemnify Courtyards HOA in the underlying action filed by Guido or for any claims Rodriguez has made or will make against Courtyards HOA relating to the deaths of Alvarez and Rodriguez Jr. \u00b6 19. Great American filed its Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 69], making essentially the same arguments as Colony.

Carbon monoxide is a pollutant under the Policy, so the allegations in the State Complaint fall within the Exclusion.

Defendants argue the actual source of the carbon monoxide is unknown, because the allegations only state that the carbon monoxide is\n   <em>\n    believed\n   </em>\n   to have come from the motor-vehicle. Since the source is unknown, Defendants would have the Court find that the carbon monoxide may have been produced by or originated from the building's heating, cooling, or dehumidifying equipment, so the Exception could potentially apply. However, Plaintiffs' duty to defend Courtyards HOA cannot arise from an inference that the carbon monoxide could have been produced by, or originated from, equipment used to heat, cool, or dehumidify the Unit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wackenhut Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11688451\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/15/1314/#p1321\">\n    15 F.Supp.2d at 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding an insurer's duty to defend cannot arise from inferences that can be made from the allegations in the complaint). The State Complaint only lists the motor-vehicle left running\n   in the garage as a potential source of the carbon monoxide, and the Court cannot infer any other sources to create a duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants also argue that the carbon monoxide entered the Unit through A/C ducts or vents, so the carbon monoxide originated from the ducts or vents, and the allegations fall within the Exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

However, this argument does not conform with the meaning of \"produced by or originating from\" in the Exception.

Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Admiral Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   , the fact that the carbon monoxide entered the unit through the A/C ducts or vents does not mean that the carbon monoxide was produced by, or originating from, the ducts or vents.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For the purposes of the Exclusion in the Policy, carbon monoxide is a pollutant, so the Exclusion applies to preclude coverage. Additionally, for the purposes of the Exception to the Exclusion, carbon monoxide does not originate from A/C ducts or vents merely because it travels through them, and the State Complaint does not allege the carbon monoxide was produced by or originated from equipment used to cool, heat, or dehumidify the Unit.
