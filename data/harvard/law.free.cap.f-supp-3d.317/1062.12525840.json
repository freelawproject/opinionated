Based upon these assumptions, UBS calculates that section 558 penalties would be $24,172.48, all other Labor Code section penalties would be $52,500, and attorneys' fees would be $19,055.62, for a total amount in controversy of $95,278.10. Plaintiff argues that the assumptions underlying UBS's calculations are incorrect, for several reasons.

Despite having made this assumption in the NOR, UBS apparently concedes this point in response to the motion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    California law is clear that a \"subsequent violation\" level applies only to violations after the employer is on notice that\n    its continued conduct is unlawful.

Limiting Amount In Controversy to Plaintiff's 25% Share\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    As a second overarching issue, plaintiff contends that the \"amount in controversy\" calculation should be limited to the 25% of penalties that would be payable to plaintiff if he prevails on his PAGA claim. PAGA provides that any civil penalties are distributed 75% to the California Labor Workforce Development Agency (\"LWDA\") and 25% to the aggrieved employee.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202699\">\n     Cal.

Plaintiff argues that a majority of courts who have considered the issue agree and do not include the 75% of penalties that are paid to the state. UBS argues, on the other hand, that adjudication of an individual plaintiff's PAGA claim implicates the rights of both plaintiff and the LWDA, such that the potential amount of penalties to be awarded must be combined to calculate the amount in controversy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The Ninth Circuit has not squarely considered the issue, nor have the California state appellate courts. The Ninth Circuit has held that a plaintiff's entitlement to PAGA penalties cannot be aggregated with the penalties owed to other employees in order to reach the jurisdictional threshold.\n    <em>\n     Urbino v.

However, under section 2699(f), default penalties do not apply when the Labor Code provides a specific civil penalty for a violation. Here, the specific civil penalty for meal and rest break violations is found in section 558(a) and is equal to $50 per pay period for initial violations and $100 per pay period for subsequent violations, plus an amount sufficient to recover underpaid wages.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    UBS does not dispute that the lower penalty rate would apply.

Plaintiff contends UBS's estimate of the amount in controversy was exaggerated due to miscounting and overstating penalties, including 100% of the penalties despite PAGA's limitation of 25% to a private plaintiff, and subtly tried to mislead the Court by suggesting that \"if the penalties were aggregated with respect to all of the individuals Plaintiff seeks to represent, the amount in controversy would\n    <em>\n     significantly\n    </em>\n    exceed the jurisdictional threshold\" (NOR, \u00b6 15, emphasis original), when UBS knows such aggregation is expressly prohibited by\n    <em>\n     Urbino.\n    </em>\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The Court disagrees. UBS did not rely on the latter argument in calculating the amount in controversy. Moreover, although the Court disagrees with many of the other arguments made by UBS, its arguments were not unreasonable based upon the available authorities. A court \"may award attorney's fees under \u00a7 1447(c) only where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal\" or there are \"unusual circumstances.\"\n    <em>\n     Martin v.
