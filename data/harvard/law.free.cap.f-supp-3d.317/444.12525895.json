Nothing in the second amended complaint indicates that Dr. Adewale, or any official at St. Elizabeths, knew of a serious medical need for the medication and recklessly failed to provide the plaintiff with the medication despite knowing that risk. The second amended complaint indicates that Dr. Adewale stated that he did not prescribe psychotropic medications because he believed Mr. Anderson \"would not respond to psychotropic medications.\" ECF No. 13, \u00b6 47.

However, the plaintiff points to no facts in the second amended complaint supporting that conclusory statement. Paragraph 59, which the plaintiff cites in his opposition brief, merely provides that defendants were aware that the plaintiff suffered mental illness and had previously been prescribed medications treating his illness. Those facts do not establish that defendants therefore knew that failing to provide the medication would lead to serious harm. As noted above, Dr. Adewale stated that he made the affirmative decision to not prescribe medication because he believed it would not be effective. His decision was based on a belief that a treatment plan without medication was optimal. In other words, he did not believe that his decision would lead to serious harm. Whether Dr. Adewale made the right medical decision is beyond the scope of the constitutional claims.\n   <em>\n    Estelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p104\">\n    429 U.S. at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p104\">\n    97 S.Ct. 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, the plaintiff was detained at St. Elizabeths for competency restoration while awaiting sentencing on a 2015 charge and prior to trial on a 2016 charge. The plaintiff argues that the Eighth Amendment is applicable because \"he plead guilty to criminal charges and entered into a sentencing agreement prior to his admission to Saint Elizabeths.\" ECF No. 21 at 7. That argument is of no moment. Mr. Anderson never completed the conditions of his sentencing agreement and when he was admitted to St. Elizabeths he had still not been formally sentenced on the 2015 charge.

The second amended complaint contains no facts indicating an omission in the District's training plan, let alone District personnel actually or constructively knowing about an omission and failing to take action. Mr. Anderson argues that he was deprived of medication on a continuing basis and that therefore supervisors at St. Elizabeths should have been aware. However, that alone is insufficient to support a claim for failure to train or supervise. The mere fact that a doctor made a medical decision to not prescribe medication does not suggest that the District of Columbia officials had actual or constructive notice that constitutional rights would be violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Even if Mr. Anderson established a policy or custom, he has failed to show that the policy or custom caused his injury.\n   <em>\n    City of Canton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    489 U.S. at 388-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"A municipality can be liable under \u00a7 1983 only where its policies are the moving force [behind] the constitutional violation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff suggests that the lack of a procedure to report Dr. Adewale's decision to not medicate \"constitutes a fact demonstrating that a District custom or policy was a substantial factor leading to his alleged injury.\" ECF No. 21 at 9. But that argument is without merit. Mr. Anderson presents no facts indicating that employees at the hospital, or others aware of the situation, were unable to report on what was going on. The lack of a formal procedure cannot be considered a \"substantial factor\" in bringing about the harm.\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

Negligence Claims-Counts 3 and 4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mr. Anderson asserts a negligence claim against all defendants (Count 3) and a negligent training and supervision claim against the District of Columbia (Count 4). Diversity of citizenship does not exist between\n   the plaintiff and the defendants-the second amended complaint indicates that all parties are citizens of the District of Columbia. The parties' presence in federal court, therefore, rests on supplemental jurisdiction, which permits a federal court to extend its jurisdiction to claims properly appended to a claim falling within its original jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). In the present case, the claims falling within this Court's original jurisdiction were the Section 1983 claims discussed above. Those claims have now been dismissed. Thus, with the explicit permission of Congress, this Court declines to hear the remaining state law claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   By statute, this Court \"may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim ... if the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"[I]n the usual case in which all federal-law claims are dismissed before trial, the balance of factors to be considered under the [supplemental] jurisdiction doctrine-judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity-will point toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v.

At this early stage of proceedings before discovery has commenced, the Court finds that these factors do in fact weigh in favor of declining jurisdiction and allowing these issues of purely D.C. law to be determined by the body that knows them best-the D.C. courts. The Court declines to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining two claims in Mr. Anderson's complaint and remands the remainder of the case to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
