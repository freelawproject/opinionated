Arenivar avers in a declaration that Manganaro employees were her direct supervisors on \"most days,\" but that Clark Construction \"controlled\" the Site and \"had the ultimate power\" to control Arenivar's assignments on a daily basis. Arenivar Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6. Moreover, she alleges that Clark Construction occasionally assigned her to a work crew cleaning up debris \"that had no relation to Manganaro's drywall work.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    \u00b6 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She also states that Clark Construction provided her workplace safety training on her first day on the job, hosted monthly meetings to discuss safety and project timelines, and could send home employees who violated Clark Construction's workplace safety rules.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 3-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And while Manganaro paid Arenivar directly, she argues that Clark Construction \"indirectly funded\" her compensation as the general contractor for the project. Remand Br. at 6. Finally, Arenivar alleges that after she was terminated, she spoke with a Clark Construction field superintendent, who relayed her complaint of sexual harassment to Clark Construction's Vice President of Human Resources. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44, 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response, Defendants note that Manganaro hired and paid Arenivar. ECF No. 1-1 (\"Douglas Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. They also argue that Clark Construction \"did not direct the day-to-day work of Manganaro employees\" or have the power to control work assignments. ECF No. 16-2 (\"Reedy Decl.\") \u00b6 11. Moreover, Manganaro employees supervised Arenivar on all but a few days. Remand Opp. at 2. Indeed, all of the supervisors identified by name in her Complaint-Odel Quintero, Mark Shelton, Ramon Padron, and Steve Armstrong-were employed by Manganaro, not Clark Construction. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27; Douglas Decl. \u00b6 9. And Defendants argue that, even when Manganaro employees like Arenivar were assigned to work on the debris clean-up crew, Manganaro determined which of its employees would be detailed to the crew and retained all authority to hire, fire, and discipline its employees. Remand Opp. at 2; Second Douglas Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-10; Reedy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-9. Defendants also state that Manganaro never exercised its authority to discipline Arenivar for safety violations. Second Douglas Decl. \u00b6 12; Reedy Decl. \u00b6 10. Finally, Defendants note that Arenivar's discussion with a Clark Construction employee about her termination occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   she was terminated.
