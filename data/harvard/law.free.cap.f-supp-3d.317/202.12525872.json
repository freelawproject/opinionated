First, the FEC denies that the specialized purpose regime imposes a content-imposed restriction at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss (\"Def.'s Reply\") at 7, ECF No. 29. Second, even if the specialized purpose regime amounts to a content-based restriction, the FEC contends this regime is sufficiently tailored to achieve a sufficiently important governmental interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 18-22. Third, the FEC argues that existing authority establishes that Congress may allow contributions to particular recipients and those recipients' expenditure of such contributions for certain purposes but not for others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Each of these arguments are addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     i. Whether The Specialized Purpose Regime Imposes Content-Based Restrictions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The FEC argues that the specialized purpose regime does not constitute a content-based restriction on speech because \"the ability of a national political party committee to use funds contributed to the segregated accounts depends not on the content of any message but rather the category of expenses at issue.\" Def.'s Reply at 7. This, however, is not so. As the LNC correctly observes, the LNC cannot lawfully spend the entirety of a contribution in an amount above $33,900 \"distributing pamphlets about the party's ideology or supporting a non-presidential candidate,\" but must spend at least some portion of that contribution, if at all, \"broadcasting its presidential nominating convention, hanging a sign on its building, or litigating an election contest.\" Pet.'s Mem. at 16. Thus, the lawfulness of a particular expenditure by the LNC may indeed turn on the message that the expenditure conveys. The FEC argues that the LNC can spend specialized purpose account funds for any purpose so long as the LNC does so at the LNC's presidential nominating convention,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 7, but to condition an expenditure's lawfulness on whether the expenditure is made in connection with a convention itself arguably constitutes a content-based restriction on speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2226\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (identifying laws that \"defin[e] regulated speech by its function or purpose\" as imposing content-based restrictions.

Moreover, because the LNC's second question merits certification, it logically follows that the LNC's third question-\"Does restricting the purposes for which the Libertarian National Committee may spend the bequest of Joseph Shaber violate the Committee's First Amendment\n   rights?,\" Pet.'s Mot. Cert. at 1-challenging the specialized purpose regime as to Mr. Shaber's particular bequest, also warrants certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Reformulating The LNC's Proposed Questions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The FEC argues that should the LNC's second and third proposed questions be certified, these questions should be reformulated because, in their current form, they are phrased in argumentative, question-begging, and overbroad terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 33. While the Court declines to adopt the FEC's proposed formulations of these questions, which themselves are argumentative and question-begging, for the reasons that follow, the LNC's questions two and three are reformulated to address the FEC's concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   At the outset, the FEC contends that the LNC's second and third proposed questions \"go far beyond the claims asserted in the LNC's complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12600300\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/450/#p456\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to the FEC, \"Counts II and III of the LNC's complaint focused on the constitutionality of the segregated account limits,\" which \"appeared to be the only aspect of the limit on contributions to political parties that the [LNC] challenged in its complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12600300\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/450/#p456\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Yet, the FEC continues, \"the LNC's proposed questions two and three are not expressly targeted at the segregated account structure, but instead broadly assert that the contribution limits applicable to national committees 'restrict the purposes for which the LNC may spend' its money.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34 (quoting Pet.'s Mem. at 3 (alterations omitted) ). Contrary to the FEC's description, Counts II and III of the LNC's complaint clearly allege that \u00a7 30125, which prohibits \"[a] national committee of a political party\" from \"spend[ing] any funds, that are not subject to the limitations [and] prohibitions ... of this Act,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030125\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), \"violate[s] the First Amendment speech and associational rights of the LNC and its supporters,\" Compl. \u00b6 31;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030125\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030125\">\n    \u00b6 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, the FEC's criticism of questions two and three for lack of notice is baseless, as the LNC's complaint targets \u00a7 30125's restriction on the LNC's ability to spend specialized purpose account funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As to the framing of questions two and three, the FEC deems these questions to be \"argumentative because [they] beg[ ] the question [of] whether the segregated account limits actually restrict the LNC's spending.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 34. The second question asks whether the specialized purpose regime facially \"violate[s] the First Amendment rights of the [LNC] by restricting the purposes for which the [LNC] may spend its money.\" Pet.'s Mot. Cert. at 1. This question can be understood to ask not only whether restricting the purposes for which the LNC may spend its money violates the First Amendment, but also whether the specialized purpose regime in fact imposes such a restriction. The second question thus requires no reformulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The third question asks whether \"restricting the purposes for which the [LNC] may spend the bequest of Joseph Shaber violates the [LNC's] First Amendment Rights.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The third question, unlike the second question, seemingly presumes that the specialized purpose regime does in fact restrict the purposes for which the LNC may spend its money. The third question's phrasing thus is argumentative and question-begging: whether the specialized purpose regime, in fact, restricts the purposes for which the LNC may spend its money is an issue that must be decided, and may not be presumed. As such, the Court reformulates the third question to mirror the second question, a reformulation to which the LNC hardly can take issue given that the LNC itself formulated the second question's phrasing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, the FEC argues that the second and third questions \"are not limited to the segregated account structure,\" Def.'s Opp'n at 34, but rather, \"implicate whether national party committees may be subject to contribution limits\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   ,\" Def.'s Reply at 13. To the extent any ambiguity exists as to which aspects of the FECA are subject to challenge here, the second and third questions are reformulated to clarify that only the specialized purpose regime created by \u00a7 30116(a)(1)(B), (a)(9), and \u00a7 30125(a)(1) are subject to challenge, and only on the ground that the specialized purpose regime conditions the lawfulness of contributions above \u00a7 30116(a)(1)(B)'s general purpose contribution limit on whether the contribution is directed toward one of \u00a7 30116(a)(9)'s three enumerated specialized purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Accordingly, the second question is reformulated as follows: \"Do\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030116\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), (a)(9), and 30125(a)(1), on their face, violate the First Amendment rights of the Libertarian National Committee by restricting the purposes for which the Committee may spend its contributions above \u00a7 30116(a)(1)(B)'s general purpose contribution limit to those specialized purposes enumerated in \u00a7 30116(a)(9) ?\" The third question is reformulated as follows: \"Do\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030116\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), (a)(9), and 30125(a)(1) violate the First Amendment rights of the Libertarian National Committee by restricting the purposes for which the Committee may spend that portion of the bequest of Joseph Shaber that exceeds \u00a7 30116(a)(1)(B)'s general purpose contribution limit to those specialized purposes enumerated in \u00a7 30116(a)(9) ?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   At the same time, the Court declines to adopt the FEC's proposed formulations of the second and third questions.
