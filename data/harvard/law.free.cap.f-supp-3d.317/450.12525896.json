Defendant's Motion to Expand the Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court has reviewed all of the trial transcripts and extra-record materials submitted by defendant in relation to his Motion to Expand (ECF Nos. 247-1 to 247-10). In deciding this \u00a7 2255 motion, the Court considered only those materials relevant to Doctors Mayer, Khanna, and Antoniades' testimony from the first trial, as well as those detailing the consideration of their testimony before and during defendant's third trial. The Court finds that all other materials are irrelevant to its consideration of defendant's \u00a7 2255 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Deficiency of Counsel's Performance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   With regard to his third trial, defendant argues that trial counsel's \"failure to even consider\" expert medical witnesses to counter the government's seven expert medical witnesses rendered his efforts constitutionally deficient. ECF No. 206 at 28; ECF No. 221 at 38. He contends that \"it was incumbent upon [his] attorneys to prepare for another trial with complex medical issues and complicated testimony.\" ECF No. 206 at 20; ECF No. 221 at 33. In\n   particular, he argues that counsel's failure to request Criminal Justice Act (\"CJA\") funds to provide for the testimony was deficient given that he was unable to pay for the expert witnesses. ECF No. 221 at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   However, defendant has contradicted the central premise of his motion by detailing how defense counsel seriously considered calling Doctor Mayer as a witness in his third trial. His reply to the government's opposition describes how defense counsel met for a \"strategy session\" shortly before the beginning of the third trial and discussed using the three doctors from the first trial at that session. ECF No. 247 at 9-10. Following this session, counsel included the three experts on a list of potential witnesses for the third trial. ECF No. 247-3 at 51-55. Throughout the course of the third trial, defendant states, counsel \"maintained ongoing communication with Dr. Mayer to deconflict his personal schedule.\" ECF No. 247 at 12. Therefore, the defendant's own pleadings make clear that his counsel did not \"[fail] to even consider\" calling expert witnesses. ECF No. 206 at 28; ECF No. 221 at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In any event, defendant fails to demonstrate how the decision to ultimately not request CJA funds and call the medical experts as testifying witnesses \"fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . His argument centers on the fact that defense counsel had called medical experts to testify during his first trial, in which he was acquitted on several counts. As he states in his reply to the government's opposition to his amended motion, \"defense [counsel] saw the effectiveness of defense expert witnesses in Trial 1 in obtaining acquittals.\" ECF No. 247 at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In contrast to defendant's characterization, his trial counsel John Bourgeois' declaration states that, after interviewing members of the jury from the first trial, he gathered that they found the volume of medical testimony presented to be excessive, \"distracting,\" and \"wholly unnecessary.\" ECF No. 241-1 \u00b6 6. His declaration also states that \"the jurors expressed that they were not impressed - or persuaded - by either side's medical expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Bourgeois also declared that the defense team's familiarity with the government's medical experts would allow them to rebut their case through cross-examination without the \"side-show\" of conflicting testimony generated at the first trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11, 12.

ECF No. 241-1 \u00b6 13.

Nevertheless, the Court finds that counsel's decision did not serve to prejudice defendant. In formulating its theory for the third trial, the government conceded that defendant did sustain an injury on September 11, 2001, as Doctors Mayer, Antoniades, and Khanna testified during the first trial. Given this concession, the Court does not see any way in which presenting this testimony again would have served to undermine the government's evidence concerning the numerous misrepresentations defendant made during his VCF hearing concerning his economic loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 241 at 16-17 (detailing the degree to which the check carbons that defendant submitted to the VCF did not match the actual checks that passed through his bank account).
