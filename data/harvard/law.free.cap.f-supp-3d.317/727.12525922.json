Koeltl, U.S.D.J., finding that plaintiff Bhungalia Family, LLC (\"BFL\") was entitled to a default judgment against defendant Deepak Agarwal (\"Agarwal\") on BFL's claim for breach of a guaranty. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 17, 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Complaint, dated May 12, 2017 (\"Compl.\") (Dkt. 1).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons below, I recommend that BFL be awarded judgment against Agarwal as follows: (1) damages of $589,990.44, representing outstanding principal due and owing under the guaranty; (2) interest owing on the unpaid principal in the amount of $41,888.58 through September 25, 2016 (which, as set forth below, was the \"Maturity Date\" of the debt); (3) additional prejudgment interest on the total outstanding loan balance of $631,879.02, to be calculated by the Clerk of Court at the rate of $351.04 per day from September 26, 2016 to the date of entry of judgment; (4) $13,798.63 in attorneys' fees; and (5) $968.34 in costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff BFL is a limited liability company located in Vienna, Virginia. (Proposed Findings \u00b6 1; Compl. \u00b6 3.) Defendant Agarwal is a natural person residing in New York, New York. (Proposed Findings \u00b6 5; Compl. \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Choxi Promissory Note\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 25, 2015, the corporate entity Choxi.com, Inc. (\"Choxi\"), an online retailer with which Agarwal was affiliated, executed a promissory note (the \"Promissory Note\") in favor of BFL, in exchange for a $1 million loan made by BFL to Choxi. (Proposed Findings \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 11; Compl. \u00b6 12; Bhungalia Decl. \u00b6 9 &amp; Ex. A (Promissory Note).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under the terms of the Promissory Note, Choxi agreed to repay to BFL the principal amount of the loan, plus interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum (to be calculated based on a 360-day year), compounded annually. (Proposed Findings \u00b6 8(a); Compl. \u00b6 13(a); Bhungalia Decl., Ex. A, Section 1(a).) More specifically, Choxi agreed to pay BFL at least accrued interest in monthly installments, beginning in or about September 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   with the entire remaining principal amount, together with any remaining accrued and unpaid interest,\n   to become due and payable on the Promissory Note's maturity date of September 25, 2016 (the \"Maturity Date\"). (Proposed Findings \u00b6 8(a), (b); Compl. \u00b6 13(a), (b); Bhungalia Decl., Ex. A, Section 1(a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties further agreed that if Choxi failed to make a payment under the Promissory Note when due, then an \"Event of Default\" would occur, giving BFL the right to accelerate the Promissory Note and to declare all of Choxi's obligations thereunder to be \"immediately due and payable.\" (Proposed Findings \u00b6 8(c), (d); Compl. \u00b6 13(c), (d); Bhungalia Decl., Ex. A, Section 2(a), Section 3.) The parties also agreed that \"the filing or commencement for [sic] any proceedings for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code\" with respect to Choxi would similarly constitute an Event of Default, permitting acceleration of Choxi's payment obligations. (Bhungalia Decl., Ex. A, Section 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Proposed Findings \u00b6 8(c); Compl. \u00b6 13(c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, of relevance here, the Promissory Note contains the following provision, allowing for BFL to recover additional amounts-including attorneys' fees and costs, and interest at a modified rate-in the event that Choxi were to fail to make payments when due, necessitating collection efforts by BFL:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Additional Expense\n   </em>\n   . If this Note or any Principal Amount or interest thereon is not paid when due, whether by reason of acceleration or otherwise, and this Note is placed in the hands of any attorney or attorneys for collection, [Choxi] promises to pay, in addition to the other amounts due hereon, the reasonable costs and expenses of such collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. In addition, if this Note or any Principal Amount or interest thereon is not paid when due and the Company is in default beyond any applicable notice and cure period, interest shall be due on the Principal Amount, from the Maturity Date, at the rate of twenty percent (20%) per annum (\"Default Interest\"), calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Bhungalia Decl., Ex.

B (Guaranty).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under the terms of the Guaranty, Agarwal \"absolutely and unconditionally guarantee[d], as a primary obligor and not as a surety, the full and punctual payment\" of Choxi's \"Guaranteed Obligations\" under the Promissory Note, including any such Guaranteed Obligations incurred or accrued during the pendency of any bankruptcy proceeding, \"whether or not allowed or allowable in such proceeding.\" (Bhungalia Decl., Ex. B, Section 2.) The term \"Guaranteed Obligations\" is defined in the Guaranty to be \"used in its most comprehensive sense,\" and to include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , principal, interest, collection costs, and attorneys' fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, the Guaranty contains a separate provision regarding \"Costs of Enforcement,\" under which Agarwal agreed to pay \"all costs and expenses including, without limitation, all court costs and attorneys' fees and expenses\n   paid or incurred by [BFL] ..., in endeavoring to collect all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations from, or in prosecuting any action against, ... [Agarwal].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Section 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Guaranty is governed by New York law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Section 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Choxi's Default Under the Promissory Note, and Agarwal's Failure To Make Payment Under the Guaranty\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Choxi made payments to BFL (representing interest, plus some repayment of principal) under the Promissory Note from October 7, 2015 through February 25, 2016 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Proposed Findings \u00b6\u00b6 12, 30, 31; Compl. \u00b6 17; Bhungalia Decl., \u00b6 23 &amp; Ex. E (spreadsheet showing payments made)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), but then failed to make the interest payment that was due in March 2016, thereby defaulting in its obligations under the Promissory Note (Proposed Findings \u00b6 13; Compl. \u00b6 18; Bhungalia Decl. \u00b6 15). As the Promissory Note did not set out the precise monthly dates on which installment payments of interest were due, BFL apparently afforded Choxi until the last day of the month of March 2016 to make its interest payment for that month, and therefore deemed March 31, 2016 the \"Default Date.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bhungalia Decl. \u00b6 15 (stating that a monthly payment of accrued interest was \"due on or before March 31, 2016,\" and identifying that date as the \"Default Date\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On or about September 1, 2016, BFL extended Agarwal's time to make payment under the Guaranty through March 25, 2017. (Proposed Findings \u00b6 15; Compl. \u00b6 20;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Bhungalia Decl., Ex. C (Extension of Time).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On March 27, 2017, given that BFL had still not received the amounts owed under the Promissory Note and Guaranty, counsel for BFL sent Agarwal a demand letter, stating that Choxi was in default under the Promissory Note, and demanding from Agarwal \"the immediate payment\" of $689,162.73, which counsel represented to be the remaining balance due on the Promissory Note (including both principal and accrued interest) as of March 25, 2017. (Proposed Findings \u00b6 16; Compl. \u00b6 21; Bhungalia Decl., Ex. D, at 1 (Demand Letter).) Counsel further demanded payment of additional interest accruing from March 25, 2017 to the date of payment, as well as \"attorneys' fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with this matter pursuant to Paragraph 15 of the Guaranty,\" which, counsel indicated, totaled $3,500.00 as of that time. (Bhungalia Decl., Ex. D., at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Despite its demand letter, BFL has represented to the Court that it received no further payments from Choxi or Agarwal. (Proposed Findings \u00b6 14; Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23; Bhungalia Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 19.) Further, this Court notes that, according to BFL's Complaint,\n   \"[a]n involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition was filed against Choxi on November 10, 2016 and it remain[ed] in bankruptcy as of the filing of this action.\" (Compl. \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   BFL commenced this action on May 12, 2017, by filing a Complaint alleging that Agarwal had breached the Guaranty. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.) BFL has certified that it duly served Agarwal with process (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Affidavit of Service, sworn to May 25, 2017 (Dkt. 7);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ziluck Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8) but, to date, Agarwal has not moved, answered, or otherwise responded to the Complaint (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On July 7, 2017, the Clerk of Court issued a Certificate of Default against Agarwal. (Dkt. 12.) On July 18, 2017, Judge Koeltl then ordered Agarwal to show cause why a default judgment should not be entered against him (Dkt. 15), and BFL filed proof that, on July 20, 2017, it served the Order To Show Cause on Agarwal (Dkt. 16). When Agarwal did not respond, Judge Koeltl proceeded to issue another Order, stating that BFL had \"shown that it is entitled to a Default Judgment\" against Agarwal, and referring the matter to this Court for a damages inquest. (Dkt. 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On September 5, 2017, this Court issued a Scheduling Order, by which it directed BFL to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning damages. (Dkt. 19.) In that Scheduling Order, this Court directed BFL to explain how it calculated its damages, to tie the proposed damages specifically to the legal claim on which liability had been established, and to support any claimed damages with an affidavit and attached documentary evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This Court also cautioned Agarwal that, if he failed to respond to BFL's submissions or to contact the Court to request a hearing by November 6, 2017, then this Court's would issue a report and recommendation on the basis of BFL's written submissions alone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   BFL timely filed inquest submissions (Dkts. 20, 21, 22), but the supporting Declaration of Haresh Bhungalia (\"Bhungalia\"), who represented that he was a duly appointed trustee of the trusts comprising the members of BFL and a custodian of the business records of those trusts (Bhungalia Decl. \u00b6 1), was neither sworn nor expressly stated to be under penalty of perjury, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Bhungalia Decl.). As Bhungalia had been put forward by BFL as the party representative with personal knowledge of the amounts due and owing under the Promissory Note (and, hence, the Guaranty) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Bhungalia Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-26), this Court, on May 7, 2018, issued another Order, directing BFL to supplement its submissions with a certification signed by Bhungalia stating, under penalty of perjury, that the statements contained in his Declaration were true and correct (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 24). On May 11, BFL submitted the supplemental certification from Bhungalia, together with proof of service on Agarwal of both the certification and this Court's May 7 Order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 25, 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As of the date of this Report and Recommendation, Agarwal has neither responded to BFL's original or supplemental submission nor requested a damages hearing (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt.), and this Court will therefore proceed to consider the matter based solely on BFL's submissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Damages Following a Default Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Rule 55(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the Clerk of\n   Court must enter a default against a party who \"has failed to plead or otherwise defend\" in an action.

(Compl. \u00b6 17.) In support of its claim, and in response to this Court's May 7, 2018 Order, Bhungalia has now stated, under penalty of perjury, that he has personal knowledge of the amounts paid (and not paid) by Choxi, under the Promissory Note. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bhungalia Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 14-16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bhungalia Supp. Decl.) Through Bhungalia, BFL has provided a spreadsheet showing that, with respect to the $1 million loan made by BFL to Choxi on September 25, 2015, Choxi repaid $450,000, in 18 payments of $25,000 each, representing a total of $410,009.56 in principal and $39,990.44 in interest. (Bhungalia Decl., Ex. E.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This Court has reviewed BFL's calculations, and finds that, under the terms of the Promissory Note (and based on the methodology set forth\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at n.5), BFL has correctly determined the amount of Choxi's payments that should have been applied to the unpaid principal and interest, at the time the payments were made. Based on those calculations, Choxi still owed $589,990.44 in principal (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the loan amount of $1 million, less $410,009.56 in the amount of principal repaid), following its last payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, and given Agarwal's unconditional guarantee of all amounts owed under the Promissory Note, this Court finds that BFL has established with reasonable certainty that, pursuant to the Guaranty, it is entitled to recover $589,990.44 from Agarwal in outstanding principal, due under the Promissory Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Unpaid Interest\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   BFL also seeks to recover damages for the unpaid interest that accrued on the outstanding principal from the date of Choxi's last payment. On this point, this Court finds that, while BFL is entitled to recover unpaid interest, its proffered calculations do not entirely comport with the terms of the Promissory Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Promissory Note effectively provides for two different interest calculations-one that should apply to determine accrued and unpaid interest prior to the Maturity Date of the debt, and one that should apply thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As to the period prior to the Maturity Date, the Promissory Note provides, as set out above, that interest was to accrue at the rate of 12 percent per annum, compounded annually. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bhungalia Decl., Ex. A, at 1.) From the date of Choxi's last payment, on February 25, 2016 to the Maturity Date of September 25, 2016 (a period of 213 days), Choxi therefore owed interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum on the outstanding principal of $589,990.44. Using a daily accrued interest amount of $196.66 (calculated by applying the 12-percent interest rate to $589,990.44, and then dividing that amount by 360, given that the Promissory Note specified that interest was to be calculated based on a 360-day year), this Court finds that the accrued and unpaid interest as of the Maturity Date was $41,888.58 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $196.66, multiplied by 213 days). As the 12 percent interest was then to compound annually, the Court further finds that this amount of unpaid interest should then have been capitalized (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , added to the outstanding principal) at the Maturity Date-which was one year after the date the Promissory Note was executed. This yields a new principal amount, or loan balance, of\n   $631,879.02 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $589,990.44 plus $41,888.58) as of the Maturity Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As to the period subsequent to the Maturity Date, the Promissory Note provides that interest was then to accrue at the rate of 20 percent (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at Section 2(c) ), and there is no reference in the Promissory Note to any further compounding of that interest. Accordingly, this Court finds that, commencing September 26, 2016, Choxi was obligated, under the Promissory Note, to pay additional interest on the loan balance of $631,879.02-with such additional interest calculated at the rate of 20 percent per annum, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 360-day year. This Court further finds that, under the Guaranty, Agarwal is now obligated to pay that additional interest, together with the pre-Maturity-Date accrued and unpaid interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The problem with BFL's calculation is that it appears to compound interest monthly, for the period from the date of Choxi's last payment to the Maturity Date (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Bhunghalia Decl., Ex. E), despite the fact that the Promissory Note only states that interest was to be compounded annually for that period. Accordingly, although I recommend that BFL be awarded accrued and unpaid interest, I only recommend that it be awarded the amounts set out above-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $41,888.58, plus additional interest at the contract rate of 20 percent, calculated from September 26, 2017 to the date of entry of judgment. In making this calculation of additional interest, the Clerk of Court should be directed to apply a daily accrued interest amount of $351.04 (calculated by applying the 20-percent interest rate to $631,879.02, and then dividing that amount by 360).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Attorneys' Fees and Costs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   BFL also seeks $18,266 in attorneys' fees and $968.34 in costs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ziluck Decl., Exs. F &amp; G.) Under the terms of the Promissory Note, Choxi agreed that, if collection of the debt were required, it would \"pay ... the reasonable costs and expenses of such collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.\" (Bhungalia Decl., Ex. A, Section 2(c).) Further, under the Guaranty, Agarwal explicitly agreed to secure Choxi's \"Guaranteed Obligations\" under the Promissory Note, including collection costs and attorneys' fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B, Section 2.) Agarwal also agreed, under the Guaranty, to pay the costs and fees incurred by BFL in seeking to enforce the Guaranty itself. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   , Section 15.) BFL therefore has the contractual right to recover from Agarwal the fees and costs it incurred in seeking payment under both the Promissory Note and Guaranty, provided such fees and costs are found by the Court to be reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prof'l Merch.

As a preliminary matter, this Court notes that Ziluck consistently engaged in block billing,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , clustering various tasks together in a single time entry. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ziluck Decl., Ex. E, at 4 (time entry for 7/17/17, recording 3.30 hours for work described as follows: \"Finalize S.

Dec. 12, 2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), counsel's extensive use of bock billing in this case hinders this Court's ability to understand how much time was devoted to particular tasks, so as to determine whether that time was reasonably spent. Even though most of counsel's billing entries in this instance were for relatively short amounts of time (often under an hour), some reduction in the requested fees is still warranted, given the difficulty block billing creates for judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green v.

Jan. 13, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Compounding the issue of block billing in this particular case, this Court is unable to discern whether the amount of time spent by Ziluck on certain tasks\n   <em>\n    in this action\n   </em>\n   was reasonable because it appears that Ziluck worked simultaneously on both this litigation and the related HTV Action (which, as noted above, is also before this Court for a damages inquest), often performing variations of the same types of tasks for both cases on the same day, and block billing in each. Moreover, although Ziluck has not explained how he apportioned his time in his billing records, this Court's review of those records suggests that he routinely attributed half of his time to one case, and half to the other, even where the work performed for the two cases was not identical. Indeed, Ziluck evenly divided his time entries on 32 out of the 36 days in which he recorded work on both cases, even in instances where there were notable, case-specific divergences in the descriptions of the work performed. (\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ziluck Decl., Ex. E, at 2 (time entry for 5/9/17, recording 1.30 hours for: \"Emails to and from H. Bhungalia regarding request for status update and preparation of complaint; Review promissory note, guaranty and other relevant documents; Begin drafting complaint.\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Scott A. Ziluck in Support of Damages Inquest, dated Oct. 5, 2017, filed in HTV Action at Dkt. 20 (\"HTV Ziluck Decl.\"), Ex. E, at 2 (time entry for 5/9/17, recording 1.30 hours for: \"Office correspondence with A. Halperin regarding response from D. Harrington on action against D. Agarwal; Telephone call with D. Harrington and A. Halperin regarding same; Email from P. Johnson regarding updated interest calculations; Review promissory note, guaranty and other relevant documents; Begin drafting complaint.\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   For his work on his separate clients' inquest submissions, Ziluck evenly divided\n   <em>\n    100 percent\n   </em>\n   of his time, for work performed over a three-week period. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ziluck Decl., Ex. E, at 6&amp; HTV Ziluck Decl., Ex. E, at 5 (time entries recording equal amounts of time expended in each case on 9/8/17, 9/13/17, 9/15/17, 9/20/17, 9/22/17, 9/27/17, and 9/29/17).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Ziluck has asserted that, by combining work on this case with the work performed on the HTV Action, \"[e]conomies were realized\" (Ziluck Decl. \u00b6 22\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), and this may well have been true, but the identical amounts of time recorded in the two actions give rise to questions regarding the reliability of the time entries. First, it is difficult to see how the time Ziluck expended on the two cases would so consistently be the same, regardless of whether the same tasks were being performed. Second, Ziluck's recording of equal amounts of time in both cases appears to have resulted in at least some inflation of hours. For example, on its face, one of Ziluck's time entries in this case seems reasonably to record .30 hours for a short telephone call to this Court's chambers regarding a scheduling order, and a client email regarding the same (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ziluck Decl., Ex. E, at 5 (time entry for 8/9/17) ), but a virtually identical entry, recording another .30 hours in the HTV Action (HTV Ziluck Decl., Ex. E, at 4 (time entry for 8/9/17) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   makes the time expended seem less reasonable. Adding both together, Ziluck effectively recorded 36 minutes for a telephone call that could not have lasted more than a few minutes and two emails, an amount that appears excessive. This does not suggest billing \"efficiencies,\" but rather improper duplicative billing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, this Court notes that this case involves a relatively straightforward contract claim-a failure to pay on an unconditional guaranty-and a default by the defendant. In similar cases, in a similar posture, the Court has approved, as reasonable, considerably fewer hours than the 37.4 hours claimed by HBB to have been incurred in this case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Customers Bank v.
