CONLEY, District Judge\n   Plaintiff Thomas Blitz filed this putative class action against Monsanto Company, alleging that the label on its product includes the following false, misleading and deceptive statement: \"Glyphosate targets an enzyme found in plants but not in people or pets.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. (dkt. # 1) \u00b6 34.) Presently before the court is defendant's motion to dismiss. (Dkt. # 10.) For the reasons discussed below, that motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   FACTS\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Thomas Blitz resides in Waunakee, Wisconsin. (Compl. (dkt. # 1) \u00b6 22.) He purchased Roundup from a Home Depot store. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Blitz alleges that the statement on the label intimating that Roundup was safe to use around people and pets induced him to purchase the product, and that he suffered pecuniary loss as a result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22, \u00b6 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Monsanto Company is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Missouri. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.) Monsanto manufactures Roundup\u00ae, a weed and grass-killing product.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. (dkt. # 1) \u00b6 1.) The active ingredient in Roundup is glyphosate, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2), which kills weeds and grasses by inhibiting the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (\"EPSP\") synthase, thus disrupting one of the steps in the so-called \"shikimate pathway.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Roundup's label reads: \" DID YOU KNOW ? Glyphosate targets an enzyme found in plants but not in people or pets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.) The Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") has registered glyphosate as a pesticide since 1974, and it renewed that registration in 1993. (Mot. to Dismiss Br. (dkt. # 12) 12.) The EPA also approved the Roundup labels at issue as (1) EPA Reg. No. 71995-25; (2) EPA Reg. No. 71995-29; and (3) EPA Reg. No. 71995-33. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Each label includes the same statement \"Glyphosate targets an enzyme found in plants but not in people or pets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties appear to agree that EPSP is not found in human and animal\n   <em>\n    cells\n   </em>\n   as evidenced by the absence of the shikimate pathway.

Personal Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because this is a court of limited jurisdiction, the court begins there. The complaint originally alleged violations of six different states' deceptive trade practices laws on behalf of six putative class representatives, including Blitz, a Wisconsinite, and five non-resident plaintiffs. (Compl. (dkt. # 1) \u00b6\u00b6 22-27.) However, in light of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb v. Super. Ct. of California\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1780\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1780,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1780\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), the five non-resident plaintiffs were dismissed voluntarily. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. # 43.) Having rendered moot defendant's argument that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the claims of the five non-Wisconsin plaintiffs, two jurisdictional questions remain: (1) whether the court has personal jurisdiction over the claims asserted by Blitz; and (2) whether the court has personal jurisdiction over a nationwide class action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As to named-plaintiff Blitz's claims, this court clearly has personal jurisdiction. Blitz is a Wisconsin resident. (Compl. (dkt. # 1) \u00b6 22.) He purchased Roundup from a Home Depot store in Wisconsin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because that transaction creates an \"affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an] activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum State,\"\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1780\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v.

Indeed, defendant does not contest that the court has personal jurisdiction over Blitz's claims against it. (Mot. to Dismiss Br. (dkt. # 12) 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As to plaintiff's apparent desire to have certified a nationwide class of persons who purchased Roundup under Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules (Compl. (dkt. # 1) 31), defendant argues that this court may not exercise specific personal jurisdiction over the claims of non-resident plaintiffs under\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   , including as members of a putative nationwide class. (Reply (dkt. # 41) 7.) However,\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   concerned the power of a\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   court to exercise specific personal jurisdiction over non-resident class\n   members, expressly leaving open the question \"whether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   court.\"\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/#p1780\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Because this question need not be decided now, and the court would no doubt benefit from greater factual and legal briefing before resolving, the court will also reserve judgment on the question of whether it can exercise personal jurisdiction over the claims of a nationwide class, at this time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Preemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant also argues that plaintiff's claims are preempted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (\"FIFRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20136\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , because the EPA registered glyphosate and approved the Roundup label. (Mot. to Dismiss Br. (dkt. # 12) 27-30.) Under FIFRA, all pesticides must be registered with the EPA before sale or distribution. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136a(a). The EPA then registers a pesticide if its labeling complies with FIFRA's requirements, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136a(c)(5)(B), meaning that the EPA will not register a \"misbranded\" pesticide.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20136\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q)(1)(A).

(Mot. to Dismiss Br. (dkt. # 12) 27-30.) Specifically, under the Wisconsin Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\"WDTPA\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   No ... corporation ... with intent to sell, distribute, increase the consumption of ... any merchandise ... or with intent to induce the public in any manner to ... purchase ... merchandise ... shall make, publish, disseminate, circulate, or place before the public ... [a] label ... which is untrue, deceptive or misleading.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20100.18\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 100.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). So, the question arguably remains whether this requirement is \"in addition to or different from\" FIFRA's requirements. Notably, WDTPA's prohibition on \"untrue, deceptive or misleading\" representations is linguistically similar to FIFRA's prohibition on \"misbranded\" pesticides -- those whose \"labeling bears any statement, design, or graphic representation relative thereto or to its ingredients which is false or misleading in any particular.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20136\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q)(1)(A). Substantively, \u00a7 100.18(1) of the WDTPA does not appear to require anything different or additional.

In this respect, defendant argues that\n   <em>\n    Mirzaie\n   </em>\n   is controlling, since the\n   <em>\n    Mirzaie\n   </em>\n   court dismissed the entire complaint with prejudice after concluding that the plaintiffs sought \"to impose a labeling requirement different or in\n   addition to that required under FIFRA.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20146421\">\n    2016 WL 146421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Dismiss Br.

Thus, the relief requested by the\n   <em>\n    Mirzaie\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs fell squarely under FIFRA's express preemption. In contrast, the WDTPA authorizes the award of monetary damages to private individuals.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20100.18\">\n    Wis.

Therefore, the court finds that\n   <em>\n    Mirzaie\n   </em>\n   does not apply to the extent plaintiff is seeking monetary damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant next argues that the distinction between injunctive and other kinds of relief is irrelevant to FIFRA preemption because \"Monsanto's only options are to change its label or else continue to face legal action,\" if plaintiff is successful. (Reply (dkt. # 41) 12 n.4 (emphasis omitted).) As a practical matter, this argument has some force except that the Supreme Court foreclosed this line of argument in\n   <em>\n    Bates\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The prohibitions in \u00a7 136v(b) apply only to \"requirements.\" An occurrence that merely motivates an optional decision does not qualify as a requirement. The Court of Appeals was therefore quite wrong when it assumed that any event, such as a jury verdict, that might \"induce\" a pesticide manufacturer to change its label should be viewed as a requirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p444\">\n    544 U.S. at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p444\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although a verdict awarding damages in favor of plaintiff might well motivate defendant to change Roundup's label, the\n   <em>\n    Bates\n   </em>\n   Court held such a verdict does not create the kind of legal \"requirement\" prohibited under FIFRA's preemption statement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/#p444\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, to the extent that defendant is arguing that the EPA's registration of glyphosate and approval of the Roundup label carry any preemptive force, defendant is simply mistaken. Again, while registration of a pesticide constitutes\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence that the pesticide's labeling complies with FIFRA, registration may not serve as a defense to a FIFRA violation. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136a(f)(2). Similarly, there is no \"indication that the EPA's approval of Roundup's label ha[s] the force of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Hardeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271804\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/216/1037/#p1039\">\n    216 F.Supp.3d at 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In sum, although only the EPA may order a label change, defendant has overstated the legal effect of the EPA's approval, as well as the import of the relief requested by plaintiff, particularly since plaintiff seeks to recover monetary damages for allegedly false statements that FIFRA itself prohibits. Accordingly, plaintiff's claims are not preempted by FIFRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Untrue, Deceptive or Misleading Representations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant argues that plaintiff's claim that defendant violated Wisconsin's Deceptive\n   Trade Practices Act must be dismissed because the challenged statement on the label is not false or misleading as a matter of law. (Mot. to Dismiss Br. (dkt. # 12) 22-27.) First, defendant argues that plaintiff cannot plead literal falsity unless supported by unanimous expert opinion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) Second, defendant argues that plaintiff's allegation that the statement is false precludes an allegation that the statement is deceptive or misleading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-27.) For the reasons below, the court rejects both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(dkt. # 1) \u00b6 34.) Defendant argues this statement on the Roundup label is not literally false as a matter of law. (Mot. to Dismiss Br. (dkt. # 12) 24.) For plaintiff to maintain a claim of literal falsity, defendant asserts that this claim must be supported by unanimous expert opinion, citing\n   <em>\n    In re GNC Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/#p514\">\n    789 F.3d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 514-15 (4th Cir. 2015).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/#p514\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    GNC\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs alleged that the products in that case were \"incapable of providing the advertised joint health benefits, and that they would not have purchased the products but for the Companies' false advertising.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/#p514\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/#p514\">\n    at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In support, the plaintiffs cited several peer-reviewed, published studies demonstrating that two of the products' active ingredients were ineffective at treating the symptoms of osteoarthritis as advertised.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/#p514\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/#p514\">\n    at 510-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, because the plaintiffs did \"not allege that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   scientists agree that glucosamine and chondroitin are ineffective at providing the promised joint health benefits,\" they could not allege literal falsity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/#p514\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233394\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/505/#p514\">\n    at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   However,\n   <em>\n    In re GNC\n   </em>\n   is at least arguably distinguishable. The scientific claims at issue in that case revolved around the \"clinical effectiveness\" of two ingredients. By contrast, plaintiff's allegation that EPSP is found in gut bacteria present in human bodies is seemingly more of a binary proposition: either the enzyme is found in gut bacteria present in humans or it is not. Specifically, defendant emphasizes that the \"currently accepted dogma is that glyphosate i[s] not harmful to humans or to any mammals because the shikimate pathway is absent in all animals.\" (Mot. to Dismiss Br. (dkt. # 12) 24.) However, plaintiff does not allege physical harm as a result of the alleged misrepresentation, but rather pecuniary loss. (Compl. (dkt. # 1) \u00b6 75.) At this point, the\n   <em>\n    GNC\n   </em>\n   standard would also seem inapplicable because even defendant has not suggested that the scientific community is equivocal as to the presence of EPSP in human and other mammalian gut bacteria, which (as discussed already) is a separate inquiry from whether human and other mammalian\n   <em>\n    cells\n   </em>\n   contain EPSP. Regardless, for the purposes of evaluating defendant's motion to dismiss, the court must accept as true plaintiff's allegation that EPSP is present in gut bacteria found in human bodies, making the challenged statement on the Roundup label \"literally false.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant nevertheless insists that \"it is almost universally accepted by regulators and the scientific community, both within and outside the United States, that glyphosate targets an enzyme ('EPSP synthase') not found in human or animal cells -- just as the statement on Roundup\u00ae's labels describes.\" (Mot. to Dismiss Br. (dkt. # 12) 10.) Again, however, the Roundup label says nothing about cells, only that EPSP is \"found in plants but not in people or pets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Although defendant may ultimately prevail on its essential argument that the distinction is not material, on the limited record currently before the court, a\n   reasonable consumer could take this statement to mean that EPSP is not found\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   people, rather than to mean that EPSP is simply not found in human cells, as opposed to bacteria present in the human gut. Similarly, as defendant notes, the Roundup label says nothing about \"gut bacteria.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) As defendant sees it, \"it is entirely unreasonable for anyone to be thinking about gut bacteria when reading\" the Roundup label, but on this limited record, it is unclear why that is so. Indeed, at least on its face, many consumers might well think gut bacteria are located\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   people. Under that view, the Roundup label would again be literally false. Regardless, the court is not prepared to hold otherwise at the pleading stage of this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Deceptive or Misleading Representations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant additionally argues that plaintiff has not sufficiently pleaded facts to support a claim that the Roundup label is deceptive or misleading under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20100.18\">\n    Wis.

Thus, the court could reasonably conclude as a matter of law that because plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded a claim of literal falsity, plaintiff has also satisfied the pleading standard for a claim that the label is misleading.

The statute itself does not define \"untrue,\" \"deceptive\" or \"misleading\" in a way that would suggest each word deserves analytically distinct treatment.

To the contrary, Wisconsin Statute \u00a7 402.607(3)(a) makes no distinction between direct and indirect sellers. Furthermore, a notice exception broad enough to encompass the act of filing a complaint undercuts the twin purposes of the notice requirement: to give notice of and opportunity to correct a specific defect and to inform the seller that the purchaser believes it is responsible for remedying the defect.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    p. 16.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
