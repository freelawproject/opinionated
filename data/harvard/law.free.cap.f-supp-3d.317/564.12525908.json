Both Defendants answered Plaintiff's complaint and moved for summary judgment without asserting as a defense the statutory immunity that is conferred on charter schools and their employees under District of Columbia law. Six months after filing their motion for summary judgment, Defendants moved to dismiss on the basis of this statutory immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 40 (\"Mot.\"). For the reasons explained below, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss will be denied. The statutory immunity they cite is an affirmative defense that they failed to plead in their answers, and therefore is forfeited. This immunity does not, as Defendants argue, divest this Court of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.
