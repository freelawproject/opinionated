ECF No. [3] (the \"Motion\"). The Court has carefully reviewed the Motion, all opposing and supporting materials, the record in this case and the applicable law, and is otherwise fully advised. For the reasons set forth below, the Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL POSTURE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff originally filed its Complaint, ECF No. [1-2] (\"Complaint\"), in the Circuit Court of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in Broward County, Florida on March 21, 2018. In its Complaint, Plaintiff alleges two breach of contract claims. Count I alleges that Defendants breached the contractual terms and conditions of the Plaintiff's homeowners insurance policy (the \"Policy\") by refusing to pay for Plaintiff's loss after Hurricane Irma. ECF No. [1-2] \u00b6 21. Count II alleges that Defendants breached the Policy by failing to make a determination of coverage by either making payment or denying the claim within\n   90 days of receiving notice. ECF No. [1-2] \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 4, 2018, Defendants filed their notice of removal, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   with this Court. ECF No. [1]. Defendants assert that there is a valid arbitration clause within the Policy that falls under the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (\"the Convention\"), invoking jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 203 and 205. Defendants then filed their Motion, again raising the defense that the agreement requires arbitration of this dispute under the Convention. Plaintiff timely filed its response arguing that Defendants have failed to state what claims they seek to arbitrate, and that the Policy issued by Defendants is governed by Florida law. As such, the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") does not apply. ECF No. [10]. By timely reply, Defendants maintain that the arbitration clause prevails over state law to the extent that the FAA incorporates an agreement the United States made with other nations. ECF No. [11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In\n   <em>\n    Antillean\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that the dispute between defendant foreign mutual insurance association and plaintiff shipping corporation was governed by an international arbitration agreement subject to the Convention, and thus Defendants' motion to compel arbitration was granted. Here, the agreement arises out of a contractual, commercial relationship between a Florida corporation and a foreign entity for the provision of insurance for a real estate investment corporation.

Plaintiff asserts that the Policy is \"governed by Florida law and Florida Statute 627, [and] therefore, the FAA does not apply ...\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As such, Plaintiff argues that the Court should deny the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In reply, Defendants assert that Plaintiff is trying to argue that reverse preemption under the McCarran-Ferguson Act (\"McCarran-Ferguson Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201011\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , mandates that state law applies in the instant case to preclude arbitration. However, the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which provides that \"the states, and only the states, can regulate the substantive content of insurance contracts,\" does not apply to contracts made under the Convention, as it was intended to apply only to interstate commerce, and not foreign commerce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Antillean Marine Shipping Corp. v.

Ct. App. 2009) in further support of their argument. There, the court held that \"the McCarran-Ferguson Act applies only to arbitration agreements within the United States and that it has no effect on an international arbitration agreement that is governed by the Convention. The Federal Arbitration Act must give way to contrary provisions of state laws regulating the business of insurance but, to the extent that the Act incorporates an agreement the United States made with other nations, it prevails over state laws.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7061424,7061373\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/17/732/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7061424,7061373\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/17/732/\">\n    at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). In the instant case, the Policy provides for a Florida corporation to be provided insurance coverage by Underwriters domiciled in the United Kingdom, thus constituting foreign commerce outside of the purview of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Thus, there is no basis upon which to argue that Florida law prohibits the Convention Act from governing this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Waiver of Right to Compel Arbitration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that the Underwriters have waived the right to demand arbitration due to \"Defendant's lackadaisical attitude towards this claim and total inaction for many months.\" ECF No. [10] at 2. Plaintiff makes this assertion of waiver without any supporting case law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [11] at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit has determined that under the FAA, a two-part test is used to establish a waiver of a right to demand arbitration. \"First, we decide if, under the totality of the circumstances, the party has acted inconsistently with the arbitration right.\"\n   <em>\n    Ivax Corp. v.

Moreover, upon review of the record, the Court does not find that Defendants acted inconsistently with the right to arbitrate. Under Section 205, a defendant \"may, at any time before the trial thereof, remove such action or proceeding ....\" Thus, a motion to stay filed several months after the original suit was filed should not be grounds for a waiver of right to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Defendants timely filed their Notice of Removal with this Court on June 4, 2018 and subsequently filed their Motion to Dismiss or Alternatively Stay Litigation Pending Arbitration on June 5, 2018. Furthermore, Defendants invoked their demand to arbitration within the original motion to dismiss, and thus avoiding any prejudice to \"the opposing party [by undertaking] the types of litigation expenses that arbitration was designed to alleviate.\"\n   <em>\n    S &amp; H Contractors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1812429\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/906/1507/#p1514\">\n    906 F.2d at 1514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
