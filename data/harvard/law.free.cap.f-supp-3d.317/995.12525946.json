On April 10\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , I ordered the defendants to produce (1) all agreements between the Zoltek Corporation, Toray Industries and/or Mr. Rumy, the founder of Zoltek Corporation, about the underlying case (including any agreement concerning the allocation of proceeds of settlement, and (2) all communications between Mr. Rumy and Toray Industries concerning the underlying case (including any communications relating to plaintiffs) ). The defendants were given a month in which to comply. They objected to the Order, but Judge Durkin denied those objections. [Dkt. # 110].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Taking every minute of the 30 days the Order gave them, defendants made their production on May 10\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . One of the documents produced was an email chain between Mr. Rumy and Zoltek Corporation and a representative of Toray Industries. The email referenced the draft of an\n   agreement that Mr. Rumy sent Toray Industries, and explained that Toray Industries indicated it would be going over the draft with its counsel and Zoltek Corporation management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Two weeks after production, Zoltek Corporation filed a motion asking that the court enter the parties' agreed Protective Order. [Dkt. # 113]. The Order was entered on May 15\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . [Dkt. # 115]. One of its provisions stated that \"[i]nadvertent disclosures of material protected by the attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine shall be handled in accordance with Federal Rule of Evidence 502.\" [Dkt. # 115, \u00b6 6].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , plaintiffs asked Zoltek Corporation to produce the Agreement mentioned in the email chain. Hearing nothing for almost a week, plaintiffs' counsel called defendants' counsel again. Plaintiffs' counsel does not relate how that conversation went [Dkt. # 120, at 2], but he had to send an email request for the draft agreement on May 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   . Zoltek Corporation's counsel promised she would get back to plaintiffs' counsel about the matter the afternoon of May 22\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   . By email that evening, for the first time in this entire exchange, Zoltek Corporations's counsel claimed that the email chain was privileged and had been inadvertently produced, demanded its destruction, and promised to provide a Privilege Log regarding the draft agreement. Zoltek Corporation's counsel referenced paragraph 6 of the parties' Protective Order, Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(5)(B), and Fed.R.Evid. 502. [Dkt. # 120-3]. For the following reasons, the Motion of Zoltek Corporation is denied, and it is ordered that Zoltek Corporation produce the withheld draft agreement immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When defendant, Zoltek Corporation, made its court-ordered production on May 10\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , it withheld the draft agreement between defendant, Zsolt Rumy, and defendants, Toray Industries and Zoltek Corporation. The draft clearly fell into the categories referenced in the Order of April 10\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . Zoltek Corporation provided no Privilege Log describing the nature of each document being withheld, even though a Privilege Log describing the nature of each withheld document must be provided in a timely manner.\n   <em>\n    Hobley v. Burge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881175\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/946/#p947\">\n    433 F.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 947 (7th Cir. 2006). Indeed, Zoltek Corporation made no claim of privilege, whether supported or unsupported, and gave no indication that it was withholding, for any reason, any documents in the categories it had been ordered to produce. That much is clear from Zoltek Corporation's \"Opening Brief on Privilege of Questioned Document\" and the Declaration of counsel, which contain no mention of any privilege log or timely claim of\n   privilege for the withheld document. [Dkt. ## 138, at 3-4; 138-3]. Thus, Zoltek Corporation violated Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(5)(A) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   When a party withholds information otherwise discoverable by claiming that the information is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation material, the party must: (i) expressly make the claim; and (ii) describe the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not produced or disclosed-and do so in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Zoltek Corporation failed to do both (i) and (ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It bears repeating that compliance with Rule 26(b)(5)(A) is not optional.\n   <em>\n    Motorola Sols., Inc. v.

So, the real issue here isn't inadvertent disclosure of the email chain; it's waiver of the privilege as to the draft agreement itself.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry.

Ill. 2007). But what Zoltek Corporation has done here goes beyond the failure to file an adequate privilege log-or any log at all-or make an adequately supported claim. Here, the failure was to make any claim at all, and the document was therefore, it must be said, withheld surreptitiously. Defendant had multiple opportunities to indicate, even by an unadorned claim, that it was withholding this document from discovery based on privilege or work product. It did nothing. The defendants' silence is telling.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   the discussion in\n   <em>\n    R-Boc v.

Thus, its production from Plaintiffs' perspective was definitely a blunder; but it was not an\n   \"inadvertent disclosure,\" as the cases define the term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The email, dated June 7, 2016, is between two non-attorneys, Mr. Zsolt Rumy and Mr. Aihara of defendant, Toray Industries. Mr. Rumy had sold Zoltek Corporation to Toray Industries in 2014. He then is said to have been a consultant and then \"transition [ed] away from involvement with Zoltek Corporation.\" [Dkt. # 139-2, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6]. It's all very vague-vagaries are a feature of Zoltek Corporation's submissions, likely with good reason-and Zoltek Corporation provides no timeline. But, in the email chain, Mr. Rumy Mr. Rumy and Mr. Aihara are clearly negotiating the terms of an agreement, with Mr. Rumy having sent a draft-the document already discussed-and Mr. Aihara sending back his thoughts and questions. Mr. Rumy tells us, in a declaration attached to Zoltek Corporation's opening brief, that the document evinces a deal whereby Toray Industries would assign a patent that was the centerpiece in a 20-year litigation odyssey back to Mr. Rumy. [Dkt. # 139-1, \u00b6 9]. Mr. Rumy would then take over the litigation, which Toray Industries had become disinterested in pursuing. [Dkt. # 139-1, \u00b6 8]. Two months later, Mr. Rumy and Toray say they executed what they tendentiously term a \"common interest agreement.\" [Dkt. # 139-1, \u00b6 10; # 139-2, \u00b6 6]. But, titles are not determinative; substance is.\n   <em>\n    Health Care Industry Liability Insurance Program v.

Ill. 2017). What Mr. Rumy calls the draft patent transfer agreement [Dkt. # 139-1, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 15], Zoltek Corporation has chosen not to make a part of the record, so there is no way to tell if it even covers the deal discussed in the email at issue; it might exclude it or, as it was allegedly executed two months after the email chain at issue, might not even be applicable.

Like most contract negotiations, the negotiation between Mr. Rumy and Toray Industries for the transfer of the patent is are not privileged. They are akin to a game of Texas Hold 'Em, insofar as there are flop, turn, and river cards-face up-and hole cards-face down'. The face up cards here are the questions and comments from Toray Industries and the attached draft agreement from Mr. Rumy. Ordinarily, even if those items revealed legal advice, any privilege that might attach to them would be waived as, obviously, they weren't kept confidential.

Again, the draft contract from Mr. Rumy and the suggestions for changes and questions from Toray Industries are the river cards in the game. Those cards weren't kept confidential; the parties chose to reveal information to one another at that point of the negotiation. But, unlike the situation involving attorney-client privilege, disclosure to a third party doesn't necessarily waive work product protection.

While the patent transfer agreement was purportedly designed to transfer control of the lengthy case from Toray Industries to Mr. Rumy, that's not what \"prepared in anticipation of litigation\" means in the context of work product protection in this case. There is nothing in Zoltek Corporation's submissions that suggests that the draft agreement contract for the transfer of the patent and any suggested edits or questions about it in the email reveal any strategies for pursuing the patent litigation or this litigation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mattenson v.

That document, the patent transfer agreement-again according to Zoltek Corporation-merely results in a change of the plaintiff in the patent litigation. Toray Industries would step away, and Mr. Rumy would take over in his \"individual capacity.\" That is not a strategy in a sense all the cases use the term. Quite the contrary. It is merely a fact that is inevitably and intentionally revealed to all, including the adversary in that litigation. It is not a question of an adversary's performing his functions with wits borrowed from his opponent. Thus, Zoltek Corporation has fallen far short of establishing that the emails and draft patent transfer agreement sent between Mr. Rumy and Toray Industries were prepared in \"anticipation of litigation\" and protected by the work product doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    G.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The case is presently set for oral argument on Thursday, July 19, 2018.

[Dkt. # 120]. Midway through briefing on those documents plaintiffs raised the issue of additional documents they wish to obtain from Zoltek Corporation. Those will have to be the subject of a proper motion to compel, filed only after the parties\n    <em>\n     strictly\n    </em>\n    comply with Local Rule 37,2 and meet and confer in good faith regarding the additional documents.

And, so, Zoltek Corporation tells us\n    <em>\n     for the first time in its reply brief\n    </em>\n    that the document is not an asset transfer at all, because the patent had expired and had no other use than in the underlying patent litigation. It also bizarrely blames the plaintiffs for this mischaracterization even though it clearly referred to it as a patent transfer-an asset transfer-multiple times. Zoltek Corporation also claims, in its reply brief, that the document embodies \"the terms [Zoltek Corporation and Mr. Rumy] could move forward together in litigation....\" [Dkt. # 151, at 1]. But that's directly contradictory to the Zoltek Corporation's representations in its opening submissions that Mr. Rumy was transitioning away from Zoltek Corporation and Toray and would \"pursue the Stealth litigation in [his]\n    <em>\n     individual\n    </em>\n    capacity.\" [Dkt. # 139-1, \u00b6 9 (emphasis supplied) ].\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The courts have characterized this tactic in a variety of ways-all negative.
