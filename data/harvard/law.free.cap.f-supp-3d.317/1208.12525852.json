The FCC explained that a predicative dialer had the \"basic function\" necessary to qualify as an ATDS: \"the\n   <em>\n    capacity\n   </em>\n   to dial numbers without human intervention.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2015, the FCC went a step further. It took the position that an ATDS need only have the capacity to dial random and sequential numbers rather than the present ability to do so.\n   <em>\n    In re Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    2015 Declaratory Ruling\n   </em>\n   \"), 30 FCC Red. 7961, 7974 \u00b6 15 (2015).
