Plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge to the warnings requirements involves a host of complex, purely legal questions, including but not limited to: whether Defendants' asserted governmental interest in imposing the health warnings regime is a substantial one; the precise burden the government bears under\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   to compel purely factual and uncontroversial government speech; and whether a disclosure of the size and appearance mandated by the warnings requirements is so \"unduly burdensome\" as to chill protected speech.

The court already has made its view of the equities clear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 46-49. The court need not repeat itself here, save to reiterate that the FDA's insistence that the cigar industry, as a whole, meet the August 10, 2018, effective date, while the agency seeks additional information that bears on the need for health warnings on premium cigars is \"a grossly unfair exercise of agency authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In contrast to the irreparable harm Plaintiffs will incur without an injunction, there is little indication that an injunction pending appeal will result in substantial harm to Defendants. Defendants do not contend otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' interest in staying the impending compliance date outweighs the minimal burden placed on Defendants to delay its enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   D. Public Interest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, the public interest favors granting injunctive relief pending resolution of the appeal. The \"strong public interest in the exercise of free speech rights,\"\n   <em>\n    Pursuing America's Greatness v.

Although Defendants rightly observe that the public has an interest in ensuring that the FDA can exercise its authority and scientific expertise to inform the public about the health risks posed by cigar and pipe tobacco products, Defendants offer no persuasive argument that there is an immediate public interest in enforcing the warnings requirements on August 10, 2018, rather than after a full hearing on appeal. That there is no immediate public interest is reinforced by the fact that Defendants are considering rulemaking that might alter the warnings requirements as to premium cigars, a key covered product. In sum, the court concludes that the public's interest in preserving constitutional protections is best served by granting Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because Plaintiffs' appeal presents \"serious legal questions\" on the merits, and because the likelihood of irreparable harm, the balance of equities, and the public interest all strongly favor interim relief, the court exercises its discretion to grant Plaintiffs' Motion for an Injunction Pending Appeal.
