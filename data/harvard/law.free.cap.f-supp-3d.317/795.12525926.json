(\"Wine Enthusiast\") commenced this declaratory judgment action on September 6, 2017. Defendant Vinotemp International Corporation (\"Vinotemp\") has responded with three counterclaims. Wine Enthusiast moved to dismiss two of the three counterclaims on March 12. For the reasons that follow, Wine Enthusiast's motion is granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Wine Enthusiast has moved to dismiss the counterclaims that assert that its wine storage systems infringe Vinotemp's United States Patent No. D711,936 (the \"D936 Patent\") and Vinotemp's asserted trade dress in a wine storage unit. The following facts are drawn from the defendant's counterclaims, the patent at issue, and photographs of Wine Enthusiast's competing products submitted by Wine Enthusiast in support of its motion. Vinotemp has not objected to consideration of those photographs and they illuminate the assertions in the counterclaims and the parties' arguments in their motion papers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The facts below are construed in favor of Vinotemp.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keiler v. Harlequin Enters. Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070496\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/64/#p68\">\n    751 F.3d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68 (2d Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Vinotemp designs, manufactures, and sells wine refrigeration and storage units. Vinotemp owns the D936 Patent, which was issued on August 26, 2014, and which claims the \"ornamental design for a black wine rack face, as shown and described\" in the patent (\"Rack Face\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Figure 1 of the patent is a \"top perspective of a black wine rack face within a wine cabinet[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   All but one of the remaining six figures in the patent provide detailed illustrations of the \"black wine rack face of [Figure] 1.\" As demonstrated in those figures, the Rack Face sits flush with the shelf to which it is attached. When looking at the Rack Face from the side, it appears it resembles an upside-down \"J.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Rack Face is thin in comparison to its height. When viewing the Rack Face from above, as in Figures 4 and 6, it appears that it is designed to be a slim cover to the front of the shelf. As shown in Figure 3, when looking at the Rack Face head-on, it obscures the elements of the shelf behind it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its counterclaims, Vinotemp describes its trade dress as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Vinotemp claims a unique trade dress for wine storage units such as a wine rack or a refrigerator. The storage units have a glass front. There are individual shelves inside the units holding the bottles in a horizontal position, with the bases of the bottles facing outward. Each of the shelves has a black front. The black front is high enough to cover most of the bottom half of each bottle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   This arrangement gives the impression the bottles are \"floating\" within the storage unit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Wine Enthusiast also manufactures and sells wine storage and refrigeration units and wine racks. Vinotemp asserts that Wine Enthusiast's Evolution series of refrigerators infringe Vinotemp's products. The photographs of the Evolution series, which the parties agree accurately reflect the alleged infringing products, include a photograph of a wine storage unit with a glass front door and horizontal shelving. The shelf fronts are visible through the glass doors, as pictured here:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In support of its motion, Wine Enthusiast has also submitted photographs of the shelves that indicate that its shelf fronts do not attach to the sides of the shelf, do not curve over the shelf sides, and do not cover any top part of the shelf to which they are attached.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The shelf fronts are thick: they have a height approximately two times their depth, as pictured below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 31, 2017, Vinotemp sent a letter to Wine Enthusiast alleging that the Evolution Series wine refrigerator units were infringing Vinotemp's D936 Patent and Vinotemp's trade dress. On September 6, Wine Enthusiast filed this action seeking a judgment declaring that it has not infringed\n   Vinotemp's patent or trade dress rights, that Vinotemp lacks any trade dress rights, and that the D936 Patent is invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   With its Amended Answer, filed December 13, Vinotemp asserts three counterclaims. In two of the counterclaims, Vinotemp asserts that Wine Enthusiast infringed the D396 Patent and Vinotemp's trade dress rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court held an initial pretrial conference with the parties on December 15. Wine Enthusiast moved to dismiss those two counterclaims on March 12, 2018. The motion became fully submitted on April 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When a party moves to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Fed.

No ordinary observer using the Vinotemp's wine rack would think, when considering the patented design features of the Rack Face as a whole and in the normal course of such use, that the Rack Face was substantially similar in design to Wine Enthusiast's shelf front on its wine racks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It is true that both wine racks have a black front or face, but the D936 Patent is not so limited. It claims protection for a black wine Rack Face with particular design features. A comparison of those features, taken individually and as a whole, with the accused product's features establish, as a matter of law, that the wine racks are not substantially similar designs. The ornamental features of Vinotemp's Wine rack face include its \"J\" shape at the top, its thinness, and its method of attachment to the shelf. Wine Enthusiast's shelf fronts do not imitate these features. Wine Enthusiast's shelf front has no \"J\" shape; it has no curves at all. Wine Enthusiast's shelf front is significantly thicker; its ratio of height to depth is approximately two versus Vinotemp's six. Finally, while Vinotemp's Rack Face attaches flush to the wine rack (its sides, top, and bottom), the shelf front on Wine Enthusiast's wine rack does not. The Wine Enthusiast shelf front juts out slightly on the sides of the shelf. It does not attach to the sides of the rack. It attaches to the rack face with about a quarter of the face siting below the rack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Figure 5 from the Patent and a photograph of the Wine Enthusiast wine rack illustrate some of these differences, as do Figure 6 from the Patent and another photograph of the Wine Enthusiast shelf front.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Vinotemp acknowledges that each of the differences described above exist, but argues that these differences between its Rack Face and Wine Enthusiast's shelf front are minor. While a concentration on small, isolated differences may not distract from the overall impression of the designs, when considering the scope of the D936 Patent, it is apparent that these design differences are not minor. Indeed, together, these features constitute the entirety of the claimed design except for its color. Vinotemp does not claim rights simply in the face of a wine rack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, Vinotemp argues that in both designs the wine rack face is \"uniformly visible\" and covers the entire front of the wine rack. But, the D936 Patent, even if valid, does not give Vinotemp monopoly rights over all black structures affixed to the front of wine racks. It seeks protection for a particular design of a Rack Face. Vinotemp has not plausibly pled that Wine Enthusiast's shelf front infringes the D936 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   II.
