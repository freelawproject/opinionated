Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Government charged Percoco with engaging in two extortion schemes: one related to an energy company, Competitive Power Ventures (\"CPV\"), and the other related to a real estate company, COR Development Company LLC (\"COR Development\" or \"COR\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, Dkt. 1; Second Superseding Indictment (Sept. 19, 2017) (\"S2 Indictment\"), Dkt. 321. Only the scheme involving COR is relevant to this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Until 2016, Percoco was a top aide to the Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 441-43. Percoco was a longtime friend of Cuomo, having served on Cuomo's staff when Cuomo was New York State's Attorney General and the U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Tr. 459, 496-97, 2130-32, 3185, 3646.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Andrew Cuomo, Percoco served as Executive Deputy Secretary in the Governor's office, also known as the Executive Chamber.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 443, 1103-05. In that position, Percoco oversaw numerous divisions within the Executive Chamber, including the divisions responsible for operations, appointments, and labor relations. Tr. 441-42, 457-58, 1103-05, 1119-20, 1248-49. By virtue of his position and his relationship to Cuomo, Percoco was known to be one of the most powerful members of the Cuomo administration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 1119-20, 1183-85, 1231-32, 2092, 2098, 2197, 3185.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In April 2014, Percoco left state employment to work full time on Cuomo's reelection campaign.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GX-1206; SYR-3832; Tr. 444, 573-75, 912-14, 1016, 1185.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although he no longer held an official position, Percoco continued to use his office and telephone in the Executive Chamber, and he continued to exercise influence over numerous state projects, operations, and personnel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , GX-571, GX-669, GX-676, GX-1507, GX-1701, GX-1702; Tr. 1127-28, 1231-35, 1249-52, 2379-80, 2410-17, 2535-37, 4964-68. According to cooperating witness Todd Howe, \"regardless of whether [Percoco] was [on] the campaign ... he had the ability to pick up the phone and get things done.\" Tr. 2098.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the summer of 2014, Empire State Development (\"ESD\"), a state agency, told COR that the company would need to enter into a \"labor peace agreement\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (\"LPA\") in order to receive a state grant to help finance a project that COR was developing in the Syracuse Inner Harbor area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GX-513, GX-551; Tr. 643-46, 660-61, 2533-34. Because COR believed that having an LPA would make the project more costly, Aiello and Gerardi, two executives at COR, sought assistance from Percoco to reverse ESD's decision to require the LPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GX-551, GX-556A, GX-1706. In late July 2014, Aiello emailed Howe, who was a consultant for COR, asking, \"[I]s there any way [Percoco] can help us with this issue while he is off the 2nd floor [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , not employed by the Governor's office] working on the Campaign[?]\" GX-550. Less than two weeks later, COR paid Percoco $15,000, routed through Howe. GX-1401I, GX1420H, GX-1606A; Tr. 2098-99, 2479-80.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Howe, Aiello, Gerardi, and Percoco exchanged a number of emails about the LPA throughout the summer and fall of 2014.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , GX-1707 (collecting emails). In October 2014, COR paid Percoco another $20,000, again routed through Howe. GX-1401J, GX-1420L, GX-1606B; Tr. 2098-99, 2483-84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In early December 2014, Gerardi reached out to Percoco through Howe because ESD was continuing to press COR to enter into an LPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GX-583, GX-586, GX-588, GX-1706. Approximately one hour later, Percoco called Andrew Kennedy, an employee in the Governor's office, and told Kennedy to stop ESD from requiring COR to enter into the LPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GX-1706; Tr. 475-76, 1272-76. Kennedy subsequently contacted an official at ESD, causing a flurry of calls and emails among the agency's staff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GX-1706; Tr. 682-85, 1274-76. The next day, ESD told COR that it would no longer require an LPA for the project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GX-590, GX-1706; Tr. 685-86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A few days later, Percoco returned to state employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GX-1206; Tr. 444, 1016. Subsequently, in mid-2015, Percoco pressured state officials to release funds that had been allocated to one of COR's projects,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   GX-1703, and, later that year, he secured a raise for Aiello's son, who worked in the Executive Chamber,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   GX-1704.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before the case was submitted to the jury, the Court asked the parties to address whether Count Eight,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which charged Percoco with extortion under color of official right,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in relation to the COR Development scheme, must be dismissed because Percoco did not hold any official position at the time that he received payments from COR Development. Tr. 3689-90. The Court entertained numerous arguments on this question in the following days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 3985-90, 4228-46, 5489-5502, 5740-61; Percoco Ltr. (Feb. 19, 2018), Dkt. 490; Gov. Ltr. (Feb. 20, 2018), Dkt. 494. At the close of all of the evidence, the Court dismissed Count Eight pursuant to Rule 29(a) and indicated that a written opinion would follow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order (Feb. 28, 2018), Dkt. 515; Tr. 5757.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court will address this question in three parts. First, does the offense require that a defendant be a \"public official,\" that is, a person who holds an official position within government, or does the offense also apply to private citizens if they wield \"unofficial\" influence and control within the government? Second, if an official position is required, at what point in time during the commission of the offense must the defendant be a public official? And third, did the facts of this case warrant sending Count Eight to the jury on the theory that, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), Percoco \"willfully caused\" others to commit extortion under color of official right?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Before joining the campaign, Percoco signed a resignation letter and left the state payroll; while employed by the campaign, Percoco no longer held any position in an official capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GX-1206; SYR-3832; Tr. 444, 573-75, 912-14, 1016, 1185. That Percoco exercised extensive influence, or even\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   control, over state government during this time is irrelevant. He was not a \"public official\" as the vast majority of courts have defined that term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   During oral arguments, the Government urged the Court to adopt the out-of-circuit dicta that suggests that private citizens \"in the process of becoming\" public officials can be liable for extortion under color of official right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 5751-53;\n   <em>\n    Saadey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9172120\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/669/#p675\">\n    393 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   675 ;\n   <em>\n    Tomblin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414296\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/46/1369/#p1383\">\n    46 F.3d at 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court declined to do so. As an initial matter, the Government offered no substantive extortion case in which this theory has actually been applied, as opposed to being discussed in dicta, and the Court's research has found none. Moreover, this was not the theory of liability on which the Government tried this case. In the ordinary case, the power of a defendant's current official position supplies the\n   coercive element of the extortion scheme. The premise of the \"in the process of becoming\" theory is that the possibility of a defendant's\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   official position can supply that coercion. Under this theory, if a person who is in the process of becoming a public official demands payments in exchange for the promise to take official acts after he assumes an official position, that person would, in effect, be using the power of his future public office to extort money. The Court expresses no opinion whether that is a legally viable theory, but even if it were, the evidence at trial showed that Percoco received payments from COR based on the expectation that he would assist COR while he was on the campaign (that is, while he was not a public official). One email, for example, expressly asked whether Percoco could help COR with state business while Percoco was \"off the 2nd floor,\" that is, out of state employment. GX-550. Percoco, then, was not using the power of his potential\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   official position to extort money from COR; he was using his\n   <em>\n    then-existing unofficial\n   </em>\n   influence and control to obtain money from COR. The coercive element of the scheme arose out of Percoco's unofficial power, which, under this Court's ruling, is not sufficient to support a charge of extortion under color of official right. Under the facts of this case, viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, no reasonable jury could conclude that Percoco committed extortion while \"in the process\" of becoming a public official, even assuming that were a viable theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

This Court holds, therefore, that in order to commit extortion under color of official right, a defendant must hold an official position either\n   (a) at the time that an extortionate payment is made or (b) at some relevant time before the payment, such as at the time that the defendant enters into a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   arrangement or otherwise makes a demand for payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The theory behind the offense compels this conclusion. If the defendant's official position is the source of the coercive force that pries open a victim's wallet and extorts a payment, then, logically, that coercive force must be in place at or before the time that the payment is made. And the Supreme Court's statement that \"fulfillment of the\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   is not an element of the offense\" makes clear that all elements of the offense must occur by the time the extortion payment is made, regardless of when, if ever, the\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   is fulfilled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728850\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/255/#p268\">\n    504 U.S. at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11728850\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/255/#p268\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, the evidence showed that a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   arrangement between Percoco, on the one hand, and Aiello and Gerardi, on the other, began to materialize sometime in the early summer of 2014 (signaling the earliest possible time that the offense could have begun).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 2093-97; GX-1707 (collecting emails).

Percoco was employed by Cuomo's campaign-not New York State-between April and December 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   GX-1206; SYR-3832; Tr. 444, 1016.

Gov.'s Request to Charge at 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.

To support this theory, the Government cited numerous cases holding that extortion can be a \"continuing offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, 23. But every case that the Government cited for this point-and many other cases applying the continuing offense doctrine to extortion under color of official right-involve a stream of multiple payments made periodically.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast,\n   the COR Development scheme involved only two payments, and neither occurred when Percoco was employed by the state. Taking this fact together with\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   's admonition that the offense is complete at the time of the payment, the Court is unable to hold that this offense continued past the time of the last purportedly-extortionate payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In sum, because the Government failed to prove that Percoco was a public official at the time that he accepted payments from COR Development or at the time that payment was demanded, the Government failed to prove a necessary element of Count Eight.
