He visited TLT's King of Prussia site on one occasion to observe a prospective safety consultant demonstrate a training session for TLT's delivery associates. On a separate occasion he conducted several interviews with prospective hires during a job fair held at a DoubleTree Hotel in Philadelphia, although the interviews were for positions as drivers at TLT's Swedesboro, New Jersey location.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-23\">\n     <strong>\n      1. Defendant Foreman\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-24\">\n     Defendant Foreman has had numerous contacts with Pennsylvania related to TLT's expansion into the state. In his deposition, Foreman stated that he traveled to Philadelphia over the last three years at least twenty times for both personal and business reasons. Foreman Dep. 47:1-13, ECF No. 44-4. His contacts with Pennsylvania involved workforce management. In July 2016, TLT decided to expand its operations into Pennsylvania, beginning with a location in King of Prussia, PA. In his Declaration, Foreman stated that TLT held a job fair event in King of Prussia in July 2016, that he attended the event, and that he \"conducted about less than twenty interviews for applicants who wanted to work for TL Transportation LLC at its facility in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.\" During the interviews, Foreman \"explained how the applicants would be paid,\" though he \"did not negotiate over any issue relating to their pay or payroll.\" Foreman Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-15, ECF No. 35-2. In his deposition, Foreman verified that these statements were accurate, Foreman Dep. 58:14-60:1, and further elaborated that he told the applicants during the interviews that they would receive an hourly rate and \"also earn a guarantee of two overtime hours a day,\"\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     at 60:6-15.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-25\">\n     Additionally, Foreman traveled to Pennsylvania to oversee the company's daily operations. He states: \"In order to get the King of Prussia facility operating, I occasionally traveled to Pennsylvania for TL Transportation LLC purposes from my home in Maryland. On these trips, I usually meet with managers and other on-site personnel. I do not usually meet with drivers, though I will exchange pleasantries with drivers if I see them on my visit.\" Foreman Decl. \u00b6 16. TLT's managers and supervisors \"oversee day-to-day operations\" at the company's Pennsylvania facilities.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 22. At one point, Foreman traveled to Pennsylvania to attend a meeting with a safety consultant to discuss a program for improving driver safety. Foreman Dep. 64:3-66:23. In addition to its King of Prussia facility, TLT expanded its operation to two additional locations in Pennsylvania, Langhorne and Port Richmond. Foreman stated that he visited all\n     three facilities,\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     at 47:20-48:11, and that, for a period of time, he visited the facilities about three to four times per month,\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     at 48:23-49:7.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-35\">\n     <strong>\n      2. Defendant Lowe\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-36\">\n     Admittedly, Defendant Lowe has had fewer contacts with Pennsylvania than Defendant Foreman. Yet, given his role in establishing TLT's pay policy and his position within the company, combined with his business-related contacts with Pennsylvania, Lowe could fairly anticipate defending himself in wage and hour litigation brought in this forum. As explained above, a top-ranking manager need only engage in management and supervisory activities in a forum to be subject to personal jurisdiction for wage and hour claims.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-38\">\n     As with Foreman, these contacts are related to Plaintiffs' claims. Lowe entered Pennsylvania to observe how the consultant interacted with TLT's employees, specifically at the location in King of Prussia. According to Foreman, he and Lowe decided to hire a consultant because TLT \"always strive[s] to be a better company and to put safer people on the road.\" Foreman Dep. 65:7-16. Additionally, Foreman stated that he had become aware through customer complaints of \"a number of incidents with respect to unsafe driving,\" specifically in Pennsylvania.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 65:18-66:13. Lowe's involvement in hiring a safety consultant furthered the company's expansion into Pennsylvania, as well as its efforts to regulate workplace conditions generally, and thus constitutes a significant contact that is related to Plaintiffs' wage and hour claims. Just one contact with a forum can give rise to personal jurisdiction if it \"creates a 'substantial connection' with the forum.\"\n     <em>\n      Burger King\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p472\">\n      471 U.S. at\n     </extracted-citation>\n     476 n.18,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p472\">\n      105 S.Ct. 2174\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ;\n     <em>\n      Miller Yacht\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9181491\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/93/#p97\">\n      384 F.3d at 96\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . Lowe's meeting in Pennsylvania was intended to produce lasting improvements in the company's performance, and alter the ways delivery associates carried out their work, thus establishing\n     a meaningful connection with Pennsylvania. Because the meeting involved employee performance, I find that it relates to the claims in this case.\n    </p>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n     <attorneys id=\"p-56\">\n      Though his Declaration mentioned numerous contacts with Pennsylvania,\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      Lowe Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 16-17, ECF No. 35-3, Lowe retreated in his subsequent deposition, contending that he in fact traveled to Pennsylvania only two times for business related to TLT. In his deposition, in direct contradiction to his Declaration, Lowe stated that he did not travel to King of Prussia, PA, to attend a TLT job fair,\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304595\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/918/24/#p30\">\n        id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304595\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/918/24/#p30\">\n       at 78:16-79:20\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , did not visit the King of Prussia location to meet with managers, and did not travel to Pennsylvania \"once every couple of months\" for work-related purposes,\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304595\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/918/24/#p30\">\n        id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304595\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/918/24/#p30\">\n       at 80:10-82:18\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .

Plaintiffs are employees who worked for Defendants as delivery associates in Pennsylvania [hereinafter the \"Pennsylvania Plaintiffs\"] and Maryland [hereinafter the \"Maryland Plaintiffs\"]. Plaintiffs filed this action in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which raises the question of whether Pennsylvania courts may assert personal jurisdiction over corporate officers who reside in Maryland. Those defendants have filed a Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction, arguing that their contacts with Pennsylvania are not related to Plaintiffs' claims arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws. As to the Pennsylvania Plaintiffs, I disagree, and find both individual defendants' business-related contacts with this forum related to Plaintiffs' wage and hour claims, and their respective contacts sufficient to justify personal jurisdiction. The Maryland Plaintiffs' claim under their state's wage and hour laws will be dismissed, however, because Plaintiffs have not shown these claims to be related to Foreman and Lowe's contacts with Pennsylvania.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      <strong>\n       I. Pertinent Background\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      Plaintiff Tyhee Hickman worked as a delivery associate for Defendant TL Transportation [hereinafter \"TLT\"] in Pennsylvania from November 2016 through March 2017, and Plaintiff Shanay Bolden worked for TLT in Maryland from January 2016 through July 2016. TLT is a delivery service provider that operates under a contract with Defendant Amazon Logistics, Inc. In their work for TLT, Plaintiffs drove delivery trucks, and delivered packages from Amazon warehouses to its customers. Plaintiffs allege that they received payment for their work based on a \"day rate,\" and argue that this compensation did not include overtime payment as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act [hereinafter \"FLSA\"], and applicable state wage and hour laws.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      Defendant TLT is run by two individuals, Defendants Herschell Lowe and Scott Foreman. Foreman has been an owner and Vice President of TLT since spring 2015, and Lowe has served as President over the same period. Foreman and Lowe began their work for TLT by expanding the company's business within Maryland, Virginia, and New Jersey, and they later secured an agreement with Amazon to provide delivery services in Pennsylvania. They began doing business at their first Pennsylvania location in summer 2016, operating out of an Amazon warehouse in King of Prussia.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      When TLT opened its King of Prussia operation, it already had a companywide pay policy in place. Plaintiffs allege that the payroll policy, which dated to July 2015, provided for a per-day rate of payment to delivery associates for each day that an associate worked, with the Maryland employees receiving a rate of $160 per day, and the Pennsylvania employees receiving $152 per day, regardless of the number of hours worked in a day.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Am. Compl. \u00b6 58, ECF No. 34. Foreman reports that he and Lowe made all business decisions, including payroll, human resources, and management decisions, in Maryland.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      In connection with TLT's expansion, Foreman took regular trips to Pennsylvania, visiting each of the Pennsylvania facilities TLT opened. During these trips, he met with Amazon officials, TLT's managers, and held safety meetings. Foreman stated in his deposition: \"I have site managers\n      and a regional manager. So I'm just coming up to meet with them.\" Foreman Dep. 49:4-14, ECF No. 44-4.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      Despite their business-related contacts with this forum, Defendants Foreman and Lowe contend that their work-related contacts with Pennsylvania were not sufficiently related to Plaintiffs' wage and hour claims to allow a court in Pennsylvania to assert personal jurisdiction over them. Defendants also argue that, because the Maryland Plaintiffs had no contact with Pennsylvania in connection with their work for TLT, Foreman and Lowe's contacts with Pennsylvania were not related to the Maryland Plaintiffs' wage and hour claims.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      <strong>\n       II.

Personal Jurisdiction over Pennsylvania Plaintiffs' Claims\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-22\">\n      Defendants Foreman and Lowe assert that jurisdiction is not proper because Plaintiffs' claims do not arise from or relate to either individual's contacts with Pennsylvania, largely relying on the theory that Plaintiffs' FLSA and Pennsylvania Minimum Wage Act (PMWA) claims concern managerial decisions that Foreman and Lowe made in Maryland. Defs.' Br. 10-11, ECF No. 35-1. I find this argument without merit. Both Foreman and Lowe's contacts with Pennsylvania involved their employees' working conditions, and thereby provide a sufficient basis for jurisdiction over all claims the Pennsylvania Plaintiffs have asserted against them.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-26\">\n      Foreman's contacts with Pennsylvania have been extensive. The question, then, is whether these contacts were sufficiently related to Plaintiffs' claims to satisfy the requirements of due process. Defendants note that Foreman's activity in Pennsylvania did not specifically involve any decisions related to the company's wage and hour policies, and argue that this is fatal to personal jurisdiction in this case.

Foreman traveled to Pennsylvania to \"get the King of Prussia facility operating,\" and \"met with managers and other on-site personnel\" on these trips. Foreman Decl. \u00b6 16; Foreman Dep. 64:5-20. His contacts with Pennsylvania were clearly important to TLT's efforts in opening its King of Prussia facility. Because Plaintiff Hickman's wage and hour claims concern work he performed from this facility, Foreman's on-site involvement in setting up the King of Prussia operation has a close causative connection to Hickman's claims.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-28\">\n      Foreman's contacts with the forum also have a causal relationship to the damages arising from the alleged wage and hour violations. Foreman oversees managers, who in turn run TLT's day-to-day business in Philadelphia; his oversight ultimately relates to the schedules and hours that delivery associates work. Liability under the FLSA and the PMWA turns on the number of hours an employee has worked in a given week or day.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n       29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (a)(2) (providing that an employer may not have an employee work for more than forty hours in a week without overtime compensation). Indeed, in response to Plaintiffs' allegations, Defendants in part argue that the drivers did not \"regularly\" work more than forty hours per week, and as a result were not entitled to overtime wages.\n      <em>\n       See, e.g.\n      </em>\n      , Def. TLT's Answer \u00b6 55, ECF No. 55. Additionally, the value of damages in this case will rise or fall depending on the number of hours employees worked in excess of forty hours in a week.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-29\">\n      Given Foreman's conduct within Pennsylvania, jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' wage and hour claims is both reasonably proportional to his contacts with the forum and a foreseeable outcome. When Foreman traveled to Pennsylvania to oversee TLT's operations, he benefitted from state laws that allowed the business to operate within the forum. And by meeting with supervisors and greeting employees during his visits to sites in Pennsylvania, Foreman engaged in conduct that furthered TLT's management of its workforce. That certainly \"related to\" the wages that TLT's workforce receives.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-30\">\n      In short, I am persuaded that contacts with the forum that influence hiring, the conditions of employment, and the hours an employee works in a day or a week, are sufficiently related to wage and hour clams to give rise to personal jurisdiction in that forum.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-31\">\n      The cases on which the defense relies do not persuade me to the contrary.

Consequently, these cases are of limited precedential value, particularly where the Third Circuit has made clear that jurisdiction is not limited to cases where a claim \"arises out of\" a defendant's contacts.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-32\">\n      Defendants also cite\n      <em>\n       Pieretti v.

In my view,\n      <em>\n       Walden\n      </em>\n      , which was unanimous, is best understood as an error-correcting decision by the Court, not one that posited new limitations on specific jurisdiction.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-34\">\n      I also find jurisdiction over Foreman consistent with \"fair play and substantial justice.\" On this point, Defendants rely on the conclusory assertion that Pennsylvania has little interest in this dispute.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Defs.' Mot. 14. To the contrary, the state's interest is significant. After all, the Pennsylvania Plaintiffs are proceeding in part under the state's wage and hour laws, which Pennsylvania enacted to afford rights and guarantees to employees working in the state. The state has a significant interest in regulating local labor markets and the conduct of employers operating within\n      Pennsylvania, as well as protecting workers from violations of federal and state wage standards. Additionally, Defendant Foreman will not face significant inconvenience in defending this litigation in Pennsylvania. As evidenced by his many trips to this forum, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania is easily accessible from Maryland.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-37\">\n      Lowe has had two significant contacts with Pennsylvania.\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      He traveled to Pennsylvania once in fall 2016 to interview a prospective safety consultant, and another time in spring 2016 to interview drivers to work at a TLT location in Swedesboro, New Jersey. Lowe Dep. 66:6-69:5, 69:20-74:17, 74:24-76:22, ECF No. 44-5. Lowe admitted that he met with the consultant in Pennsylvania so he could watch the consultant present his training program to TLT employees and decide whether it was \"useful.\"\n      <em>\n       See id.\n      </em>\n      at 69:20-71:19. In Pennsylvania, Lowe observed the consultant \"going over safety tips\" with \"all of our drivers.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 74:10-13. In the session, the consultant discussed various aspects of driver safety: \"Following distance. Blind spots. Backing up. An array of safety things.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 74:14-15. Lowe also indicated that TLT decided to hire the consultant.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 72:2-3.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-39\">\n      Lowe also entered Pennsylvania to hold interviews in Philadelphia in spring 2016 to further the expansion of TLT. Lowe held the interviews in a DoubleTree Hotel in Philadelphia, and met with five applicants, Lowe Dep. at 76:11-18, though he contended that he interviewed applicants for positions only in TLT's Swedesboro, New Jersey location,\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      at 74:24-75:12, 76:19-22. But as Foreman acknowledged in his deposition, after TLT shuttered its Swedesboro facility, it transferred its New Jersey employees to Pennsylvania to staff its new King of Prussia location. Foreman Dep. 62:3-21. Lowe interviewed delivery associates for the Swedesboro location not long before the facility closed in November or December 2016.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Lowe Dep. 75:17-21. This illustrates the regional and interconnected nature of TLT's business. As the transfer of employees between locations indicates, an employee TLT hired to work in Swedesboro, roughly twenty-five miles away from Philadelphia, and a little over thirty miles from King of Prussia, could later be moved to a Pennsylvania location. In this respect, the interviews Lowe conducted in this forum are better understood as furthering the expansion of TLT's workforce within the Delaware Valley metropolitan region, lending additional support to finding Lowe's contacts related to the Pennsylvania Plaintiffs' wage and hour claims.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-40\">\n      Defendant Lowe's role in formulating the company's wage policy further justifies personal jurisdiction. Lowe admitted that he was involved in deciding the pay rate the delivery associates received. Lowe Dep. 53:24-54:6. Lowe was also involved in communicating with Amazon about expanding into Pennsylvania, signed a \"work order\" agreeing to provide delivery services for Amazon in Pennsylvania, and decided with Foreman on the locations TLT would open in the state.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 31:23-37:6. Though Lowe and Foreman developed and instituted the pay policy before TLT decided to expand its operations into Pennsylvania, they directed the policy at employees in the state by opening Pennsylvania facilities and hiring delivery associates at the new locations.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Foreman Dep. 14:20-16:20; Foreman Decl. \u00b6 14. When Lowe entered this forum, he did so to support the expansion of TLT's business, which was subject to the pay policies he designed.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-41\">\n      As a TLT executive, Lowe benefited from the company's expansion into the state, and he entered the forum in furtherance of that interest. I thus find jurisdiction over Lowe proportional to his contacts with Pennsylvania, and that he could fairly anticipate defending himself against wage and hour litigation initiated by Pennsylvania employees.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-42\">\n      For the same reasons set forth above, jurisdiction over Defendant Lowe would also comport with fair play and substantial justice. Lowe would not be unduly inconvenienced by defending himself in this forum.

Furthermore, as Plaintiffs rightly note, another District of Columbia court later declined to follow\n      <em>\n       Shay\n      </em>\n      in a FLSA case similar to this action,\n      <em>\n       Douglas v. Chariots for Hire\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304595\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/918/24/#p30\">\n       918 F.Supp.2d 24\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 30 (D.D.C. 2013). There, the court found that venue was proper where the employees performed a \"substantial percentage\" of their work within the venue, even though the employer made all company policy decisions in another state.\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304595\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/918/24/#p30\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <footnotemark>\n       3\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-51\">\n      Because a substantial part of the events giving rise to Plaintiffs' claims in Counts I, II, and IV occurred in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Venue is denied.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-52\">\n      <strong>\n       IV. Conclusion\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-53\">\n      Defendants' Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction is granted only as to the Maryland Plaintiffs' claim in Count III against Defendants Foreman and Lowe. The Maryland Plaintiffs nonetheless remain parties to this action, as Defendants TLT, Amazon Logistics, and Amazon.com have not raised any challenges to jurisdiction. Defendants' Motions are denied in all other respects.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-57\">\n      To be clear, Defendants have not suggested that\n      <em>\n       Bristol-Myers\n      </em>\n      requires dismissal of Plaintiff Bolden's FLSA claims. There are also compelling reasons to doubt that the reasoning in\n      <em>\n       Bristol-Myers\n      </em>\n      applies to the claims of putative class members who worked for TLT in Maryland. Unlike the mass tort action arising under state law in\n      <em>\n       Bristol-Myers\n      </em>\n      , this is an opt-in class action arising under a federal statute that applies to all fifty states. Furthermore, the Supreme Court in\n      <em>\n       Bristol-Myers\n      </em>\n      specifically reserved for another day the question of \"whether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal court.\"\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n       137 S.Ct. at 1784\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . Based on these distinctions, many district courts faced with this issue have convincingly found that\n      <em>\n       Bristol-Myers\n      </em>\n      does not prevent a plaintiff in federal court from asserting federal claims on behalf of a nationwide class.\n      <em>\n       See, e.g.\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <em>\n       Swamy v.

Cal. 2017) (finding that \"\n      <em>\n       Bristol-Myers\n      </em>\n      does not apply to divest courts of personal jurisdiction in FLSA collective actions\");\n      <em>\n       Chernus v. Logitech, Inc.\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201981481\">\n       2018 WL 1981481\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , at *7 (D.N.J. 2018) (\"[M]ost of the courts that have encountered this issue have found that\n      <em>\n       Bristol-Myers\n      </em>\n      does not apply in the federal class action context.\").\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-58\">\n      As to Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim in Count IV, Defendants seem to imply that venue is improper because it would be based solely on the fact that Plaintiffs experienced an economic harm within the forum, and argue that this harm alone is an insufficient basis for venue.

But this ignores the fact that Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims also arise from facts relating to their work in Pennsylvania.\n     </p>\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
