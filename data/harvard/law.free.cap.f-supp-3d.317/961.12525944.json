Dlott, Judge\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendant Minute Key Inc.'s Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law. (Doc. 255.) Plaintiff, The Hillman Group, Inc., has filed a memorandum in opposition (Doc. 264), to which Minute Key has replied (Doc. 267). For the reasons that follow, Defendant's Motion will be DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This litigation-between competitors in the self-service, automatic key duplication industry\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -began on October 1, 2013 as a patent case. Hillman filed a Complaint against Minute Key, seeking a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C532%2C809%20B2\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,532,809 B2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '809 patent\"). (Doc. 1.) Minute Key answered and asserted a counterclaim of infringement. (Doc. 14.) In an effort to conclude the dispute, Minute Key moved to dismiss its counterclaim with prejudice (Doc. 28) and to dismiss the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction (Doc. 29). Hillman opposed both motions (Docs. 32, 33), prompting Minute Key to provide Hillman with a covenant not to sue. (Doc. 35-1 at PageID 321.) Thereafter, Hillman conceded that the covenant not to sue divested the Court of jurisdiction over its non-infringement claim, but argued that jurisdiction remained to determine the validity of the patent. (Doc. 39 at PageID 1380-81.) At this point Hillman also filed a motion to amend its Complaint to add a claim for false advertising and misrepresentation under the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B), and a claim for violation of the Ohio Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\"ODTPA\"), Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 4165.02(A)(10). (Doc. 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court granted Minute Key's motion to voluntarily dismiss its infringement counterclaim. (Doc. 55 at PageID 770-72.) And, in light of the voluntary dismissal and the covenant not to sue, the Court determined that it no longer had jurisdiction over Hillman's remaining invalidity claim and granted Minute Key's Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 772-77.) However, the Court also granted Hillman leave to amend its Complaint to add the Lanham Act and ODTPA claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 777-79.) Thus, pending as of September 4, 2014 were Hillman's allegations that Minute Key knowingly made false and misleading representations of fact concerning Hillman's FastKey kiosk to Walmart-the parties' mutual customer-in order to gain a business advantage. (Docs. 56 (SEALED)/58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Two revised scheduling orders later (Docs. 71, 84), Minute Key moved for summary judgment. (Docs. 118 (SEALED)/119.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It argued that Hillman could not establish the first element of proof in a Lanham Act case, urging that its communications with Walmart regarding patent infringement by Hillman were statements of opinion rather than statements of fact. It also argued that, regardless, the statements were not sufficiently disseminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition, Minute Key maintained that Hillman could not demonstrate that Minute Key's claim of patent infringement was \"objectively baseless.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Minute Key contended that Walmart's license agreement with Hillman concerning placement of Hillman's FastKey kiosks undermined recovery of any damages sought in connection with its unfair competition claim. With respect to each premise, the Court concluded that genuine issues of material fact existed, and, accordingly, on July 8, 2016, denied Minute Key's motion. (Doc. 136.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court held a Final Pretrial Conference in this civil action the same day it released its Order denying summary judgment. At that time, the Court agreed to allow the parties to brief the issue of whether a claim construction of the '809 patent, otherwise known as a\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   hearing, was necessary before proceeding to trial before a jury on August 22, 2016. Minute Key argued that it was (Doc. 138), while Hillman maintained that it was not (Doc. 139). Minute Key's argument was reminiscent of its argument made in support of summary judgment: The statements that Hillman believed to be actionable were statements about patent infringement. To prevail, therefore, Hillman must demonstrate that the statements were \"objectively baseless\" as part of the bad-faith requirement established in\n   <em>\n    Zenith Elec. Corp. v. Exzec, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11551150\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/182/1340/\">\n    182 F.3d 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 1999). That determination depended, in turn, on whether the infringement accusation was \"so unreasonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it would succeed.\"\n   <em>\n    iLOR, LLC v. Google, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085311\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/1372/#p1378\">\n    631 F.3d 1372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2011). In Minute Key's view, Hillman could not establish objective baselessness without first proving that its FastKey kiosk does not infringe the minuteKEY kiosk. And to meet that burden, Minute Key insisted that the claim terms in dispute must be construed by the Court in advance of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hillman countered that a claim construction was not necessary when the claim terms-\"fully-automatic\" and \"fully automatic\"-were clear on their face.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, to do so, Hillman believed, would usurp the role of the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hillman also maintained that the Court should decline to construe the claim terms because technical people skilled in the art used them consistent with their plain meaning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Minute Key representatives\n   had repeatedly characterized their own kiosk as being fully automatic because it does not require user involvement, and Hillman agreed. And they had repeatedly characterized Hillman's FastKey kiosk as\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   fully automatic because it\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   require user involvement, and Hillman again agreed. Accordingly, Hillman contended there was no dispute at the time the infringement statements were made among those of skill in this art as to what \"fully automatic\" does and does not cover.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court, siding with Hillman, concluded that a claim construction was not necessary. (Doc. 140.) It found that the claim terms \"fully-automatic\" and \"fully automatic\" were not technically complex and had a plain meaning that a jury, the rightful trier of fact, could and would understand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After a two-day hearing with respect to deposition designations, the jury trial in this matter began on August 24, 2016. It ended with a verdict returned in Hillman's favor on September 7, 2016. Answering a series of interrogatories, the jury found that Hillman proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Minute Key made a \"literally false\" statement of fact to Walmart about Hillman's FastKey kiosk; that Minute Key's statement actually deceived, or was likely to deceive, Walmart; that Minute Key's deception was material in that it was likely to influence purchasing decisions by Walmart; and that Minute Key's statement resulted in actual or probable injury to Hillman. (Verdict Form, Doc. 240 at PageID 12464.) The jury also found that Hillman proved, by the higher standard of clear and convincing evidence, that Minute Key knew that Hillman's FastKey kiosk did not infringe the '809 patent but nonetheless represented to Walmart that it did. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 12465.) The jury awarded Hillman damages in the amount of $164,072 with respect to the September 27, 2013 \"rollout freeze\" at Walmart. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 12466.) This amount, however, was only one-half of the amount ($328,144) computed by Hillman's opinion witness regarding the freeze.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the jury declined to award any damages to Hillman because of lost placement of FastKey kiosks beyond the initial 1,000 awarded\n   by Walmart from February 2014 to the present\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   because of Minute Key kiosk placements beyond the initial 400 awarded by Walmart. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085311\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/1372/#p1378\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The jury's verdict, therefore, was only a partial victory for Hillman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Minute Key moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(2) after the close of Hillman's case-in-chief and again after the close of all of the evidence but before submission of the case to the jury. In the wake of the jury's verdict, Minute Key now renews its Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The standard for a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) is the same as one under Rule 50(a) made during trial. Such a motion \"may only be granted if, when viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, giving that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences, there is no genuine issue of material fact for the jury, and reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion in favor of the moving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnes v.

The court \"may not weigh the evidence, question the credibility of witnesses, or substitute [its] own judgment for that of the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Further, the court \"must indulge all presumptions in favor of the validity of the jury's verdict, and should refrain from interfering with a jury's verdict unless it is clear that the jury reached a seriously erroneous result.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Nashville Network\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11889897,11889978\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/132/1123/\">\n    132 F.3d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1131 (6th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 43 of the Lanham Act permits a civil action against \"[a]ny person, who on or in connection with any goods or services, ... uses in commerce any ... false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which ... in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, characteristics, [or] qualities[ ] ... of his or her or another person's goods, services, or commercial activities[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). This type of claim is commonly known as a \"false advertising\" claim. Likewise, under the ODTPA, a civil action may be filed when \"[a] person ...[,] in the course of the person's business, vocation, or occupation, ... [d]isparages the goods, services, or business of another by false representation of fact[.]\" Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 4165.02(A)(10). Courts \"evaluate an Ohio deceptive trade practices claim under the same analysis as that used for Lanham Act claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Papa Ads, LLC v.

Thus, as we noted at the summary judgment stage (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 136 at PageID 7817), Hillman's federal and state claims rise or fall together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To succeed on an unfair competition claim, a plaintiff generally must establish the following elements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1) the defendant made false or misleading statements of fact concerning [its] own product or another's; 2) the statement actually or tends to deceive a substantial portion of the intended audience; 3) the statement is material in that it will likely influence the deceived consumer's purchasing decisions; 4) the advertisements were introduced into interstate commerce; and 5) there is some causal link between the challenged statements and harm to the plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Am.

The patent to be issued next Tuesday is only the tip of the iceberg of our intellectual property, and there are many more on the way. Our shareholders expect, and are entitled to, a meaningful return on their investments, and this can be achieved only if our intellectual property is enforced against imitators. It is flattering to be imitated by others, but it also is evidence of the significance of the contribution that MinuteKey's technology has made to the industry, and our technology must be protected.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Not sure how Hillman will respond to the notice but wanted to give you a heads up as you roll out self service key duplicating kiosks into your stores.

However, the Court also instructed the jury that bad faith could be proved \"through a different method, one that has both objective and subjective components.\" (Trial Tr. at 9-21:3-5, Doc. 238 at PageID 12339; Doc. 264-1 at PageID 13077.) Continuing:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    The objective component requires a showing by Hillman by clear and convincing evidence that Minute Key's infringement allegation to Walmart was objectively baseless. An allegation is objectively baseless if a reasonable company could not realistically expect to succeed in litigation on the merits of its infringement allegation.

If you find that Minute Key's infringement allegation to Walmart was objectively baseless, then you may continue to the second component of bad faith, one that allows you to consider subjective intent.

In this regard, you may consider evidence of Minute Key's motivation, including whether its allegation of patent infringement by Hillman was an attempt to interfere with Hillman's business relationship with Walmart.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    (Trial Tr. at 9-21:5-23, Doc. 238 at PageID 12339; Doc. 264-1 at PageID 13077.)

The second paragraph of this instruction, emphasized above, was proposed by Minute Key at the charge conference as a substitute for the sentence, \"Each 'claim' element of the '809 patent, all of which require a 'fully-automatic' kiosk, would have to be found in Hillman's FastKey kiosk-the 'accused' infringing product-in order for the '809 patent to be infringed.\" (Trial Tr. at 8-18:10-8-24:23, Doc. 231 at PageID 12279-85; Doc. 267 at PageID 13487.) Hillman objected. (Trial Tr. at 8-24:19-20, Doc. 231 at PageID 12285 (\"Your Honor, we object. We think your instruction as written is the correct one.\").)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Finally, all three of these instructions were preceded by an introductory one:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    As you have heard during the trial, this case originally began as a patent case. Hillman filed a lawsuit asking this Court to declare that its FastKey kiosk did not infringe the '809 patent belonging to Minute Key. Minute Key responded by filing a counterclaim asking the Court to\n    declare that the FastKey kiosk did infringe its '809 patent. Eventually both of those claims were dismissed, and what remains for your deliberations are only Hillman's federal and state claims of false advertising against Minute Key. In this case, therefore,\n    <strong>\n     you are not being asked to decide whether Hillman's FastKey kiosk infringed the '809 patent. Rather, you are being asked to decide whether the infringement allegations made by Minute Key to Walmart were made in bad faith.\n    </strong>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    A patent holder is permitted under the law to make statements about its patent rights and about infringers that are true. A patent holder is even allowed to make representations that turn out to be false or misleading as long as the representations are not made in bad faith.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    (Trial Tr. 9-19:4-21, Doc. 238 at PageID 12337 (emphasis added).) Neither party objected to this instruction. (Trial Tr. 8-17:15-8-18:9, Doc. 231 at PageID 12278-79.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Minute Key's Repackaged Arguments Regarding Claim Construction Fail\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    For the jury to find a clear case of bad faith, Minute Key contends that \"the jury first must have conducted its own claim construction in Hillman's favor and, then, simply compared the kiosks to each other.\" (Doc. 255 at PageID 12696-97.) This was error, it believes, for two reasons. First, a jury cannot perform claim construction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Markman,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744942\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/370/\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744942\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/370/\">\n     517 U.S. at 372\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744942\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/370/\">\n     116 S.Ct. 1384\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Second, product-to-product comparison is improper when analyzing infringement.\n    <em>\n     Zenith Labs. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515429\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/1418/#p1423\">\n     19 F.3d 1418\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1423 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Hillman responds that \"Minute Key's motion attempts to yet again re-litigate claim construction, consistent with virtually every paper it has filed in this case since losing summary judgment.\" (Doc. 264 at PageID 13028.) We agree with Hillman. Minute Key's well-written reprise notwithstanding, the Court will not revisit this issue again.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The July 22, 2016 Order Denying Minute Key's Request for a Claim Construction of the '809 Patent informed the jury instructions. Pretrial, this Court observed: \"Among other things, a jury will be asked to decide whether a reasonable litigant could have believed it would succeed on the infringement allegations made in 2013 by Minute Key to Walmart about Hillman. That question can be answered\n    <strong>\n     without construing\n    </strong>\n    the plain language claim terms 'fully-automatic' and 'fully automatic' in the '809 Patent some three years after the allegations were made.\" (Doc. 140 at PageID 7920 (emphasis added).) At trial, the instructions were so tailored. The jury was succinctly told what it was-and was not-being asked to decide. It was told that it was\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    being asked to decide whether Hillman's FastKey kiosk actually infringed Minute Key's '809 patent. It was told\n    <em>\n     instead\n    </em>\n    that it was being asked to decide whether Minute Key's infringement allegations about Hillman's FastKey kiosk made to Walmart in 2013 were made in bad faith. To this end, and by way of background, the jury was instructed that a patent cannot be infringed if even a single\n    <em>\n     claim element\n    </em>\n    is missing from an accused infringing product; that the parties disputed whether the patent claims at issue required a \"fully-automatic\" kiosk in order for the '809 patent to be infringed; and that, in the case of the '809 patent, the\n    <em>\n     claim element\n    </em>\n    \"fully automatic\" should be given its plain meaning. These instructions, considered together, allow a reasonable jury to conclude that a kiosk that is not \"fully automatic\"-based on that\n    <em>\n     claim element\n    </em>\n    's plain meaning-cannot infringe\n    Minute Key's '809 patent for purposes of a Lanham Act false advertising claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The parties devote considerable attention in their briefs to wordsmithing the charge conference. On appeal, of course, the transcript will stand on its own. Minute Key is absolutely correct when it recounts that the Court did not engage in a claim construction. But Minute Key persistently ignores the reason why. The Court did not engage in a claim construction\n    <em>\n     because one was not needed.\n    </em>\n    The Court did not engage in a claim construction because the claim terms \"fully-automatic\" and \"fully automatic\" were not \"technically complex\" and had a \"plain meaning\" that a jury \"c[ould] and w[ould] understand.\" (Doc. 140 at PageID 7919.) The jury was instructed, without objection from Minute Key, that it should \"give the claim [element] 'fully automatic' its plain meaning.\" The sentence the Court allowed Minute Key to substitute-the one concerning the parties \"dispute\" about whether the patent claims require a \"fully-automatic\" kiosk in order for the '809 patent to be infringed-does not, as Minute Key insists, convert the jury's deliberation into a claim construction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <strong>\n     4. Minute Key's Marketing Documents\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    In Minute Key's view, any evidence contained in its marketing documents is \"legally irrelevant\" to the reasonableness of its allegation to Walmart. (Doc. 255 at PageID 12698-99.) Hillman correctly recalls that Minute Key made a nearly identical argument during summary judgment that the Court rejected. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 136 at PageID 7824-26 (declining to apply\n    <em>\n     iLOR\n    </em>\n    's holding that a blog entry was irrelevant to the issue of objective baselessness,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085311\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/1372/#p1378\">\n     631 F.3d at 1380\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , because here, in contrast to\n    <em>\n     iLOR\n    </em>\n    , marketplace representation is the heart of the cause of action).) As it did on the question of claim construction, the Court declines to reexamine this issue. Further, this Court did not then-and does not now-rule that \"[m]arketing documents may be considered as part of the subjective component of bad faith only\n    <strong>\n     after\n    </strong>\n    an objective analysis is conducted.\" (Doc. 267 at PageID 13491 (emphasis in original) (citing\n    <em>\n     800 Adept, Inc. v.

This assertion appeared one line below\n    another statement that Minute Key's only \"current competition\" was \"Fast Key.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    One week later, during a meeting with Walmart on January 24, 2013, Minute Key presented a chart titled \"Competition\" with a field for \"Customer Experience.\" (PX-36 at PX-36-0001, PX-36-0016.) Next to the line item \"Fully Automated,\" an entry of \"No-'Make your own key' \" appeared for FastKey and \"Yes-'We copy your key' \" for Minute Key.

Fagundo admitted, however, that he never provided any of the marketing documents to attorney Rudisill. (Trial Tr. at 6-45:19-24 (\"No. I think I was paying them enough for the patent review not to review the marketing documents.\"), Doc. 222 at PageID 11915.) In order \"to obtain a clear understanding of Minute Key's allegations\" via \"an identification of the specific parts or components of the Hillman equipment that Minute Key believes infringes and the specific claims Minute Key alleges are being infringed,\" Walmart Associate General Counsel Rosalyn Mitchell asked Rudisill to prepare a claim chart.

Notably, the field next to the first claim, \"A network of self-service, fully-automatic kiosks for duplicating keys, said network comprising[,]\" was left blank, as was the field next to the claim numbered 15, \"A method of duplicating keys in a network of self-service, fully automatic kiosks at different locations, each having[.]\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The absent patent attorney in this case, whom Minute Key curiously did not bring to trial, cannot save Minute Key on the question of bad faith.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    To its credit, Minute Key grudgingly concedes that \"the record evidence could demonstrate at most only the subjective component of bad faith, even in a 'clear case' analysis.\" (Doc. 255 at PageID 12700.) Indeed, it could:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n    Setting the stage, and after learning in April 2012 that it would be required to compete against Hillman in the form of a 100-store to 100-store, head-to-head pilot to secure future Walmart business, Minute Key board member and investor Frick asked CEO Fagundo \"if there is any way we can use the patent application to create some FUD with Walmart re Hillman.\" (PX-82 at PX-82-0001-0002.) Fagundo testified at trial that \"FUD\" is an acronym for \"fear, uncertainty, and doubt.\" (Trial Tr. at 6-100:20-6-101:6, Doc. 220 at PageID 11837-38.)\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    Having learned in December 2012 that it had lost the head-to-head pilot against Hillman, on January 15, 2013 Fagundo sent an email to Frick stating that he was \"[t]hinking about raising the patent card.\" (PX-106 at PX-106-0002-0003.)\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    The subject of patents had not been discussed during at least the two prior business meetings between Minute Key and Walmart.

Always need a competitor and we will whack them in time[;]\" and \"Need to whack them now!\" (from Fagundo). (PX-105 at PX-105-0001.) And later, after this civil action commenced, \"I'm pissed.

And, after signing a contract for new business in March 2014, Fagundo remarks to board members \"I think we finally won this one.\" (PX-116 at PX-116-0003-0004.)\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Because the record contains sufficient evidence, without a doubt clear and convincing evidence, upon which a jury properly could find bad faith as a matter of law, in this regard Minute Key's Motion must be denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    <strong>\n     B.\n     <em>\n      A Reasonable Jury Could Have Found Minute Key's Statement Was Literally False.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The Court also rejects Minute Key's second ground in support of its Motion, lack of \"legally relevant evidence\" in support of literal falsity.

In this regard, Minute Key refers largely to the testimony of Dan Hoelter, Walmart's Senior Manager for Home Services, whose videotaped deposition was played for the jury.\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n    He denied that Minute Key's allegation of patent infringement \"brought everything to a halt.\" (Doc. 116 at PageID 3262 (113:4-8);\n    <em>\n     see also\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11585290\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/185/606/#p613\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at PageID 3256 (88:9-14).)

Hoelter stated that as of September 12, 2013, a week after receiving Fagundo's September 5 email alleging infringement,\n    \"there was no change in any sort of rollout schedule. Everything was business as usual.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at PageID 3251 (67:1-13).) Regarding materiality, Minute Key insists that Hillman did not prove-indeed, could not prove-that Walmart changed its purchasing decision because Hillman eventually installed the 1,000 kiosks it was awarded as a result of winning the pilot. (Trial Tr. at 2-129:1-16, Doc. 204 at PageID 11074.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Hillman counters that, with respect to actual deception,\n    <em>\n     Podiatric Physicians\n    </em>\n    merely requires a showing of evidence that the consumer \"perceived the advertisement in a way that misled [it] about the plaintiff's product.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11585290\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/185/606/#p613\">\n     185 F.3d at 614\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The excerpts of Hoelter's testimony cited by Minute Key fail to account for the directive he sent within 24 hours of receiving Minute Key's September 5 email: \"Due to the upcoming issuance of the MinuteKey Patent that will occur on Tuesday and the cease order that will be issued to the Hillman Group (FastKey) we will be using the MinuteKey Program for all stores asking for the self-assisted key cutting kiosk.\" (JX-2024 at JX-2024-0002.) Additionally, Walmart Associate General Counsel Rosalyn Mitchell required Hillman to confirm its indemnification obligations within days of Minute Key's September 5, 2013 email. (JX-2020.) Hillman General Counsel Douglas Roberts testified that Walmart's request in this respect was redundant inasmuch as \"[t]here was already indemnification from Hillman in the kiosk license agreement\" and a reflection of how \"nervous\" Walmart was about Minute Key's allegations. (Trial Tr. at 5-45:2-5-46:1, Doc. 215 at PageID 11594-95.) As for materiality, Hillman maintains that it was not required to prove that Walmart\n    <em>\n     changed\n    </em>\n    a purchasing decision. All that is necessary under\n    <em>\n     Podiatric Physicians\n    </em>\n    is proof that \"the statement is material in that it\n    <strong>\n     will likely influence\n    </strong>\n    the deceived consumer's purchasing decisions.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11585290\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/185/606/#p613\">\n     185 F.3d at 613\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). Hoelter's day-after email sufficiently demonstrates this likelihood. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    JX-2024 at JX-2024-0002.) Moreover, evidence was presented to the jury suggesting that the original purchasing decision\n    <em>\n     was\n    </em>\n    changed. Hoelter's letter to Hillman initiating the rollout freeze specifically pinpointed Minute Key's allegations as the catalyst:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n    As I believe you are aware, Walmart has non-exclusive written agreements with both The Hillman Group, Inc. and Minute Key, Inc. for key duplication services in Walmart stores. Pursuant to those agreements, Hillman and Minute Key have deployed their respective key duplication machines in different Walmart stores. Walmart has been in the process of working with both Hillman and Minute Key to deploy additional Hillman and Minute Key machines in various other Walmart stores that currently do not have key duplication machines.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n    <strong>\n     As you know, Minute Key has recently alleged that the Hillman key duplication machines infringe a patent that was issued on September 10, 2013 to Minute Key.\n    </strong>\n    To date, no lawsuit has been filed by either Hillman or Minute Key regarding the claims of infringement. Walmart is not in a position to determine the validity of the Minute Key patent or the merits of Minute Key's allegations of infringement. Walmart understands that Hillman and Minute Key are addressing these claims directly with each other.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n    <strong>\n     At this time, Walmart is suspending the deployment of key duplication machines that are supplied by both Minute Key and Hillman.\n    </strong>\n    Effective immediately, please stop efforts to place key duplication machines in Walmart stores.

We are providing similar notice to Minute Key.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    (JX-2028 at JX-2028-0002 (emphasis added).) Delaying Hillman's exercise of a contractual right in the time period immediately prior to Walmart's holiday blackout\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n    -and denying Hillman (as well as its customer, Walmart) the revenue expected during that time period-qualifies as a \"change\" to the original purchasing decision.

While Walmart's Hoelter may have been a disinterested witness, his after-the-fact testimony that it was\n    <em>\n     Hillman\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     's\n    </em>\n    actions that caused the \"freeze\" on FastKey installs was inconsistent with emails sent in the immediate wake of Minute Key's allegation of patent infringement. And with respect to any award of stores beyond the initial 1,000, his testimony was equivocal, and dramatically so. Explaining what he meant when writing, \"We are aligned that MK get first call since you are our main provider going forward[,]\" Hoelter answered:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n    Well, seeing as that FastKey was capped at 1,000 stores due to legal issues, and that would automatically mean that minuteKEY, the other provider, would be our main provider going forward.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    (Doc. 116 at PageID 3276 (166:10-18).) After a ten-minute break in testimony, Hoelter indicated there was \"something\" he wanted to clarify:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    My last statement before we left-it's a long day, and I said that minuteKEY became the main provider moving forward because of legal actions, which actually that's not the case.

In this circumstance, a reasonable jury, charged with the responsibility to assess the credibility of\n    <em>\n     every\n    </em>\n    witness, could have concluded that Hoelter's contemporaneous documents reflected the truth of Walmart's actions vis-\u00e0-vis the rollout freeze. On this alternative ground, then, were it necessary to consider, the Court would deny Minute Key's Motion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <strong>\n     D.\n     <em>\n      A Reasonable Jury Could Have Found Minute Key's Statement Was Made in Commercial Advertising or Promotion.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Only statements made in \"commercial advertising or promotion\" fall within the scope of the Lanham Act.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1)(B).

Following\n    <em>\n     Grubbs\n    </em>\n    , this Court resolved that the proper customer \"base\" should be tied to the market for self-service key duplication kiosks and not\n    key duplication equipment generally. (Doc. 136 at PageID 7823.) Statements to a single customer can trigger the protections of the Lanham Act \"if the market at issue is very small and discrete,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Champion Labs.\n    </em>\n    , 616 F.Supp.2d at 694-95, but it was for the jury to decide whether the market at issue in this civil action was properly limited to Walmart.

Even crediting testimony as to Hillman's business model of placing its FastKey \"only where it could implement a 'two-system solution,' \" there was evidence that its \"base\" extended-beyond Walmart-at least to Home Depot, Lowe's, Orchard Supply, Meijer, and Menards.

Because Walmart \"was only one customer within a much larger customer base for Hillman,\" Minute Key contends it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of dissemination.

Seeds testified that, out of \"a thousand and twenty\" FastKeys ever built, \"a thousand\" were in Walmart stores. (Trial Tr. at 3-95:11-17, Doc. 210 at PageID 11400.) Yancey, whose videotaped deposition was played for the jury,\n    <footnotemark>\n     22\n    </footnotemark>\n    confirmed. When asked how many FastKeys were operating in stores other than Walmart, she testified, \"I'm going to say maybe 20.\" (Doc. 114 at PageID 3071 (46:4-7).) Seeds further testified that the FastKey kiosk was designed for Walmart, and that Walmart was \"100 percent of [Hillman's] focus\" for self-service key duplication.

On this evidence, a reasonable jury could decide that Minute Key's statement of infringement on September 5, 2013 was disseminated to a \"substantial portion\" of Hillman's \"existing\" customer base as\n    <em>\n     Grubbs\n    </em>\n    requires.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <strong>\n     E.\n     <em>\n      A Reasonable Jury Could Have Found Hillman Proved Causation and Harm.\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Minute Key urges that no reasonable jury could have found that its infringement statement caused injury to\n    Hillman in the form of a delay in its pilot rollout. As it asserted in connection with its alternative actual deception and materiality arguments, Minute Key claims that \"Hillman's own actions and Walmart's independent decisions stand uncontradicted\" and therefore \"undercut\" any causal link. (Doc. 255 at PageID 12709.) Minute Key also contends that the jury's award \"was based on nothing other than speculation\" and hence \"cannot stand.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at PageID 12710.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Hillman replies that Minute Key's arguments should be rejected outright because they were not raised in either of Minute Key's motions made under Rule 50(a)(2) during trial. (Doc. 264 at PageID 13043.) Not so. Hillman is correct that a Rule 50(b) motion \"is only a renewal of the preverdict motion\" and, as such, \"can be granted only on grounds advanced in the preverdict motion.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ford v. Cnty. of Grand Traverse\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5893854\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/483/#p491\">\n     535 F.3d 483\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 491 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting advisory committee's note (2006 Amendment) ). Hillman is similarly correct that if a ground is not raised in a \"sufficiently substantial way in the earlier motion,\" it is not preserved for a Rule 50(b) motion after the verdict.\n    <em>\n     CFE Racing Prods., Inc. v. BMF Wheels, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277542\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/571/#p583\">\n     793 F.3d 571\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 583 (6th Cir. 2015). But during argument at the close of Hillman's case-in-chief, Minute Key's counsel explained that the concepts of \"actual deception,\" \"material[ity],\" and \"purchasing decision\" changes are all \"tied into causation.\" (Trial Tr. at 5-232:22-5-233:4, Doc. 218 at PageID 11781-82.) This argument continued for some three pages of the transcript. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5-232:22-5-235:20, Doc. 218 at PageID 11781-84.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n    Counsel later addressed the lack of evidence of damages for any delay in the rollout during argument at the close of all evidence. (Trial Tr. at 8-33:25-8-34:24, Doc. 234 at PageID 12299-12300.) Having sufficiently preserved these arguments, Minute Key is entitled to a ruling on their substance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    As discussed in Part III.C,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the \"freeze\" letter sent to both Hillman and Minute Key over Dan Hoelter's signature supports the jury's verdict in favor of Hillman in terms of causation. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    JX-2028.) Hoelter testified that the letter \"was drafted with the help of [Walmart's] legal team[,]\" having determined \"it [ ] would be best for Walmart's perspective to suspend all operations\n    <strong>\n     until we could actually dig into the issue further so that we weren't knowingly infringing on any patents by allowing FastKey to install.\n    </strong>\n    \" (Doc. 116 at PageID 3253 (76:16-77:7) (emphasis added).)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Certified Public Accountant Matthew L. Gutzwiller testified that Hillman suffered lost profits in the amount of $328,144 as a result of the rollout freeze. (Trial Tr. at 5-144:19-5-146:3, Doc. 217 at PageID 11693-95; Trial Tr. at 5-149:8-5-155:6, Doc. 217 at PageID 11698-704; PX-245, JX-2053.) In calculating lost profits, Gutzwiller assumed that \"the 303 machines that ultimately were subject to the rollout freeze would have been deployed and generating revenue as early as October 31st, 2013.\" (Trial Tr. at 5-145:19-5-146:2, Doc. 217 at PageID 11694.) Gutzwiller assumed that Hillman could install 303 machines in five weeks-approximately 60 per week-based on a review of Hillman's installation pace in September 2013 immediately before the freeze. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5-192:12-24, Doc. 217 at PageID 11741 (\"I actually looked at it by week, and there are two weeks in September, one they did 74 machines and another week they did 65. So I think my assumption that they could do 60 a week I\n    believe was reasonable, yes.\").) But Gutzwiller's calculation admittedly did not account for Walmart's holiday blackout that began in mid-October. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5-192:4-11, Doc. 217 at PageID 11741 (\"[T]he information that I had suggested that [the Walmart annual blackout] would not have been imposed until perhaps the middle of November which would have accommodated that installation of these 303 machines. So I think the answer to your question is that's correct, I didn't factor in the blackout here.\").)\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The jury awarded Hillman $164,072.\n    <footnotemark>\n     25\n    </footnotemark>\n    That amount obviously is one-half of the lost profits Gutzwiller calculated. That amount gives every indication of adjusting a five-week period (September 27-October 31) down to a two-and-one-half week period (September 27-October 15). While the Court cannot be certain, it seems that the jury applied basic arithmetic skills and-to account for the beginning of Walmart's holiday blackout-divided by two. Nothing is speculative about the jury's verdict in light of the testimony, and the Court will not disturb it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    For all the foregoing reasons, Defendant Minute Key Inc.'s Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law is hereby\n    <strong>\n     DENIED\n    </strong>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    <strong>\n     IT IS SO ORDERED\n    </strong>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"12\">\n    <p id=\"p-116\">\n     The Court provided to each juror a printed copy of the entire set of instructions read aloud.
