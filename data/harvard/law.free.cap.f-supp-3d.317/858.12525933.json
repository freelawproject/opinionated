After careful consideration of all the voluminous written filings and oral argument in this case, the Court hereby grants Class Plaintiffs' motion for final approval, finding that the Settlement Agreement and Plan of Allocation are fair, reasonable, adequate, and comport with all requirements of law. The Court also grants in full the motions of Wolf Popper, Almeida, and KSF for fees and costs, but only grants in part the motions of Class Counsel and BLBG for the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Stipulation of Settlement and Plan of Allocation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case grows out of a massive fraud, but whether defendants were responsible for the fraud or were themselves victims of the fraud was one of several hotly-contested issues that made the outcome of this case uncertain. The proposed settlement followed more than three years of litigation including, among other things, non-frivolous (though mostly unsuccessful) motions by defendants to dismiss plaintiffs' claims, defeat class certification, and obtain summary judgment in their favor, as well as extensive fact and expert discovery (including 68 depositions and review of more than 25 million pages of documents), preparations for trial, a substantial Second Circuit appeal, and a fully briefed petition for certiorari.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 5-6. Familiarity with all these prior matters is here assumed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Settlement Amount equals approximately 22.3% of the likely recoverable damages suffered by the class (as estimated by Class Plaintiffs).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. It represents, moreover, a 65% premium over the recoveries enjoyed by various individual plaintiffs (sophisticated institutional investors represented by experienced counsel) who have previously reached settlements with the Petrobras Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Furthermore, as mentioned, all but one of the remaining institutional plaintiffs have indicated their intention to remain class members and forgo their individual claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (e), the Court must approve a class action settlement before it can take effect. \"A court may approve a class action settlement if it is fair, adequate, and reasonable, and not a product of collusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

In making its determination, the Court can take into account,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , (1) the complexity, expense, and duration of the litigation; (2) the class's reaction to the settlement; (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; (4) the risks of establishing liability; (5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining the class action through trial; (7) the defendants' ability to withstand a greater judgment; and (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of best possible recovery and all attendant litigation risks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Detroit v.

Furthermore if, as here, the \"settlement class\" is different from the litigation class or classes previously certified, the Court must now certify the settlement class, although certain Rule 23 considerations are not applicable in this context.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Amchem Prods., Inc. v.

Objectors here principally challenge (1) certification, (2) the sufficiency of the class notice, (3) the proposed\n   <em>\n    cry\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    pres\n   </em>\n   recipient, and (4) the settlement amount.

Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Objectors argue that the proposed settlement class is overbroad, and that, accordingly, it fails to satisfy the requirements of Rule 23 that (1) the diverse groups and individuals within the class be adequately represented by the named plaintiffs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Haynes Obj. at 3-8; Gielata Obj. at 1-8; Bueno Obj. at 6-9, and that (2) common issues of law and fact predominate over those issues subject only to individualized proof,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Haynes Obj. at 9-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) Adequate Representation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The proposed settlement agreement defines the Settlement Class as all persons who purchased Petrobras Securities in a transaction \"that satisfies any of the following criteria: (i) any transaction in a Petrobras Security listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"); (ii) any transaction in a Petrobras Security that cleared or settled through the Depository Trust Company's book-entry system; or (iii) any transaction in a Petrobras Security\n   to which the United States securities laws apply, including as applicable pursuant to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Morrison v.

Haynes, Gielata, and Bueno purport to identify an intraclass conflict in this case between those persons whose purchases of Petrobras Securities are connected to the U.S.\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   by virtue of the fact that their transactions were cleared or settled through the Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\") in New York (the \"DTC claimants\") and those persons whose purchases of Petrobras Securities are otherwise domestic under the operative case law (the \"domestic claimants\"), for example because their purchases took place on U.S. exchanges. According to Gielata, the DTC claimants are not properly part of the class at all and should be filtered out by a special master.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gielata Obj. at 4 (\"the problem here is not the 'classic'\n   <em>\n    Amchem\n   </em>\n   conflict necessitating subclasses. Rather, the structural conflict here is [ ] class member claimants versus claimants that cannot be part of the class because their claims are barred by\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   \"). According to Haynes, while the DTC claimants may properly be part of the class, the domestic claimants are entitled to separate representation given the relative strength of their claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Haynes Obj. at 6. Haynes proposes that the Court certify two or three subclasses for purposes of negotiating a new settlement (or continuing the litigation).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Bueno similarly suggests that the Court appoint subclass representatives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bueno Obj. at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   What this boils down to as a practical matter is that certain claimants who would have been unable to join the litigation classes previously certified by the Court because of extraterritorial impediments are now included in the settlement class so that the defendants can buy \"global peace.\" In the Second Circuit, plaintiffs are entitled to settle even entirely non-meritorious claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Am.

Accordingly, even though the Court previously found that the DTC claimants could not establish domesticity as a matter of law (but not because they lacked Article III standing), Gielata is wrong that the DTC claimants cannot be part of the settlement class (assuming that the other requirements of Rule 23 are met).\n   <em>\n    SeeAIG\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3501777\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/689/229/#p243\">\n    689 F.3d at 237-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (certifying a settlement class even though some or all of the class members could not satisfy the reliance element of their securities fraud claims);\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v.

Lending credence to Class Plaintiffs' explanation is the fact that not one institutional investor has joined Haynes in his objection and Haynes himself has at most a couple hundred dollars at stake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 17:3 (St. John) (estimating Haynes' expected recovery at $66).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Further still, each of the three named plaintiffs in this case are represented by separate counsel, and two of those three named plaintiffs, Hawaii and North Carolina, have exclusively domestic claims, while USS has both domestic and non-domestic claims. In other words, Hawaii and North Carolina are the sort of domestic-only class representatives that Haynes\n   and Bueno ask the Court to appoint. Both were involved in the settlement negotiations and neither objected to the equal treatment of the DTC claimants, even though these institutional investors have orders-of-magnitude more money on the line than Bueno or Haynes and have no plausible reason to agree to disadvantageous settlement terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18:12-20 (Dubbs) (explaining that all of Hawaii's transactions were \"domestic\" per the Court's prior order, that Hawaii was actively engaged in the settlement negotiations, and that Hawaii is \"satisfied with the result\"). Objectors, for their part, provide no explanation as to why Hawaii or North Carolina would agree to a settlement that unfairly diluted their expected recovery. Indeed, counsel for these Representatives, while also representing the class as a whole, have a fiduciary duty to their individual clients to ensure that the Agreement and Plan advance their clients' interests. Accordingly, the Court finds that there is insufficient evidence of prejudice here to warrant the appointment of subclass representatives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Literary Works\n   </em>\n   at 252 (in evaluating the adequacy of representation a Court may \"examine a settlement's substance for evidence of prejudice to the interests of a subset of plaintiffs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Predominance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Haynes also argues that the presence of the DTC claimants in the class definition means that the proposed class fails to meet the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b) (3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Haynes Obj. at 9. The problem, according to Haynes, is that domesticity is an individual question requiring class members to present evidence that varies from member to member (including,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , facts concerning the formation of contracts, placement of purchase orders, and exchange of money).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922741\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/223/#p231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Haynes faults plaintiffs for failing to put forth \"class-wide evidence\" of domesticity, which, Haynes argues, is needed to \"prevent the fact-finder from 'having to look at every class member's transaction documents to determine who did and who did not have a valid claim.' \" Haynes Obj. at 10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275849\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/250/#p274\">\n    862 F.3d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274 (2d Cir. 2017) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   But the predominance requirement differs between trial and settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AIG\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3501777\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/689/229/#p243\">\n    689 F.3d at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, defendants' highlighted entries for one project attorney who billed 23 consecutive billable days for reading news articles on Petrobras-on most days for exactly 8.0 or 9.0 hours per day-totaling approximately 185 hours.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.

The various reductions made below reflect not only that review, but also the Court's familiarity from various other cases with appropriate billing rates and time allocations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As regards the time billed by 27 foreign attorneys, Class Counsel do not address the case law cited by Haynes or identify cases supporting their position. Moreover, it would be improper to charge the class U.S.-attorney rates for this work. Accordingly, the full amount billed by these individuals must be deducted from Class Counsel's lodestar (approximately $27,569,829).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Class Counsel may add to their reimbursement request the actual costs they incurred compensating these attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As regards the amounts billed by staff and contract attorneys in this action (approximately $89,410,520.50 at Pomerantz, $6,375,370 at Labaton, and $1,180,333 at Motley Rice),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. Ltr. at 10,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court agrees with objectors that a reduction is appropriate to account for the considerable time spent by these attorneys on low level document review. However, given the legal experience, language skills, and status of these attorneys,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court disagrees\n   with Gielata and Haynes that their rates should be capped at or below $200. A more appropriate reduction is the one suggested by Gielata of 20%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As regards the amounts billed by these attorneys for translating documents, however, a further reduction is required. While Class Counsel appropriately used attorneys to perform certain translation work in this case, such work is not appropriately billed at rates of between $325 and $625 per hour. Accordingly, these amounts (approximately $10 million at Pomerantz, $4,162,555 at Labaton, $752,783 at Motley Rice)\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   must be reduced by a further 50%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Applying all the foregoing adjustments, and \"rounding up\" the figures in counsel's favor, the Court calculates an adjusted lodestar of $104.8 million, consisting of $96.0 million at Pomerantz, $7.5 million at Labaton, and $1.3 million at Motley Rice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) The Multiplier\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \"[T]here is a strong presumption that the lodestar is sufficient,\"\n   <em>\n    Perdue v.

Haynes concedes that a multiplier is warranted but argues that no more than the requested 1.78 multiplier is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Haynes Obj. at 19-23. Anticipating a possible lodestar reduction, Class Counsel argues that even at \"$104,461,062 [the] requested multiplier would be 2.7, well within the range of acceptable multipliers in this Circuit.\" Pl. Ltr. at 29. Accordingly, Class counsel contend, the Court should honor the\n   <em>\n    ex\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   fee agreement executed by Class Counsel with USS and award $284.5 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fee Mem. at 17-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court finds that there was, as previously mentioned, sufficient risk at both the motion to dismiss phase and the motion for summary judgment phase to warrant a multiplier. Additionally, the Court finds that Class Counsel's performance was in many respects exceptional, with the result that, as noted, the class is poised to enjoy a substantially larger per share recovery than the recovery enjoyed by numerous large and sophisticated plaintiffs who separately settled their claims. It also bears mentioning, however, that this case involved fraud allegations that were previously widely reported and heavily investigated by the authorities in Brazil, so that much of the work that might otherwise have been required of plaintiffs' counsel had already been done, and done in a way that enhanced plaintiffs' bargaining position. As for the fact that plaintiffs negotiated, at the outset of the case, a particular fee arrangement with a particular client, this is at best just one factor to be weighed in assessing, after settlement has been reached, the full set of\n   intervening events that have occurred and that provide a much better indication of what was the value of the attorneys' work to the class as a whole than any before-the-fact private agreement reached with an individual plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Indeed, one purpose of the lodestar check is to ensure that even an arms-length fee agreement reached between class counsel and class representatives does not result in a harvest of fees at the expense of the class. As Class Counsel's adjusted lodestar is $104.8 million (and Class Counsel likely spent far, far less than this compensating its attorneys), the Court believes that the original 1.78 multiplier requested by Class Counsel is sufficient to adequately account for the risks undertaken and the results achieved. Additional compensation above this amount would represent a windfall to Class Counsel, who were highly incentivized to heavily litigate this huge case regardless of the expected fee award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   It is important to also remember that we are dealing here, not just with percentages, billable rates, and multipliers, but with very large amounts of money in absolute terms that plaintiffs' counsel will be receiving under any analysis. Accordingly, the Court grants Class Counsel's motion in part and awards fees in the amount of $186.5 million-consisting of $170,880,000 to Pomerantz, $13,350,000 to Labaton, and $2,314,000 to Motley Rice-or roughly two-thirds of what was sought. The Court also awards costs in the amount of $14,515,235.24, plus whatever amount Class Counsel paid to employ the 27 foreign contract attorneys mentioned above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As regards the fee award, fifty percent is payable to counsel immediately upon entry of final judgment. The other fifty percent shall be paid only after the distribution is completed. This schedule, which the Court has routinely employed in other cases, reflects that, on the one hand, counsel have spent a great deal of time and money to litigate this case and should not have to continue to shoulder the costs of funding this litigation any longer than necessary, but that, on the other hand, counsel should not be paid in full before their clients have received any of their recovery, nor would it be helpful to eliminate an incentive for counsel to monitor the distribution agent and ensure that the settlement funds are distributed expeditiously.
