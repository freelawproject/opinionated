They were members of the medical staff at PMC, the only public hospital serving northern Brevard County, until PMC denied Plaintiffs' applications for reappointment of their medical privileges (\"\n   <strong>\n    Denial\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-4.) Thereafter, Plaintiffs initiated this action, claiming: (1) under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Denial violates their Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-58 (\"\n   <strong>\n    PDP Claim\n   </strong>\n   \") ); and (2) under Florida law, the Denial constitutes a breach of PMC's Bylaws (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-67 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Bylaws Claim\n   </strong>\n   \") ).

PDP Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   First, PMC argues that Plaintiffs' PDP Claim fails because Plaintiffs do not have a constitutional or contractual right to a review of PMC's business decision to not renew Plaintiffs' medical privileges. (Doc. 19, pp. 1, 9-13.) On review, the Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause provides that a state shall not \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or\n   property, without due process of law.\" U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. \"[A] \u00a7 1983 claim alleging a denial of procedural due process requires proof of three elements: (1) a deprivation of a constitutionally-protected liberty or property interest; (2) state action; and (3) constitutionally-adequate process.\"\n   <em>\n    J.R. v.

(Doc. 19, pp. 9-13.) Plaintiffs allege they \"have a constitutionally-protected property interest in their medical staff privileges at PMC where, as here, the Bylaws detail an extensive procedure [PMC] must follow before [Plaintiffs'] application for reappointment to the medical staff and medical staff privileges at PMC may be denied.\" (Doc. 1, \u00b6 47;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-2, pp. 31-34 (PMC Bylaws procedure for reappointing medical privileges).) With this, Plaintiffs meet the first element, as \"well-established precedent in this circuit ... recognizes a physician's medical staff privileges as a property interest protected by the fourteenth amendment,\" where, as here, \"the medical staff bylaws establish specific standards and procedures to be applied when considering the suspension, denial, or revocation of the staff privileges of any member.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shahawy v. Harrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539153\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/1529/#p1532\">\n    875 F.2d 1529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1532 (11th Cir. 1989) (discussing\n   <em>\n    Northeast Georgia Radiological Associates v.

Accordingly, the Court rejects PMC's argument that Plaintiffs have no constitutionally-protected property interest in reappointment of their medical privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Next, PMC argues that adequate procedures were offered to Plaintiffs, who rejected them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 19, pp. 19-20.) The procedures offered were: (1) an interview with an Ad Hoc Committee of the Board; and (2) appellate review by the Board-both post-termination. (Doc. 1-4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33.) But PMC denied Plaintiffs' request for a hearing in conformity with the Bylaws (Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33)-such a hearing is pre-termination and entails a full panoply of procedural protections (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-2, pp. 47-52 (PMC Bylaws describing hearing process) ). Again, looking at\n   <em>\n    Shahawy\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, the Court finds sufficient Plaintiffs' allegations that PMC deprived them of constitutionally-adequate process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539153\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/875/1529/#p1532\">\n    875 F.2d at 1533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A fundamental principle of procedural due process is that a person be given a pre-termination hearing prior to being deprived of any significant property interest.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Boddie v.

Thus, Plaintiffs have stated a plausible PDP claim, and PMC's Motion is due to be denied on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Bylaws Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   PMC argues the Bylaws Claim must be dismissed because: (1) the Denial did not breach the Bylaws; (2) Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies; and (3) PMC is protected by statutory immunity. (Doc. 19, pp. 13-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As to the first two arguments, the Court's finding above-that PMC did not offer Plaintiffs a hearing in conformity\n   with the Bylaws when it denied Plaintiffs' reappointment applications-beyond supporting a plausible PDP Claim, also supports Plaintiffs' Bylaws Claim. (\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 42, pp. 3-8 (PI Order describing Bylaws' reappointment process and process awarded to Plaintiffs),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15 (finding PMC did not follow Bylaws' process in Denial).) By alleging that PMC strayed from the Bylaws' outlined procedures in considering and denying Plaintiffs' reappointment applications-which included not offering Plaintiffs adequate procedures-Plaintiffs have adequately stated a claim for breach of the Bylaws. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 15-33.) So the Court rejects PMC's first two arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Third, PMC claims that the Bylaws Claim is barred by statutory immunity under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20395.0191\">\n    Fla.

(Doc. 19, p. 19.) Yet a review of the Complaint belies this argument. Indeed, Plaintiffs allege two instances of intentional fraud by PMC's CEO George Miktarian, Jr. in connection with their Reappointment Applications: (1) when PMC's Board reviewed Plaintiffs' applications; and (2) when the Medical Executive Committee (\"\n   <strong>\n    MEC\n   </strong>\n   \") reviewed the applications. (Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 25-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, Plaintiffs allege that \"during a meeting of the Board on December 4, 2017, Mr. Miktarian submitted false charges to the Board that [PMC] had made numerous requests of [Plaintiffs] to provide [PMC] with information concerning the treatment of their cancer patients ..., and [Plaintiffs] had refused to comply with the requests [PMC] had made to them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) As to extrinsic evidence, Plaintiffs plead that the \"minutes from the December 4, 2017 meeting of the Board confirm that, \"Mr. Miktarian disseminated [to the Board] a memorandum documenting the attempts to retrieve the information, as well as a\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     draft letter\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   to each physician requesting the information yet again.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26 (alteration and emphasis in original).) Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Miktarian's memorandum contained representations that \"are demonstrably false,\" but that \"[PMC], through Mr. Miktarian, made these false representations with the intent that the Board would rely on the false representations to reject the MEC's November 21, 2017 recommendation that all of [Plaintiffs'] staff privileges be renewed, and instead deny [Plaintiffs'] renewal of their staff privileges at PMC based upon these false representations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) With this, Plaintiffs allege that \"[t]he\n   Board did rely on these false representations when it denied renewal of [Plaintiffs'] staff privileges by a Board vote on January 8, 2018.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs claim that PMC also committed intentional fraud through Miktarian when he \"intentionally misinformed the MEC at its meeting on December 19, 2017, that '[t]here has been non-compliance with numerous requests for clinical data' made to [Plaintiffs], which, again, was intentionally falsely represented to the MEC to induce its members to adopt a 'motion to support the Board recommendation regarding [Plaintiffs] that would deny [Plaintiffs'] reappointment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29 (first alteration in original).) According to Plaintiffs, both times, Mr. Miktarian \"made his false representations about [Plaintiffs] with malice,\" as defined by the Bylaws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On review, the Court finds that Plaintiffs \"specifically allege ... 'intentional fraud' sufficient to overcome the immunity provided by the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lawnwood Med. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7039731\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/54/1027/#p1031\">\n    54 So.3d at 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, at this pleading stage, the Court finds that PMC is not entitled to statutory immunity, and Plaintiffs' Bylaws Claim may proceed. Indeed, PMC's arguments attacking the veracity of Plaintiffs' allegations are best left to later proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 19, pp. 18-19.)
