The New York Hotel Trades Council &amp; Hotel Association of New York City, Inc. Pension Fund (\"NYHTC\") filed one motion. ECF No. 12. The Oklahoma Police Pension and Retirement System (\"Oklahoma Pension\") filed the second. ECF No. 29. The Court will grant NYHTC's motion and appoint the pension fund as lead plaintiff, and their selected counsel. The Court will also consolidate the two related cases:\n   <em>\n    Hessefort v.
