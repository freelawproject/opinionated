Specifically, the plaintiff identifies \"a review report about the NIH Clinical Center\" that HHS released in April 2016 without \"protect[ing] from disclosure th[at] review team's membership or final conclusions,\" and that allegedly \"address[ed] many of\n   the same issues that the 2007 Operational Review team discussed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the plaintiff states that in July 2017, HHS \"released another Clinical Center report which contained the results of Focus Groups commissioned to implement the recommendations in the April 2016 Clinical Center report.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, according to the plaintiff, the defendant \"has not explained why\" the Operational Review Team's final report and the Marit Focus Groups' findings \"are confidential, pre-decisional, or deliberative, while similar follow-up reports have been readily released.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court construes this argument as the plaintiff asserting that the defendant cannot avail itself to the protections of the deliberative process privilege to shield the Operational Review Team's and the Marit Focus Groups' final reports and their related documents from disclosure because that privilege has been waived by HHS's public release of purportedly similar reports. The Court disagrees for several reasons. First, the plaintiff \"carries the burden of producing at least some evidence that the deliberative process privilege has been waived,\"\n   <em>\n    Elec.

Thus, to the extent that the deliberative process privilege had once applied to the April 2016 Clinical Center Report and the July 2017 Focus Group findings, it has waived that privilege, but only with respect to those documents and their underlying information. And, the plaintiff has not demonstrated that the underlying information disclosed in those reports is the same information found in the 2007 Operational Review Team's or the Marit Focus Groups' final reports.

First, the plaintiff's waiver by adoption argument for this specifically withheld information is predicated on mere speculation that \"working law\" may exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 25 (stating that \"\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   any of the specific actions discussed in these e[-]mails were taken by Gormley and others (as the September 2007 e[-]mails suggest they were),\n   <em>\n    then\n   </em>\n   these e[-]mail 'discussions' about such actions have lost their pre[-]decisional status and must be released\" (emphasis added) ). Such speculation that \"working law\" may exist in the e-mails cannot serve as a basis to conclude that the defendant has waived the deliberative process privilege and that its withholding of this information pursuant to that privilege were improper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vento v.

And, the plaintiff's reliance on a September 2007 e-mail between Gormley and the plaintiff as the only support for his speculative position is misplaced, primarily because that e-mail clearly indicates that the actions Gormley took were discussions about ideas on how to implement changes recommend by the operational review, not actual actions that led to the adoption of agency policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply, Ex. 5 (E-mail correspondence from Gormley to the plaintiff) (Sept. 24, 2007) (Gormley \"writing to follow up on plans for operational changes ... that were recommended in the recent operational review and endorsed ... by the [ ] Advisory Board,\" stating that she \"would like to discuss with [the plaintiff] ideas [she] ha[d] for how to implement the changes in a manner that respects [the plaintiff's] religious accommodation\"). Consequently, this e-mail demonstrates that Gormley did nothing more than engage in the give-and-take deliberative process undertaken by the SMD to determine whether changes to its policies and practices were appropriate.
