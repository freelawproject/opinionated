Commerce preliminarily determined that sugar from Mexico was being sold, or likely to be sold, into the United States at less than fair value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sugar From Mexico: Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2065%2C189\">\n    79 Fed.

During the pendency of the administrative review, the United States began direct negotiations with both the Government of Mexico and producers and exporters of sugar from Mexico regarding possible amendment of the AD Suspension Agreement. On March 9, 2017, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce met with his Mexican counterpart to announce \"a new round of negotiations regarding the serious issues identified with the functioning of the current [suspension] agreements on sugar from Mexico.\"\n   <em>\n    Sugar from Mexico: Meeting with Secretary Wilbur Ross\n   </em>\n   , PD 77 (Dep't of Commerce Apr. 4, 2017). Commerce then notified representatives of Mexican producers and exporters of sugar and the Government of Mexico that Commerce intended to terminate the AD Suspension Agreement on June 5, 2017, unless a revised agreement was reached by that date, citing \"outstanding issues between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Commerce to Juan Cortina Gallardo and Additional Signatories re: termination of AD Suspension Agreement, PD 78 (May 1, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   By mid-June 2017, Commerce and the Government of Mexico had reached agreement on these issues and initialed draft amendments to the AD Suspension Agreement.

After considering comments from interested parties, Commerce, on June 30, 2017, signed final amendments to the AD Suspension Agreement.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   CSC Sugar contends that Commerce did not meet its obligation to file a complete administrative record with the court as required by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(2)(A)(i) and USCIT Rule 73.2(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 10-11. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that Commerce failed to memorialize and include in the record ex parte communications between Commerce officials and interested parties (including the domestic sugar industry and representatives of Mexico) as required by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f(a)(3).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-11. In support of its contention, Plaintiff relies on a\n   <em>\n    Financial Times\n   </em>\n   article dated May 31, 2017 that specifically reports on phone calls in May 2017 between the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, U.S. sugar industry representatives, and Mexican sugar industry representatives regarding negotiations to amend the AD Suspension Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at Ex. 2 (\"\n   <em>\n    Financial Times\n   </em>\n   article\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Government does not dispute that these ex parte calls occurred.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. Given this, Plaintiff maintains that under the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 1516a(b)(2) and 1677f(a)(3), Commerce failed to provide the court with the requisite complete \"copy of all information presented to or obtained by [Commerce] ... including ... the record of ex parte meetings required to be kept by section 1677f(a)(3).\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(2)(A)(i) ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   USCIT R. 73.2(a)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f(a)(3). In response, the Government contends that Plaintiff's argument is fundamentally flawed because Commerce was not required to maintain records of ex parte meetings that occurred during the course of suspension agreement negotiations.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. at 11-26. Specifically, the Government maintains that \u00a7 1516(b)(2) and \u00a7 1677f(a)(3)'s requirements do not apply to negotiations of a\n   suspension agreement or amendments. The Government further argues that suspension agreement proceedings are free from statutory recordkeeping requirements other than the minimal notice and comment requirements required by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(e), which details the procedures that Commerce is required to follow before suspending an antidumping duty investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-22; 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As a threshold matter, ASC contends that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that there is a \"reasonable basis\" in fact for the court to conclude that the administrative record is incomplete.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ASC Resp. at 8-10. Plaintiff asks that the court take notice of the\n   <em>\n    Financial Times\n   </em>\n   article describing the unrecorded ex parte communications between Commerce and interested parties as the \"reasonable basis\" justifying its motion to complete the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 7 n.3 (citing\n   <em>\n    Nippon Steel Corp. v.

Section 1673c(e) governs the procedure for Commerce to suspend an antidumping duty investigation and provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Before an investigation may be suspended under subsection (b) or (c) the administering authority shall-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (1) notify the petitioner of, and consult with the petitioner concerning, its intention to suspend the investigation, and notify other parties to the investigation and the Commission not less than 30 days before the date on which it suspends the investigation,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (2) provide a copy of the proposed agreement to the petitioner at the time of the notification, together with an explanation of how the agreement will be carried out and enforced, and of how the agreement will meet the requirements of subsections (b) and (d) or (c) and (d), and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (3) permit all interested parties described in section 1677(9) of this title to submit comments and information for the record before the date on which notice of suspension of the investigation is published under subsection (f)(1)(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(e).

Specifically, the Government contends that Congress would not have included these notice and comment procedures in a separate section applicable to suspension agreements if it did not also intend these procedures to be mutually exclusive with the recordkeeping requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1516a(b)(2) and 1677f(a)(3).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11189336,6114495\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/118/1366/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As support, the Government relies on a short quotation from the Senate Report that emphasizes the importance of Commerce's consultations with the petitioner prior to adopting a suspension agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (\"the requirement that the petitioner be consulted will not be met by\n   pro forma communications.

The Government's reliance on this language is perplexing because, to the extent that it is relevant at all, it suggests that Congress had no intention for suspension agreement negotiations to bypass any statutory recordkeeping requirements. The Government argues that \"Congress['] emphas[is on] communications with the petitioner in the congressional reports accompanying the legislation makes sense only if Commerce's suspension agreement negotiations are otherwise off-the-record.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, the Government's reading of this language strains credulity, as it ignores conflicting language in the Senate Report as well as the broader context of the statutory provisions regarding suspension agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Prior to the passage of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, the international trade law statutes did not permit suspension of investigations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.

In enacting \u00a7 1673c, Congress emphasized that suspension agreements were intended only for \"unusual\" and \"narrowly circumscribed\" circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71. Given this broader context, the Senate Report's emphasis on the importance of Commerce guaranteeing \"complete disclosure and discussion\" with petitioners in the suspension agreement process can best be understood as providing additional protections to the domestic industry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rather than justifying off-the-record communications as the basis for structuring suspension agreements, the legislative history of \u00a7 1673c suggests that Congress aimed to ensure that Commerce would not abuse its newly granted power to suspend investigations or restrict interested parties' access to relevant information in connection with a proposed suspension agreement. The Government has not identified, nor has the court found, anything in the legislative history of \u00a7 1673c that suggests that suspension agreement negotiations were intended to be exempt from the generally applicable recordkeeping requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1516a(b)(2) and 1677f(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Government also relies on the history of Commerce's regulations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20351.208\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 351.208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - .209, implementing \u00a7 1673c.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. at 23.

Accordingly, the court does not agree that the language and legislative history of \u00a7 1673c(e), or its implementing regulations, support the Government's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Government also misreads the statute when it argues that \u00a7 1673c(e)'s due process protections of notice and comment prior to a determination to suspend an antidumping investigation somehow conflict or render \"superfluous\" the recordkeeping requirements established in \u00a7\u00a7 1516a(b)(2) and 1677f(a)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. at 18. Section 1516a(b)(2), as described previously, defines the scope of the administrative record for the judicial review of antidumping duty proceedings. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(2). Included within the scope of the administrative record is a reference to \u00a7 1677f(a)(3), which requires\n   that Commerce must maintain records of ex parte communications relating to antidumping duty proceedings. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f(a)(3). Taken together, \u00a7\u00a7 1516(a)(b)(2) and 1677f(a)(3) provide the generally applicable recordkeeping requirements for Commerce's antidumping duty proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Section 1673c, on the other hand, does not address general recordkeeping requirements, but rather focuses on Commerce's ability to suspend or terminate antidumping duty investigations. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c. Section 1673c(e) specifically provides that Commerce must afford notice and comment to petitioners and other interested parties before suspending an investigation. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673c(e). These notice and comment requirements do not serve to replace the recordkeeping requirements generally established in \u00a7 1516a(b)(2). Instead, \u00a7 1673c(e) affords interested parties additional due process protections before Commerce may suspend an antidumping investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. 96-249, at 71, 1979 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 457. Accordingly, the court rejects the Government's attempt to frame \u00a7 1673c(e) as somehow incompatible with or mutually exclusive of the recordkeeping requirements applicable to all antidumping duty proceedings in \u00a7\u00a7 1516a(b)(2) and 1677f(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Additionally, the court rejects the Government's argument that suspension agreement proceedings under \u00a7 1673(c) are not governed by the record requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1516a(b)(2) and 1677f(a)(3) for two other reasons. First, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B) lists the reviewable determinations that may be contested before the U.S. Court of International Trade. Specifically, \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B)(iv) provides that an interested party may challenge a determination by Commerce \"under section 1671c or 1673c of this title, to suspend an antidumping duty or a countervailing duty investigation, including any final determination resulting from a continued investigation which changes the size of the dumping margin or net countervailable subsidy calculated, or the reasoning underlying such calculations, at the time the suspension agreement was concluded.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B)(iv). The plain language of \u00a7 1516a provides that Commerce's determinations involving suspension agreements are reviewable determinations, and the Government fails to point out any statutory language indicating Congressional intent to provide for different recordkeeping requirements for suspension agreement determinations as compared with any other reviewable determination listed under \u00a7 1516a(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, despite the Government's primary argument that suspension agreement proceedings are not governed by \u00a7 1677f(a)(3)'s recordkeeping requirements, the Government's actual recordkeeping conflicts with its claimed statutory interpretation. Commerce memorialized two ex parte meetings in this matter prior to the issuance of the final determination adopting the amendment to the AD Suspension Agreement: one regarding a meeting between representatives of Mexico and Secretary of Commerce Ross in March 2017, and another regarding a discussion between Commerce officials and representatives of the domestic sugar industry in the \"Sugar Users Association\" in June 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sugar From Mexico: Meeting with Secretary Wilbur Ross\n   </em>\n   , PD 77 (Dep't of Commerce Apr. 4, 2017);\n   <em>\n    Sugar from Mexico: Ex-parte Memo\n   </em>\n   , PD 95 (Dep't of Commerce June 21, 2017). The Government insists that no \"substantive discussion\" of the suspension agreement amendments occurred at these two ex parte meetings. Therefore, the Government maintains that memorializing these meetings\n   was not inconsistent with its position that suspension agreement proceedings fall outside the scope of the recordkeeping requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1516a(b)(2) or 1677f(a)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. at 26-27. The Government emphasizes that these two ex parte meeting memoranda do not \"memorialize[ ] deliberative discussion in any manner that would undermine an ongoing negotiation,\" and are thus distinct from the additional records sought by CSC Sugar.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C296\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C296\">\n    at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Government's argument, however, ignores the plain language requirement of \u00a7 1677f(a)(3), which applies to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   ex parte communications involving the provision of \"factual information in connection with a proceeding\" and requires the memorialization of no more and no less than \"the identity of the persons present at the meeting, the date, time, and place of the meeting, and a summary of the matters discussed or submitted.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f(a)(3). The statute does not differentiate between substantive and non-substantive ex parte meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Aside from their statutory interpretation arguments, the Government and Defendant-Intervenors advance similar contentions that suspension agreement negotiations are in some way inherently privileged or confidential and are thus exempt from statutorily mandated recordkeeping and disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. at 19-20, 22-26; ASC Resp. at 6-8 (\"Any Communications Between Commerce and the Parties During the Negotiations to Amend the Suspension Agreements are Privileged\"); C\u00e1mara Resp. at 6-8 (similarly suggesting that suspension agreement negotiations are akin to confidential settlement agreement discussions, or alternatively, that these negotiations are protected by the deliberative process privilege). Because Commerce failed to place on the record memoranda for the ex parte communications at issue that included at least the non-confidential information required by \u00a7 1677f(a) (i.e., a summary memorandum listing the date, time, and participants to the communication, as well as a non-confidential summary of general matters discussed), the court cannot reach the question of whether any specific content is protected from disclosure as confidential or privileged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f(a)(3). Both the statute, as well as Commerce's regulation defining the official record for review for determinations challenged before this Court, are clear: the record includes \"all information presented to or obtained by\" the agency, including confidential and privileged material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(2) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.104\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"The official record will include government memoranda pertaining to the proceeding, memoranda of ex parte meetings, determinations, notices published in the Federal Register, and transcripts of hearings.
