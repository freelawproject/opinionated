After a search effort, the CIA found only one non-search-related document, and concluded that any other pertinent documents had likely been given to the National Archives. I conclude that the CIA has met its burden of showing that the search was adequate and that its redactions were proper under FOIA. Accordingly, the CIA's Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted and Assassination Archives' Motion for Summary Judgment will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Compl. \u00b6 16. As part of its original FOIA request, the Assassination Archives attached a 1963 memorandum summarizing a Joint Chiefs of Staff briefing, which mentioned that \"the plot to kill Hitler\" was \"being studied in detail,\" as a historical parallel to the CIA's then-ongoing efforts to overthrow Fidel Castro. ECF 1-1 at 7. The first request, sent in August 2012, asked for: (1) \"all records on or pertaining to the CIA's 1963 study of plots to assassinate Adolf Hitler,\" and (2) \"all records on or pertaining to communications by Allen Dulles regarding plots to assassinate Adol[f] Hitler\" during Dulles's relevant periods of service in the Office of Strategic Services (a precursor to the CIA), or the CIA itself. Compl. Ex. 1, ECF No. 1-1. After the CIA said that no responsive records could be found, Assassination Archives sent an amended request in October 2012. Compl. \u00b6 16. That request sought:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (1) All records on or pertaining to any plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, including, but not limited to, all records in any way reflecting or referencing the CIA's study in 1963 of plots to assassinate Hitler....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (2) All records on or pertaining to communications by or with Allen Dulles regarding plots to assassinate Adol[f] Hitler during Dulles's service in the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (3) All index entries or other records reflecting the search for records responsive to this request in its original or amended form, including search times used with each of the components searched.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Compl.

The CIA Conducted an Adequate and Reasonable Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The CIA relies on declarations by Antoinette B.

Shiner at 2-4, ECF No. 25-1 (3d Supp. Shiner Decl.); Second Supp. Decl. of Antoinette B. Shiner (2d Supp. Shiner Decl.), ECF No. 19-2. Ms. Shiner describes the CIA's exhaustive search in this manner:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [I]nformation management professionals (\"IMS\") conducted searches of the Directorate of Analysis (\"DA\"); Directorate of Operations (\"DO\"), including its operational files; the Office of the Director, the Director's Action Center, the Office of the General Counsel, the Office of Congressional Affairs, the Center for the Study of Intelligence (which is part of the CIA's Talent Center) and the CIA's history staff office. These directorates and offices were selected on the basis that they would potentially contain the historical studies and the documentary materials sought by Plaintiffs. For each of these offices, IMS personnel identified the specific database and files that would potentially contain the types of records responsive to Plaintiffs' request-i.e., the searches included all relevant office databases, Agency share drives, and archival records-for memoranda, correspondence and any other records responsive to the request at issue. Keyword searches ... were targeted to retrieve records from each database and set of files that contained those terms. In cases where records provided references to additional responsive documents, IMS professionals followed up on those leads and conducted additional searches based on those terms or references. No other offices were deemed likely to maintain responsive documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ... Moreover, Agency personnel consulted with the CIA's history staff, who are very knowledgeable about the Agency's holdings with respect to the request's subject matter. In fact, the Agency's Chief Historian was personally consulted. He advised on Agency-wide searches and personally conducted searches of history staff files for any reference to studies of anti-Hitler plots dating from the 1963 time frame, as referenced very briefly in the \"JCS Memo\" or \"Higgins Memorandum,\" attached to Plaintiffs' complaint and opposition. The Chief Historian did not locate any additional responsive records (apart from the one document that had already been released to Plaintiffs) and opined that, due to the age of the subject matter and narrow scope of Plaintiffs' request focusing on anti-Hitler plots, there would not be many responsive documents and anything related to assassination studies would likely be found at the National Archives. Indeed, IMS professionals noted that these types of records have likely been accessioned to the National Archives and Records Administration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   3d Supp. Shiner Decl. at 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Assassination Archives argues that the CIA did not conduct an adequate\n   search because the CIA should have found records that are connected to \"known operations, events and activities.\" AARC's Cross-Mot. 18. Since no records of a Hitler study have been found, Assassination Archives contends that the CIA's search efforts must have been inadequate. But \"the adequacy of a FOIA search is generally determined not by the fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of the methods used to carry out the search.\"\n   <em>\n    Iturralde v.

This explanation is entirely plausible on its face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Next, Assassination Archives alleges that the CIA's no-records letters qualify as \"troubling questions as to the conduct of the search.\" Pl.'s Mot.

But the CIA admitted that the two letters were sent by administrative error, CIA Reply 12, and the Plaintiff argues that the errors raise \"troubling questions\" without even mentioning what those questions might be.

The Plaintiff also contends that the CIA's Chief Historian should have himself submitted an affidavit, an \"omission\" that warrants a deposition by the Assassination Archives. Pl.'s Reply 4.

Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. 28-29. But again, this claim is irrelevant to the legal issue. Even though large portions of the guide are public, the CIA withheld specific information in order to \"protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1).

The CIA Properly Applied FOIA Exemption 5\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The CIA also redacted parts of internal communications regarding the FOIA search pursuant to FOIA Exemption 5 and the deliberative process privilege. Exemption 5 protects from disclosure \"inter-agency and intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law.\" U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5). In other words, it covers records that would \"normally [be] privileged in the civil discovery context,\"\n   <em>\n    N.L.R.B. v.

Supp. Shiner Decl. 8-9. Assassination Archives makes the bald assertion, without a citation to the record, that the CIA's redactions \"do not reflect a policy deliberation ... rather they are factually based records as to what was found or not found.\" Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. 31. This unsupported claim fails to rebut the presumption of good faith that I must give to agency affidavits.\n   <em>\n    SafeCard Servs. Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 926 F.2d at 1201. I conclude that the CIA properly applied Exemption 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The CIA Properly Applied FOIA Exemption 6\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   An agency may use Exemption 6 to protect \"personnel and medical files\" and files that would constitute a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6). If a privacy interest exists, the third party's privacy interest is weighed against the public interest in disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU v. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828067,3767796\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1/\">\n    655 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011). The CIA invokes this exemption as an independent basis for withholding the names and phone numbers of agency personnel. 3d Supp. Shiner Decl. at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Assassination Archives alleges that Exemption 6 does not apply because disclosure of CIA personnel names and telephone numbers are important for sniffing out why administrative errors occurred in this case, and to vindicate the public interest in the John F. Kennedy assassination. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. 31-33. But the connection between these records and President Kennedy's assassination are tenuous at best, resting on the Plaintiff's theory that the Kennedy assassination was motivated by U.S. efforts to assassinate Fidel Castro, efforts that prompted the CIA to study assassination attempts on Adolf Hitler. So this case is two assassinations removed from the assassination of President Kennedy. And even if I accepted the Plaintiff's proposition that public interest in the Kennedy assassination is relevant to this case, and relevant to the CIA's diligence during these search efforts, that interest does not outweigh the privacy interests of CIA personnel in their names and phone numbers. The public's interest in figuring out why two \"no-records\" emails were mistakenly sent is miniscule at best. And the fact that Congress has seen fit make the personal information of CIA staff members statutorily inaccessible also demonstrates the public's interest in CIA personnel avoiding personal scrutiny for their public service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203507\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, I conclude that the CIA properly applied Exemption 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    F. President Trump's Order Requires Nothing Further\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Assassination Archives also claims that the CIA's search efforts and redactions are inconsistent with President Trump's order regarding President Kennedy's assassination records, as recorded in a White House statement. That statement reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY ON THEPRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATIONRECORDSOctober 26, 2017\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Today, President Donald J. Trump took action to ensure release of the remaining President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records. Accordingly, the National Archives and Records Administration will make approximately 2,800 records available in full for public access today. The remaining records will be released with agency-proposed redactions on a rolling basis in the coming weeks. The President has demanded unprecedented transparency from the agencies and directed them to minimize redactions without delay. The National Archives will therefore release more records, with redactions only in the rarest of circumstances, by the deadline of April 26, 2018.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204857002\">\n    2017 WL 4857002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (White House). The Plaintiff argues that this statement gives added \"weight to the public interests at issue in this case,\" and contends that the CIA has failed to comply with President Trump's orders. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. 23, 27-28, 30, 33. But this argument fails to comprehend the limited scope of President Trump's order, and the CIA's support for its redactions in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Put simply, President Trump ordered that President Kennedy's assassination records be released swiftly, \"with redactions only in the rarest of circumstances.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204857002\">\n    2017 WL 4857002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As explained above, the records at issue in this case are only tenuously related to President Kennedy's assassination.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   n. 11. President Kennedy's assassination records are held by National Archives, not by the CIA, and so the President's order does not even apply to this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202107\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   note at\n   Section 4(a)(1) (directing \"the National Archives and Records Administration\" to establish \"a collection of records to be known as the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection.\"). Even on the generous assumption that CIA studies of Hitler assassination attempts are part of \"the remaining President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records\" referenced by the White House statement, the order only requires agencies to \"minimize redactions without delay.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204857002\">\n    2017 WL 4857002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For all of the reasons given above, I conclude that the CIA conducted a legally adequate search, and has minimized redactions under applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the CIA's Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted and the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment will be denied. A separate order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Assassination Archives suggested additional search terms in its opening brief, and was not satisfied when the agency gave detailed examples of the search terms it had used. 3d. Supp. Shiner Decl. at 4-5; Pl.'s Reply 7-8. But the CIA's search terms are quite exhaustive, including searches of many significant phrases (including \"Hitler Assassination,\" \"1963 assassination study,\" and \"Dulles files\"), as well as those same words individually searched without quotes (plot, Hitler, assassination, Dulles), a method calculated to \"ensur[e] the broadest array of responsive hits.\" 3d. Supp. Shiner Decl. at 4-5. The Plaintiff's suggestion that the CIA was delinquent in failing to search phrases like \"July 20 plot\" and \"plot to kill Hitler\" ignores the fact that those phrases would duplicate searches the CIA had already performed for \"plot\" and \"Hitler.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Reply 7-8.
