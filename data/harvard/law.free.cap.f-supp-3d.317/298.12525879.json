BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Between November 2015 and October 2017, Mr. Abrego was an employee of One Fish, Two Fish, a restaurant in the District of Columbia owned and operated by defendants. Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 12. Mr. Abrego alleges that he typically worked at the restaurant six days a week for approximately eleven and a half hours a day, for a total of sixty-nine hours a week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. For this work, Mr. Abrego claims that he was paid $450 in cash each week, although \"in the last few months of\n   his employment,\" his salary was raised to $725 every week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. He claims that this wage \"violated Federal and District of Columbia overtime compensation laws because Defendants failed to pay Plaintiff overtime wages at the time-and-one-half rate for hours worked per week over forty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Based on his calculations, Mr. Abrego claims that defendants owe him $55,000 in unpaid overtime wages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to filing suit, Mr. Abrego's counsel sent a pre-litigation demand letter for settlement purposes to defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. Ex. 1, ECF No. 8-1. In that letter, Mr. Abrego's counsel explained that, although Mr. Abrego worked sixty nine hours a week for One Fish, Two Fish, he had only been paid an average of $500 each week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Counsel asserted that One Fish, Two Fish's failure to pay Mr. Abrego overtime wages violated federal and District of Columbia laws, and he explained that those laws permitted Mr. Abrego to recover four times his unpaid wages in liquidated damages-which would have amounted to approximately $217,500-in addition to attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Counsel proposed settling the matter for $137,000, which was approximately two and a half times Mr. Abrego's unpaid wages plus $2000 in attorney's fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants did not respond to the pre-litigation demand letter, and on November 2, 2017, Mr. Abrego filed the instant suit.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1. The next day, on November 3, 2017, Mr. Abrego allegedly signed an agreement settling his employment claims against defendants for $6,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp., ECF No. 8 at 2-3.

This was because, at the time of the settlement, \"both parties\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     knew\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   more than $500.00 was due\" to the employee under the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156456\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/324/697/#p706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, because the settlement was not \"made as the result of a bona fide dispute between the two parties in consideration of a bona fide compromise and settlement,\" the release contained in the settlement was unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156456\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/324/697/#p706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156456\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/324/697/#p706\">\n    at 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156456\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/324/697/#p706\">\n    65 S.Ct. 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, there is nothing in the complaint that supports a finding that the parties' purported settlement agreement is \"the result of a bona fide dispute between the two parties.\" Defendants' purported liability stems from an alleged violation of the FLSA, which provides that \"[a]ny employer who violates the provisions of section 206 or section 207 ... shall be liable to the employee ... affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Section 207 states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Except as otherwise provided in this section, no employer shall employ any of his employees who in any workweek is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or is employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 207(a)(1). Mr. Abrego claims that defendants violated these provisions by failing to pay him overtime wages for the time he worked in excess of forty hours per week.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1. On the record before the Court, there is no dispute between the parties as to applicability of the FLSA's overtime requirements to Mr. Abrego, the number of hours worked by Mr. Abrego, or the wages owed to him under the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272179\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/210/54/\">\n    210 F.Supp.3d at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the absence of a bona fide dispute, the settlement agreement signed by Mr. Abrego appears to be the sort of \"mere waiver\" of FLSA rights that is clearly prohibited.\n   <em>\n    Brooklyn Savings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156456\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/324/697/#p706\">\n    324 U.S. at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156456\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/324/697/#p706\">\n    65 S.Ct. 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the settlement agreement does not bar Mr. Abrego's claims in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
