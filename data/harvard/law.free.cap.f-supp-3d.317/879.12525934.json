(\"Wells Fargo\"), the trustee for the holders of a commercial mortgage loan, against Defendants Chun Chin Yung (\"Yung\") and Chao Hong Weng (\"Weng,\" and together with Yung, \"Defendants\"), the borrowers. Wells Fargo alleges that Defendants breached their obligation to pay the loan and are now in default under the terms of the agreement. Following the close of discovery, Wells Fargo filed a motion for summary judgment, which Defendants oppose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Wells Fargo's motion for summary judgment. The Court will grant Wells Fargo's motion with respect to liability, and award damages consisting of the principal, interest, and certain fees, charges, and costs. However, the Court will deny Wells Fargo's motion to the extent it seeks additional damages, including four disputed fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 30, 2006, Yung and Weng obtained a commercial mortgage loan from Column Financial, Inc. (\"the Original Lender\"), with a principal amount of $2,725,000.00 (\"the Loan\") and a fixed interest rate of 6.73% per annum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Promissory Note at 1, Compl. Ex. A, ECF No. 1-1. The Loan was secured by a mortgage on a property located at 700-742 Adams Avenue, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (\"the Mortgage\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Open-End Mortgage, Security Agreement, and Assignment of Leases and Rents, Compl. Ex. B, ECF No. 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The promissory note for the loan (\"the Note\") provided that Defendants were responsible for making monthly payments of $17,638.09 for a ten-year period from August 11, 2006 until July 11, 2016 (\"the Maturity Date\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Note \u00a7 1.01. The Note further stated that, on the Maturity Date, the outstanding principal balance, along with the accrued but unpaid interest, would be due and payable in full.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Although the loan had a ten-year term, the monthly payment amounts were calculated based upon a thirty-year term. Therefore,\n   under the terms of the Note, a very large payment would be due on the Maturity Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under the Note, a default occurs when, among other things, Defendants fail to make a monthly payment on or before the monthly payment due date, or fail to pay the outstanding amount due on the Maturity Date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Note \u00a7 1.04;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mortgage \u00a7 2.1. The failure to pay on time also results in a late charge of five percent (5.0%) of the overdue payment amount, an additional four percent (4.0%) interest on the outstanding principal balance, and costs of collection, such as attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Note \u00a7 1.04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the closing date, Defendants signed the Note, the Mortgage, and various other documents related to the Loan (\"the Loan Documents\"). The Note contains an integration clause, which states that \"[t]his Note and the other Loan Documents contain the entire agreements between the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and all prior agreements relative hereto and thereto which are not contained herein or therein are terminated.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Note \u00a7 2.08.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At his deposition, Yung testified that he personally signed the Note, and no one else explained or reviewed the loan documents on his behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Dep. of Chun Chin Yung (\"Yung Dep.\"), 38:10-14, 39:3-5, Oct. 25, 2017, Pl.'s Mot.

Yung also stated that there was nothing in particular that he did not understand at the time of signing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39:6-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Regarding default, Yung testified that he construed the terms of the Note as an obligation to pay the monthly bill on time, and that his understanding was that a default would only occur if he made late payments on the monthly bill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:7-24. He also testified that he did not understand the consequences of not paying the remainder of the loan on the Maturity Date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50:16-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Yung testified that he understood that he had signed a ten-year fixed loan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:2-4. However, he also testified that someone, who he believes is a realtor, told him that it could later change to a thirty-year term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:24-45:6. Yung admits that he signed the Note without any modifications to the language for the original ten-year term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47:1-3. However, according to Yung, he assumed that if he had been paying on time, the bank would refinance the loan to a thirty-year term at the Maturity Date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53:11-20. Yung also testified that he did not ask to negotiate the terms of the Note because he believed that the terms were fixed for every client.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62:1-4. He did not share his assumption regarding the potential change to a thirty-year term before he signed the Loan Documents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53:21-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In her deposition, Weng also confirmed that she personally signed the Note.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Dep. of Chao Hong Weng (\"Weng Dep.\") at 7:22-24, Oct. 25, 2017, Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. D, ECF No. 20-4. In addition, Weng also stated that she understood why she was signing the Note and that she and Yung were the borrowers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:5-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the execution of the loan documents, the Original Lender sold the loan to Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage Securities Corp.

However, Wells Fargo did not agree to the modification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 75:11-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 11, 2016, the Maturity Date for the Note, Yung failed to pay the remaining outstanding loan balance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:2-5. Wells Fargo did not accept Yung's offer to continue making regular payments after the Maturity Date, and as a result, Defendants have not made any payments since that date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:6-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Wells Fargo filed this action on April 24, 2017, bringing one breach of contract claim against Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Wells Fargo argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because Defendants admitted to having negotiated and signed the Note, and admit to failing to pay the outstanding principal and interest on the Maturity Date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 9, ECF No. 20-2. In response, Defendants argue that\n   genuine issues of material fact exist regarding (1) whether a valid, enforceable contract was created by the parties; (2) whether Wells Fargo has behaved in a reasonable manner and/or exercised its discretion in a reasonable manner; and (3) the amount of the alleged indebtedness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem.

Wells Fargo has also shown that under the applicable substantive law it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to liability and the majority of its claimed damages.
