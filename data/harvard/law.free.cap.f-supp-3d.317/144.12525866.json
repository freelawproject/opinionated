Williams said that \"he could not use that soap,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (Am.

Dkt. 37 at 2-3. The DOC asserts that the amended complaint \"fails to make a single specific factual allegation about a District of Columbia policy or policymaker,\" that it \"does not assert that the individual Defendants were acting pursuant to any official policy or custom of the District [of Columbia] when they allegedly caused his injury,\" and that it does not allege that the District of Columbia's \"refusal to act on his written complaints was the result of a policy or custom.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.

The amended complaint, according to Williams, asserts that the District of Columbia \"evinced a deliberate indifference to the violence meted out to him in prison ... [and] to his need for physical safety by not acting on five separate grievances.\" Dkt. 38 at 2-3. Although those grievances were filed after the alleged attack, Williams argues that the District's failure to take disciplinary action shows that \"the District of Columbia knowingly ignores an unconstitutional practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Williams has not plausibly alleged that the District of Columbia is liable under \u00a7 1983 for deliberate indifference to the use of excessive force. Even assuming that the District of Columbia is substituted for the DOC, the amended complaint alleges only that Williams alerted the District to the officers' alleged misconduct after the fact by filing five separate complaints,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 34 at 7 (Am.

According to the amended complaint, \"by refusing to act on [his] five separate written complaints,\" the District was deliberately indifferent both to \"the violent treatment\" by Officers Ellerbe and Taylor and \"the deliberate indifference of Officer Pam.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (Am.

The allegations of fact raised in the amended complaint, however, establish only that the District had knowledge after the fact that two of its employees beat Williams. Those allegations do not address what the District knew or should have known\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the alleged attack, and they do not support a claim that the District's deliberate indifference\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    failed to prevent\n   </em>\n   the incident.

In\n   <em>\n    Singh v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the plaintiff alleged that he had \"expressly reported ... harassment [by police officers] on five separate occasions.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310007\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/881/76/#p87\">\n    881 F.Supp.2d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87 (D.D.C. 2012). Assuming the truth of this allegation, \"the District would have been aware of the risk of constitutional violations [but] nothing was done to stop, discipline, or investigate the defendant officers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310007\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/881/76/#p87\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court concluded that the plaintiff had \"pleaded sufficient facts to indicate that the District was or should have been aware of the risk of constitutional violations from the defendant officers' actions, and that it engaged in deliberate indifference by failing to take any ostensible action in response.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310007\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/881/76/#p87\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muhammad v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3949245\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/584/134/#p139\">\n    584 F.Supp.2d 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 139 (D.D.C. 2008). In\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   and similar cases, the municipality received notice of the risk\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the constitutional tort occurred. In the present case, however, Williams fails to allege that the District had any advance notice or reason to believe that the correctional officers posed a risk to Williams or any other inmates. If Williams obtains discovery supporting such a contention, he can seek leave to amend at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court will, accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Williams's motion to substitute without prejudice, Dkt. 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the reasons above, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Williams's motion to substitute the District of Columbia for the D.C. Department of Corrections as a Defendant in this action, Dkt. 35, is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the D.C. Department of Corrections is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   as a Defendant in this action; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that all Defendants shall answer or otherwise respond to the amended complaint on or before July 13, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
