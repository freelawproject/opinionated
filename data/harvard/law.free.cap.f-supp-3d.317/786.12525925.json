No. 65.) The Akasha Brothers argue that the requested documents are material to their defense that they were forcibly kidnapped by agents of the United States government and that the Court therefore lacks jurisdiction over their prosecution. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Def. Mem. of Law,\" Dkt. No. 66.) Because the Akasha Brothers fail to show that the documents they seek from the Government could be material to any non-frivolous defense to their prosecution, the Motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Akasha Brothers, along with Gulam Hussein, Vijaygiri Anandgiri Goswami, and Muhammad Asif Hafeez (collectively, and together with the Akasha Brothers, \"Defendants\"),\n   are charged with orchestrating an international narcotics conspiracy based in Kenya, with a distribution network that included the United States. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Superseding Indictment,\" Dkt. No. 55.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Akasha Brothers are citizens of Kenya and were arrested by Kenyan authorities in October 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. of Law at 5-6; Dkt. No. 66, Ex. B at 1-2.) After their arrest, the Kenyan government initiated extradition proceedings against the Akasha Brothers in the Chief Magistrate's Court at Mombasa (\"Kenyan Magistrate Court\") to determine whether the Akasha Brothers could be extradited to the United States to face prosecution in the instant case, as requested by the United States government. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 66, Ex. B at 5-6 and Ex. C.) The Kenyan government also requested that the Akasha Brothers be detained pending the resolution of the extradition proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B at 41-43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November 2014, the Kenyan Magistrate Court ordered that the Akasha Brothers could not be removed from Kenya without a prior order by a Kenyan court \"to ensure that the rule of law prevails in this case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B at 35.) In December 2014, the Kenyan Magistrate Court ordered that the Akasha Brothers be released from detention once they satisfied various \"strict bond terms that will ensure [their] attendance in court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 30, 2017, and again on January 31, 2017, the High Court of Kenya at Mombasa issued orders stating that the Akasha Brothers were in the custody of the \"Inspector General of Police\" and the \"Director of Criminal Investigation\" (collectively, \"Kenyan Law Enforcement Agents\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. E and F.) The High Court of Kenya ordered the Kenyan Law Enforcement Agents to produce the Akasha Brothers \"together with the original of any warrant or order for detention.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The High Court of Kenya further ordered that the Kenyan Law Enforcement Agents were \"hereby restrained and prohibited from removing the applicants out of the jurisdiction of this court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, on January 31, 2017-the same day the High Court of Kenya issued the latter of the orders described above-the Akasha Brothers were in the custody of the United States government and were produced for their initial appearances in this Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 17 and 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Akasha Brothers assert that the confusion about their whereabouts is explained by the fact that the United States government \"forcibly kidnap[ped]\" them from Kenya and brought them to the Southern District of New York in January 2017. (Def. Mem. Of Law at 1-2.) To support this version of events, Ibrahim Akasha Abdalla submitted a sworn affidavit attesting that on or about January 28, 2017, he was sitting in his vehicle in Mombasa, Kenya when several armed individuals who \"identified themselves as police\" forced him into the backseat of his car, bound his hands, confiscated his two cellular telephones, and eventually transferred him to a second car and covered his head. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Affidavit,\" Dkt. No. 70, Ex. C.) Ibrahim Akasha Abdalla attests that he was then transferred to a \"small, dark, very hot windowless room,\" where he was kept without food or water for approximately two days. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14-15.) Ibrahim Akasha Abdalla attests that during those two days, men repeatedly interrogated him about the whereabouts of his brother, Baktash Akasha Abdalla, and when he denied any such knowledge, they beat him with\n   their hands and sticks, kicked him, and poured water on him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) After approximately two days, Ibrahim Akasha Abdalla was transferred to the custody of agents of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, who brought him to the Southern District of New York by airplane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Akasha Brothers move to compel the Government to produce any documents related to their extradition or expulsion from Kenya pursuant to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (\"Rule 16\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion.) The Akasha Brothers argue that the requested documents will be material to a subsequent motion they intend to file to dismiss the Superseding Indictment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. of Law at 1-2.) The Superseding Indictment must ultimately be dismissed, the Akasha Brothers argue, because the Court lacks jurisdiction over their prosecution as a result of the Government's conduct in bringing them from Kenya to the United States. Specifically, the Akasha Brothers argue that the Court lacks jurisdiction because: (1) the Government's actions in removing them from Kenya while extradition proceedings were pending violated the United States' extradition treaty with Kenya (the \"Extradition Treaty,\" Dkt. No. 66, Ex. A), and (2) the Government's conduct in kidnapping the Akasha Brothers was so shocking and outrageous that it divested the Court of jurisdiction over the prosecution that flowed from that conduct. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. of Law at 10-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In opposition, the Government argues that the Motion should be denied because: (1) the Akasha Brothers lack standing to challenge the actions of the Kenyan government in delivering them to the United States government; (2) the Akasha Brothers' allegations of abuse at the hands of Kenyan police officers do not rise to the level of outrageous misconduct by agents of the United States government necessary to set forth a constitutional challenge to the Court's jurisdiction; and (3) even if the Akasha Brothers had alleged significant abuse by agents of the United States government, case law does not support the contention that such abuse would divest the Court of jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Government Brief\" at 13-16, Dkt. No. 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In reply, the Akasha Brothers argue that the requested documents are material to their defense because the requested documents may \"shed light on the United States government's involvement in the kidnapping\" and because the documents will demonstrate whether or not the Akasha Brothers were removed from Kenya pursuant to an expulsion or extradition order and consequently whether their removal was in compliance with the Extradition Treaty. (\"Def. Reply Brief\" at 3, Dkt. No. 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Rule 16\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In relevant part, Rule 16 provides that the Government \"must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy ... documents, if the item is within the government's possession, custody, or control and ... the item is material to preparing the defense.\" Fed.

The Akasha Brothers' allegations that they were removed from Kenya before they were formally extradited do not run afoul of any provisions of the Treaty, which sets forth rules for extradition, but does not state that extradition is the sole mechanism by which a Kenyan national may be transferred to the United States for criminal prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Machain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730664\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/655/#p666\">\n    504 U.S. at 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730664\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/655/#p666\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that no treaty violation occurred where the treaty at issue did not explicitly \"prohibit[ ] abductions outside of its terms\" and declining to interpret the treaty as imposing \"an implied term prohibiting prosecution where the defendant's presence is obtained by means other than those established by the Treaty\"). Indeed, all of the Treaty provisions that the Akasha Brothers point to as having been violated by their removal to the United States set forth rules for extradition and not for removal generally. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Extradition Treaty at Article 4 (\"The extradition shall not take place if the person claimed ... is still under trial in the territories of the High Contracting Party applied to, for the crime or offense for which his extradition is demanded.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730664\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/655/#p666\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Article 8 (providing that \"[t]he extradition\" must conform to the laws of the territory from which a defendant is to be extradited).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Akasha Brothers argue that their transfer from the custody of Kenyan police officers to United States agents ran afoul of direct orders from the High Court of Kenya prohibiting the Kenyan Law Enforcement Agents from removing the Akasha Brothers from the jurisdiction of the Kenyan courts.

The issue for purposes of this Court's jurisdiction is whether the Akasha Brothers' transfer to the United States violated the Extradition Treaty and not whether it violated any of Kenya's domestic laws. Thus, whether Kenyan Law Enforcement Agents complied with the orders of Kenyan courts in transferring the Akasha Brothers to the custody of the United States is irrelevant to the present inquiry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because the Akasha Brothers lack standing to raise a violation of the Extradition Treaty, and because any such challenge would lack merit if they did have standing to raise it, the Akasha Brothers have not put forth a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case that any documents they demand from the Government could support a non-frivolous defense based on the first exception to the\n   <em>\n    Ker\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Frisbie\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   With respect to the second exception to the\n   <em>\n    Ker\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Frisbie\n   </em>\n   doctrine, the Akasha Brothers argue that because their transfer to the United States was precipitated by Kenyan police officers' kidnapping of Ibrahim Akasha Abdalla, followed by a two-day violent interrogation, the Court lacks jurisdiction over the prosecution that flows from that violent conduct. However, these allegations, if true, charge only Kenyan officials with violent conduct against Ibrahim Akasha Abdalla. The Akasha Brothers do not claim that they suffered any violence, custodial interrogation, or torture at the hands of United States officials. Additionally, there is no reason to believe that the documents the Akasha Brothers seek to compel-\"extradition and/or expulsion documents\" (Motion at 2)-could plausibly demonstrate that agents of the United States government directed Kenyan officials to engage in any of the alleged violent conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
