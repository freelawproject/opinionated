The litigation consists of 41 actions, 29 in the Eastern District of Louisiana and 12 in the Western District of Louisiana, as listed on Schedule A. The Panel has been notified of one additional action involving related issues, which is pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n </opinion>\n <summary id=\"p-8\">\n  Responding plaintiffs the Parishes of Plaquemines, Jefferson, Cameron, and St. Bernard, and District Attorneys Keith Stutes and Bridget Dinvaut oppose centralization, as do plaintiff-intervenors the State of Louisiana, through the Department of Natural Resources, Office of Coastal Management, and its Secretary, Thomas F. Harris, and the State of Louisiana\n  <em>\n   ex rel\n  </em>\n  . Jeff Landry, Attorney General. Defendant Cox Operating, L.L.C., supports centralization in the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n </summary>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  On the basis of the papers filed and the hearing session held, we conclude that centralization is not necessary for the convenience of the parties and witnesses or to further the just and efficient conduct of this litigation. The 41 actions broadly implicate certain common factual questions concerning the reasons why five Louisiana parishes (Plaquemines, Cameron, Jefferson, St. Bernard, and Vermilion) have been experiencing coastal land loss and other damage, and more specifically, the extent, if any, to which defendants' oil and gas exploration, production, and transportation activities in those parishes have contributed to that loss. But each action involves oil and gas operations conducted in a different \"Operational Area,\" and is brought against a different cast of defendants. Moving defendants do not contend that the various oil and gas fields in these Operational Areas were developed at the same time or operated in the same manner. Similarly, defendants do not assert that other possible causes of land loss and damage are the\n  same from Operational Area to Operational Area. Although issues concerning federal and state regulation of the oil and gas industry and certain industry practices may be common across the actions, the nature of these cases suggests that most pretrial proceedings, particularly discovery, will be largely individualized.\n </opinion>\n <attorneys id=\"p-10\">\n  Aside from the preponderance of individualized issues, centralization under Section 1407 does not appear necessary. Plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenors represent that they are amenable to Section 1404 transfer of the Western District of Louisiana cases to the Eastern District of Louisiana for possible consolidation. Even if such transfer is not administratively practicable, as defendants contend, the 41 cases are pending in two adjacent districts. Informal coordination by the involved courts and cooperative efforts by counsel thus should be feasible to avoid or minimize duplicative pretrial proceedings.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the motion for centralization of these actions is denied.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"*\">\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Judges Sarah S. Vance and Lewis A. Kaplan took no part in the decision of this matter.
