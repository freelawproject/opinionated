The FCA employees did not identify their employer nor explain that they were trying to collect a debt during either of the phone calls. Prendergast filed a lawsuit against FCA, arguing that its phone calls violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The parties have filed cross motions for summary judgment.

FCA, on the other hand, urges this Court to\n   grant summary judgment in its favor on all of the FDCPA violations that Prendergast alleges. The Court will address each of the various sections in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To establish a claim under the FDCPA, Prendergast must prove that (1) FCA qualifies as a \"debt collector\" as defined in \u00a7 1692a(6), (2) the actions of which she complains were taken \"in connection with the collection of any debt,\" and (3) the actions violated one of the FDCPA's substantive provisions.\n   <em>\n    Gburek v. Litton Loan Servicing LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706383\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/380/#p384\">\n    614 F.3d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 384 (7th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). The joint statement of undisputed facts unambiguously establishes that FCA \"is a debt collector and at all times relevant was collecting a consumer debt as defined by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a\" and, at the time of the two phone calls, FCA \"attempted to contact [Prendergast] in an attempt to collect the alleged debt.\" Doc. 16 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13. The only question that remains is whether FCA's phone calls violated a provision of the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Section 1692d(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Debt collectors cannot make phone calls \"without meaningful disclosure of the caller's identity,\" except as provided in \u00a7 1692b. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692d(6). Courts have decided that meaningful disclosure requires the debt collector's employees to disclose the name of their company and the fact that the purpose of the call is debt collection.\n   <em>\n    Pawelczak v. Fin. Recovery Servc., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4252766\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/286/381/#p387\">\n    286 F.R.D. 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 387 (N.D. Ill. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The two parties do not dispute that the FCA callers did not meaningfully identify themselves within the meaning of the statute when they called Prendergast. A review of the transcripts of both phone calls clearly establishes this-neither caller explained that the purpose of the call was debt collection or that they worked for FCA. Doc. 16 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 18. The question that these motions raise is whether \u00a7 1692d(6) even applies to the phone calls, where the FCA callers were unable to confirm certain identifying information about Prendergast. If this provision covers FCA's phone calls with Prendergast, then it is clear from the facts established in the undisputed statement of facts that FCA violated it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   FCA argues that the callers were unable to confirm Prendergast's identity and so the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 1692d(6) do not apply. FCA provides no legal support for its contention that the disclosure requirements of this section only applies after a debt collector has confirmed the consumer's identity. But the Court need not reach this question, because these are not even the facts presented before it. FCA does not dispute that the person on the other end of both of the calls to Prendergast's phone number was in fact Prendergast; rather, it argues that its callers had no way of knowing at the time of the phone calls that they were speaking to Prendergast. The callers both knew that they were calling the phone number associated with Prendergast's account. In the second phone call, Prendergast explicitly stated: \"This is Yenma.\" Doc. 16 \u00b6 18. This is clear confirmation of Prendergast's identity. FCA discredits this confirmation, positing that it is \"insufficient as a matter of law\" because the statement was \"flippant\" and Prendergast then \"refused to confirm any other identifying information.\" Doc. 20 at 7. However, FCA provides no support for these characterizations. FCA was speaking to the consumer, who identified herself by name. At this point, once Prendergast identified herself, the requirements of \u00a7 1692d(6) become entirely clear: Heebner needed to state that she worked for FCA and was calling to collect a debt, and she did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   FCA also argues that it is clear that its callers did not know whether they had contacted Prendergast because of the notes that they made in the system after the call. Even conceding that FCA is correct that its callers were uncertain that they had reached Prendergast (a fact of which the Court is doubtful, particularly in the case of the second phone call), FCA fails to identify why the callers' opinions would be relevant. These facts are immaterial; again, FCA was speaking to the consumer, who had identified herself by name. At this point, the impressions of the caller do not factor into the Court's analysis. Moreover, to the extent that FCA argues that Prendergast was \"playing coy,\" Doc. 18 at 2; Doc. 20 at 4, in her responses to their phone calls, they fail to support this with any facts. In response to their requests to confirm her address, Prendergast responded both times that any mail could be sent to the address that the callers mentioned. This information, especially coupled with her self-identification in the second call, indicates a confirmation of her address. The only other identifying information discussed on the call was Prendergast's social security number, and the Court finds it ridiculous to suggest that declining to provide one's security number to an unidentified stranger over the phone is somehow evasive or \"coy\" behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   FCA argues that its callers were entitled to confirm Prendergast's address (two were associated with her account) and/or social security number before disclosing the necessary information about itself. FCA does not point to any portion of the FDCPA that qualifies the disclosure requirements in this way. It relies only on an unreported case from the District Court of Kansas to support this contention, which noted that \"[u]nder the FDCPA, when a debt collector is unable to confirm the debtor's identity via the debtor's Social Security number, the debt collector must terminate the call.\"\n   <em>\n    Galligan v. FMS, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-2004-JAR-JPO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201207214\">\n    2012 WL 1207214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D. Kan. Apr. 11, 2012). The only support the\n   <em>\n    Galligan\n   </em>\n   court provided for this contention was a reference to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) -the Court presumes this was a reference to either \u00a7\u00a7 1692b or 1692c(b), which the Court addresses below. To the extent that the\n   <em>\n    Galligan\n   </em>\n   court intended to require that consumers confirm their social security numbers before the FDCPA's disclosure requirements apply to debt collectors, this Court respectfully disagrees. The FDCPA includes no such requirement. If this were the rule, consumers would need to give their social security numbers out to random unknown callers before the caller even disclosed the purpose of the call. Given the rampant identity theft problems that today's consumers face, this outcome would be absurd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   FCA also argues that it did not violate the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 1692d(6) because the phone calls fall within the provision's exception for calls made pursuant to \u00a7 1692b. The plain language of the statute prevents this interpretation of the FDCPA: \u00a7 1692b provides that debt collectors \"communicating with any person\n   <em>\n    other than the consumer\n   </em>\n   for the purpose of acquiring location information about the consumer shall ... only if expressly requested, identify his employer [and shall] not state that such consumer owes any debt.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692b (emphasis added). When its callers placed those two phone calls in December 2016, they did not communicate with any person other than the consumer-they communicated with the consumer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chatman v. GC Servs., LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068630\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/57/560/#p569\">\n    57 F.Supp.3d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 569 (D.S.C. 2014). As noted in\n   <em>\n    Chatman\n   </em>\n   , the argument that potential liability for \u00a7 1692b absolves debt collectors from complying with other provisions of the FDCPA \"is nothing more than a creative attempt to avoid the clear\n   mandates of Section 1692d(6) and 1692e(11).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068630\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/57/560/#p569\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068630\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/57/560/#p569\">\n    at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court understands that this could occasionally place debt collectors between a rock and a hard place if the caller truly cannot determine whether they are on the phone with the consumer or a third party. But this is not that situation: they called a number associated with Prendergast, and the person who answered identified herself as Prendergast. There is no dispute with regard to these facts, and so Prendergast is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Section 1692e(11)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Debt collectors must \"disclose in the initial ... communication with the consumer ... that the debt collector is attempting to collect a debt and that any information obtained will be used for that purpose.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(11). FCA's primary argument, that \u00a7 1692e(11) does not apply because its callers were not certain they were speaking with the consumer, fails for the same reason it fails regarding \u00a7 1692b(6). However, FCA also argues that it did not violate the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 1692e(11) specifically for two reasons. First, it argues that the phone calls do not constitute communications under the meaning of the FDCPA, and so no initial communication was made that would trigger the requirements of \u00a7 1692e(11). Second, it argues that the Seventh Circuit has imposed a materiality requirement on any violation of \u00a7 1692e, and any violation made by its phone calls were not material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The FDCPA defines \"communication\" as \"the conveying of information regarding a debt directly or indirectly to any person through any medium.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(2). Though a few courts have held otherwise, many persuasive authorities have interpreted this definition broadly and have concluded that this definition includes communications between debt collectors and consumers where the debt collectors do not specifically mention the debt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramirez v.

Mich. 2013) (finding no FDCPA communication where the caller merely stated his name and company and asked that the consumer call him back). The Court finds these cases persuasive. FCA objects to this line of cases and the cases cited by Prendergast as distinguishable on the grounds that these case involved voicemails left by the debt collector. However, FCA does not explain why a voicemail where the debt collector does not identify itself and merely \"requests that Plaintiff return their calls\" should be distinguishable from the present situation. At any rate, both callers reached Prendergast over the phone, identified their names, and informed Prendergast that they were calling regarding the delivery of a letter. Doc. 16 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 18. Under this line of cases, this is sufficient to constitute a communication under the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   FCA also argues that any violation of \u00a7 1692e must be material in order to be actionable. FCA is correct that \"[g]enerally, \u00a7 1692e only protects against false statements that are material.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Evans v.

In\n   <em>\n    Janetos\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit noted that a general materiality requirement for \u00a7 1692e was necessary because its provisions \"are drafted in broad terms,\" and so courts need to determine \"whether [a claim] represent[s] the kind of conduct the Act was intended to eliminate.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324436\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/317/#p324\">\n    825 F.3d 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 324 (7th Cir. 2016). The court contrasted that with the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 1692g(a), where Congress had already decided that the FDCPA should penalize certain failures to disclose, and held there was no need for individual inquiry regarding materiality in that situation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324436\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/317/#p324\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Section 1692e(11) is similar to \u00a7 1692g(a) in this regard-Congress has already decided that the FDCPA should penalize a debt collector's failure to disclose certain information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Seventh Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Evans v. Portfolio Recovery Associates\n   </em>\n   further undermines FCA's attempt to impose an individual materiality requirement. There, the circuit court held that any violation of \u00a7 1692e(8) would always be material.\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202035315\">\n    2018 WL 2035315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (to violate \u00a7 1692e(8), debt collectors \"omit a piece of information that is\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   material, namely, that the consumer has disputed a particular debt\" (emphasis in original) ). Like \u00a7 1692e(11), \u00a7 1692e(8) contains a higher level of specificity than \u00a7 1692e generally. Applying the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Janetos\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   to \u00a7 1692e(11), it appears as though Congress has already determined the materiality question for the courts. Rather than the broad strokes of other portions of \u00a7 1692e, the provision specifically requires debt collectors to disclose to consumers in their initial communication that they are debt collectors and that any information they obtain will be used to collect a debt. Even if an individual inquiry were necessary on the materiality issue, the FCA callers' failure to reveal the purpose for their calls deprived Prendergast of the opportunity to intelligently respond to the callers' questions, \"the epitome of materiality.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204325495\">\n    2015 WL 4325495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. FCA has not shown a genuine issue of material fact regarding \u00a7 1692e(11), and so the Court grants summary judgment in favor of Prendergast on this provision as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Section 1692d, Section 1692g(a), and \"Other Deceptive Conduct\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In its motion, FCA also asks that the Court grant summary judgment in its favor with regard to the other sections that Prendergast raised in her complaint- \u00a7\u00a7 1692d and 1692g(a), as well as the \"other deceptive conduct\" that she mentions in\n   her complaint. Because the Court has already found that FCA violated the FDCPA, it denies FCA's motion regarding these other portions of Prendergast's complaint as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Statutory Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In light of the Court's finding that FCA violated two provisions of the FDCPA, Prendergast is entitled to statutory damages.\n   <em>\n    Borcherding-Dittloff v. Transworld Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11585256\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/58/1006/#p1011\">\n    58 F.Supp.2d 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1011-12 (W.D. Wis. 1999) (\"To obtain statutory damages, a plaintiff need prove only that the debt collector violated the statute.\"). Prendergast emphasizes that she is entitled to the maximum statutory penalty, and FCA does not address statutory damages in its briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court may allow statutory damages up to $1,000. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a)(2). Although it is within the Court's discretion to decide what amount to award, the FDCPA provides various factors to consider, which include: (1) the frequency and persistence of noncompliance by the debt collector, (2) the nature of such noncompliance, and (3) the extent to which such noncompliance was intentional. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Applying the first factor to this case, FCA made, at most, two phone calls that violated the FDCPA, which violated two different provisions of the statute. Second, the nature of the calls were somewhat threatening-having a stranger call with your social security number and address and refuse to explain the reason for the call would unnerve anyone. And according to Prendergast, the calls made her \"paranoid, scared, and worried.\" Doc. 16, Ex. A \u00b6 12. Finally, \"even if the violation was not intentional, it was at a minimum, measured and calculated.\"\n   <em>\n    Edwards v. Niagara Credit Solutions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5563610\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/586/1346/#p1354\">\n    586 F.Supp.2d 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1354 (N.D. Ga. 2008). According to the joint statement of undisputed material facts, FCA's policy required that its callers confirm either the consumer's social security or birthdate (for some reason, the callers involved here did not ask for birthdate as an alternative to social security number) before they made any of the necessary FDCPA disclosures. FCA chose this policy, which violates the FDCPA, and must face the consequences of its decision. In light of these factors, the Court awards Prendergast $1,000 in statutory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Prendergast's motion for summary judgment [15], awards Prendergast $1,000 in statutory damages, and denies FCA's motion for summary judgment [17].\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The facts in this section are derived from the joint statement of undisputed material facts [16] and accompanying exhibits.
