Mr. Zaidan learned his name was included on a list of suspected terrorists and Mr. Kareem has been the victim or near victim of at least five aerial bombings while in Syria. Based on this information, the Plaintiffs believe their names are on a list of individuals the United States has determined are terrorists and may be killed (the so-called Kill List). Plaintiffs sue President Donald J. Trump, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Secretary of the Department of Defense (DOD), the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), all in their official capacities, as well as the Department of Justice (DOJ), DOD, DHS, and CIA. Plaintiffs allege that these officials and agencies violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , by putting Plaintiffs' names on the Kill List. Defendants move to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that Plaintiffs lack standing and raise a political question outside the jurisdiction of the courts.

To the contrary, Mr. Zaidan alleges that some information from SKYNET was publicized by unknown persons on the Internet and it included his name as prime among persons whose metadata caused them to be suspected of terrorist activities. That information, whether or not classified, may be cited by Plaintiffs although its weight may be subject to attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Complaint alleges that \"Defendants' false classification of plaintiff Zaidan as a terrorist, based on SKYNET's metadata analysis, has prompted defendants to place him on their Kill List and target him to be killed.\" Compl. \u00b6 35.

Therefore, the Court assumes the accuracy of Mr. Zaidan's allegations that he is a journalist who regularly meets with individuals tied to terrorists, that he has interviewed terrorist leaders, and that he found his name on a SKYNET list of potential terrorists. These facts, however, are not sufficient to allege plausibly that his name is on a U.S. Kill List; that conclusion is mere speculation presented as a fact. As did the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Clapper v. Amnesty International USA\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Zaidan presents a list of factual allegations that is too attenuated from the final necessary allegation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    568 U.S. at 410-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, while Mr. Zaidan would not need to plead with certainty or have actual proof that his name is on a Kill List, his current allegations would require the Court to find that it is plausible that every individual whose name is on the SKYNET list of potential terrorists is also on a Kill List, for which there is no evidence of fact or logic. To the contrary, Mr. Zaidan does not allege that a single individual on the SKYNET list has been the subject of a United States drone strike or targeted for lethal action. While it is possible that there is a correlation between a list like SKYNET and the Kill List, the Court finds no allegations in the Complaint that raise that possibility above mere speculation. Accordingly, the Court finds Mr. Zaidan has failed to allege a plausible injury-in-fact and therefore has no standing to sue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Court concludes that Mr. Zaidan has no standing to pursue his lawsuit, the remaining arguments will be analyzed only as they pertain to Mr. Kareem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   ii.

Although Defendants set forth other plausible alternatives, such as the fact that Mr. Kareem could have been targeted by Syria for reporting on anti-Assad efforts, their argument does not make it implausible that the attacks were a result of U.S. action; at oral argument, Defendants conceded that Mr. Kareem specifies that at least one of the strikes was from a Hellfire missile of the kind used by the U.S. without identifying the other weapons to the contrary.

From the former perspective, Defendants insist that the APA does not apply due to this \"time of war,\" while from the latter, Defendants assert that the United States has such a limited military presence in Syria it is not plausible the attacks against Mr. Kareem were the result of U.S. action.

Defendants do not disavow the Presidential Policy Guidance or its applicability to any decision in 2016 or earlier to put Mr. Kareem's\n   name on the Kill List, as he alleges. The Presidential Policy Guidance supports his argument that the relevant decisions are made far from the field of battle. Mr. Kareem complains of an alleged decision to authorize a lethal strike against him and not a decision in the field to attempt to carry out that authorization. He wants the opportunity to persuade his government that he is not a terrorist or a threat so that the alleged authorization to kill is rescinded.

When an individual who is not a U.S. person is proposed for lethal action, and the principals of the relevant defense agencies unanimously decide that lethal action should be taken, the principal of the nominating agency may approve lethal action after prior notice to the President.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 14 \u00a7 3.E.1.

As an emphasis to this conclusion, the Presidential Policy Guidance itself states that it \"is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\" Presidential Policy Guidance at 18 \u00a7 8.A.

As discussed above, Mr. Kareem's first claim would require the Court to delve into the propriety or merit of the decision to place Mr. Kareem on the Kill List, which is beyond the Court's authority. Counts Two and Three, on the other hand, appear at first blush to present \"pure[ ] legal issues,\" namely whether Defendants violated a pertinent legal authority when they placed Mr. Kareem on the Kill List. However, the process of determining whether Defendants exceeded their authority or violated any of the statutes referenced in the Complaint would require the Court to make a finding on the propriety of the alleged action, which is prohibited by the political question doctrine. Therefore, the Court finds Counts Two and Three raise a nonjusticiable political question and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   c.

Importantly, unlikethe plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    El-Shifa\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jaber\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Kareem does not seek a ruling that a strike by the U.S. military was mistaken or improper. He seeks his birthright instead: a timely assertion of his due process rights under the Constitution to be heard before he might be included on the Kill List and his First Amendment rights to free speech before he might be targeted for lethal action due to his profession.

While these latter cases provide only guidance, not decision, their guidance is useful here because constitutional norms were extended to U.S. citizens abroad despite the context of war-making. The difference between them and the instant matter is also notable: Mr. Kareem is not in U.S. custody and, if targeted because he is on the Kill List, may well have been identified by means other than his name, profession, place of birth, and the like. Now that he has made it to a U.S. court, however, his constitutional rights as a citizen must be recognized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Neither of the\n   <em>\n    al-Aulaqi\n   </em>\n   decisions provides a useful final analysis here. Nasser al-Aulaqi challenged \"the facts of military decisions exercised thousands of miles from the forum\" and did so before the Presidential Policy Guidance was developed in 2013 or published in 2016, thereby establishing the system whereby such identification of targets is made by the principals of U.S. defense agencies or the President in Washington.\n   <em>\n    Al-Aulaqi I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120346\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/727/1/\">\n    727 F.Supp.2d at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   suit filed by Nasser al-Aulaqi after his son's death was decided on the peculiarities of\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   precedent and the applicability of that decision to new fact patterns. This case is brought by a U.S. citizen who seeks to interpose accurate personal information concerning his profession and activities into specific targeting decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   These are weighty matters of law and fact but constitutional questions are the bread and butter of the federal judiciary.

Failure to State a Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants' final argument in support of dismissal is the same as the first. They argue that Mr. Kareem's allegations that he has been put on the Kill List are implausible and, therefore, fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that Mr. Kareem's allegations may be wrong as a matter of fact but the Complaint presents them in a plausible manner.
