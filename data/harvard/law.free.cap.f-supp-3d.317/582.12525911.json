COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   It is a sad reality of American life that a white citizen of Washington, D.C. would feel a need to report an African American teenager and his friends to the police for simply congregating in a public establishment. It is also lamentable (but thankfully not tragic in this instance) that the young man, having committed no crime, would feel the urge to run when the police arrived to investigate. Both actions are born of fear on either side of the country's racial divide. But while those fears may animate this case, they do not decide it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case instead turns on a miscommunication between the 911 dispatchers who took the citizen's complaint and the patrol officers to whom it was relayed. That the officers received erroneous information about the nature of the complaint immunizes their use of force to detain the young man. And if the miscommunication was simply negligent, which seems likely, then the dispatchers, too, would be immune from suit. The present record, however, does not allow for a definitive determination of the dispatchers' mental state. The Court will therefore await further briefing after limited discovery before reaching that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before the Court are motions to dismiss, and on one issue an alternative motion for summary judgment, filed by the individual police officers and dispatchers who are named as defendants in this case. The District of Columbia joins both sets of motions. Because the defendants have predominantly moved for dismissal, the Court draws the following factual background from Plaintiff Jason Goolsby's Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Browning v. Clinton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414873,3699663\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/235/\">\n    292 F.3d 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 12, 2015, Goolsby and two other young African-American men walked into the vestibule of a Citibank in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, D.C. to use an ATM. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14. A Caucasian family of three-a mother, father, and baby in a stroller-approached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. Goolsby held the door open for the family to enter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. He then overheard the mother say she had left something in the car, and the family left the bank without using the ATM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After leaving, the woman called 911.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. She reported to the dispatcher that she felt uneasy about Goolsby and the other two young men standing in the vestibule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 23, 51. The dispatcher then \"relayed false and/or misleading information\" to several District police officers, informing them that they were responding to \"an imminent or already attempted robbery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, 29-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When the responding officers arrived, they observed Goolsby and his friends walking down the street near the bank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. They then \"converged on the teenagers as if they were apprehending a dangerous felon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. One of the officers drove his SUV directly toward Goolsby \"at a very high rate of speed\" before exiting the car and yelling at Goolsby to get down on the ground or he would pepper spray him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-42. Goolsby instead fled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Following a \"short pursuit,\" the officers caught Goolsby and \"violently slamm[ed] [him] to the ground,\" \"twist[ed] [his] arm to a gut-wrenching degree while [he] screamed in pain,\" and handcuffed him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-45, 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While Goolsby was handcuffed, the officers contacted the woman who had placed the 911 call.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. The woman informed the officers that there had been no robbery, but that she had been alarmed by the young men's presence and thought the police should investigate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-51. After speaking to the woman, the officers informed Goolsby that he had been detained because of the 911 call and released him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53-54. Goolsby alleges that he suffered unspecified \"severe injuries to his face, left arm, neck, back, and thighs\" at the hands of the officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Goolsby subsequently brought suit against the District of Columbia as well as the individual officers and dispatchers involved in the incident. He alleged violations of his constitutional rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , premised on claims of illegal arrest or seizure, use of excessive force, and deprivation of his due process rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 78-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He also raised parallel D.C. law claims for negligence, false imprisonment, assault and battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the individual defendants as well as against the District of Columbia under a respondeat superior theory of liability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 60-77, 96-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Goolsby's original complaint was served on the District alone, since he did not know the identities of the individual officers and dispatchers. The District subsequently moved to dismiss or, alternatively, for summary judgment on the D.C. law claims; because the individual defendants had not yet been served, the District's motion did not address any of the section 1983 constitutional claims. On June 8, 2017, the Court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss. It then denied the motion without prejudice, directing the District to identify the individual defendants so as to allow Goolsby to effectuate service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order (June 9, 2017). The Court deferred resolution of the D.C. common law claims pending the individual defendants' responses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Goolsby has now filed an amended complaint and effectuated service on the individual defendants. The individual defendants and the District have again moved to dismiss the case, filing two separate motions: one by the police officer defendants (the \"Officers\") and one by the dispatcher defendants (the \"Dispatchers\"), with the District joining both motions as to the respective respondeat superior claims\n   against it. The Dispatchers have also moved for summary judgment on Goolsby's Fourth Amendment claim. The Court held a further hearing on May 22, 2018. It will now grant both motions in part, deny both motions in part, and again reserve ruling on Goolsby's D.C. law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

But as to the Dispatchers, the Court concludes that a genuine issue of material fact precludes summary judgment on the Fourth Amendment claims and that Goolsby has pled an alternative Fifth Amendment theory.

But as noted, Goolsby has pled that the Officers reasonably believed they were responding to an attempted robbery. As a result, they could have reasonably believed they could temporarily detain Goolsby. And even if that conclusion were erroneous, the simple fact that a detention was impermissible does not automatically make the use of force to effectuate that detention excessive.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Velazquez v.

While this issue presents a somewhat closer question than in the false arrest claims, the Court ultimately concludes that qualified immunity is appropriate here, too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For one, Goolsby nowhere points to a case with similar facts holding the officers used excessive force. This disregards the Supreme Court's counsel that in the context of excessive force claims, \"police officers are entitled to qualified immunity unless existing precedent 'squarely governs' the\n   <em>\n    specific facts at issue\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Kisela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610446\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1148/#p1153\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). And this omission is particularly problematic since the level of force, as pled, does not rise to the level that the Supreme Court or the D.C.

In contrast, Goolsby alleges that he suffered unspecified \"severe injuries to his face, left arm, neck, back, and thighs for which he sought medical treatment at Washington Hospital Center.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This factual distinction, however, is still not enough to render any constitutional violation here clearly established.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4291027\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/83/158/#p171\">\n    83 F.Supp.3d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171 (D.D.C. 2015) (according officers qualified immunity on similar facts despite the fact that the officers broke the plaintiff's arm when handcuffing\n   her). The D.C. Circuit has made clear that any injury to the plaintiff is not dispositive but rather only a factor to consider in determining whether the level of force used was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wardlaw v. Pickett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517410,3724125\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/1297/\">\n    1 F.3d 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1304 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Furthermore, Goolsby points to no case from the D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court, and the Court is aware of none, indicating that a severe injury alone suffices to make the degree of force used here, under these circumstances, unreasonable. After all, one could argue that the facts alleged point towards a greater degree of permissible force than in the prior D.C. Circuit cases: Goolsby was in actual flight whereas the plaintiffs in the previous cases only posed a\n   <em>\n    risk\n   </em>\n   of flight, and he was suspected of a more serious offense (attempted robbery) than the plaintiffs in the prior cases (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , walking a dog without a leash or dancing at the Jefferson Memorial). Nor does Goolsby point to cases from other courts of appeals that would suggest any injury here clearly rendered the use of force excessive. Given this absence of cases with similar facts indicating force similar to that used here resulting in \"severe injuries\" was excessive, any constitutional violation was not clearly established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To conclude, the Officers' conduct alleged here falls within a gray area between clearly-sanctioned uses of force from cases such as\n   <em>\n    Wasserman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Oberwetter\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   and clearly-excessive uses of force from cases such as\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . As such, and given the similarity of these facts to those in\n   <em>\n    Wasserman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   , a reasonable officer could have concluded the use of force alleged here was reasonable. The Court therefore must accord the Officers qualified immunity for their alleged conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    2. Dispatchers' Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Goolsby also asserts Fourth Amendment unreasonable seizure and excessive force claims against the Dispatchers. He contends that section 1983 encompasses liability for any government actor who \"was directly responsible for the constitutional deprivation\" or who \"gave authorization or approval of such misconduct.\" Pl.'s Opp'n Dispatchers' MTD at 20. Since the Dispatchers are not alleged to have authorized the Officers' conduct or approved of it-indeed, they were not physically present during any of the events that occurred and have no supervisory or other authority over the Officers-the argument is simply that the Dispatchers' affirmative act of providing false or misleading information to the Officers set in effect a chain of events leading to Goolsby being unlawfully arrested and subjected to excessive force. Pl.'s Opp'n Dispatchers' MTD at 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Dispatchers respond that they should be granted summary judgment because their actions are protected by qualified immunity. Dispatchers' MTD at 13-14. In their view, no cases put them on notice\n   that \"in providing incorrect information to police officers [they] could be held liable for the constitutional torts of the officers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. The Court ultimately concludes that qualified immunity is appropriate as to Goolsby's excessive force claims against the Dispatchers, but that a genuine issue of material fact precludes summary judgment as to his false arrest claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    False Arrest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Beginning with the false arrest claims, the Court will again start with the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis: whether any violation by the Dispatchers was clearly established. Goolsby once more cites no relevant cases, here ones involving dispatchers held liable for false arrest under section 1983. The only relevant court of appeals decisions the Court is aware of-all of which reviewed summary judgment grants to dispatchers-held the dispatcher not liable because he acted negligently or within the scope of his discretion. For instance, a Sixth Circuit opinion held that in the absence of \"deliberate indifference or recklessness\" by two dispatchers, the plaintiff lacked \"a basis to hold the ... dispatchers accountable for a seizure in which they did not directly participate\" under section 1983.\n   <em>\n    Smoak v.

The Supreme Court has recognized that when section 1983 was passed, \"the generally accepted rule was that one who procured the issuance of an arrest warrant by submitting a complaint could be held liable if the complaint was made maliciously and without probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Malley v.

This is in line with the general tort law principle that one who instigates a false arrest, such as by directing a police officer to arrest someone without any suspicion of wrongdoing, is also liable for false arrest or imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 45A (\"One who instigates or participates in the unlawful confinement of another is subject to liability to the other for false imprisonment.\"). Combined, these rules would seem to put any reasonable dispatcher on notice that certain kinds of false reports might violate the Fourth Amendment, namely maliciously misleading police officers without suspicion of wrongdoing in a manner that leads to another's detention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In light of this legal background, the Court concludes that a genuine issue of material fact precludes summary judgment at this juncture. The current record reveals that the dispatchers did, in fact, make incorrect factual statements to the Officers. For instance, the 911 call transcript shows that the caller stated that she\n   \"felt like if [she and her husband] had taken money out [they] might've gotten robbed,\" Dispatchers' MTD Ex. 1, at 1, but a dispatcher later told an officer that the caller \"state[d] that [Goolsby and his companion] were trying to rob him\" and \"that these subjects were trying to rob people at the ATM,\" Pl.'s Opp'n Dispatchers' MTD Ex. 1, at 2:13-16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other officers in their statements described the dispatcher's report as a \"radio run for a possible robbery,\" Pl.'s Opp'n Dispatchers' MTD Ex. 3, at 6, \"a call for a[n] attempted robbery,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, or \"a radio run for a possible attempt robbery,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. All of this suggests that misinformation was given to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The most natural explanation for the erroneous information passed along is simply negligence or confusion on the part of the dispatcher. But it could also be the case that the dispatcher intentionally misdirected the patrol officers for some nefarious purpose. The current record is devoid of any direct evidence speaking to the Dispatchers' mental state; there are no depositions or sworn affidavits that explain why they apparently misrepresented the citizen's complaint to the officers. While the record evidence is certainly consistent with negligence-it is not a difficult to imagine a dispatcher inadvertently turning \"thought I might be robbed\" to \"attempting to rob,\" particularly in a fast-moving situation-it does not foreclose the possibility of intentional conduct. Since the dispatcher's mental state is relevant to whether a section 1983 claim has been stated or a clearly established violation occurred, the current factual record yields a genuine issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court appreciates its obligation to \"exercise its discretion in a way that protects the substance of the qualified immunity defense\" and to ensure that \"officials are not subjected to unnecessary and burdensome discovery or trial proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Crawford-El v. Britton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503978\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/574/#p597\">\n    523 U.S. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 597-98,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503978\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/574/#p597\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503978\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/574/#p597\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). Therefore, while the Court will deny without prejudice the Dispatchers' motion for summary judgment on the false arrest claims, it will not allow the parties to begin full merits discovery. Instead, it will allow only limited discovery into the Dispatchers' mental state since such discovery is necessary to resolve the qualified immunity question. Following this limited discovery, the parties will be free to re-brief summary judgment as to the constitutional claims remaining against the Dispatchers-including the Fifth Amendment claim discussed above and the issue of whether the Dispatchers violated any clearly established Fourth Amendment principles-before progressing further into discovery and the merits of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Excessive Force\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Goolsby also raises excessive force claims against the Dispatchers. As with the false arrest claim, Goolsby cites no case law that has ever found a dispatcher liable for a police officer's use of force. Nor is the Court aware of any. While the cases discussed above might support possible\n   <em>\n    false arrest\n   </em>\n   claims against the Dispatchers, they provide no indication that the Dispatchers might be liable for\n   <em>\n    excessive force\n   </em>\n   claims. In the absence of any case law suggesting that a dispatcher can be held liable for a police officer's use of excessive force, the Court concludes that any constitutional violation here is not clearly established. Dismissal of the excessive force claims against the Dispatchers is\n   thus appropriate on the basis of qualified immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Goolsby's D.C.

Because the Court has not yet resolved the Dispatchers' qualified immunity defense-and, indeed, retains doubts as to whether the remaining claims will survive qualified immunity following limited discovery and summary judgment briefing-it will again reserve on the arguments that remain on Goolsby's D.C. law claims pending the outcome of summary judgment on qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant in part and deny in part both motions to dismiss as detailed above.

It thus cannot show that any constitutional norms were clearly established at the time of the Officers' conduct.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Kisela\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610446\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1148/#p1153\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 1154\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Goolsby's complaint alleges that all of the officers on the scene committed the allegedly unlawful detention and used excessive force. It does not seem plausible that all of the officers were simultaneously involved in the detention and use of force. In any case, as to those officers personally involved, the Court has concluded that they should receive qualified immunity. As to the other officers-against whom Goolsby would have only a bystander liability claim at most-the Court reaches the same conclusion. A bystander liability claim only lies if the bystander officer knows that the other officer is violating constitutional rights.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Matthews v. District of Columbia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4327481\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/924/115/#p118\">\n     924 F.Supp.2d 115\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 118 (D.D.C. 2013). If it was not clearly established that the principal officer was violating constitutional rights, it follows that it is not clearly established that the bystander officer should know the officer was violating constitutional rights. Consequently, it would not be clearly established that the bystander officer would be liable for a failure to intervene.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The Court is cognizant that neither party discussed\n    <em>\n     Malley\n    </em>\n    or\n    <em>\n     Kalina\n    </em>\n    .
