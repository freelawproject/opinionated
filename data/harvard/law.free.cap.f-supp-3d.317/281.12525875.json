Pending before the Court are the defendants' motions to dismiss and Mr. Widtfeldt's motion for leave to file an amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 3; Peterson/Weber Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 5; Neb. Bar Ass'n Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 6; Mot. to Amend, ECF No. 10. Because the Court lacks jurisdiction over Mr. Widtfeldt's claim and because his proposed amended complaint is futile, the defendants' motions to dismiss are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Mr. Widtfeldt's motion for leave to file an amended complaint is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mr. Widtfeldt's complaint is impossible to decipher, despite the Court's best efforts. The nineteen-page complaint seems to allege: (1) a conspiracy dating back to the Clinton Administration regarding \"wrongful Lyme Treatment Standard,\" in order to \"create a national health epidemic with Lyme disease,\" Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6 2; (2) city-ordered and Nebraska Supreme Court-approved \"break-ins\" of Mr. Widtfeldt's law firm office in 2015,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4; (3) the illegal disposal of a Native American's body,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5; (4) improper IRS tax audits dating back to 1970,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6; (5) USDA's repudiation of farm subsidies worth $100 million,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8; (6) conspiracy to hide evidence regarding a 2002 IRS tax settlement,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11; (7) conspiracy by the Federal Election Commission to \"chill\" the Christian Coalition's freedom of speech,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12; (8) conspiracy by Democratic Party members to \"chill\" Mr. Widtfeldt's speech regarding global warming, specifically that a massive volcano eruption caused global warming,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14; (9) failure to compensate Mr. Widtfeldt $5 trillion for his Ph.D, which \"saved a war with Russia,\"\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17; (10) conspiracy by Democratic Party members to pay $100 million to each \"Democrat Judge\" and \"elected Democrat Office Holder\",\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14; among other allegations. Mr. Widtfeldt seeks $13 trillion dollars in attorneys' fees, in addition to over $5 trillion in other damages.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Try as it might, the Court can neither determine the grounds for its jurisdiction nor Mr. Widtfeldt's grounds for relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) (\"A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain: (1) a short and plain statement of the grounds for the court's jurisdiction, ...
