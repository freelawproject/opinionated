BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n   For the last several years Plaintiff Mark Thorp has waged a lengthy legal battle against the District of Columbia over what he claims was an unlawful 2015 search of his home and arrest for drug and animal-cruelty charges. Although this Court recently granted summary judgment to the District,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorp v. D.C. (Thorp I)\n   </em>\n   , --- F.Supp.3d ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202364291\">\n    2018 WL 2364291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. May 24, 2018), Thorp is not waving a white flag. Instead, on May 7, 2018, he filed a new suit against,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the city's lawyers, asserting a farrago of counts arising from the D.C. Office of Tax Revenue's issuance of tax summonses to twelve corporate entities affiliated with him and his nightclub business. Plaintiff contends that, rather than being issued for permissible civil purposes, these summonses are in fact part of a criminal investigation launched against him as retaliation for filing the prior suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Framing the summonses as the latest fusillade in a comprehensive scheme to interfere with the prosecution of his earlier case, Thorp asserts that OTR is acting in bad faith and has gone far beyond the scope of its civil authority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2047-4310\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 47-4310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff alleges that the summonses therefore violate his First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment rights, as well as constituting a conspiracy to deprive him of his civil rights, an abuse of process, and a violation of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. Relying on his constitutional claims, Thorp has now moved for a preliminary injunction, asking this Court to enjoin the District from enforcing the OTR summonses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As it indicated at oral argument, the Court remains puzzled why Plaintiff has chosen to file a 37-page lawsuit in federal court instead of simply challenging OTR's summonses or its authority in the D.C. Superior Court. In any event, the Court concludes that such a pre-enforcement action challenging state tax administration is not a proper matter for the federal system. Under the doctrine of comity, Thorp's myriad claims regarding OTR's actions belong instead in Superior Court. This Court, consequently, concludes that Plaintiff cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits sufficient for a preliminary injunction to issue, as he cannot even show a likelihood that this Court should hear his case. The Court finds, additionally, that Thorp cannot demonstrate the requisite likelihood of irreparable harm for injunctive relief. Here, the OTR summonses at issue remain pending and unenforced. Plaintiff's parade of horribles regarding the impact of the records requests therefore is largely speculative, and his alleged injuries far from certain. As the Court thus concludes that Thorp's claims do not warrant the \"extraordinary remedy\" of a preliminary injunction, it will deny his Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February 2015, Thorp filed suit against the District of Columbia and Metropolitan Police Department Lieutenant Ramey Kyle, alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the police illegally searched and seized his home and stole certain valuables. On May 24, 2018, this Court granted summary judgment for Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 117, Case No. 15-195 (Order). The Court\n   rejected Thorp's Fourth Amendment claims, as well as his false-arrest, abuse-of-process, and negligent-supervision counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thorp I\n   </em>\n   , --- F.Supp.3d at ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202364291\">\n    2018 WL 2364291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 7, 2018, less than three weeks before the issuance of the Opinion in\n   <em>\n    Thorp I\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff filed this suit against counsel for Defendants in that case-Assistant Attorneys General Conrad Risher and Michael Tilghman-OTR Agent Bruce Traina, and the District itself. This latest Complaint addresses a series of tax summonses for books and records related to various entities allegedly controlled by Thorp-summonses that he claims are in fact directly related to the proceedings in\n   <em>\n    Thorp I\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiff asserts in his Complaint that the summonses were improperly issued as part of a criminal investigation that was launched to retaliate against him for filing suit against the District and to prevent him from litigating the 2015 matter. Under this retaliation theory, Thorp brings a series of constitutional, statutory, and common-law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Specifically, he alleges in Count I that Defendants Traina and Risher violated his First Amendment rights by having \"initiated and caused to be initiated new criminal investigation proceedings,\" which \"are intended to punish and retaliate against the Plaintiff for his disclosures of governmental misconduct and his attempts to seek remedies through civil process.\" Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 195-96. Such conduct, Plaintiff contends, \"has deprived [him] of his right of redress and other forms of freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 197.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thorp's second count also alleges a constitutional violation-namely, a Fifth Amendment due-process violation arising from Defendants' \"unfounded and burdensome criminal investigation,\" which Thorp asserts is \"being employed to harass [him]\" and \"to unlawfully pressure [him] to settle a collateral dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 207-211. His third count is similarly based on the Fifth Amendment, as he alleges that Defendant Tilghman violated his due-process rights when he \"unlawfully interfered with the[ ] proceedings by making false statements regarding the availability of [Defendant] Risher to the Court's law clerk outside of any legal paper or official hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 220. This contention is seemingly based on an alleged April 2, 2018, conversation between Tilghman and a law clerk of this Court in which Thorp contends that Tilghman falsely stated that \"Risher was on 'scheduled leave' \" when \"Risher had specifically stated to the Plaintiff's attorney three days earlier that he would be in the office on April 2.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 185. This \"false statement,\" Plaintiff asserts, \"was intended to thwart the Court's inquiry into the alleged illegal conduct by Risher and Traina.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 185-86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Count IV of the Complaint moves on to the Fourth Amendment, alleging that \"Defendant Traina is employing administrative summonses to conduct a criminal investigation\" and that \"[s]uch summonses for compulsory production of private papers are searches and seizures regulated under the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 227-39. Counts V and VI are similarly directed at the constitutionality of the OTR request, claiming that \"[b]y employing administrative summonses to conduct a criminal investigation,\" Defendant Traina violated Thorp's Sixth Amendment \"right to counsel in a criminal proceeding,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 241, and that the summonses also \"violate[ ] [his] right against compelled self-incrimination\" under the Fifth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 248.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Count VII is brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and alleges that Traina and Risher, \"[i]n response to the 2015 lawsuit and the 2018 Motion for Summary Judgment,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   have \"conspired to deter, by force, intimidation, or threat, [Thorp's] participation in proceedings in this Court, and to injure [Thorp's] person and property on account of his having attended such proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    , \u00b6 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Count VIII alleges \"abuse of process,\" asserting that Traina and Risher used the administrative summonses \"for an ulterior motive, to punish [Thorp] for the prosecution of [his] civil claims,\" \"to interfere with his further prosecution thereof,\" and to \"hinder any investigation into [Defendants'] illegal conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 263-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants argue that, accordingly, the \"[ ]TIA prohibits this Court from enjoining OTR's 'collection' efforts\" and that Plaintiff's challenge \"is impermissible in this forum.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2047-4310\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Thorp disputes such characterization. He asserts that he is not seeking \"an injunction against the assessment, levy, or collection of any tax whatsoever,\" but instead \"an injunction to stop the unconstitutional use of [ ] civil summonses in his criminal investigation.\" Reply at 7. Such injunctive relief, Plaintiff argues, falls outside the bounds of the TIA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    On this point, the Court agrees with Thorp. The TIA does not bar federal-court jurisdiction over this case, as an injunction would not restrain the \"assessment, levy, or collection of any tax under State law.\" As the Supreme Court explained in\n    <em>\n     Direct Mktg.

In that case, the Court determined that a challenge to a Colorado notice-and-reporting statute fell\n    <em>\n     outside\n    </em>\n    of the scope of the Act because the provision did not pertain to the \"assessment, levy, or collection\" of state taxes.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587005\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1124/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587005\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1124/\">\n     at 1130-31\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In reaching this conclusion, the Court engaged in a lengthy exegesis as to what, specifically, those three terms mean. \"Assessment,\" the Court found, \"refers to the official recording of a taxpayer's liability, which occurs after information relevant to the calculation of that liability is reported to the taxing authority.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \"Levy,\" the Court held, is \"limited to an official governmental action imposing, determining the amount of, or securing payment on a tax,\" and \"collection\" is the \"act of obtaining payment of taxes due.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587005\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1124/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Beyond these discrete acts, the Court concluded, the TIA did not bar any and all suits that might affect a state's system of taxation.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587005\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1124/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587005\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1124/\">\n     at 1131-32\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Colorado's notice-and-reporting requirements, the Court found, related to a \"phase of tax administration procedure\" antecedent to the acts covered by the TIA-namely, the \"information gathering\" of materials \"relevant to tax liability.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587005\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1124/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587005\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1124/\">\n     at 1129\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court therefore concluded that enforcement of the state statute fell outside the bounds of the plain language of the TIA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Here, too, the disputed statute relates to a taxpayer's liability, but under\n    <em>\n     Direct Marketing\n    </em>\n    , its enforcement does not fall within the scope of the TIA. Although the District asserts that its summons authority under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2047-4310\">\n     D.C. Code \u00a7 47-4310\n    </extracted-citation>\n    serves, in part, to \"determin[e] the liability of a person or real property for a tax imposed\" and thus is part and parcel of its collection of taxes,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Opp. at 5, this argument falls short in light of the Court's interpretation of \"collection\" in\n    <em>\n     Direct Marketing\n    </em>\n    .\"Collection,\" the Court made clear, \"occurs after a formal assessment\" and is a \"separate step in the taxation process from assessment and the reporting on which assessment is based.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587005\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1124/\">\n     135 S.Ct. at 1130-31\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The language of \u00a7 47-4310 demonstrates that the provision relates not to such post-assessment collections but, instead, is keyed to the \"information gathering\" phase of D.C.'s tax administration. Indeed, as Officer Traina states in his Declaration, the summons authority is used to \"investigate tax liability and possible tax fraud.\" ECF No. 16 (Declaration of Bruce R. Traina), \u00b6 2. Just as with the Colorado reporting statute at issue in\n    <em>\n     Direct Marketing\n    </em>\n    , this component\n    of the District's tax administration is not an aspect of \"assessment,\" \"levy,\" or \"collection\" as defined by the Supreme Court. The Court therefore concludes that the District's tax-summons authority is not within the realm of government actions addressed by the TIA, and that the Act does not bar this Court from hearing this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    <em>\n     2. Comity\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The Court turns next to Defendant's alternative threshold argument that the doctrine of comity precludes Plaintiff's challenge to a D.C. tax provision in federal court. According to the District, \"Plaintiff's suit constitutes an impermissible effort to assert \u00a7 1983 actions against the validity of state tax systems in federal court[ ].\" Opp. at 4. Comity, Defendants contend, \"bars challenges to District of Columbia taxes\" in federal court and thus Thorp's instant suit.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4. Plaintiff does not respond directly to the comity argument in his Reply, but instead broadly refers to the authority of this Court to order prospective relief to remedy unconstitutional government actions-including, allegedly, his claims regarding the administrative tax summonses.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reply at 2-4. Under Thorp's theory, this Court's equitable power to enter an injunction is reason enough for his case to be properly brought before the federal judiciary.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The Court disagrees. It is clear from the Complaint that Thorp is attacking, at bottom, the issuance of a tax summons pursuant to the D.C. Code. Elsewhere in his papers and at oral argument, moreover, Plaintiff suggested that he is in fact challenging the summons provision\n    <em>\n     itself\n    </em>\n    as\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    unconstitutional, arguing that it gives impermissibly broad authority to OTR.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11 (arguing that \"the civil summonses issued by Defendant Traina are patently illegal\" and discussing \"the evident lack of procedural safeguards under District of Columbia law\").

Here, Plaintiff's claims are inextricably intertwined with a determination of the appropriate scope, interpretation, and application of D.C. tax law. Although the summons provision may not invoke the jurisdictional bar of the TIA, resolving this case would require this Court to delve into sensitive matters of state tax law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl. Supp. Mem. at 10 (challenging scope of OTR's \"employment of administrative examination summonses\"). The summons provision under \u00a7 47-4310 addresses the authority of OTR and its agents, and it thus provides a vital mechanism by which D.C. has sought to ensure enforcement and compliance with its tax laws. This delegation of investigational authority is clearly intertwined with the District's ability to administer its chosen system of taxation, including its capacity to determine tax liability, prevent tax fraud, and ensure that its citizens are not shirking their obligations as local taxpayers. In light of the important role \u00a7 47-4310 plays in the District's tax scheme, the Court determines that Thorp should \"seek protection of [his] federal rights by state remedies, provided of course that those remedies are plain, adequate, and complete, and [he] may ultimately seek review of the state decisions\" in the Supreme Court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Fair Assessment in Real Estate Ass'n, Inc. v.

Count II of the Complaint alleges that Defendants violated his Fifth Amendment rights by initiating an \"unfounded and burdensome criminal investigation.\" Compl., \u00b6 206. Repeatedly characterizing the OTR summonses as a \"criminal investigation,\" Thorp contends that the requests are being used for ends other than a legitimate tax inquiry.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 210-11. Yet, because the Court concludes that the summonses at issue are not solely directed at a \"criminal investigation\" and instead comply with the appropriate scope of an administrative tax subpoena, Thorp's Fifth Amendment claim based on their alleged impropriety is unlikely to prevail.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    His second due-process claim (Count III), which alleges that Defendant Tilghman \"unlawfully interfered\" with the 2015 proceedings by \"making false statements regarding the availability of Risher to the Court's law clerk,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 220, finds even less footing in the law. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Thorp can point to no authority supporting his proposition that a single statement by an attorney regarding the\n    vacation schedule of a co-worker-much less one to a law clerk-rises to the level of a due-process violation. A moment of calendaring confusion does not a constitutional case make. Indeed, as the Court has expressed in argument on this matter, such vindictive,\n    <em>\n     ad hominem\n    </em>\n    overreaching undermines Plaintiff's credibility and the legitimacy of this suit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The Court last briefly turns to the remaining issue raised in his Motion-Thorp's First Amendment retaliation claim (Count I).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. at 1-2. The premise here is that Defendants Traina and Risher initiated a new criminal investigation of him-in the form of issuing the disputed summonses-\"less than two weeks\" after new evidence regarding the 2015 lawsuit came to light.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl., \u00b6 195. Given this timing, Thorp contends that the summonses were \"intended to punish and retaliate\" against him.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 196. The Court finds this\n    <em>\n     post hoc ergo propter hoc\n    </em>\n    argument unlikely to prevail. Plaintiff has put forward no evidence of the necessary \"causal link between the exercise of a constitutional right and the adverse action taken against him.\"\n    <em>\n     Aref v. Lynch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4352338\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/242/#p258\">\n     833 F.3d 242\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 258 (D.C. Cir. 2016). Although Thorp may find the timing of the tax investigation \"startling,\" Mot. at 2, the District is correct that the record does not support a reasonable inference of retaliation.\n    <em>\n     Thorp I\n    </em>\n    was initiated three years prior to the issuance of the OTR summonses, and Plaintiff is unable to plausibly explain why Defendants only now are allegedly engaged in an attempt to retaliate against him for litigating that case. He offers no evidence of governmental intent to prevent him from accessing the courts, nor does he show any indication that Defendants sought to punish him for filing and prosecuting the earlier action. Plaintiff may be personally convinced that the administrative tax subpoenas are improperly motivated, but his speculative suspicions do not provide a factual basis for relief. The Court therefore concludes that, as the record stands, he is unlikely to prevail on the merits of his First Amendment claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Although the Court finds that this case does not fall within the parameters of the TIA, it concludes that Thorp's claims are likely barred as a matter of comity. Because Plaintiff has not shown that this Court is in fact empowered to adjudicate his dispute, he cannot demonstrate the requisite likelihood of success for an injunction to issue. The Court concludes, moreover, that even if it\n    <em>\n     were\n    </em>\n    to consider the merits of Thorp's claims, he nonetheless would be unlikely to prevail. In such circumstances, the Court concludes that Plaintiff does not meet the threshold test for injunctive relief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Irreparable Harm\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Given\n    <em>\n     Winter\n    </em>\n    's uncertainty over whether this is sufficient to deny the Motion,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Section II,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the court will move on to irreparable harm. Thorp contends that he will suffer irreparable injury from Defendants' alleged First Amendment violations, claiming that the OTR summonses will deprive him of \"his right of redress and other forms of freedom of speech\" in connection with litigating his 2015 suit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl., \u00b6 197. Yet, as Plaintiff himself recognizes, the \"summonses remain unexecuted and pending.\" Supp. Mem. at 4. As discussed above, Thorp thus has remedies he may pursue in state court before any alleged injuries would occur. First, it would seem that he could move to quash the summonses in Superior Court-a response this Court would think far more straightforward than filing a \u00a7 1983 suit, TRO, and PI Motion in the federal system. Second, Thorp could oppose any attempt to compel his compliance with the\n    tax summonses. Indeed, it was disclosed at oral argument that such a motion to compel one of the summonses has already been filed in Maryland, which Plaintiff made clear his intent to oppose. The Court sees no reason he could not do the same with respect to the other summonses at issue, assuming that any action to enforce is ever brought.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     See v. City of Seattle\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/#p544\">\n     387 U.S. 541\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 544-45,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/#p544\">\n     87 S.Ct. 1737\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/#p544\">\n     18 L.Ed.2d 943\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1967) (noting that an administrative subpoena \"may not be made and enforced by the inspector in the field, and the subpoenaed party may obtain judicial review of the reasonableness of the demand prior to suffering penalties for refusing to comply\"). This ability to contest the summonses in D.C. (or another state) court precludes a finding of irreparable harm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    This conclusion mirrors that of the numerous other cases holding that pre-enforcement suits challenging administrative summonses do not present the requisite risk of immediate injury. Instead, courts have repeatedly rejected claims for injunctive relief, requiring that the plaintiff bring his claims in the context of an enforcement proceeding initiated by the relevant agency.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Jewell v.
