In support of their motion, Defendants rely on the declaration of Great Meadow Correctional Facility's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. David Karandy, Plaintiff's medical records, and Plaintiff's disciplinary history. (Dkt. 61-1; Dkt. 61-2).

The court in\n   <em>\n    Abreu v.

The Second Circuit was not asked in\n   <em>\n    Chavis\n   </em>\n   to consider how a court should approach a defendant's subsequent challenge to an imminent-danger finding, nor was it asked to analyze evidence adduced after the complaint was filed that may refute a court's initial finding that the complaint plausibly alleged facts suggesting plaintiff was in imminent danger of a serious physical injury at the time the action was commenced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Abreu v.

Accordingly, like those courts cited above, the Court will consider the evidence that Defendants have offered-consisting of the declaration of Great Meadow Correctional Facility's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. David Karandy, Plaintiff's medical records, and Plaintiff's disciplinary history-in order to determine whether the Court should revoke its preliminary finding that the imminent danger exception applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plaintiff's IFP Status is Revoked\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court previously determined that Plaintiff is a three-strikes litigant because at least three of Plaintiff's prior actions or appeals have been dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim. (Dkt. 21 at 3-4). Plaintiff's three strikes include the following: (1)\n   <em>\n    Abreuv. Disability Advocates, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:09-CV-06306-LAP (S.D.N.Y.

Feb. 18, 2010) (dismissing complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii) ); and (4)\n   <em>\n    Abreu v. Supreme Court of Bronx County\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-1130 (2d Cir. Aug. 11, 2010) (dismissing appeal because it lacked an arguable basis in law or fact).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint suggested that, at the time of filing on October 20, 2014, he suffered numerous medical conditions that were not properly treated at Wende (where he was housed at the time of filing), including a positive tuberculosis diagnosis, rectal pain and bleeding, a healing right hand fracture following surgery, severe back pain, and other medical conditions. (Dkt. 21 at 4). Based on those allegations, the Court concluded that the imminent danger exception applied and that Plaintiff was entitled to proceed IFP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Yet the medical evidence that Defendants submitted negates Plaintiff's allegations of an imminent danger of serious physical injury. As an initial matter, because of previous incidents where Plaintiff exposed himself to nurses, Plaintiff was required to wear an \"exposer suit\" that would prevent him from doing so. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 61-1 at 3, 17). Plaintiff refused to wear the exposer suit; as a result, he was deemed to have refused medications. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). As to his allegation that he suffered from tuberculosis and was not being treated, Plaintiff had no signs or symptoms of tuberculosis, and he was prescribed-yet refused-prophylactic tuberculosis medication on October 3, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 18, and 20, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 13-19). After he filed the instant complaint, he refused his medication and sick call on October 22, 23, 25, and 27, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 11-12). According to Dr. Karandy, \"Plaintiff's life was not in danger as a result of these refusals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). As to his allegations of back pain and rectal pain and bleeding, a review of Plaintiff's medical records from September through October 2014 reveals that he never complained of those symptoms. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    at 4, 11-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). As to his allegation of a fracture in his right hand, Plaintiff did complain of right hand pain, for which he was\n   seen on multiple occasions and prescribed occupational and physical therapy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 12, 20, 21). As to his complaints of dry skin and gastrointestinal problems, Plaintiff was provided creams, ointments, stool softeners, and other related medications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 22, 24). Considering the medical records summarized above, Plaintiff was not suffering from a condition that placed him in imminent danger of serious physical injury when he filed his complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In opposition to Defendants' motion, Plaintiff fails to refute the medical records or supply evidence of his own to substantiate the allegations of imminent danger. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 67). Instead, he argues that he does not have three strikes. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 67 at \u00b6 5). As summarized above, that claim is false; Plaintiff accumulated three strikes before filing this lawsuit. He also summarizes his claims, recounts incidents that occurred at other correctional facilities, disparages defense counsel and Dr. Karandy, and contends that other courts have granted him leave to proceed IFP in several other cases based on a finding that the imminent danger exception applied. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). However, none of those allegations or circumstances are relevant to the issue presently before the Court. Plaintiff also argues that the Court should not conduct a searching inquiry to determine whether the imminent danger exception applies, per the Second Circuit's instruction in\n   <em>\n    Chavis\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). But, as discussed above,\n   <em>\n    Chavis\n   </em>\n   did not address the situation present here: a defendant's challenge to the preliminary finding that the imminent danger exception applied. Accordingly, the Court finds none of the arguments or allegations set forth in Plaintiff's opposition persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the evidence that Defendants have offered-consisting of the declaration of Great Meadow Correctional Facility's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. David Karandy, Plaintiff's medical records, and Plaintiff's disciplinary history-demonstrates the incorrectness of the Court's preliminary finding that Plaintiff was in imminent danger of serious physical injury at the time he filed his complaint. Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants' motion to revoke Plaintiff's IFP status. (Dkt. 61). The Court orders Plaintiff to pay the $400 filing fee, with credit for any amounts previously collected from his prison account, within 30 days of the date of this Decision and Order. If Plaintiff fails to pay the filing fee, the Clerk of Court is directed to dismiss his complaint with prejudice without further order of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Effective May 1, 2013, the Judicial Conference of the United States added an administrative fee of $50.00 to the cost of filing a civil lawsuit in district court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    September 2012 Report of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the United States,\n    <em>\n     available at\n    </em>\n    &lt; http://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/reports-proceedings-judicial-conference-us&gt;.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
