FRIEDRICH, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Lisa Stephens brings this Title VII action against her former employer, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, asserting that it discriminated against her based on race and gender, subjected her to a hostile work environment, and retaliated against her for engaging in protected activity. Before the Court is Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's Partial Motion to Dismiss. Dkt. 9. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a bureau within the Treasury Department, hired Stephens as a Bank Examiner and Shared National Credit Program Manager on July 1, 2012. Compl \u00b6 6; Dkt. 9-1 at 5. Stephens worked for the Treasury Department for nearly one year. Compl. \u00b6 35. During that time, Stephens' supervisor was Vance Price, the Deputy Comptroller for Large Bank Supervision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. According to the complaint, Price did not adequately explain Stephens' managerial duties, and he did not provide Stephens with necessary training, documents, performance plans, assistance, and feedback.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-11, 25, 29, 32. Also, Stephens \"was forced to supervise\" Jamie-Jo Perry, \"an insubordinate and disgruntled employee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 13, 21-22. The Treasury Department failed to address the insubordination,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13, and Price undermined Stephens' authority over Perry when, for example, he granted Perry's leave request without consulting Stephens and when he reassigned tasks to Perry that Stephens had previously removed from Perry,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 5, 2013, Stephens received a negative performance review,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33, and on June 12-shortly before her one-year probationary period ended-Stephens received a notice of termination,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Stephens then resigned in lieu of termination on June 28, the day before her termination would have taken effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. On July 16, Stephens initiated contact with an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Counselor. The Counselor ultimately issued a Report of Counseling. Dkt. 9-1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 2. On August 26, 2013, Stephens submitted an individual complaint to the Treasury Department. Dkt. 9-2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 2. After the Treasury Department completed an investigation, Stephens opted for a hearing before an administrative judge of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The administrative judge conducted an initial teleconference that discussed the nature of Stephens' claims, then issued an order identifying the issues to be adjudicated and setting a schedule for discovery and dispositive motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 9-4. After discovery was completed and after the Treasury Department's motion for a decision had been pending before the administrative judge for approximately one year, Stephens withdrew her individual complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 9-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Stephens then filed this case, asserting three claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act: disparate-treatment discrimination based on race and gender, hostile work environment, and retaliation. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-54. The Treasury Department answered the complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 4, but in the parties' ensuing meet and confer statement, the Department stated that it \"intend[ed] to file a dispositive motion on [Stephens'] failure to exhaust administrative remedies as to at least one of her claims.\" Dkt. 6 at 2. Because exhaustion is a question that can be resolved on the pleadings and the administrative record, the Court permitted the Treasury Department to file a dispositive motion as to exhaustion of administrative remedies. Dkt. 7 at 2; Dkt. 8 at 1. But because the motion would not dispose of the entire case, the Court also permitted initial discovery to begin while specifying that further discovery was stayed pending resolution of the exhaustion motion. Dkt. 7 at 2; Dkt. 8 at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Before the EEO Counselor and in her individual complaint submitted to the Treasury Department, however, Stephens did not raise this 2012 protected activity as a premise for her retaliation claim in any way. Instead, Stephens identified her protected EEO activity as occurring exclusively in February and March 2013, when she expressed interest in filing her own EEO complaint against Perry because Perry filed one against her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Individual Complaint, Dkt. 9-2 at 3 (\"I was discriminated against based on ... retaliation (complaining of discrimination during the investigation of a complaint by Jamie-Jo Perry against the OCC with me named as the primary management official in\n   <em>\n    February-March 2013\n   </em>\n   ) ....\" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Report of EEO Counseling, Dkt. 9-1 at 2 (checking box for \"retaliation/reprisal for prior protected EEO activity\" based on \"participation in the EEO complaint process as a Responsible Management Official named in a case filed by an OCC employee she supervised\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (\"Ms. Stephens alleges reprisal for her participation in the EEO complaint process as an RMO and for expressing her interest in pursuing an EEO complaint.

As a result, Stephens exhausted administrative remedies for a retaliation claim premised on protected EEO activity that allegedly occurred in February and March 2013, but not premised on any other protected EEO activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.
