MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n     This\n     <em>\n      in rem\n     </em>\n     proceeding against two General Electric aircraft engines started in 2014, when the United States filed a complaint seeking forfeiture of the engines and alleging that Evans Meridians Ltd. intended to transfer the engines to an Iranian entity with terrorist ties. Evans Meridians filed a counter-claim asserting lawful ownership of the property. In 2016, it failed to comply with a court order directing it to repatriate the engines or post a $6 million bond, and the Court entered a coercive contempt order directing the company to pay the Court a fine of $15,000 for each day that it continued in noncompliance. In 2018, Evans Meridians gave up its claim to the property, saying the engines had been dismantled for parts, and the United States moved for a compensatory contempt order directing the company to pay the United States Marshals Service a $4 million fine. Because Evans Meridians has relinquished its claim and there are no other counter-claimants, I will enter default judgment in favor of the United States. At a hearing on February 14, 2018, I requested further briefing regarding the United States' motion for compensatory sanctions. Because Evans Meridians's contempt led to the destruction of the engines, I will grant the United States' motion for a compensatory contempt order. In the interest of justice, I will reduce the outstanding fine under the Court's prior contempt order to $2 million.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     A court must enter default judgment when the \"party against whom a judgment ... is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise.\" Fed.

The sanction imposed by the Court today is\n     payable to the United States as the complainant, and it is thus civil and compensatory, rather than criminal.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-23\">\n     Evans Meridians argues that a $4 million sanction is large enough to push this sanction from the realm of civil contempt to that of criminal contempt. Evans's Suppl. Mem. 5. To support this view, Evans Meridians cites to footnote 5 of\n     <em>\n      Bagwell.\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13721\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/624/#p632\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     But that footnote uses the size of a sanction to distinguish between petty and serious\n     <em>\n      criminal\n     </em>\n     sanctions, not to distinguish between civil and criminal sanctions.\n     <em>\n      Bagwell\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39687\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/821/#p826\">\n      512 U.S. 821\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 837, n.5,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39687\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/821/#p826\">\n      114 S.Ct. 2552\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39687\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/821/#p826\">\n      129 L.Ed.2d 642\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . Evans Meridians misinterprets\n     <em>\n      Bagwell\n     </em>\n     and thus is incorrect in asserting that the size of the sanction factors into the civil-criminal distinction.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-24\">\n     Evans Meridians is similarly incorrect in arguing that, because forfeiture is punitive and criminal, a sanction relating to forfeiture must be punitive and criminal. Evans's Suppl. Mem. 7-8. Forfeiture is not always punitive and criminal; forfeiture can be civil.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20981\">\n      18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 981\n     </extracted-citation>\n     - 82.
