COLLYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a case that has become unduly complicated. It began when the Fort Sill Apache Indian Tribe (the Tribe), a federally recognized Indian Tribe, sued the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) and Jonodev Chaudhuri, in his official capacity as Acting Chairman of the NIGC, regarding the status of the Tribe's land in Akela Flats, New Mexico. The underlying issue is the Tribe's desire to operate a casino and the 2015 Decision and Order of NIGC that the Tribe is not eligible to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After some initial skirmishing, the parties asked to stay the case while they tried to reach a settlement. Months passed without apparent progress and the Court set a status conference to determine whether settlement was possible or if the litigation should proceed. At that status conference on August 15, 2016, the parties explained a\n   structure upon which they had agreed, that might possibly, or possibly not, resolve the lands dispute. To that end, the parties proposed an order the Court might enter to ensure a more timely effectuation of the settlement structure. The parties before the Court agreed that the Department of Interior would submit a letter to NIGC outlining its opinion on the status of the lands at Akela Flats, and NIGC would subsequently decide to reconsider, or not, its decision that the Tribe was ineligible to conduct gaming in New Mexico. The outcome of that proposal and this Court's Order was a letter issued by NIGC in January 2017 (2017 Decision), signed by three Commissioners, in which NIGC stated it would not reconsider and affirmed its 2015 Decision and Order (2015 Decision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties returned to this litigation and the Tribe filed a Second Amended Complaint that complains of both the 2017 Decision and 2015 Decision, and added Defendants Department of the Interior (Interior) and other associated individuals (collectively, Defendants). Pending before the Court are Defendants' Motions for Reconsideration and Partial Dismissal of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint. Defendants insist that the 2017 Decision was not, and could not be considered, final agency action subject to challenge before a court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties are well aware of the facts of the case; however, because the parties' motions concern legal issues not previously considered by the Court, it recites the facts in detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Fort Sill Apache Indian Tribe is a federally recognized Indian tribe. Second Am. Compl. (SAC) [Dkt. 80] \u00b6 23. Originating in what is now New Mexico, the predecessors of the Fort Sill Apache were forcibly relocated in the 19th century to Florida, Alabama, and then Oklahoma by the United States Army following the conclusion of the war against the Apache leader Geronimo and his people.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45 (\"In 1886, after tribal leader Geronimo and his last warriors surrendered, the United States imprisoned the entire Chiricahua and Warm Springs Apache population (including women, children, and non-combatants) and forcibly expatriated them .... Conditions in the prison camps were brutal: four years after Geronimo's surrender, a quarter of the [Apache] were dead.\"). After 27 years of incarceration at Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma, the Apache prisoners of war were given the choice in the early 20th century to become members of the separate Mescalero Apache Tribe in New Mexico or to be released to live without tribal affiliation in Oklahoma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. Those Apache who chose to remain in Oklahoma were resettled onto the existing Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Reservation (KCA Reservation).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These Oklahoma Apache and their descendants now comprise the Fort Sill Apache Indian Tribe. In the 1970s, the Fort Sill Apache Indian Tribe successfully undertook the then-existing Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) process to become federally recognized and eligible for BIA-administered programs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the late 1990s, the Tribe sought to open a gaming facility on land within the boundaries of the KCA Reservation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-58. The Comanche Nation, a separate tribal entity which also held lands on the KCA Reservation, opposed that plan and sued the United States to stop it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-61;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Comanche Nation, Okla. v.

SAC \u00b6 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The United States, the Comanche Nation, and the Fort Sill Apache Indian Tribe ultimately negotiated a three-way settlement\n   agreement effective as of March 8, 2007 (Comanche Nation Settlement Agreement).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-63. Pursuant to the Comanche Nation Settlement Agreement, the Fort Sill Apache Indian Tribe agreed to relinquish its lands on the KCA Reservation and move to a thirty-acre location in Akela Flats, New Mexico, an area within the Tribe's ancestral homeland.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. For its part, the government agreed to \"withdraw its March 29, 1996 memorandum opinion allowing the Tribe to acquire a land base on the former KCA Reservation in Oklahoma and to enter into certain agreements that would assist the Tribe in establishing\n   <em>\n    equivalent rights\n   </em>\n   in New Mexico.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In Section 7 of the Comanche Nation Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed to several statements, including that the Fort Sill Apache Indian Tribe is the successor-in-interest to the Chiricahua and Warm Springs Apache Tribes with aboriginal lands in Arizona and New Mexico; that the Tribe is a federally recognized Indian tribe; and that the government agreed to process timely an application for a reservation proclamation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-70.

The First Amended Complaint,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , dropped the claim of unreasonable agency delay and reasserted the claim that NIGC had acted arbitrarily and capriciously.

The Tribe also added a separate legal claim that the United States had breached the Comanche Nation Settlement Agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 8-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Soon after the Tribe amended its Complaint, the parties entered into an extended period of settlement discussions, which lasted well over a year.

SAC. \u00b6 13. On October 14, 2015, the Court entered a minute order granting the parties' joint motion to stay litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The stay was extended several times at the request of the parties. The Court held a status conference ten months later, on August 15, 2016, to obtain an explanation. At that conference, the parties proposed that the Court enter an Order to memorialize the agreement described above, with language supplied\n   <em>\n    by the parties\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The next day, the parties submitted a Joint Proposed Order which read in material part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [T]he Department of the Interior (\"Interior\") shall issue a letter providing Interior's position regarding the Fort Sill Apache Tribe's gaming eligibility under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and certain other matters addressed in the National Indian Gaming Commission's (\"NIGC\") Decision and Order dated May 5, 2015, and ... the NIGC shall reconsider its Decision and Order dated May 5, 2015, in consideration of the letter to be provided by Interior, and shall issue a Decision and Order incorporating such reconsideration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Joint Proposed Order [Dkt. 50] at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court entered an Order substantively\n   similar to that Proposed Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order [Dkt. 51]. While this Order underwent some revisions throughout the fall of 2016, the above-quoted language remained materially unchanged. The final iteration of the Order, which again substantively incorporated language jointly requested by the parties, was entered on October 21, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Order Granting Mot. to Amend [Dkt. 60].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Defendants certified on December 9, 2016 that Interior had furnished NIGC with a letter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice [Dkt. 63]. On January 12, 2017, NIGC issued the 2017 Decision stating, in material part, that the letter from the Department of the Interior did not provide grounds for reconsideration of the 2015 Decision. The nature of the 2017 Decision constitutes the basis for much of the immediate litigation. When the Tribe challenged the 2017 Decision as inadequate under the terms of the Court's Order and the parties' agreement, the government opposed, and the Court ruled that, based on Defendants' representations, they had met the terms of the agreement and were therefore in compliance with the Court's Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2/17/2017 Mem.

After hearing oral argument, the Court granted the Tribe's Motion to Amend by minute order dated July 7, 2017. The Defendants have now filed a combined Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint and Motion to Reconsider the Court's July 7, 2017 Minute Order [Dkt. 84] (Defs.' MTD).

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint alleges four separate Counts: Count 1 alleges that the 2015 Decision was arbitrary and capricious; Count 2 alleges that NIGC acted arbitrarily and capriciously in forcing the Tribe to close its Akela Flats gaming facility; Count 3 alleges that the Defendants breached the Comanche Nation Settlement Agreement; and Count 4 alleges that the 2017 Decision was arbitrary and capricious. The Defendants move to dismiss Counts 2, 3, and 4. Specifically, they move to dismiss Count 2 for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; Count 3 for lack of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) ; and Count 4 for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Count 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Tribe's Count 2 alleges that NIGC's actions to force closure of the Akela Flats casino were arbitrary and capricious. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 147-51. Upon issuing NOV 09-35, the Acting Chair of NIGC informed the Tribe that there was \"no way for the Tribe to cure\" the alleged violations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148. When the Tribe administratively appealed NOV 09-35, the Commission issued the 2015 Decision, sustaining the violations. The Court has previously ruled that issuance of NOV 09-35 did not constitute final agency action subject to review, despite the Tribe's subsequent closure of the Akela Flats casino.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5/12/2015 Mem. Op. Count 1 of the Complaint, which Defendants do not move to dismiss, alleges that the 2015 Decision was arbitrary and capricious and otherwise in violation of the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The question as to Count 2 is whether it makes out a separate claim regarding the closure of the Akela Flats casino that can be attributed to NIGC. It does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As the Tribe admits, the Tribe closed the Akela Flats facility on its own due to the threat of potential fines that could accrue during the appeal of the 2015 Decision. NIGC issued no other formal notices or orders to the Tribe, such as a closure order, which it had the legal authority to do. To the extent NIGC's actions are amenable to review, such review must be based on final agency action-the 2015 Decision-but not the preliminary NOV. Therefore, any cognizable harms claimed in Count 2 are already pled in Count 1. Count 2 will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

While it did not issue a formal ruling on the question, the Court indicated in open court that it understood the 2017 Decision to constitute final agency action and subsequently granted the Tribe's motion to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 7, 2017 Minute Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Most of Defendants' arguments demeaning the 2017 Decision can be resolved by answering two related questions: (1) can federal agencies voluntarily reopen regulatory proceedings, and, upon doing so, create new reviewable final agency actions; and (2) does the Tribe adequately allege that did NIGC did so here?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As to the first question, precedent in the D.C. Circuit unequivocally holds that agencies are empowered to reopen administrative processes and that such activity is judicially reviewable. \"If for any reason [an] agency reopens a matter and, after reconsideration, issues a new and final order, that order is reviewable on its merits, even though the agency merely reaffirms its original decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Sendra Corp. v.

Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As to the second question, the Tribe has adequately pled that the 2017 Decision was final agency action. The 2017 Decision was the culmination of a process jointly agreed upon by the parties on a timeline ordered by the Court, in which NIGC would \"reconsider its prior Decision and Order dated May 5, 2015, in consideration of the letter to be provided by Interior, and shall issue a Decision and Order incorporating such reconsideration.\" Order Granting Mot. to Amend. In light of the clarity of Circuit precedent and the parties' stated intentions, the Defendants' arguments lose all force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, the plain language quoted above from this Court's Order states that the final product of the process discussed for a year was to be a \"Decision and Order\" with the same import as the 2015 Decision. That language was jointly proposed by the parties and entered as an Order to facilitate the resolution of this dispute, at the parties' own behest. Defendants offer no alternative reading of this language or any other explanation of its intention or of the Court's orders to the same effect, entered at the joint requests of the litigating parties. To the contrary, NIGC asserted vigorously that its 2017 Decision, in the form of a letter, fulfilled the terms of the parties' agreement; the Court took those assertions at face value and assumed good faith; and the Court then concluded that the NIGC letter should be deemed the anticipated 2017 Decision and Order required by the parties' agreement and the Court's orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2/17/2017 Mem. Op. Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Sendra Corp. v. Magaw\n   </em>\n   , when \"after reconsideration, [an agency] issues a new and final order, that order is reviewable on its merits, even though the agency merely reaffirms its original decision.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11910693,3704790\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/162/\">\n    111 F.3d at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In seeking to avoid this conclusion, the Defendants misread the procedural history of this prolonged litigation. Both parties thought settlement talks might be fruitful and jointly sought a stay. When no progress appeared to be forthcoming, the Court held a status conference at which both parties described the process upon which they had already agreed,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , an opinion from Interior on the status of Akela Flats and possible reconsideration by NIGC, but also explained that it was stymied within the bureaucracy. Both parties then agreed that a Court-ordered schedule would help to accomplish this reconsideration. In furtherance of this idea, the parties submitted a proposed order to the Court which, as amended from time to time in non-substantive ways, set out a timetable. The entire purpose of the exercise was to present new and official information from Interior to NIGC upon which NIGC might reconsider the 2015 Decision. Such voluntary reconsideration by the agency certainly implies no ruling by the Court that NIGC's original decision was arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accord with the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Defendants further insist that the 2017 Decision cannot be final agency action because it does not comply with the parameters for final agency action set out by IGRA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 14. Whatever the merits of the argument in general, it is inapposite here, because this final agency action was issued pursuant to the parties' agreement to seek administrative reconsideration rather than continuing the litigation. The parties spent the better part of a year negotiating over how to resolve this case. The result of those negotiations was\n   the adoption of a process that allowed Interior to state its views to NIGC and NIGC to consider that opinion and issue a \"decision and order.\" By mutual agreement and by Court order, that is what happened and final agency action resulted. There can be no doubt that NIGC intends to speak no further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For similar reasons, the Defendants' argument that the 2017 Decision cannot constitute final agency action because NIGC did not abide by the appropriate procedures specified in the Federal Register fails. At best, an agency's failure to follow its own procedures is grounds for considering a decision arbitrary and capricious, not grounds for precluding judicial review. If an agency could avoid judicial review simply by ignoring its own procedures and then pointing to its own failures, there would be little left to judicial review. Having found that the Tribe has adequately pled that the 2017 Decision constitutes final agency action subject to review, the Court will refrain from addressing whether it violated particular procedures or agreements and may be invalid. Such matters are best addressed with a full administrative record and briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court will grant the Motion to Reconsider the Court's July 7, 2017 Minute Order and upon reconsideration will deny the Motion to Dismiss Count 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Motion to Compel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Tribe moves to compel the Defendants to produce the administrative record for the 2017 Decision. In July 2017, the Defendants represented that they were determining which documents comprise that administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 7/31/2017 Status Report [Dkt. 85] at 2. There has been more than ample time to do so over the last ten months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Having reaffirmed on reconsideration that the 2017 Decision constitutes final agency action subject to challenge in court, the Court will order the Defendants to produce the administrative record for the 2017 Decision, including any privilege log, within fourteen days of the date of this order. The Tribe's motion to compel will be denied as premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court will grant in part and deny in part the Motion to Dismiss [Dkt 84] and will grant the Motion for Reconsideration [Dkt. 84]. The Court will dismiss Count 2 for failure to state a claim, and Count 3 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. After reconsideration, the Court will deny the Motion to Dismiss Count 4. The Court will deny the Tribe's Motion to Compel Production [Dkt. 93] as premature. The Defendants will be ordered to file the administrative record for the 2017 Decision, with a privilege log if any, within fourteen (14) days of the date of this order. The parties will also be ordered to meet and confer and, no later than 14 days after the filing of the administrative record, submit a proposed schedule for further proceedings.

The Court therefore construes the Defendants to be moving to dismiss Count 3 for lack of jurisdiction and not Count 2.
