(Dkt. 1). Specifically, Plaintiff claims that Defendant conducted materially defective identification procedures concerning two of the three eyewitnesses to the murder of Joseph Northrup (\"Northrup\") and then failed to disclose those defects, which resulted in Plaintiff's criminal prosecution and wrongful conviction at trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. 22). Because there are issues of material fact for a jury to resolve, Defendant's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the evening of April 29, 2009, sometime after 8:00 P.M., Northrup and his girlfriend, Suzanne Grover (\"Grover\"), engaged in a verbal altercation at their residence\n   before Northrup fled the house and ran through the nearby housing projects. (Dkt. 22-15 at 92-95).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Grover pursued him on foot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94-95). Northrup ran through a \"big group of people\" standing in the back of the housing projects, and then engaged in a conversation with another individual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96, 98). Grover disengaged her pursuit and left the housing projects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98). She then entered a green Jeep driven by her sister, Amanda Basile (\"Basile\"); Basile's friend, Christina Picone (\"Picone\"), and Grover's three-year-old son rode as passengers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98-99). Basile and Picone had followed Grover after she and Northrup fled from the residence. (Dkt. 22-18 at 13-14).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Basile, Picone, and Grover drove away, they soon spotted Northrup again, at which time Grover left the Jeep and once again gave chase into an empty lot. (Dkt. 22-15 at 99-100). Basile and Picone parked the Jeep in a nearby parking lot. (Dkt. 22-18 at 17-18). Suddenly, a male individual (the \"shooter\") ran up to the driver's side door, and asked Basile if everything was all right and whether he should \"go over there and shoot [Northrup].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18). Basile and Picone both observed that the shooter was carrying a gun in his hands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22-17 at 17).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Basile was confused by the shooter's question, and before she could fully react, the shooter began to run towards Grover and Northrup. (Dkt. 22-18 at 21). Basile believed that she heard other people \"in the background screaming\" the name \"Jerome.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As Grover and Northrup reengaged in their verbal dispute, the shooter appeared from behind Grover carrying a gun. (Dkt. 22-15 at 102-03). The shooter declared that he had been told that Northrup was bothering the girls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106-07). Northrup approached the shooter and stated that \"he's not the only one with guns.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106-08). The shooter then fired his gun several times at Northrup, who fell to the ground. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108). Northrup later succumbed to his wounds and died. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the City of Buffalo Police Department secured the scene, the three eyewitnesses were taken to police headquarters. Each witness was interviewed and performed a photo array identification. Defendant conducted a photo array identification with Basile and Grover, while Picone underwent the photo array procedures at the direction of another police officer. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22-3). Each eyewitness identified Plaintiff as the shooter. (Dkt. 22-7; Dkt. 22-8; Dkt. 22-11). Plaintiff lived near the crime scene (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22-23), and a search warrant executed at Plaintiff's residence produced a black hoodie with print on the front that was similar to the general descriptions provided by the eyewitnesses (Dkt. 22-13; see Dkt. 22-4 at 2; Dkt. 22-5 at 1; Dkt. 22-9 at 1). Plaintiff's trial resulted in his conviction for Northrup's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Subsequently, new evidence was discovered that suggested that the eyewitness testimony, which was the primary evidence supporting the prosecution's case, was unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Specifically, Basile provided an affidavit averring that Defendant threatened to arrest her if she did not identify someone in the photo array as the shooter. (Dkt. 22-21 at 12). Basile, who was 16 years old at the time (Dkt. 25-1 at 3), also averred that after she had identified Plaintiff as the shooter, Defendant told her that Grover had identified the same person (Dkt. 22-21 at 12). Although Basile had been unsure as to whether she correctly identified the shooter, learning that Grover selected the same individual \"convinced\" her that she had done so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Grover also submitted a statement to the police indicating that Defendant told her that another eyewitness had already identified one of the six individuals presented in the photo array before she identified Plaintiff as the shooter. (Dkt. 25-2 at 2). Although there is no suggestion that Picone's photo array was conducted improperly, she submitted an affidavit indicating that she only observed the shooter from the side and from the back, and that she was uncertain that her identification of Plaintiff was accurate. (Dkt. 22-21 at 14-15). Instead, she explained that she believed the shooter was of Puerto Rican descent, and that she picked the individual who most closely resembled a Puerto Rican individual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). Plaintiff's motion to vacate his conviction was granted on the consent of the District Attorney's Office. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 22-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff brings this civil rights action against Defendant for malicious prosecution and for the violation of his right to a fair trial as a result of Defendant's alleged fabrication and concealment of falsified evidence. (Dkt. 1). Defendant moves for summary judgment, primarily arguing that Plaintiff has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to the elements of each cause of action, and, in any event, that he is entitled to qualified immunity, and that Plaintiff's lawsuit is barred by the doctrines of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and collateral estoppel. (Dkt. 22-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Motion For Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Basile avers that Defendant threatened to arrest her if she did not identify someone in the photo array as the shooter. (Dkt. 22-21 at 12; see Dkt. 25-1 at 3 (stating that she was \"scared to death\" at the time Defendant was interviewing her, and that Defendant was \"yelling at [her] and stuff\") ). After eventually selecting Plaintiff's photo in the array, Defendant left the room. (Dkt. 22-21 at 12; Dkt. 25-1 at 3). After he spoke with Grover, Defendant returned to Basile's room where he informed her that Grover also had identified Plaintiff as the shooter. (Dkt. 22-21 at 12; Dkt. 25-1 at 3). Although Basile had been unsure whether she correctly identified Plaintiff as the shooter-and even averred that she \"didn't believe that [he] was the same man [she] saw earlier\"-she became \"convinced\" she had made the right choice after hearing that Grover had named the same individual. (Dkt. 22-21 at 12; see Dkt. 25-1 at 3). In addition, during Grover's photo array procedure-and after Grover had already informed Defendant that none of the pictures appeared to depict the shooter-Defendant told her to \" '[l]ook again because someone else already identified a person on one of the pages as the person that killed [Northrup].' \" (Dkt. 25-2 at 2). These facts, if credited, paint a strong picture of bad faith conduct. Since the overall case against Plaintiff was primarily based upon the identification evidence provided by these three eyewitnesses (see Dkt. 22-22 at 1 (averring that \"[t]he principal evidence at trial consisted of testimony from three eyewitnesses who had each identified [Plaintiff] from a photo array\") ), there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the indictment was procured by police misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendant also argues that probable cause to prosecute Plaintiff existed separate and apart from the rebuttable presumption created by the grand jury indictment.
