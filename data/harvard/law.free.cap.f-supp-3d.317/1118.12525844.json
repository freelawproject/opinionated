Plaintiffs allege that the State Department violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"), and the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\") when it published its Record of Decision (\"ROD\") and National Interest Determination (\"NID\") and issued the accompanying Presidential Permit to allow defendant-intervenor TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, LP (\"TransCanada\") to construct a cross-border oil pipeline known as Keystone XL (\"Keystone\"). Plaintiffs have moved for summary judgment. (Docs. 139 &amp; 145.) Federal Defendants and TransCanada have filed cross motions for summary judgment. (Docs. 172 &amp; 170.) The Court held a hearing on these motions on May 24, 2018. (Doc. 194.) The Court is prepared to rule on a portion of Plaintiffs's motion for summary judgment. The Court will rule on the remaining issues in a forthcoming Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court detailed the background of this case in its Order regarding Federal Defendant's and TransCanada's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction. (Doc. 99.) The Court will only recite those facts that have arisen since its Order regarding jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Nebraska Public Service Commission (\"PSC\") denied TransCanada's application for its preferred route on November 20, 2017. (Doc. 104-1.) The Nebraska PSC instead approved the \"Mainline Alternative\" route.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Mainline Alternative route goes through five different counties and crosses several different water bodies than the original preferred route.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Mainline Alternative route also would be longer. This added length requires an additional\n   pump station and accompanying power line infrastructure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the Nebraska PSC announced its decision, Plaintiffs notified Federal Defendants that they needed to reinitiate ESA Section 7(a)(2) consultation on the Mainline Alternative route to assess the potential effects of the new route on endangered and threatened species. (Doc. 141-1.) Plaintiffs also requested that Federal Defendants prepare a supplemental EIS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Federal Defendants have taken steps to reinitiate ESA Section 7(a)(2) consultation with the appropriate agencies, including FWS.

In fact, TransCanada included the Mainline Alternative route as one of two alternatives in its February 16, 2017, application to the Nebraska PSC. (Doc. 104-1 at 12, 58-59.) The State Department knew, therefore, before it issued the Presidential Permit on March 23, 2017, that the Nebraska PSC potentially could approve the Mainline Alternative route. This contingency likely imposed an obligation on the Federal Defendants to supplement the EIS to reflect the Mainline Alternative route.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Regardless of this contingency, Federal Defendants now possess the obligation to supplement the EIS. The State Department retains discretion to review any changes to the project that might arise after the issuance of the Presidential Permit. Federal Defendants argument that the Presidential Permit applies only to the segment of the pipeline at the border proves unpersuasive as the Presidential Permit states that that Keystone \"must be constructed and operated as described in the 2012 and 2017 permit applications, the 2014 EIS ...\" Notice of Issuance of a Presidential Permit,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016467\">\n    82 Fed.

The Court viewed the State Department's preparation of the NEPA analysis associated with Keystone as recognition of its legal obligations. (Doc. 99 at 14.)

The Forest Service issued a special use permit to the Montana Department of Livestock to operate a bison capture facility.

The Ninth Circuit determined that the Forest Service possessed no ongoing oversight or involvement of the special use permit after its issuance.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376011\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/884/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9376011\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/884/\">\n     at 894\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Federal Defendants still retain a meaningful opportunity to evaluate the Mainline Alternative route. The Mainline Alternative route differs from the route analyzed in the EIS. The Mainline Alternative route crosses five different counties. The Mainline Alternative route crosses different water bodies. The Mainline Alternative route would be longer. The Mainline Alternative route would require an additional pump station and accompanying power line infrastructure. Federal Defendants cannot escape their responsibility under NEPA to evaluate the Mainline Alternative route. Federal Defendants first argued that it was too early to evaluate the Mainline Alternative route before the approval of the Presidential Permit. They now argue that it remains too late to evaluate the Mainline Alternative route. NEPA requires a hard look.\n    <em>\n     Marsh\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605417\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/360/#p367\">\n     490 U.S. at 367-72\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605417\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/360/#p367\">\n     109 S.Ct. 1851\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The Court further agrees that Federal Defendants must address the Mainline Alternative route as it proves to be a \"connected action\" to the proposed action. Similar to\n    <em>\n     Thomas\n    </em>\n    , the Mainline Alternative route represents an interdependent part of the larger action of Keystone.\n    <em>\n     Thomas,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"292446\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/753/754/#p759\">\n     753 F.2d at 759\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The entire pipeline remains interrelated and requires one EIS to understand the functioning of the entire unit.

Federal Defendants possess the obligation to analyze new information relevant to the environmental impacts of its decision.

Cal. 2006). In\n    <em>\n     Bosworth\n    </em>\n    , the court required a post-decision supplemental EIS for a timber harvesting project where the project had not been completed.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768458\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/465/931/#p939\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Federal Defendants' failure to supplement the 2014 EIS likewise violates its obligations under NEPA.\n    <em>\n     Thomas,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"292446\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/753/754/#p759\">\n     753 F.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    759 ;\n    <em>\n     Bosworth\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768458\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/465/931/#p939\">\n     465 F.Supp.2d at 939\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Plaintiffs further argue that Federal Defendants possessed the obligation to analyze Keystone under the ESA. (Doc. 140 at 17.) The ESA requires agencies to analyze the site-specific impacts of proposed actions. Under Section 7 of the ESA, all federal \"action agencies\" must, \"in consultation with\" the Fish Wildlife and Service, \"insure\" that the actions that they fund, authorize, or undertake are \"not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species\" or \"result in the destruction or adverse modification\" of critical habitat.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201536\">\n     16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2). The ESA requires agencies to evaluate which species or critical habitats are present in the \"action area,\" which includes \"all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the Federal action.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20402.02\">\n     50 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 402.02\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 402.12(a). The Court will address the ESA argument in a future Order.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    1. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Federal Defendants must supplement the 2014 final supplemental EIS to consider the Mainline Alternative route as approved by the Nebraska PSC.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n    2. The Court declines to vacate the Presidential Permit at this time. TransCanada has represented to the\n    Court that construction of the pipeline will not begin until the second quarter of 2019. The Court directs Federal Defendants to file a proposed schedule to supplement the EIS in a manner that allows appropriate review before TransCanada's planned construction activities.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n    3. The Court will consider further remedies if circumstances change that do not allow review of the supplemental EIS before TransCanada's planned construction activities.\n   </blockquote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
