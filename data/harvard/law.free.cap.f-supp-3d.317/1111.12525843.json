On December 25, 1996, at the age of thirteen, Plaintiff's grandmother brought him to the United States. He entered the United States at the Los Angeles International Airport with a false Philippines passport and a fraudulent United States visa. Plaintiff has never left the United States since his initial entry, and in October 2014, he married Cindy Ramat, a U.S. citizen. On October 26, 2015, Cindy Ramat filed a Form I-130 visa petition, which was approved on April 28, 2017.</p>\n\n<attorneys id=\"p-12\">On January 11, 2017, the USCIS asked Plaintiff for evidence regarding his entry into the United States. Plaintiff alleges he then contacted the grandmother who brought him to the United States, who told him the Philippines passport and United States visa Plaintiff entered with were \"false\" and provided by a \"rogue Consulate/employee in the Philippines.\" (FAC \u00b6 8.) His grandmother provided a declaration attesting to these facts, which Plaintiff submitted to the USCIS along with his own declaration asserting his lack of knowledge of the falsity of his entry documents.</attorneys>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p-20\"><strong>A.

Because the Court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the action, Defendants' motion to dismiss is <strong>GRANTED</strong> , and Plaintiff's motions are <strong>DENIED as moot</strong> .</p><p id=\"p-9\"><strong>BACKGROUND &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY</strong><footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-11\">Also on October 26, 2015, Plaintiff filed a Form I-485 application for adjustment of status with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (\"USCIS\") under <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255</extracted-citation>(a). On September 19, 2016, Plaintiff appeared for an interview with USCIS where he testified about his entrance to the United States. Regarding the passport and visa he presented, Plaintiff testified that his family had told him they had been lost.</p><p id=\"p-13\">On May 9, 2017, the USCIS denied Plaintiff's application for adjustment of status on the grounds that Plaintiff lacked sufficient evidence to establish that he had been inspected and admitted into the United States. Plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider the denial of his application, which was denied on November 1, 2017. Subsequently, on December 8, 2017, Plaintiff filed his initial complaint seeking judicial <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1114\" href=\"#p1114\" id=\"p1114\">*1114</a>review of the USCIS's denial of his application for adjustment of status under the Administrative Procedures Act. (Docket No. 1.)</p><p id=\"p-14\">On February 12, 2018, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that the USCIS has initiated removal proceedings against Plaintiff on February 8, 2018. (Docket No. 4.) In lieu of filing an opposition to Defendants' motion, Plaintiff exercised his right to amend his pleading and filed the operative FAC. (Docket No. 5.) Defendants responded by moving again to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the same grounds.

To support their argument, Defendants submitted the 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\") that was filed with the Immigration Court on February 8, 2018. (<em>See</em> Docket No. 4-2.) In opposition, Plaintiff argues this Court retains subject matter jurisdiction because: (1) Defendants failed to properly place him in removal proceedings when they failed to properly serve him with the February 8, 2018 NTA; (2) even if Defendants cured this deficiency with the filing of the superseding March 7, 2018 NTA, the \"spirit of <em>Cabaccang</em> \" requires the Court retain jurisdiction over his claim.

In <em>Pereira</em> , the Supreme Court held that \"[a] putative notice to appear that fails to designate the specific time or place of the noncitizen's removal proceedings is not a 'notice to appear under section 1229(a),' and so does not trigger the stop-time rule.\"<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> , at 2108. Relying on <em>Pereira</em> , Plaintiff filed the pending motions for temporary restraining order and for leave to file a supplemental memorandum to, <em>inter alia</em> , advise the Court that Defendants' NTAs were additionally defective for failing to specify the time and place of the removal proceedings, and therefore \"the Immigration Court does not have jurisdiction over [him].\" (Docket No. 13-2 at p. 15.)

Plaintiff's argument that the Immigration Court lacks jurisdiction over him is not persuasive because the Court's primary concern is the existence of its <em>own</em> subject matter jurisdiction (or lack thereof). <em>Pereira</em> teaches simply that the service of a notice to appear that fails to specify the time or place of the removal proceedings does not trigger the \"stop-time rule\" for determining the end of a noncitizen's period of \"continuous residence\" or \"physical presence.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> , at 2108 n.5 (\"The Court leaves for another day whether a putative notice to appear that omits any of the other categories of information enumerated in \u00a7 1229(a)(1) triggers the stop-time rule.\").</p><p id=\"p-31\">Invoking \"the spirit of <em>Cabaccang</em> \" is equally unhelpful to Plaintiff. Plaintiff argues that \"[j]ust as the <em>Cabaccang</em> court reasoned [the plaintiffs] should not able to circumvent removal by running to federal court and filing APA claims, Plaintiff argues Defendants should not be able to circumvent a valid question of law by running to place Plaintiff in removal proceedings.\" (Opp'n at pp. 3-4.) But the <em>Cabaccang</em> court addressed this exact scenario, holding that \"[r]egardless of whether the [plaintiffs'] removal proceedings began before this action, the pendency of removal proceedings now means their claims are not ripe for judicial review.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052400\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/1313/\">627 F.3d at 1317</extracted-citation> (citation omitted). The <em>Cabaccang</em> court further explained that \"although jurisdiction is usually determined from the filing of the relevant complaint, after-arising events can defeat jurisdiction by negating the ripeness of a claim.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052400\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/1313/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> (citing <em>Hose v.

Therefore, Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is <strong>GRANTED</strong> , and Plaintiff's <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1118\" href=\"#p1118\" id=\"p1118\">*1118</a>First Amended Complaint is <strong>DISMISSED</strong> .</p><p id=\"p-37\">Also pending is Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's initial complaint, which was filed on February 12, 2018. (Docket No. 4.) However, on March 5, 2018, Plaintiff timely filed his First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), which rendered this motion moot. <em>See</em> Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1). Therefore, the motion to dismiss the initial complaint is denied as moot.</p><p id=\"p-38\">The following overview of the facts is drawn from the allegations of Plaintiff's FAC.
