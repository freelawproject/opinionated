On December 25, 1996, at the age of thirteen, Plaintiff's grandmother brought him to the United States. He entered the United States at the Los Angeles International Airport with a false Philippines passport and a fraudulent United States visa. Plaintiff has never left the United States since his initial entry, and in October 2014, he married Cindy Ramat, a U.S. citizen. On October 26, 2015, Cindy Ramat filed a Form I-130 visa petition, which was approved on April 28, 2017.\n   </opinion>\n   <opinion id=\"p-12\">\n    On January 11, 2017, the USCIS asked Plaintiff for evidence regarding his entry into the United States. Plaintiff alleges he then contacted the grandmother who brought him to the United States, who told him the Philippines passport and United States visa Plaintiff entered with were \"false\" and provided by a \"rogue Consulate/employee in the Philippines.\" (FAC \u00b6 8.) His grandmother provided a declaration attesting to these facts, which Plaintiff submitted to the USCIS along with his own declaration asserting his lack of knowledge of the falsity of his entry documents.\n   </opinion>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    <strong>\n     A.
