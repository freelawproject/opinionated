In sum, Plaintiffs are individuals who were arrested on felony crimes and whose DNA samples were taken at the station house. FAC (dkt. 56) \u00b6\u00b6 13-25. No charges were filed against Plaintiffs Haskell, Ento, or Desai after their arrests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17, 22. Plaintiffs brought suit in October 2009, alleging that California Penal Code section 296(a)(2)(C), which provides for the mandatory DNA sampling of felony arrestees in California, is an illegal search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment, a violation of their rights to substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and a violation of their rights to procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. (dkt. 1). Plaintiffs amended their complaint in December 2009,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   FAC, and the Court denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction that same month,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order Denying Motion for Preliminary Injunction.

The Maryland law authorizes the collection of DNA from individuals \"charged with ...a crime of violence or an attempt to commit a crime of violence; or...burglary or an attempt to commit burglary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1967. It prohibits law enforcement from processing the DNA sample or placing it into a database without consent until the arrestee is arraigned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And it provides that the sample is to be immediately destroyed if all qualifying charges are later found to be without probable cause, if a criminal action against the individual does not result in conviction, if the conviction is reversed or vacated and no new trial permitted, or if the individual is pardoned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court, rather than limit its discussion to the Maryland law, noted that twenty-eight states \"have adopted laws similar to the Maryland Act\" and explained that \"[a]lthough those statutes vary in their particulars, such as what charges require a DNA sample, their similarity means that this case implicates more than the specific Maryland law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1968.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Supreme Court held that a DNA swab procedure is a search subject to the Fourth Amendment; in analyzing that search, the Court weighed five government interests against the individual arrestees' interest in privacy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1970-79. The Court focused primarily on \"the need for law enforcement officers in a safe and accurate way to process and identify the persons and possessions they must take into custody,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1970, explaining that \" '[i]n every criminal case, it is known and must be known who has been arrested and who is being tried.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1971 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hiibel v.

The Court observed that it \"must give great weight both to the significant government interest at stake in the identification of arrestees and to the unmatched potential of DNA identification to serve that interest,\" and held that, balanced against the \"minimal\" \"intrusion of a cheek swab\" and the arrestee's \"necessarily...diminished\" expectations of privacy, the search was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1977-78. The Court\n   therefore concluded: \"When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold for a serious offense and they bring the suspect to the station to be detained in custody, taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee's DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1980 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that this Court did not err in denying a preliminary injunction on behalf of anyone arrested for, or charged with, a felony.\n   <em>\n    Haskell v.

In 2014, they asserted that the DNA Act is unconstitutional, despite\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , both because of differences between the California law and the Maryland law at issue in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , and because the government interests identified in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   do not apply with the same force to individuals arrested but not charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 6-14. In 2018, they have taken a new position, arguing that while it is \"still an open question after\"\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   whether the DNA Act is unconstitutional as to individuals arrested and not charged, \"[e]ven if the Fourth Amendment allows the government to seize a DNA sample from everybody arrested on suspicion of a felony, once the government determines that it will not prosecute a person, or charges are dismissed, the government's interests no longer justify analyzing that sample to obtain a DNA profile.\" Pls. Br. at 1. The Court addresses Plaintiffs' arguments in reverse order: (A) that while taking a DNA sample at booking is permissible, analyzing it is not; (B) that the government interests in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   are not present here; and (C) that there are significant differences between the Maryland and California laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Taking But Not Analyzing DNA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs assert in their briefing, and repeated at the motion hearing, that they are \"propos[ing]\" a \"rule\" that would allow law enforcement to seize samples from all felony arrestees, but that would prevent law enforcement from analyzing those samples until a prosecutor has filed charges. Pls. Br. at 7, 8. The Court rejects this new position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   First, while nothing prevents Plaintiffs from proposing rules, the Court is not in the business of weighing legislative proposals. The DNA Act says what it says. It allows for the taking and analysis of a felony arrestee's DNA at booking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 45-49;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20295\">\n    Cal.

While a different system might be better, or worse, the Court's task is to assess the constitutionality of the DNA Act as written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs' new position is inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiffs are clever to argue that, while it might make sense to take an arrestee's DNA sample at booking, the government cannot justify analyzing that sample once the arrestee is no longer accused of a crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.

This new position, allowing for early DNA collection, eliminates some of Defendants' 2014 arguments-for example, that if law enforcement did not take a DNA sample at booking, \"[i]ndividuals out of custody prior to charging have every incentive to flee knowing that a DNA sample taken later after charging will likely connect them to their unsolved violent crimes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 8;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20295\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20295\">\n    n.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514365\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/230/681/12514365/\">\n    4 Cal. 5th at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514365,12514366,12514367\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/230/681/\">\n    230 Cal.Rptr.3d 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514365,12514366,12514367\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/230/681/\">\n    413 P.3d 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"there are practical reasons for collecting the required DNA sample at the time of booking....if the arrestee is released pending adjudication, officials may not have another opportunity.\").
