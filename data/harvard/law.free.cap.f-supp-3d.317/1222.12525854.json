The Court addressed Consumer Plaintiffs' initial Complaint [Doc. 47] and Defendant's corresponding Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 52] in its Order dated March 5, 2018 [Doc. 102]. In its Order, the Court dismissed without prejudice Consumer Plaintiffs' claim for a violation of the Georgia Fair Business Practice Act (\"GFBPA\") and their alternative claims for \"Violations of State Consumer Laws.\" (Order at 53, 55.) The Court granted Plaintiffs leave to amend their Complaint and replead the GFBPA claim and the claims pertaining to violations of similar state consumer protection laws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Consumer Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint alleging violations of the GFBPA (Count VI), the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"CUTPA\") (Count VII), the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\") (Count VIII), and the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\") (Count IX) [Doc. 107]. Defendant has filed a Motion to Dismiss these claims [Doc. 117]. The Court's rulings are set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

As such, Plaintiffs GFBPA claim was dismissed, with the Court granting Plaintiffs leave to replead on the sole issue of reliance, which Plaintiffs have now done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have still failed to plead actual reliance in their Amended Complaint because they fail to \"identify any statement by Arby's 1) containing a purported misrepresentation or omission regarding Arby's data security 2) that they actually read and relied on.\" (Memo Supp. Mot. Dismiss at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that they have adequately pled reliance in asserting that 1) Arby's had knowledge of the vulnerabilities in its data systems yet misrepresented itself as compliant with data security protection standards; and that 2) consumers \"relied to their detriment\" upon these representations and omissions regarding data security, when they used their credit and debit cards, expecting that Arby's data systems were secure and that the information contained on their cards would be secure. (Consumer's Resp. at 2; Consumer's Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 204-215.) Had Arby's disclosed that its systems were not secure, Consumer Plaintiffs would not have used their cards and may not have made purchases at all at these Arby's locations. (Consumer's Resp. at 3; Consumer's Am. Compl. \u00b6 213.) In both their Original and Amended Complaints, Consumer Plaintiffs alleged the following specific misrepresentations:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   More specifically, ARG violated the following provisions of the GFBPA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   a. Engaging in unfair and deceptive acts and practices in the credit and debit card processing services furnished in connection with the sale of goods at Arby's restaurants ( O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10-1-393(a) );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   b. Misrepresenting that its services and data systems abided by and had sponsorship, approval, or certification by the Payment card Industry Security Standards Council ( O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10-1-393(b)(2) );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   c. Misrepresenting that its services and data systems had an affiliation, connection, or association with, or certification by, the Payment Card Industry\n   Security Standards Council ( O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10-1-393(b)(3) ); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   d. Misrepresenting that its services and data systems had the sponsorship, approval, characteristics, and benefits by complying with the PCI DSS standards ( O.C.G.A. 10-1-393(b)(5) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Consumer's Am. Compl. \u00b6 205.) In their Amended Complaint, Consumer Plaintiffs added six paragraphs involving reliance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   209. Because ARG accepted credit and debit cards as methods of payment its customers, including Plaintiffs and Class members, expected that ARG's POS and data systems were secure and that their customer data would be secure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   210. Because ARG accepted credit and debit cards as methods of payment, Consumer Plaintiffs and Class members relied upon ARG to advise customers if its POS and data systems were not secure and, thus, Customer Data could be compromised.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   211. Consumer Plaintiffs and Class members were not afforded by ARG equal or ample opportunity to make any inspection to determine ARG's data security or to otherwise ascertain the truthfulness of Defendant's representations and omissions regarding data security, including ARG's failure to alert customers that its POS and data systems were not secure and, thus, were vulnerable to attack.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   212. In deciding to use their payment cards for their purchases at ARG-owned and operated restaurants, Consumer Plaintiffs and Class members relied to their detriment upon ARG's representations and omissions regarding data security, including ARG's failure to alert customers that its POS and data systems were not secure and, thus, were vulnerable to attack.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   213. Had ARG disclosed to Consumer Plaintiffs and Class members that its POS and data systems were not secure, and, thus, vulnerable to attack, Consumer Plaintiffs and Class members would not have used their payment cards at ARG-owned and operated restaurants, and very well may not have made purchases at all at these Arby's locations\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   214. As a direct result of their reliance on ARG to be truthful in its disclosures and non-disclosures regarding the vulnerability of its POS and data systems, Consumer Plaintiffs and Class members used their payment cards to make purchases at ARG-owned and operated restaurants during Data Breach period and their Customer Data was compromised causing Plaintiff and Class members to suffer damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Consumer's Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 209-214.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Thus, though Plaintiffs Amended Complaint facially addresses reliance, Arby's argues that because the new reliance allegations still don't identify a specific statement made by Arby's, they are conclusory and fail to state a claim. (Memo Supp. Mot. Dismiss at 3.) In support of this contention, Arby's first cites to cases which consider the GFBPA in contexts wholly unrelated to a data breach. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (citing\n   <em>\n    Samuel v.

Arby's then points to\n   <em>\n    Bishop v. Shorter\n   </em>\n   in arguing that a \"would-not-have-shopped\" theory is insufficient to plead reliance.\n   <em>\n    Bishop v. Shorter Univ., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:15-cv-33-HLM (N.D.Ga. June 4, 2015), ECF No. 22, at 35-36, 49. Besides that\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   does not deal with a GFBPA claim or an online data hack\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the court in\n   <em>\n    Bishop\n   </em>\n   found that defendants\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   warn plaintiffs to be on alert about their financial records, and further found that plaintiffs had failed to properly allege reliance because they had not indicated any actions they took or did not take as a result of the purported misrepresentations involved.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-49. Here, Arby's has not argued that they gave customers any similar warnings and Consumer Plaintiffs, in their Amended Complaint, specifically allege that the use of their payment cards at Arby's restaurants was a result of their reliance on Arby's misrepresentations and omissions. (Consumer's Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 212-215.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant next argues that \"[d]ata breach cases in other jurisdictions have reached the same result under other states' consumer protection statutes.\" (Memo Supp. Mot. Dismiss at 3 fn. 2.) But these cases are also unpersuasive. First,\n   <em>\n    In re Michaels Stores Pin Pad Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4122932\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/830/518/#p526\">\n    830 F.Supp.2d 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526 (N.D. Ill. 2011) is distinguishable. Though plaintiffs in that case failed to plead a \"deceptive\" practice because they could not identify a specific communication from the defendant containing a deceptive omission, plaintiffs did successfully state a claim for \"unfair\" practices under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (ICFA). As under ICFA, a claim under the GFBPA may proceed under an \"unfairness\" theory\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   , as Consumer Plaintiffs have alleged here. (Consumer's Am. Compl. \u00b6 204.) Next, Arby's cites\n   <em>\n    In re Heartland Payment Sys., Inc. Customer Data Sec. Breach Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4134151\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/834/566/\">\n    834 F.Supp.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.

But in that case, the bank-plaintiffs' claim of a violation of the New Jersey consumer protection statute failed because it was unclear\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the banks relied on misrepresentations or what actions they took in relying. As noted above, Consumer Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint alleges that Class members \"relied to their detriment upon ARG's representations and omissions regarding data security,\" and that \"as a direct result of their reliance upon ARG to be truthful in its disclosures and non-disclosures,\" Consumer Plaintiffs used their payment cards at Arby's restaurants, and suffered injury as a direct and proximate result.

The GFBPA is to be liberally construed in order to effectuate the purpose of the statute - protecting consumers.\n   <em>\n    Georgia Receivables Inc. v. Welch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"497148\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/242/146/\">\n    242 Ga.App. 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"497148\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/242/146/\">\n    529 S.E.2d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). In order to ensure that consumers are protected, the GFBPA must be strictly enforced against a business\n   which engages in unfair or deceptive acts or practices that the Act seeks to prohibit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"497148\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/242/146/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In light of the above-cited rulings in similar data breach cases, the statutory language itself, pleading expectations under the specific circumstances, the purpose of the GFBPA, and the amended allegations, the Court finds that Consumer Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged both a violation of the Act and reliance to show causation as required by O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10-1-399.\n   <em>\n    Tiismann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5720722\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/281/137/\">\n    637 S.E.2d at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At this early stage of litigation, Consumer Plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim under the GFBPA\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   . The Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the GFBPA (Count VI) claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. State Consumer Protection Laws in Connecticut, Florida, and Tennessee (Counts VII, VIII, IX)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs asserted claims under the CUTPA, FDUTPA, and TCPA, all in the alternative to their GFBPA claim. (Doc. 107 at 77, 84, 90). Because the Court finds that Consumer Plaintiffs' GFBPA claim will go forward, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   Counts VII, VIII, and IX as redundant and duplicative\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   . As noted in the previous order on this issue, there is no statutory provision in the GFBPA that restricts the private right of action to Georgia citizens. (Order at 46.) Because Consumer Plaintiffs are all represented in the GFBPA claim, the other state consumer protection statutory claims are unnecessary. Further, were the Connecticut, Florida, and Tennessee counts permitted to proceed, it is possible that class members from other states might move to add claims under the consumer protection statutes of their home states, which too would be unnecessary under the circumstances\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
