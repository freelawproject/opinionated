Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Harvey is a former employee of Dougherty's insurance company. After an acrimonious termination from that position, Harvey co-founded Defendant NASB, which competes with Dougherty's firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 10, 2017, Harvey gave a keynote address at a conference hosted by NASB. Roughly three hundred people from the insurance industry were present. During his address, Harvey projected a picture of Dougherty standing between Harvey and another man onto a screen for the audience to view, and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [T]he guy in the middle there he may or may not be HIV positive, I don't know, I have no idea, I have no idea I can't confirm nor deny that, that he is or isn't, I don't know, Chad, I don't know, I don't know ... I have no idea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [110] \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 15, a video of the speech was uploaded to the NASB website. The video was removed from the website the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 10, Dougherty filed this lawsuit against Harvey and NASB, alleging defamation and false light invasion of privacy. Dougherty seeks actual and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In separate motions, Harvey and NASB seek summary judgment on Dougherty's claims. They argue that Harvey's statement cannot constitute defamation per se; that Dougherty fails to allege special damages as required to maintain a defamation claim; and that because the statement is allegedly defamatory, the false light claim fails as well. NASB additionally argues for summary judgment on the basis that it is not liable for the statement Harvey made at the conference. Finally, NASB seeks summary judgment on Dougherty's punitive damages claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

However, the statement in\n   <em>\n    Bellemead\n   </em>\n   required either additional facts or inferences to make plain that something injurious was said. That is the classic form of innuendo in a defamation case: additional explanation or interpretation is needed to turn what appears to be an anodyne statement into a defamatory one.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   In the law of defamation, an innuendo is the plaintiff's explanation of a statement's defamatory meaning when that meaning is not apparent from the statement's face. For example, the innuendo of the statement \"David burned down his house\" can be shown by pleading that the statement was understood to mean that David was defrauding his insurance company ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Innuendo\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bellemead\n   </em>\n   , the allegedly per se defamatory statement, which pertained to the dissolution of a real estate development company, was, \"Jerry isn't going to be selling lots here in Warner Robins much longer.

While the statement was arguably an assertion that Jerry's company was going out of business, the Georgia Supreme Court held that the statement was not injurious on its face. Indeed, the number of potential interpretations of the statement in\n   <em>\n    Bellemead\n   </em>\n   are limited only by the imagination.

But that does not mean that there is\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   evidence that Harvey is NASB's alter ego.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Harvey is a minority shareholder of NASB and co-founded the company with its current president and CEO, Chad Milner. Harvey and Milner split the responsibilities of running the company. Harvey supervises the insurance agents, runs the recruiting events, and acts as the face of the company in most of its publications, while Milner manages the office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   NASB maintains that Harvey is an independent contractor and minority stakeholder in the company and has no role in the day-to-day operations of NASB's office or oversight of the employees. However, this is an overly technical characterization of the evidence. NASB has as many as sixty employees, but there is evidence that most of these employees are leased from another company owned by Milner on an as-needed, per-task basis. And while Harvey may have no role in the day-to-day affairs of the \"office,\" he testifies that he is\n   completely in charge of the hundreds of insurance agents upon whom NASB's business relies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Harvey testifies that he is a partner, an independent contractor, and a W-2 employee of NASB, and is responsible for overseeing NASB's hundreds of insurance agents. He considers himself second-in-command to NASB's president, but as the head of the field side of the company, the other partners do \"[w]hatever [he] tells them to\" do in matters related to the field side of the business.

He has consistently represented the company in videos made available to the public and through numerous live speaking engagements. Harvey's statement was made at an NASB conference where he was the keynote speaker representing NASB in an effort to recruit agents to work for NASB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Taken together, the evidence of Harvey's role within the company presents an issue of fact for the jury as to whether Harvey spoke on behalf of NASB as its alter ego.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   NASB also argues that Harvey was not authorized to make the particular statement disparaging Dougherty and his company. But under\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   , this is not the proper inquiry; an alter ego theory does not require that the company authorize or direct the statement.

NASB's Ratification of Harvey's Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   NASB argues that as a matter of law it cannot be held liable for defamation through ratification of Harvey's statement because Georgia courts do not recognize ratification of slander as a viable theory. Dougherty, on the other hand, argues that NASB can be held liable under a ratification theory despite the fact that no Georgia court has ever so held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As discussed above, a corporation can commit slander under an alter ego theory, but otherwise \"lacks the capacity to commit slander and, absent evidence that the corporation expressly directed the saying of the slanderous words,\" a corporation cannot be held liable for the slander.\n   <em>\n    Church of God, Inc. v.

Thus, even if true, Dougherty's claim that\n   NASB ratified Harvey's statements fails as a matter of law to state a claim for defamation against NASB. However, because liability against NASB may be found if a jury concludes that Harvey acted as NASB's alter ego, summary judgment will be denied on this claim, too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Punitive Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   NASB argues that summary judgment is appropriate on Dougherty's claim for punitive damages under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-5-12, which provides a defense against punitive damages in defamation cases based on the \"visual or sound broadcast of an erroneous statement alleged to be defamatory.\" The statute does not bar claims for defamation published in person to a live audience, as occurred here. Though Dougherty does allege that NASB published the video online, his defamation claim is primarily based upon the speech before an audience, for which there is no statutory shield through retractions. There is sufficient evidence in the record (including additional statements from the address itself) of Harvey's alleged ill-will toward his former employer to create a fact question regarding whether his statement was made with the malice required to support a claim for punitive damages. NASB's potential liability is based upon an alter ego allegation, not solely the republication of the video of Harvey's statement. As such, summary judgment will be denied on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Motion to Open Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On April 25, 2018, Dougherty filed a motion [90] to open discovery into Harvey's financial records for punitive damages. In response, Harvey asked the Court to extend the time for their response to the motion to open discovery until after this Court had ruled on summary judgment. As the Court will deny Defendants' motions for summary judgment on the defamation claim, Harvey and NASB are ordered to respond to the motion to open discovery within fourteen days of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motions [91, 93] for summary judgment are denied. Defendants are ordered to respond to the motion [90] to open discovery within fourteen days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED this 31st day of July, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Thomas Gibbons, Rhetoric; Or, A View of Its Principal Tropes and Figures, in Their Origin and Powers 157-58 (1767) (quoting Cicero, \"Omission, says he, is when we say we pass over, or do not know, or will not mention, that which we declare with the utmost force.
