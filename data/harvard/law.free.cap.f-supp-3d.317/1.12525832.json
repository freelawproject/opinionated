If this court's decision is correct, the court may exercise specific jurisdiction over the claims of thousands of unnamed, nonresident putative class members. On the other hand, if the court is wrong and it lacks specific jurisdiction over such claims, this court could not entertain a nationwide class action and the most Plaintiffs could seek to certify is a District of Columbia class. The difference in scope of these two scenarios need not be belabored. Quite obviously, a nationwide class action would place far greater demands on this court and Defendant than would a case that goes forward with only a geographically limited class.

At the hearing on this matter, Plaintiffs' counsel conceded that, in order to establish a class consisting of current and former WFMG employees, and presumably to determine damages, he might demand more than a decade's worth of payroll records from well over two hundred Whole Foods grocery stores operated by WFMG.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jt.

Plaintiffs could not certify in this district court a class of all WFMG employees, let alone a true nationwide class. At most, Plaintiffs would be able to certify a District of Columbia class, consisting of employees who worked in the District's five Whole Foods stores operated by WFMG. In addition, if a nationwide class action cannot be brought here, the court will not face the potential of grappling with the laws of the 43 states in which Whole Foods does business. The court would rather avoid such a morass if it is in fact wrong about\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb\n   </em>\n   's application in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Accordingly, given the potential of avoiding burdensome discovery costs and conserving judicial resources in the event of a reversal, this court finds that certifying its prior order for interlocutory appeal will \"materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Before concluding, the court notes that litigation will not cease pending resolution of the interlocutory appeal. Section 1292(b) provides \"[t]hat application for an appeal hereunder shall not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the Court of Appeals or a judge thereof shall so order.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). As described further in the Scheduling Order filed herewith, pending resolution of the interlocutory appeal, the court stays all discovery with respect to certification of a nationwide class. The case shall, however, proceed with respect to all Whole Foods stores operated by WFMG in the District of Columbia, Maryland,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and any other store at which a plaintiff in the closely related case of\n   <em>\n    Vasquez v. Whole Foods Market Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 17-cv-00112-APM (D.D.C.), was employed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, the court grants Defendant's Motion to Certify for Interlocutory Appeal, ECF No. 37. A separate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Plaintiffs argue that some of the cases that Defendant cites do not actually support its position or merely address the issue in dicta. Pls.' Mem. at 7; Pls.' Ltr. Br., ECF No. 43, at 1-2. Even if Plaintiffs' reading of these cases is correct, there are still several district court judges who have expressly held that\n    <em>\n     Bristol-Myers Squibb\n    </em>\n    extends to nationwide class actions brought in federal court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Plaintiffs attempt to downplay the division by pointing out (correctly) that most of the district courts that reached a decision different than this court come from one district-the Northern District of Illinois.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Mem. at 7; Pls.' Ltr. Br., ECF No. 43, at 3. However, that fact does not, for the reasons explained below, diminish the strength of the rationale that those courts have advanced in reaching a different conclusion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The court did not dismiss Plaintiffs' claims under Maryland law; therefore, discovery as to those stores will be permitted to go forward. However, if the D.C. Circuit were to disagree with this court on the application of\n    <em>\n     Bristol-Myers Squibb\n    </em>\n    , this court may not have personal jurisdiction over a Maryland sub-class.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
