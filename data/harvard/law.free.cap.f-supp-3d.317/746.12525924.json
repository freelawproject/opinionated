City of New York\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-6885-LTS-HBP,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20892350\">\n    2017 WL 892350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 6, 2017). The following summary of Plaintiffs' allegations is limited to those relevant to the claims asserted in the Proposed SAC. Plaintiffs' non-conclusory factual allegations are taken as true for purposes of this motion practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the NYPD maintains a policy that, in violation of a state law prohibiting quotas for law enforcement activities, directs its employees to perform a mandatory number of arrests or other police actions over a defined period of time as a performance standard, effectively establishing quotas, and that the policy \"has led to a pattern and practice of discrimination against officers of Hispanic and African-American heritage on the basis of color, race and national origin.\" (Proposed SAC \u00b6\u00b6 3, 19.) Plaintiffs allege that \"failure to meet the illegal quota[s] result[ ] in adverse employment consequences, including but not limited to negative evaluations, termination or threat of termination, lost compensation, lost overtime, denial of promotions and upgrades, denial of overtime, loss of vacation days earned, loss of accrued time earned, punitive postings and punitive transfers, suspension, investigations, charges, suspensions, formal and informal discipline, assignments to undesirable and/or particularly dangerous tasks,\n   punitive postings and punitive transfers, all leading and contributing to a hostile working environment and racially disparate treatment of the minority police officers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Plaintiffs, who are Latino and African-American police officers currently or formerly employed by the NYPD, sue on behalf of themselves and of a putative class of \"approximately 6,000\" Black and Latino NYPD officers, \"who will have been and will be affected by the imposition of the illegal quota system,\" pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 213-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs characterize the roles of the Proposed Individual Defendants as follows. In his capacity as mayor, Defendant Mayor de Blasio \"routinely met with the Police Commissioner[,] Deputy Police Commissioners[,] and other high[-]ranking members of the NYPD to set policy and make recommendations relating to the polic[i]es, administration, practices, customs[,] and procedure[s] of the NYPD and relating to the disciplinary system and implementation of penalties within the NYPD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) In his capacity as Commissioner, Bratton was the \"principal administrator\" of the NYPD, \"responsible for the application of the NYPD's enforcement and administrative polic[i]es[,] including its internal investigatory and disciplinary process.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) As Chief of Department, O'Neill was \"the highest ranking non-civilian ... uniformed police officer\" and \"in charge of all NYPD operations answering only to the Police Commissioner and the Mayor.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) Proposed Defendant Inspector McCormack was the commanding officer of the NYPD's 40\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Precinct from September 27, 2011, to May 2014, at which point the Plaintiffs allege \"he was transferred out of the precinct\" following media reports \"that he was recorded pressuring a police officer to target young [B]lack males.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Proposed Defendant Inspector Tsachas was the commanding officer of Transit District 32 from June 2015 to June 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Proposed Defendant Tucker is the First Deputy Police Commissioner of the NYPD, and he allegedly \"set policy, directed personnel, approved penalties and made recommendations as to all penalties regarding all disciplinary matters within the NYPD,\" and chaired Steering Committee meetings where \"penalties are discussed and recommendations made\" regarding disciplinary actions against Black and Latino NYPD officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) Proposed Defendant Tucker also chairs the Special Monitoring Committee, a body within the NYPD that determines whether to place NYPD officers in a Performance Monitoring Program (the \"PMP\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Proposed Defendant Kevin S. Richardson is a Deputy Commissioner of the NYPD as well as the Commanding Officer of the NYPD's Advocate's office, and he allegedly \"routinely met with other defendants to set policy, approve penalties, and make recommendations regarding disciplinary matters,\" and participates in Steering Committee meetings and the Special Monitoring Committee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Proposed SAC generally alleges that the Proposed Individual Defendants knew or should have known of the customs, practices, and policies described in the Proposed SAC, including but not limited to the maintenance of the illegal quota system by the NYPD and its racially discriminatory effect on the minority community and minority officers including the Plaintiffs, and \"condoned, ratified and/or authorized\" such practices, policies, and conduct. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 60-66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs proffer the following statistical allegations in support of their employment discrimination claims. According to Plaintiffs, as of June 2014, the NYPD had 35,000 members, of whom 51% were White, 26% were Latino, and 16% were Black. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 245.) Plaintiffs allege that \"the vast majority of the NYPD command structure[ ] are [W]hite males[,]\" as 80% of captains and 82% \"of the appointed ranks above the rank of Deputy Inspector\" are White. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs also allege that, as of November 2014, Black and Latino police officers comprised 43% of the NYPD's uniform workforce, but held only 17% of appointed positions above the rank of Deputy Inspector. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 246.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that \"the performance evaluation system to which the [P]laintiffs are subjected by the [Proposed D]efendants is unfair\" because, despite being \"neutral on its face, ... minority officers are more likely to be charged, investigated and receive more punishment, than their [W]hite counterparts for the same alleged offenses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) In support of that fact, Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that unspecified statistics from the Case Analysis and Tracking System (\"CATS\") for a three-year period spanning 2013 to 2016 \"show a substantial disparity between the treatment of [B]lack and [L]atino police officers as opposed to their [W]hite counterparts,\" and that, over that period, such officers \"[we]re more frequently written up for minor disciplinary infractions,\" for which the imposed penalties \"[we]re more severe.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 241.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Police officers' annual performance ratings, which range between 1.0 and 5.0, play an integral role in promotions and other employment actions, as a high annual performance rating of 4.0 or above is one of the requisite criteria for promotion to the next rank, while a \"negative annual evaluation rating,\" or a score below 3.0, makes the officer \"a candidate for placement into the probationary [PMP]\". (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27, 29.) Plaintiffs allege that \"[ ]though Black and Latino Police Officers constitute only 42% of the NYPD uniformed workforce, they make up 70% of all officers in the [PMP] as of December 31, 2016.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 235.) The PMP comprises three different levels of performance monitoring, each of which has different consequences for the terms of an officer's employment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that, from 2013 through 2015, Black and Latino officers were 50% and 70%, respectively, more likely than White officers to \"receive formal charges and specifications,\" according to CATS data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 247.) Plaintiffs further allege on the same basis that Black and Latino officers were \"substantially more likely to have been found guilty on departmental charges than [W]hite officers,\" that such officers, once found guilty, were more likely than White officers to be terminated or placed on probation, and that \"in general, disparities in the treatment of Latino and Black officers as compared to [W]hite officers at each stage of the disciplinary process support the inference that race and ethnicity were motivating factors in the decisions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs also allege that Blacks and Latinos are 25% overrepresented in \"consultations,\" which are investigations to see if command discipline charges should be brought against an officer, and that such consultations involving Black and Latino officers are 25% more likely to result in charges than consultations involving White officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 248.) Plaintiffs also allege that Black and Latino officers are 4% less likely to be offered a plea than White officers, and that dispositions of charges involving minority officers are harsher: Black and Latino officers are 40% more likely to receive a \"guilty at trial\" disposition and 84% more likely to receive a \"charges filed\" disposition, compared to White officers, and that Black and Latino officers are 659% more likely to be terminated, compared to White officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   All Plaintiffs allege that they \"suffered negative employment consequences as a result of the failure to meet the illegal quotas\" and that they were \"racially discriminated against ... with respect to performance evaluations, the [PMP], and the administration of discipline and punishment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-57.) They also allege that each \"has been penalized for reporting and complaining about the illegal quotas and its racially discriminatory application against the minority community.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Proposed SAC also proffers factual allegations specific to each named Plaintiff's NYPD experience, the details of which are discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   in connection with the question of the sufficiency of each Plaintiff's claims of discriminatory treatment, retaliation for complaints of discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliation for engaging in activity protected by the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that leave to amend should be freely granted when justice so requires.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed SAC \u00b6\u00b6 68-69, 72, 78, 80.) He also alleges that he was given negative or subpar performance ratings, disciplinary notices and punishments, and lost an endorsement for promotion; Raymond characterizes these incidents as \"acts of intentional racial discrimination\" committed by the Proposed Defendants, including Proposed Individual Defendant Tsachas. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81, 85, 89, 94.) He alleges that Tsachas \"punished minority officers more severely and more often than the [W]hite officers in his command for failure to meet the quota and any other disciplinary\n   issue,\" specifically alleging that Raymond was disciplined for the untimely submission of a vacation request while two White officers were not disciplined for the same offense, and that he was disciplined for failure to meet the enforcement activity quota while a White officer with the same or a lower level of quota compliance was not punished in any way. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64, 88, 90.). Raymond also pleads that, on December 10, 2015, his promotion to Sergeant was canceled by a deputy commissioner who then endorsed the promotion of a White police officer, following a Review Board session that was called \"to discuss Raymond's lack of enforcement activity and anticipated promotion to Sergeant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 93-94.) Plaintiffs characterize the cancellation of the promotion as an \"act of intentional racial discrimination,\" asserting that the promoted White officer was \"comparable to Raymond in that he was also called before the [R]eview [B]oard.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.) Raymond, however, fails to plead facts to support the inference that he was indeed \"comparable\" to the promoted White officer in relevant respects, such as whether the two officers had similar backgrounds, experiences, law enforcement activity statistics or performance ratings. Appearing before the Review Board on the same day does not by itself support an inference that Raymond and the White officer were \"comparable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Raymond's allegations as to discipline for the denied vacation request and failure to discipline a White officer for failing to meet quotas at the same or a higher level of noncompliance are, however, just sufficient to frame claims for intentional discriminatory treatment. Plaintiff has identified alleged comparators and specified the conduct on which the alleged disparate treatment was based. While his allegations as to comparable status are relatively conclusory, the proffer of information as to similar relevant violations and consequences (or lack thereof) and the names of the White officers is sufficient in the context of the Proposed SAC to state disparate treatment causes of action against Proposed Individual Defendant Tsachas with respect to punishment for the late leave request and for failure to meet enforcement activity quotas. Raymond has failed, however, to allege the involvement of any of the other Proposed Individual Defendants in these measures and to show that any such measures were imposed pursuant to official policies of the City, so he will only be permitted to amend the complaint to assert these claims as against Proposed Individual Defendant Tsachas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs thus fail to plead that the Proposed Defendants as a group acted with discriminatory intent as to Raymond. Plaintiffs will, however, be permitted to plead Raymond's individual discrimination claims against Tsachas based on the discipline for the late vacation request and discipline for failure to meet enforcement quotas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez and Baez\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Gonzalez' and Baez' claims of racially discriminatory actions taken against each of them are similar. Gonzalez claims that he was repeatedly chastised and punished for failing to meet enforcement activity standards, and that it was \"racially discriminatory\" for Gonzalez to receive a negative performance rating when \"[W]hite police officers in the same command, unit, squad, and shift as [Gonzalez], with equal or lower enforcement activity numbers, received annual performance evaluation ratings\" higher than his own negative rating. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed SAC \u00b6 108.) Gonzalez alleges that the enforcement metrics were brought up in discussions of his performance rating and names White\n   officers who were allegedly in the same command and shift who had at least equally low metrics and were not given ratings as low as Gonzalez'. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 108-09.) He alleges that the rating was imposed by a Lt. Hatki and upheld by Proposed Individual Defendant McCormack. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs allege generally that in the 40\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Precinct, to which both Gonzalez and Baez were assigned, all officers were subject to the same enforcement activity standards but that White officers did not receive the same punishments as Black and Latino officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133.) They allege that it was \"racially discriminatory\" for Baez to receive a negative performance rating in 2013 from Proposed Individual Defendant McCormack, \"because in that year, [his] actual performance as a police officer merited a score of at least 4.0,\" because Baez performed \"excellent police work\" in 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 135, 137.) While Baez's subjective self-evaluation of the quality of his police work is insufficient to raise an inference of discrimination, he also alleges that \"comparatively placed [W]hite police officers in the same unit, with similar activity numbers for the same period[ ] ... did not get the same punishment,\" and received higher annual performance evaluation scores. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 136.) On March 31, 2014, Baez was placed in the PMP for a negative performance rating by Proposed Individual Defendant McCormack, which Plaintiffs assert was \"racially discriminatory\" because McCormack specifically told Baez that his negative rating was based on writing an insufficient number of Criminal Court summonses, and because named White police officers \"whose performance was at the same level or worse than Baez were not placed\" in the PMP.

Although he alleges that he has long opposed the alleged quota requirement because he believes it is unfair, the only specific quota-related \"problems with the [D]efendants\" that he identifies in his complaint are attributed to his failure to meet the quotas in June 2011 when he deliberately refrained from making arrests in order to let his partner, who was getting married, write all of the arrests and summonses for that month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 198-99.)

Although he pleads that his White colleagues faced different employment actions, the alleged disparity is insufficient to support the inference because he does not proffer facts showing that they were similarly situated in ways other than their raw enforcement numbers, such as their reasons for noncompliance.

Serrano alleges that McCormack and the captain learned of Serrano's complaints over eight months later, on February 7, 2013, and thereafter \"commenced a series of retaliatory action[s] against\" Serrano, including removing him from his usual patrol assignment and reassigning him to a solitary fixed foot post, where he was inspected by five different supervisors that night, which is allegedly \"an indication that the object of the post [was] punishment\" and allegedly was \"intended to convey a threat to Serrano that he would be under increased scrutiny and would be punished for minor or pretextual infractions;\" \"sending him outside the precinct on details;\" ransacking his locker and pasting stickers of rats, in reference to his complaint, on the locker; and denying him leave despite his alleged requesting of days off in the usual manner; and the receipt of a 3.0 out of 5.0 performance evaluation for the 2012 annual period.

In the meeting, Raymond \"denounce[ed] unlawful enforcement quotas that his supervisors were imposing on him, which he felt unfairly targeted [B]lack and [L]atino communities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.) Raymond alleges that, five days after that meeting, he was told by a supervisor that the Platoon Commander with whom Raymond had met on November 22, 2014, had \"ordered\" that supervisor \"to lower Raymond's evaluation score and assign him to a punitive post, in retaliation for Raymond's stance [towards] the quota.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.) Raymond also alleges that, in retaliation for his alleged First Amendment-protected speech, he experienced the following events in January 2015: (1) the Platoon Commander denied his request to attend a presidential task force meeting on the basis of his subpar performance; (2) the commanding officer, whom Raymond had identified as imposing the quota in the letter sent in July, issued Raymond a failing interim evaluation; and (3) he was given an annual evaluation rating of 2.5 out of 5.0 for 2014, which was finalized in August 2015 by Proposed Individual Defendant Tsachas as \"retaliation for Raymond's expressed opposition to the quota.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79-84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Proposed Defendants oppose Raymond's First Amendment claim, arguing that the Court need not examine whether the July 23, 2014, letter \"was constitutionally protected\" because the claim fails to allege causation, \"as the first adverse action allegedly occurred four months later.\" (Opp. Br. at 19.) Defendants also assert that the November 22, 2014, conversation was not constitutionally protected speech because \"it is essentially a personal grievance about the effect of [the] NYPD's productivity standards upon [Raymond's] standing within the NYPD.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Court first must determine whether Raymond alleges sufficiently that he spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516953\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/386/#p394\">\n    890 F.3d at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Raymond alleges plausibly that he spoke as a citizen when he submitted the July 23, 2014, letter and when he met with the Platoon Commander on November 22, 2014, as both incidents of speech \"merely concerned\" his duties as a police officer and were not \"ordinarily within the scope of an employee's duties.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516953\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/386/#p394\">\n    890 F.3d at 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Proposed SAC does not include any facts to support an inference that commentary on the quota system was within the scope of a police officer's duties. Though each incident of speech about the quotas was made through internal NYPD channels to which a private citizen would not have access, such as through the internal Re-Engineering focus group, which was comprised of police officers and to which Raymond had been invited to participate as part of his role as an officer, and in conversations with his platoon commander and his individual supervisors (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Proposed SAC \u00b6\u00b6 74-76), neither incident was \"composed of statements made as a means to fulfill, or undertaken in the course of performing[,] [Raymond's] responsibilities as a police officer,\" as the\n   role is described in the Proposed SAC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516953\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/386/#p394\">\n    890 F.3d at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Furthermore, Raymond's statements on July 23, 2014, and November 22, 2014, were \"on a matter of public concern,\" as speech by a New York City police officer \"about the quota system imposed on him and other officers by direct supervisors ... addresse[s] a matter of public concern.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   , 488 Fed. App'x at 533. Defendants' argument that Raymond was motivated by a personal grievance about the effect of the NYPD's productivity standards upon his standing within the NYPD is unavailing. Even if Raymond was \"motivated by a personal grievance,\" he alleges plausibly that, in his November 22, 2014, conversation, he was \"simultaneously speak[ing] on a matter affecting the public at large\" (the quota system), and therefore was speaking on a matter of public concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516953\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/386/#p394\">\n    890 F.3d at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The adverse actions that occurred in November 2014, immediately following his November 22, 2014, conversation are in sufficient temporal proximity to support an inference of causal connection. Plaintiffs further allege that, after Proposed Individual Defendant Tsachas took over the command in 2015, he imposed a low performance rating to defeat Raymond's promotion and directed that Raymond be put on a punitive posting until he stopped resisting the quota. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed SAC \u00b6\u00b6 82-87.) This direct evidence of animus based on speech in opposition to the\n   quota is sufficient to sustain a First Amendment retaliation claim against Proposed Individual Defendant Tsachas for the low rating, denial of promotion and punitive posting. The four-month period that elapsed between the first alleged adverse action, in November 2014, and the July 23, 2014, letter, however, is too attenuated to provide a plausible basis for an inference of a causal connection based on temporal proximity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20693568\">\n    2012 WL 693568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   For these reasons, Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a further amended complaint thus is denied as to Raymond's First Amendment retaliation claim based on the incident of speech that occurred in 2008 and the July 23, 2014, letter, and granted as to the claim against Proposed Individual Defendant Tsachas based on the 2015 performance evaluation, promotion denial and punitive posting actions that followed the November 22, 2014, meeting with the Platoon Commander.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Serrano alleges that McCormack and the captain first learned of his complaints against them on February 7, 2013, and that McCormack soon thereafter \"commenced a series of retaliatory action[s]\" against him, including a reassignment from his usual patrol assignment to a solitary fixed foot post, inspections by multiple supervisors (including, unusually, McCormack himself) during a single shift, sending him outside the precinct on details, and denying leave requests despite the fact he \"requested days off in the usual manner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 155-57.) Serrano further alleges that, in February 2013, shortly before he was expected to testify in the Floyd trial, McCormack threatened that, if Serrano testified, McCormack would scrutinize Serrano's memo book and issue a CD for every mistake in the book. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 164.) Serrano goes on to allege that, on or about April 5, 2013, following his March 2013 testimony in\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   (in which he testified that McCormack and others had compelled him to racially profile Blacks and Latinos), he was transferred out of his precinct, where he was assigned the midnight tour, to a precinct where he was assigned the day tour, and thus \"he lost his night differential pay,\" amounting to about $5,000 a year. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 165-67.) Defendants do not address Serrano's allegations of retaliation for his June 1, 2012, complaints, but only argue that his claim is insufficiently plead because the transfer between precincts following Serrano's\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   testimony was not\n   an adverse employment action.

Serrano's allegations that he complained in writing to his union delegate about the quota system also plead sufficiently that he engaged in protected activity, because that speech is not \"itself ordinarily within the scope of [a police officer's] duties,\" even if it \"merely concerns those duties.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516953\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/386/#p394\">\n    890 F.3d at 398-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Weintraub\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517228\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/593/196/#p203\">\n    593 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   203 ) (holding that a police officer's union speech, spoken in his role as a union officer, and not made \"as a means to fulfill\" or \"undertaken in the course of performing\" his responsibilities as a police officer was citizen speech for purposes of the First Amendment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The conduct that Serrano alleges was undertaken in retaliation for his 2012 complaints is \"retaliatory conduct that would deter a similarly situated individual of ordinary firmness from exercising his or her constitutional rights\" and thus supports an inference of an \"adverse action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zelnik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3730878\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/217/#p225\">\n    464 F.3d at 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2006). Plaintiffs plead that reassignment to a solitary fixed foot post and inspections by supervising officers is \"highly unusual and an indication that the object of the post is punishment\" and that the \"inspections were intended to convey a threat to Serrano that he would be under increased scrutiny and would be punished for minor or pretextual infractions.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed SAC \u00b6 155.) Such allegations describe conduct in the nature of \"reprimands\" and thus are sufficient to plead adverse action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zelnik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3730878\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/217/#p225\">\n    464 F.3d at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Plaintiffs sufficiently allege facts to support direct and indirect causal connections. Serrano's supervisors, including Proposed Individual Defendant McCormack, commenced their allegedly retaliatory actions shortly after learning of Serrano's protected activity in February 2013 and, as \"there is no hard and fast rule for the amount of time that must pass before a causal connection is necessarily broken,\" the temporal proximity as alleged in the Proposed SAC is sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Birch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20F.%20Supp.%203d%2021\">\n    184 F.Supp.3d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Serrano further alleges a specific threat and direct retaliatory action by McCormack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The retaliatory conduct Plaintiffs allege that Serrano experienced in response to his\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   testimony is also sufficient to support a claim of an \"adverse action.\" (Proposed SAC \u00b6\u00b6 165-67.) Plaintiffs' allegations regarding Serrano's transfer from his midnight tour in the 40\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Precinct to the day tour in the 33\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Precinct, resulting in a difference in pay of about $5,000 per year, support an inference that he experienced a \"reduction in pay.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zelnik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3730878\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/217/#p225\">\n    464 F.3d at 225-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs also satisfy the \"causal connection\" prong of the inquiry, as they have sufficiently plead allegations to warrant the inference that Serrano's\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   trial testimony \"was a substantial motivating factor\" in his \"reduction in pay,\" as the reassignment occurred within a month of Serrano's protected speech, and such \"temporal proximity is strong circumstantial evidence of improper intent.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stajic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271654\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/214/230/#p235\">\n    214 F.Supp.3d at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their complaint is therefore granted as to Serrano's First Amendment retaliation claim against Proposed Individual Defendant McCormack only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   7.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion: First Amendment Retaliation Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a further amended complaint with respect to First Amendment retaliation claims is thus granted as to Raymond's claim against Proposed Individual Defendant Tsachas based on the 2015 performance evaluation, promotion denial and punitive posting actions that followed the November 22, 2014, meeting with the Platoon Commander; Gonzalez' First Amendment retaliation claim against the City and Proposed Individual Defendants McCormack, O'Neill and Bratton, to the extent he alleges retaliatory conduct from May to November 2015; and Serrano's First Amendment retaliation claim against Proposed Individual Defendant McCormack only.
