As discussed above, there is at least a fact question on whether Plaintiffs' primary duty included performing non-manual labor-specifically, Defendants' evidence relating to the PCOs' managerial role of running well sites, interacting with customers, participating in marketing, and monitoring pressure systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs next contend Defendants cannot identify specific duties Plaintiffs allegedly performed which are executive, administrative, or professional. Again, Defendants provide evidence that creates a fact question on whether Plaintiffs' primary duty involved management and safety operations at Defendants' well sites-work directly related to \"safety and health\" and \"personnel management.\" (Doc. 162 at 8-9, 10-12);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.201\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Consequently, Defendants do identify at least some specific duties that could qualify as administrative and therefore summary judgment is not appropriate on Defendants' HCE exemption defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Due to the preceding discussion, the Court finds genuine issues of material fact on both of the challenged exemptions. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Defendants' White Collar Exemption Affirmative Defenses. (Doc. 148).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   It is so\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    This definition appears in the 2004 regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor. There is some confusion as to whether the 2004 definition (Old Rule) or a rule promulgated in 2016 (New Rule) controls the current definition of \"employee employed in a bona fide administrative capacity.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nevada\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418763\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/275/795/#p798\">\n     275 F.Supp.3d at 798\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Due to the current nationwide injunction halting the implementation of the New Rule, the Old Rule controls.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418763\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/275/795/#p798\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ; see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Parrish v.
