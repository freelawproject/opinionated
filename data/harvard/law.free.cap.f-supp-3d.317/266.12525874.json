BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Mindful of the oft-quoted advice to uncover a scandal-\"follow the money\"-\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff William E. Powell has been on a long quest to obtain tax information related to his late father and grandfather, their trusts and estates, and two family printing businesses. Suspecting a possible\n   breach of fiduciary duty by the trustees, he has sent countless Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act requests to Defendant Internal Revenue Service. Although the Service contends that it has released all responsive records to which Plaintiff is entitled, he insists that it is unlawfully withholding documents in violation of the Privacy Act and FOIA. Defendant now moves to dismiss part of Powell's claims and asks for summary judgment on the remainder. Largely agreeing, the Court will grant in part and deny in part the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff's grandfather, Andrew Powell, was a prominent printer \"who parlayed a small printing business into one of the first African-American [p]rinting [c]ompanies\" in Detroit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 61-63. The Court presumes that this was the Andrew Powell Printing Company. Upon his death in 1987, Plaintiff's father-William A. Powell-inherited the business and incorporated it as the Powell Printing Company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 59, 63-65. Plaintiff became an \"[a]uthorized [i]ndividual\" for the company after his father's death, and he alleges that he is the beneficiary and heir of his father's estate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 44-45. Both father and grandfather additionally had a trust, which lists Powell as a beneficiary. For more than half a decade, Plaintiff has sought tax information on the elder Powells and their entities, believing that the trustees may have breached their fiduciary duty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Powell v.

July 31, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As relevant here, in 2013, Plaintiff submitted forms to the IRS requesting the Powell Printing Company's corporate tax returns for 1989-1991.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 73-79, 104-06. Shortly thereafter, the Service sent him the 1990 and 1991 tax returns as well as a Business Master File Transcript-Complete, which lists all tax returns and documents filed on behalf of the company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, Exhs. J, K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June and September 2017, Plaintiff submitted more Privacy Act and FOIA requests for various tax records for himself, his father and grandfather, the two printing companies, the William A. Powell Estate, the William A. Powell Trust, and the Andrew Powell Trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD, Exhs. A-H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 13, 2017, Plaintiff filed the initial Complaint in this suit, originally seeking relief under a criminal statute and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206103\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which mandates personal-record disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1. Because neither ground provides for a private right of action, Defendant moved to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 8. Powell swiftly responded with his First Amended Complaint, which alleged a Privacy Act violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11. On July 3, he moved for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint to add FOIA and Privacy Act claims related to his June requests, which the Court granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16; Minute Order of July 20, 2017. On October 23, he again sought supplementation, this time to tack on his September record requests to this suit, and he was again permitted to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 26; Minute Order of Oct. 30, 2017. The Court treats these latter two pleadings as supplementing, rather than superseding, the First Amended Complaint, and it will thus consider the allegations in all three as properly pled. The Government has now filed a Motion to\n   Dismiss or for Summary Judgment, asserting that all of his claims fail because the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear them, they are moot, or they are deficient as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Service does not dispute that this information is sufficient for Plaintiff to obtain the records of himself, his father, the Powell Printing Company, the William A. Powell Estate, the William A.

The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, when seeking tax records for a deceased individual or an estate, a requester must show that he is the \"administrator, executor, or trustee of [the] estate\" or an \"heir at law, next of kin, or beneficiary under the will, of such decedent.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206103\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1)(E) (i)-(ii).

The Court has reviewed this document and is unable to locate such an indication. Even if that information did appear on the transcript, it would still not satisfy the requirements for disclosure because he must show that, as a shareholder, he owns more than 1% of the outstanding stock or that (if an S corporation) he was a shareholder during the relevant period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206103\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1)(D)(iii), (iv). Plaintiff also contends that the company \"would have Members and the Andrew Powell Printing Company would have to provide an accurate accounting of the LLC's ownership and each Member's distributive share of profits and losses on state and federal tax returns.\" Opp. at 7. Construed generously, the Court takes Plaintiff's argument to be that the IRS would be able to see whether he meets the criteria for disclosure because it could look at the returns and determine how much of a share Powell inherited through his father. Even if that were true, Powell, not the Service, bears the burden of establishing access to records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goldstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272857\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/279/170/#p180\">\n    279 F.Supp.3d at 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the extent, moreover, that he attempts to argue that as a shareholder of Powell Printing Company he is also a shareholder of the Andrew Powell Printing Company and thus entitled to access, Plaintiff has not established that these two companies are the same legal entities such that being a shareholder of one would mean he was a shareholder of the other. The Court thus agrees with the Government that Powell has only established authorization to obtain tax information for the Powell Printing Company, William A. Powell, the William A. Powell Trust, the William A. Powell Estate, the Andrew Powell Trust, and himself.

The \"adequacy of a FOIA search is generally determined not by the fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of the methods used to carry out the search.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701462,9374831\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/311/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Service's described search was reasonably tailored to produce all address changes in the system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   b. Foreign Information System Transcripts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff also requested the Foreign Information System (Transcript/Tax Return) for various years for\n   himself and his father. According to the IRS, the FIS \"is a computer system that was used to track data\" submitted by foreign-owned corporations on Form 5472.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   White Decl., \u00b6 18. The system was replaced by a new electronic one in 2007-before corporations filed tax returns for that year-meaning there would be no records for any corporation after 2006. As to years prior to that, the Government avers that \"to the extent they ever existed,\" it is unable to search for such records because they are \"no longer accessible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22. Powell balks at the suggestion that \"no one within one of the largest collection agencies ('IRS') in the world does not have any form of computer support or technology information ('IT') support to advise Defendant of how to retrieve information from an obsolete system.\" Opp. at 12. He asserts that there should be a \"hard copy, microfilm, microfiche, or other electronic media forms\" available to access the requested documents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"[P]urely speculative claims about the ... discoverability of other documents,\" however, is insufficient to overcome the \"good faith presumption\" accorded agency affidavits in FOIA cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bloeser v. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180452\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/811/316/#p320\">\n    811 F.Supp.2d 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 320 (D.D.C. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4159167\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/742/126/#p130\">\n    742 F.Supp.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 130 (D.D.C. 2010) ). The Court further notes that, to the extent what Powell desires is Form 5472-which is used by corporations with 25% or more foreign ownership-if any existed, they would be appended to an individual tax return.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   White Decl., \u00b6 22 n.3. His request for the FIS\n   <em>\n    transcript\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MTD, Exh. C, however, is only available in the now-defunct FIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   c. Non-Master File Transcripts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff also requested official and automated Non-Master File (NMF) transcripts for several years for himself as well as the Andrew Powell Trust, the Powell Printing Company, William A. Powell, the William A. Powell Estate, and the William A. Powell Trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD, Exh. E. The IRS has two types of tax filing accounts: Master File (MF) and NMF. The MF includes the individual, business, and employee-plans master files as well as any individual-retirement-account file. \"In addition to\" those files, \"there is also NMF,\" which is \"used to control returns or entities that are not available from the Master File.\" Internal Revenue Manual \u00a7 4.71.2(5). \"NMF accounts are not posted on Master File\" and are located \"on the A[utomated]NMF system.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4159167\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/742/126/#p130\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 (5)-(6). To search for Plaintiff's requested files, the IRS input the relevant taxpayer identification number, transcript type, and relevant time periods, but retrieved no responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   White Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 28, 32. Plaintiff, again, does not dispute the adequacy of this search but instead argues that Defendant should have searched for Individual Master File transcripts and Business Master File Transcripts. The Internal Revenue Manual is clear, however, that those transcripts would not appear on an NMF. The Court is satisfied that the Service's NMF search was adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   d. Form 1042S Indices\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The IRS also searched for Form 1042S Indices for the Powell Printing Company and the William A. Powell Estate as per Plaintiff's June 12 request. To do so, it searched the Master File System in IDRS for the specific MFT code that corresponds to whether the taxpayer filed a 1042-S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   White Decl., \u00b6 36. That code was not present on the transcripts for either the Powell Printing Company or the William A. Powell Estate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39. Powell only challenges this search to the extent it did not include records for the Andrew Powell Printing Company, but, as discussed\n   above, he has not shown that he is entitled to those records. The IRS, therefore, had no obligation to search for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   e. K-1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Powell also requested K-1 information, which form is used to report taxable events from entities including an estate or trust, for himself from several of the entities stretching back to 1987. According to the Service, this information \"would show up on Mr. Powell's transcripts\" in IDRS if it exists, but that system only retains information returns (mandatory tax documents that businesses use to notify the IRS of reportable transactions) for ten years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   White Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 41-42. Because the latest date for which Powell requested K-1 information was 2006, any records from the trust or estate would have been purged from IDRS in 2016-one year before he submitted his request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Next, the Service manually searched Plaintiff's transcripts for the requested years \"in case he perhaps had attached his Forms K-1 to his own returns.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 43. It then sent a request to its long-term storage facility to locate any responsive files.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 45. Personal tax returns, however, are destroyed after seven years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 46. In other words, if Plaintiff had a 2006 tax return, it would have been filed in 2007 and destroyed in 2014. Finally, Defendant \"checked to see if the Andrew Powell Trust had filed a Form 1041,\" which would have had K-1 information attached, if applicable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 47. The Trust only filed a Form 1041 for 1996, but the IRS does not have a record of it because it would have been destroyed around 2003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 48. After realizing it did not search for K-1s from the William A. Powell Trust and the William A. Powell Estate, the Service conducted a supplemental search using the same method described above and did not locate any responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply, Attach. 1 (Supplemental Declaration of William White), \u00b6\u00b6 4-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff attempts to undercut this seemingly thorough search with two arguments. First, he claims that he \"requested the K-1s for William A. Powell, William E. Powell, and Andrew Powell for the Powell Printing Company for the years of 1990 through 1993.\" Opp. at 15. The only evidence in the record regarding K-1 requests are those reported by the William A. Powell Trust (1992-2006), the William A. Powell Estate (1992-2006), and the Andrew Powell Trust (1987-1998) for which Plaintiff was the beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD, Exh. B at 3. He has not provided any proof, therefore, that he requested K-1s for his father or grandfather, or for himself from 1990-1991 related to the William A. Powell Trust and Estate. As Defendant seeks summary judgment on the claims at issue here, Powell must show some \"genuine dispute as to the agency's receipt of the ... request in light of the agency's declaration that it had no record of receiving the request.\"\n   <em>\n    Pinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197077\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/69/108/#p115\">\n    69 F.Supp.3d at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He has not done so. In any event, even if he had, these records would likely have been destroyed pursuant to the aforementioned retention policies. The Service averred, furthermore, that it searched for his K-1 information as it related to the William A. Powell Trust, the William A. Powell Estate, and the Andrew Powell Trust for the requested years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   White Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 41-49; Suppl. White Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 2-8. As described above, however, the requested records \"no longer exist because [Plaintiff] is seeking information return data from prior to 10 years ago.\" White Decl., \u00b6 49;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   , Suppl. White Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 4-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Powell next argues that the IRS should have been able to locate Form 706, a one-time submission by the executor of an estate to determine the estate tax, for the William A. Powell Estate because such\n   forms are retained for 75 years. The Service avers that \"searched for the Form 706 in 2015 as part of a court proceeding in Michigan and [was] unable to locate it.\" Supp. White Decl., \u00b6 9. Such a cursory explanation is not a \"reasonably detailed\" description of the search because it does not \"set[ ] forth the search terms and the type of search performed.\"\n   <em>\n    Oglesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486337,10542054\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/57/\">\n    920 F.2d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the IRS alleges that it has a\n   <em>\n    copy\n   </em>\n   of the Estate Form 706, Powell seeks the\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   , which he says may have K-1 information attached. The Court is, accordingly, unable to grant the Government summary judgment on this score. It may renew its Motion with another supplemental declaration describing the search terms and type of search performed for the original Form 706 for the William A. Powell Estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court will largely grant Defendant's Motion. With the exception of the request for the Powell Printing Company's 1989 tax return, the claims in Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint will be dismissed for failure to exhaust. The Court will also grant the Government summary judgment on the claims in the Second Amended and Supplemental Complaints, apart from the adequacy of the search for Plaintiff's K-1 information as it relates to Form 706 from the William A. Powell Estate. A separate Order consistent with this Opinion will be issued this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
