Pl.'s Mot. at 30. As alleged, Murdock knowingly filed 18 reports which contained false information about Brasil's role in managing the company. This conduct alone constitutes egregious fraud and disregard for regulatory filing requirements, satisfying the first prong of the standard for imposing third-tier penalties.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    China Infrastructure Inv.\n   </em>\n   , 189 F.Supp.3d at 136-37 (finding defendants' misrepresentation of former CFO's officer status and forgery of his signature in SEC filings satisfied the fraud criterion for penalties analysis). And Murdock engaged in further fraud when he induced the removal of restrictive legends meant to prevent the sale of unregistered Analytica shares to the public. Hence, the first requirement is easily met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court also finds Murdock's violations satisfy the second criterion for the imposition of third-tier penalties. First, Murdoch knowingly misled investors regarding Brasil's control of Analytica and Murdock's own role managing the company, deceiving investors as to the stability of the company and their investment. Second, his fraudulent scheme put over a half million unregistered shares into the public market. The price then dropped from at least $1 per share in 2014 to less than a penny per share in March 2018. Although the SEC has provided no evidence demonstrating Murdock's actions caused this entire price drop, his violations nonetheless \"created a significant risk\" that the shares' value would decrease if it later came to light that he was in fact in control of the company or that the shares sold in the public market were unregistered. This risk of substantial losses is sufficient to warrant the imposition of third-tier penalties.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Enters.
