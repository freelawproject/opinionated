The day of Kingsbury's arrest, the government notified Kingsbury's lawyer of its intention to test the handgun and magazine swabs for DNA evidence using a process that would \"consume\"-i.e., destroy-the swabs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from C.B.

(\"Def.'s Mot.\") [ECF No. 10] at 4. Specifically, Kingsbury proposed that the government be ordered to \"cut each swab in half\" and to extract DNA from only one of the two halves.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If the government determined that there was enough DNA extract to proceed with testing, it would do so; if not, it could extract DNA from the remaining half, combine the two extractions, and then attempt to construct a DNA profile from the resulting combination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The government opposes the defendant's proposed approach on both legal and scientific grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Opp'n at 5-40. From a legal standpoint, the government argues that neither the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, nor the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, nor any other legal authority prohibits the government from consuming DNA evidence for \"legitimate scientific reason[s].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Scientifically, the government contends that because swabs tend to contain low levels of\n   DNA evidence to begin with, splitting the swabs here unjustifiably increases the risk that neither half will yield usable results.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12, 26-28;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-37 (arguing that while high-content, high-quality DNA sources such as condoms or large blood stains typically do not require consumption, low-content, low-quality sources like swabs, straws, and hair roots typically do). The government also argues, among other things, that: (1) the manipulation required to split the swabs and, if necessary, to recombine the extracted DNA would lead to further DNA loss,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-25; (2) because genetic material is rarely evenly distributed throughout a swab, splitting the swabs would create a risk that one party would receive a usable DNA sample while the other would not,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-32; and (3) because swabs often collect genetic material left by more than one person, splitting the swabs decreases the likelihood that enough material from any one individual will remain to construct a reliable DNA profile of that individual,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12, 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Kingsbury has not filed a reply in support of his motion to compel, and the time in which to do so has expired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Crim.

These courts explain that, until the swabs are tested, it is impossible to know whether they contain exculpatory or even material evidence, because the results of the testing could be inculpatory-or, as is statistically more likely, inconclusive.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342730\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/60/#p65\">\n    169 F.Supp.3d at 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]t this time, the swabs are neither exculpatory or inculpatory evidence.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 20 to Gov't's Opp'n (suggesting that, according to a study conducted by the D.C. Department\n   of Forensic Sciences, more than 70% of all firearms swabs produce either no DNA results or \"uninterpretable\" results). Moreover, these courts have held, \"the Government does not act in bad faith when it consumes genetic material for testing, so long as it has a scientific reason for doing so.\"\n   <em>\n    Quinones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268057\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/375/#p376\">\n    236 F.Supp.3d at 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, neither prong of\n   <em>\n    Youngblood\n   </em>\n   's two-pronged test is satisfied, and \"the due process clause ... do[es] not require the Government to preserve half of swabs prior to extracting any DNA evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342730\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/60/#p65\">\n    169 F.Supp.3d at 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Courts have also held that the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure impose no such requirement. Under Rule 16(a)(1)(E), a defendant may inspect any tangible object that is \"material to preparing the defense,\" that \"the government intends to use ... in its case-in-chief at trial,\" or that \"was obtained from or belongs to the defendant.\" But as one court in this district has explained, it is impossible to know whether a swab satisfies any of these three criteria until it is tested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342730\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/60/#p65\">\n    169 F.Supp.3d at 65-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that, prior to testing, \"it is unclear whether the swabs are material to preparing [the] defense, whether the Government intends to use any DNA evidence during its case-in-chief, or if any DNA is obtained, whether it is from or belongs to [the defendant]\"). Thus, Rule 16 does not require the government to split swabs prior to testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court is persuaded by these prior decisions of courts in this district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Quinones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Haight\n   </em>\n   , it is impossible to know whether the swabs are exculpatory, material, or discoverable under Rule 16 until they are tested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, the government's unrebutted explanation of the scientific necessity of consuming the swabs \"vitiate[s] any finding of bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Haight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290166\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/240/#p241\">\n    153 F.Supp.3d at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, neither due process nor the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure prohibit the government from consuming the swabs at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, the Court notes that its ruling does not leave Kingsbury without meaningful avenues of challenging the results of the government's testing of the undivided swabs. For one thing, although the DNA extraction process will consume the swabs themselves, there may be leftover DNA extract (depending on how much genetic material is present on the swabs) that \"will be preserved in the event the defense decides to request testing.\" Consumption Letter at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342730\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/60/#p65\">\n    169 F.Supp.3d at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To the extent that there is DNA extract left, it shall be preserved for defense use.\"). Moreover, Kingsbury may request discovery of the results of the government's DNA testing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(a)(1)(F) (authorizing a defendant to obtain discovery of the \"results or reports\" of \"scientific test[s] or experiment[s]\"), and, if he questions the government's methods, he \"may cross-examine any experts involved in the testing,\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342730\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/60/#p65\">\n    169 F.Supp.3d at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The presence of these\n   safeguards further buttresses the Court's conclusion that consumption of the swabs would violate neither due process nor the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court joins every other judge in this district to have considered the issue and holds that the government may consume the DNA swabs at issue in this case in conducting DNA testing. Kingsbury's motion to compel the government to preserve half of each swab will therefore be denied. A separate order has been issued on this date.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Kingsbury relies on two D.C. Superior Court cases that have adopted his proposed testing method.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mot. at 3 n.2. But as the government points out-and as Kingsbury does not dispute-nineteen other Superior Court judges have rejected it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Gov't's Opp'n at 9 n.6.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Kingsbury correctly points out that the D.C. Circuit has read the term \"material\" in a related provision of Rule 16 to refer to any evidence that is \"important to the preparation of a defense,\" regardless of whether it is inculpatory or exculpatory.\n    <em>\n     United States v.

But once again, it is impossible to tell whether the swabs are \"important\" to Kingsbury's defense until they are tested, because the tests could be-and, according to the government, are statistically most likely to be-inconclusive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
