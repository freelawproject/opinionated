WOLFORD, United States District Judge\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     INTRODUCTION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Phyllis Jiles (\"Plaintiff\"),\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , brings this action pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\"), and the New York State Human Rights Law, New York Executive Law \u00a7 290\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"NYSHRL\"), alleging that her former employer, the Rochester Genesee Regional Transportation Authority (\"Defendant\"), retaliated against her by failing to rehire her for an open position. (Dkt. 1). Presently before the Court is Defendant's motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 7). For the following reasons, Defendant's motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following alleged facts are drawn from Plaintiff's complaint and the attached exhibits. On March 1 and 7, 2016, Defendant was accepting applications for a customer service position. (Dkt. 1 at 5). Plaintiff, who was first employed by Defendant on March 24, 2004 and laid off on May 30, 2014, applied for the open position online, but Defendant blocked her email address. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 4-5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jiles v. Rochester Genesee Reg'l Transp. Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271636\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/217/688/#p689\">\n    217 F.Supp.3d 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 689 (W.D.N.Y. 2016) ). Plaintiff then created a \"fake email address to test the website\" and, after applying with the fake email address, received a message stating her application had been received. (Dkt. 1 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Attached to Plaintiff's complaint are a Determination and Order by the New York State Division of Human Rights (\"NYSDHR\"), dated February 13, 2017, and a notice of dismissal and right to sue by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission adopting the NYSDHR's findings, dated March 16, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8, 9). According to the NYSDHR Determination and Order, Plaintiff filed a verified complaint with the NYSDHR on August 23, 2016, charging Defendant with \"discrimination/retaliation, race/color\" in violation of the NYSHRL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). After investigating the complaint, the NYSDHR found no probable cause to believe Defendant engaged in discrimination or retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The NYSDHR Determination and Order states that Plaintiff previously worked for Defendant as a \"Scheduler\" and filed a prior NYSDHR racial discrimination complaint against Defendant in April of 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In November of 2015 and March of 2016, Plaintiff applied for an \"Access Scheduler\" position with Defendant, but was not rehired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Regardless of whether Defendant blocked Plaintiff's email address, the NYSDHR found that Plaintiff submitted, and Defendant received, paper applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The NYSDHR also noted that, according to Defendant, Plaintiff's prior position as a \"Scheduler\" entailed office work rather than customer service work and Plaintiff lacked customer service experience required for the \"Access Scheduler\" position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Correspondingly, the NYSDHR found that Plaintiff was not better qualified than the candidates selected for the \"Access Scheduler\" positions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Additionally, the employee responsible for reviewing applications for Defendant asserted that she was hired after Plaintiff's first complaint and denied knowledge of Plaintiff's prior complaint at the time of her applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Proceedings in this Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff filed her original complaint in this action on June 2, 2017, claiming Defendant both discriminated and retaliated against her by terminating her employment and by failing to rehire her for the open \"Access Scheduler\" position. (Dkt. 1). By order dated August 29, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiff leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and screened Plaintiff's complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2). (Dkt. 3). Pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2), the Court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   dismissed with prejudice Plaintiff's claims arising out of her termination as barred by res judicata,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   leaving only her claim for retaliation arising out of Defendant's failure to rehire her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 8, 2017, Defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 7). Initially, Defendant argued that both Plaintiff's NYSHRL claim and Title VII claim should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Dkt. 7-9 at 5). Plaintiff filed a response to the motion to dismiss on November 27, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 9). Defendant filed a reply on December 20, 2017. (Dkt. 10). Defendant, in its reply, withdrew its earlier argument that Plaintiff's Title VII claim should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), and instead asserted that Plaintiff's Title VII claim should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court Declines to Treat the Instant Motion as a Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant, in its reply memorandum, also asks the Court, in the alternative, to convert its motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56. (Dkt. 10 at 9). Rule 12(d) provides the circumstances in which a motion to dismiss may be converted to a motion for summary judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   If, on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment\n   under Rule 56. All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). Whether the Court should convert or decide the motion to dismiss on the pleadings alone is a discretionary decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friedl v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11526365\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/210/79/#p83\">\n    210 F.3d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83 (2d Cir. 2000) (explaining that a district court may choose between conversion or exclusion of extra-pleading materials presented in response to a 12(b)(6) motion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The plain language of Rule 12(d) provides for conversion of only Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 12(c) motions. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). Here, in light of the Court's refusal to consider Defendant's late argument to dismiss Plaintiff's Title VII claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court declines to treat the instant motion as one for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's motion to dismiss (Dkt. 7) is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Plaintiff previously raised claims of discrimination and retaliation relating to the termination of her employment in a prior action in this Court, and the Court dismissed those claims as time-barred under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jiles v.
