Specifically, Defendant seeks to exclude: (1) evidence of medical expenses billed as a result of the incident; (2) evidence of the Parties' financial resources; (3) comments from Plaintiffs' counsel regarding personal knowledge or justness of cause; (4) specific comments to the jury; (5) evidence of prior incidents; and (6) certain hearsay statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs do not oppose the exclusion of evidence regarding the Parties' financial resources, counsel's statements regarding personal knowledge or justness of cause, and specific comments to the jury regarding that it should \"send a message\" to Defendant. Accordingly, Defendant's omnibus motion is granted with respect to these three incorporated motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Evidence of Medical Expenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant moves to exclude evidence of the full amount of the medical expenses billed as a result of the incident and argues that it is improper to introduce the medical bills that represent the total amount billed rather than the amount that was actually accepted as payment in full satisfaction of the bills. Plaintiffs argue in opposition that the collateral source rule precludes Defendant's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant's argument on this point focuses on what Plaintiffs would be entitled to recoup-not the admissibility of the full amount of medical expenses billed. Because Defendant does not put forth a valid argument as to why the evidence should\n   not be admitted, Defendant's motion to exclude evidence of the full amount of medical expenses billed is denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Plaintiffs oppose and argue that each prior incident is related in one fashion or another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Evidence of similar occurrences may be offered to show a defendant's notice of a particular defect or danger, the magnitude of the defect or danger involved, the defendant's ability to correct a known defect, the lack of safety for intended uses, the strength of a product, the standard of care, and causation.\"\n   <em>\n    Hessen for Use &amp; Benefit of Allstate Ins.

However, in order for evidence of prior incidents to be admissible, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit requires that (1) \"conditions substantially similar to the occurrence in question must have caused the prior accident\" and (2) \"the prior accident must not have occurred too remote in time.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

The purpose of this doctrine is to \"protect[ ] parties against the admission of unfairly prejudicial evidence, evidence which, because it is not substantially similar to the accident or incident at issue, is apt to confuse or mislead the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Tran v.

Several of the prior incidents that Plaintiffs seek to introduce took place while aboard a tender boat-not on a ramp. These prior incidents, relating to injuries sustained by Sean Haymes, Margie Patricia Gomez, Patricia Painter, Caroline Laverty, and David Medina, are not sufficiently similar and are therefore excluded from being presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court finds that the prior incident involving Francis Joyce Rose is substantially similar. Ms. Rose was a passenger who lost her footing and fell when a ramp moved while she was disembarking a tender boat to go ashore. Ms. Rose reported that the ramp moved due to a sea swell. Evidence of this prior incident is admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The prior incident involving Iwan Hermawan is not substantially similar. Mr. Hermawan flipped over the railing of a tender boat during tender operations when a swell hit the tender boat. As noted above, incidents that occurred on tender boats are not substantially similar to the facts here. Further, Mr. Hermawan was a crew member and not in a similar position as the Plaintiffs here. Evidence of Mr. Hermawan's prior incident is inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The prior incidents involving passengers Amanda Yuelling, Caroline Laverty, Jo Ann Croteau, and Jennifer Ojascastro,\n   are not substantially similar. Although these incidents-each of which can be categorized as a \"slip and fall\"-occurred on ramps, there is no reason to believe that any of these incidents were the result of poor weather. Admission of evidence regarding these incidents would be more prejudicial than probative and these incidents are accordingly excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, the prior incident involved Qungwen Shen is not substantially similar. Ms. Shen was a passenger who caught her toe between the tender and the gangway while disembarking a tender boat to return to the cruise ship. The facts do not indicate inclement weather or anything akin to what Plaintiffs allege here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Accordingly, Defendant's motion to exclude evidence of the prior incident regarding Ms. Rose is denied. The motion to exclude evidence of prior incidents is granted in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Hearsay Statements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant also moves to exclude Plaintiff Lydia Acevedo's testimony that an unknown person alleged to be a crew member commented to her that the weather and water conditions were bad at the time of the incident. Defendant argues that the statement in question is inadmissible hearsay and does not fall under any hearsay exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Rule 801(d)(2)(D) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that a statement is not hearsay if \"offered against a party and is 'statement by the party's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship.' \"\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson v.

In the report, Dr. Gelblum opines on Plaintiff Daniel Acevedo's neurologic state after conducting a neurological examination and reviewing Daniel Acevedo's medical records. Dr. Gelblum also conducted a depression screening, and the result was positive. Plaintiffs specifically take issue with Dr. Gelblum's \"depression screening\" and additional finding that Daniel Acevedo suffers from \"psychiatric pseudo-seizures\" and the references in the report to Plaintiffs' financial incentives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Following a thorough review of the report, the Court finds that Dr. Gelblum is qualified to testify regarding the matters contained in the report, that the methodology was sound, and that it will assist the jury to determine facts at issue. However, any references to Plaintiffs' financial incentives are improper and not properly within the scope of Dr. Gelblum's expertise and are hereby stricken.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally,\n   the fact that the report is signed electronically is not a basis for striking the report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hermosilla v.

Because Dr. Olaffson's report contains an electronic signature, Plaintiffs' motion to strike the report is denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dr. Olaffson's Report (ECF No. 63-1) at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Dr. Robert Camuccio\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs also seek to exclude Robert Camuccio's testimony and report because they argue that Mr. Camuccio's methodology is not described adequately, nor does the report provide any technical or specialized knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Mr. Camuccio is a retired U.S. Coast Guard Officer who submitted a report regarding tender boat operations. Mr. Camuccio visited and inspected the\n   <em>\n    Sky\n   </em>\n   while the ship was transporting passengers to and from two tender boats that were used on the day of the accident. Mr. Camuccio observed personnel aboard the\n   <em>\n    Sky\n   </em>\n   and opined that they were performing their normal duties and responsibilities required during tender boat operations. Mr. Camuccio's report states that \"[t]he tendering procedures [he] witnessed were carried out to industry standards.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As noted above, the Court looks to the expert's qualifications, the reliability of the testimony, and the extent to which the testimony will aid the trier of fact.\n   <em>\n    Sorrels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768232\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/1275/#p1287\">\n    796 F.3d at 1275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs do not challenge Mr. Camuccio's qualifications. It is also clear from the record that expert testimony regarding tender boat operations would be helpful to the trier of fact. Thus, the issue before the Court is Mr. Camuccio's methodology. Plaintiffs contend that Mr. Camuccio's conclusion regarding industry standards is the equivalent of lay testimony and that Mr. Camuccio fails to prove his methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Based upon a review of the report and Mr. Camuccio's observations which provide the basis for his conclusions, the report and testimony on the issues contained therein are admissible.

In\n   <em>\n    Kondragunta\n   </em>\n   , the Court addressed plaintiff's non-compliance with Rule 26(a)(2)(C) on a motion for summary judgment.

Mar. 21, 2013). The court found that despite plaintiff's disclosure of the names of the treating physicians and the subject matter upon which the experts would be testifying, the failure to provide a summary of the facts and the opinions on which the expert was expected to testify was in violation of Rule 26(a)(2)(C)(ii). The court then addressed whether plaintiff's noncompliant disclosure created a harm that cannot be cured.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. The court noted that \"[m]ost courts that have dealt with this same question in similar situations have answered 'No,' and instead permitted the noncompliant party another opportunity to provide a compliant report, after which the moving party is then permitted to depose the witness.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs provided a bullet point list in the Notice but failed to summarize or provide any information regarding the opinions of the experts with respect to the topic of costs of past and future medical care.\n   <em>\n    See Kondragunta v.

In Plaintiffs' response in opposition, Plaintiffs informed the Court that they would move to amend their expert witness disclosures to include opinions as to the Plaintiffs' future medical care and costs of future medical care by September 5, 2017. On September 14, 2017, Plaintiffs moved for leave to reopen expert witness discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 83). On September 15, 2017, Plaintiffs withdrew the motion.

Plaintiffs have thus indicated through their response to the motion to strike, motion to amend, and subsequent withdrawal of the motion to amend, that they will not be amending the expert reports to include information regarding past and future medical costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Despite the withdrawal of the motion to amend, the Court permits Plaintiffs a brief opportunity to amend the disclosures and cure the deficiencies regarding past and future medical care costs in compliance with Rule 26.
