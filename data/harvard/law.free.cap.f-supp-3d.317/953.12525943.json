That said, \"[m]uch is undisputed here,\" according to Plaintiff. (Doc. 19, ID 501).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant terminated Plaintiff for accumulating twelve points under the company's no-fault attendance policy. With the exception of eleven excluded categories of absence, including FMLA leave, any absence earns an employee between one-half and one-and-a-half points. At eleven points, Defendant's policy calls for termination. Defendant consistently enforced the policy as written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff, as an hourly worker, was a member of his union and familiar with the collective bargaining agreement that governed his employment. Under that agreement, an employee could reduce attendance points by achieving perfect attendance for thirty days. The policy treated time off for vacation, bereavement, jury duty, military duty, union leave, and holidays as days \"worked\" toward that thirty-day count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   It did not, however, count FMLA leave as time \"worked\" toward the thirty-day perfect attendance streak. While Defendant did not add points for time an employee missed while on FMLA leave, it classified FMLA leave as an event that reset the perfect attendance clock. For example, if an employee worked three days, took the fourth day off for an FMLA qualifying purpose, and returned to work on the fifth, his attendance streak restarted at one day worked, rather than four.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant does not require its employees to use or exhaust vacation time in conjunction with FMLA leave, though it permits employees to do so. Employees using vacation time with leave maintain perfect attendance and avoid an economic loss, since FMLA leave is unpaid. Plaintiff never used vacation time in conjunction with his FMLA leave, and Defendant paid out the fifty-six hours of unused vacation time due to Plaintiff on termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff used intermittent FMLA leave due to migraine headaches. Defendant approved all his requests for FMLA leave. Plaintiff missed slightly more than ten percent of his scheduled time off due to his migraines, and Defendant gave him no attendance points for those absences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff claims that if Defendant treated his FMLA leave the same as vacation, bereavement leave, or the other handful of excepted types of absences, he would have had several points fewer on his attendance record, keeping him below the terminal eleven points. However, because Defendant's policy did not count his FMLA leave time toward the necessary thirty days of perfect attendance, Plaintiff surpassed eleven points, and Defendant terminated him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response to his termination, Plaintiff filed the present action. Defendant has moved for summary judgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate under Fed. R.

(Doc. 13-1). Instead, the policy merely treats FMLA leave like the equivalent non-FMLA for the purposes of distributing attendance bonuses, which is permissible under the relevant law and regulations. (Doc. 13-1, ID 62-67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In response, Plaintiff claims Defendant interfered with his rights under FMLA, because each time he used his approved intermittent FMLA leave, he interrupted the thirty-day perfect attendance window. (Doc. 19, ID 511-20). Plaintiff argues he cannot control when he needs that time, and therefore faces inevitable termination as points accumulate and never come off due to his use of intermittent FMLA leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   With few, if any, relevant facts in dispute, the case boils down to the characterization of Defendant's attendance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ultimately, I agree with Defendant. The point removal policy is a benefit employees earn for working, and the Act does not entitle employees to \"the accrual of any...employment benefits during any period of leave.\" 29 U.S.C.\u00a7 2614(a)(3)(A).

Defendant argues the point removal policy is distinct and separate from the attendance policy itself. Therefore, removing points is a bonus, and adding points is a disciplinary step. Since the policy does not add points for FMLA leave, and treats FMLA leave like equivalent non-FMLA leave, Defendant argues it complies with the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On the other side, Plaintiff contends the point removal process is a portion of the larger attendance policy, rather than a bonus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   He argues there is no difference between penalizing his FMLA absence by adding points to his record, and not removing a point after thirty days of perfect attendance, interrupted only by FMLA leave. Since certain forms of leave, paid and unpaid, do not interrupt the thirty-day perfect attendance timeline, Plaintiff argues the policy interferes with his FMLA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   rights by disciplining him exclusively for exercising his FMLA rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To support its claims, Defendant points to the preamble to the regulation change included in the Federal Register. According to Defendant, the preamble shows that the Department of Labor considered, but rejected Plaintiff's argument when it drafted the regulation.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Allowing an employer to disqualify employees taking FMLA leave from bonuses or awards for the achievement of a specified goal unless the bonus is awarded to employees on an equivalent leave status for a reason that does not qualify as FMLA leave puts employees who take FMLA leave on equal footing with employees who take leave for non-FMLA reasons. The Department does not view this as interference because employees taking FMLA leave are not being treated differently than employees taking equivalent non-FMLA leave. Accordingly, employees taking FMLA leave neither lose any benefit accrued prior to taking leave, nor accrue any additional benefit to which they would not otherwise be entitled....Penalizing an employee for taking FMLA leave under a \"no fault\" attendance policy is distinct from disqualifying an employee from a bonus or award for attendance because the former faults an employee for taking leave itself whereas the latter denies a reward for achieving the job-related performance goal of perfect attendance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2067934\">\n    73 Fed.

Since the removal of a point is a \"bonus,\" and the company does not add points for missed work covered by the FMLA, it complies with the regulatory distinction expressed in the Federal Register.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2067934\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Penalizing an employee for taking FMLA leave under a 'no fault' attendance policy is distinct from disqualifying an employee from a bonus or award for attendance.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Additionally, Defendant offers several out-of-circuit cases illustrating how other courts have considered the new bonus regulation.
