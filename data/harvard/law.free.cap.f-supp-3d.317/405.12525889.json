These cases, however, predate the D.C. Circuit's recent decision in\n    <em>\n     Reporters Committee for Freedom of Press\n    </em>\n    . That case makes clear that an agency declaration's failure to identify both the type of search performed and the terms used to search electronically-stored materials results in a \"principal flaw\" even when components, offices, units, or divisions within an agency conduct searches as part of a broader agency search.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264644\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/399/#p403\">\n     877 F.3d at 403\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <em>\n     Reporters Committee for Freedom of Press\n    </em>\n    involved a challenge to a FOIA search conducted by several components of the FBI: three \"divisions,\" an \"office,\" a \"unit,\" and a \"section\" of the FBI. In that case, the D.C. Circuit explicitly rejected the government's argument that \"[a]n agency affidavit, describing a targeted search of a specific office as part of a broader search, does not need to elaborate further to achieve the level of detail FOIA requires.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264644\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/399/#p403\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264644\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/399/#p403\">\n     at 404\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation marks omitted).

Based on the reasoning of\n    <em>\n     Reporters Committee for Freedom of Press\n    </em>\n    , NARA must set forth the search terms and the type of search performed with specificity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    NARA next argues that any defect in Scanlon's description of the searches conducted by NARA's Office of General Counsel, Equal Employment Opportunity Office, and the Office of Human Capital is irrelevant because Scanlon ultimately determined that NARA's Office of the Inspector General was the only office that had responsive records. Defs.' Reply at 4-5. But Scanlon's declaration expressly states that he made this determination \"\n    <em>\n     [b]ased on the responses received from the offices that searched for responsive records\n    </em>\n    and the information provided to me by individuals with direct knowledge of the events that are the subject of the request.\" Scanlon Decl. \u00b6 20 (emphasis added). Because the searches conducted by NARA's Office of General Counsel, Equal Employment Opportunity Office, and Office of Human Capital informed Scanlon's determination that the Office of the Inspector General was the only office with responsive records, those offices' searches are relevant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    NARA's final counterargument fails for the same reason. According to NARA, the plaintiffs' claim against NARA in count four is moot because NARA's Office of Inspector General \"ultimately located, processed, and produced the very records that plaintiffs sought-i.e.,[ ] records 'memorializing' the investigation in question ....\" Defs.' Reply at 6 (\"Having received precisely the records they requested, and having waived any challenge to redactions or withholdings in those records, plaintiffs are not suffering any cognizable injury that is redressable under FOIA.\"). As noted, however, NARA's assertion that the records from the Office of the Inspector General were the only records responsive to the plaintiffs' FOIA request is derived, at least in part, from the searches conducted by NARA's Office of General Counsel, Equal Employment Opportunity Office, and Office of Human Capital. Scanlon Decl. \u00b6 20. But the Court concludes that it has insufficient information to assess the adequacy of those searches, and if additional searches wind up being necessary, there remains the possibility that NARA might find additional responsive records.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Absent additional information about the searches conducted by NARA's Office of General Counsel, Equal Employment Opportunity Office, and Office of Human Capital, the Court is unable to determine whether these searches were adequate. Accordingly, consistent with this Circuit's precedent, NARA shall identify the search terms that the staff members in these offices used to search their electronic records, as well as the reason for any differences in the record systems they searched.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Reporters Comm. for Freedom of Press\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264644\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/399/#p403\">\n     877 F.3d at 403\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Scanlon's search was therefore limited to \"NARA's non-OIG operational records ....\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264644\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/399/#p403\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     As noted,\n     <em>\n      supra\n     </em>\n     p. 409, the plaintiffs concede that the search conducted by NARA's OIG was adequate.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-40\">\n     The plaintiffs also take issue with the fact that the Office of General Counsel, Equal Employment Opportunity Office, and Office of Human Capital \"provided differing levels of detail with respect to the various electronic repositories that were searched but provided no discernable reason for that distinction.\" Pls.' Opp'n at 5. The Court needs more detail from NARA to assess this argument. Although Scanlon does not expressly say so, his declaration suggests that the electronic repositories searched by these offices differed at least in part because the plaintiffs' FOIA request specified repositories that they wanted NARA to search, not all of which appear to be used by every office that conducted a search. Scanlon Decl. \u00b6 13;\n     <em>\n      see also id.\n     </em>\n     Ex. A at 1 (listing record systems to be included in NARA's searches). For example, Scanlon contacted the Office of General Counsel about the repositories identified as NARA 18: General Law Files, NARA 28: Tort and Employee Claim Files, and NARA 32: Alternate Dispute Resolution Files, which the plaintiffs requested be searched.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     Scanlon did not, however, identify any repositories associated with the Equal Employment Opportunity Office, presumably because none of the repositories identified by the plaintiffs are used by that office, but the declaration is unclear on this point.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 13. Moreover, Scanlon indicated that he contacted the Office of Human Capital about searching NARA 17: Grievance Records,\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     , but there is no other reference to this repository in the declaration. The declaration states that the Office of Human Capital searched the \"Employee Relations\" database because that database was \"where any potentially relevant records would have been located.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     \u00b6 15. Scanlon does not explain, however, whether the \"Employee Relations\" database is the same as NARA 17; nor does he explain why NARA 17 was never searched.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
