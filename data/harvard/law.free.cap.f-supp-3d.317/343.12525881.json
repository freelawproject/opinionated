MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The resolution of this case depends on the meaning of the word \"is.\" The Plaintiff, Security University (the \"University\"), which trains information technology and cybersecurity professionals, obtained a grant from the Department of Labor. The Defendants, officials for the Department of Labor and the Department itself (collectively, \"DOL\"), terminated the grant after the University lost its accreditation. The DOL asserted that to be eligible for the grant, the University must be an institution of higher education that \"is accredited\" throughout the term of the grant. Because the University lost its accreditation halfway through the grant period, the DOL concluded that the University was no longer eligible and that the grant should be terminated. The University challenges the DOL's position as arbitrary and capricious, arguing that the University only needed to be accredited at the time of the grant award. The University further challenges as arbitrary and capricious the deadline imposed by the DOL for the University to regain accreditation. The parties' cross-motions for summary judgment are now ripe for adjudication. Upon consideration of the pleadings, relevant law, related legal memoranda in opposition and in support, and the entire record, the Court finds that the relevant statutes required the University to maintain its accreditation throughout the term of the grant and that neither the DOL's decision to terminate the grant nor its deadline for the University to regain accreditation were arbitrary and capricious. Accordingly, the Plaintiff's motion will be denied and the Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgement will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In early 2013, the DOL published notice of a coming award of funds under the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training grant program.

Thus, an \"eligible institution[ ]\" for a grant must be an \"institution of higher education\" that \"is accredited.\" The Dictionary Act makes clear that \"words used in the present tense include the future as well as the present.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The \"is\" in \"is accredited\" is in the present tense, and by operation of the Dictionary Act, includes the future as\n   well. It follows that \"is accredited\" requires a continuous state of being accredited which persists into the future, meaning here that the University must have maintained its accreditation throughout the term of the grant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For Congress, all our yesterdays and tomorrows are today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The University also argues that continuous accreditation was not a requirement of the grant because it was not specified in the grant announcement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. 4. However, the University agreed to \"fully comply with the following regulations,\" including \"29 CFR Part 95,\" J.A at 11, which permits a grant officer to terminate an award if a \"recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2095.61\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 95.61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or \"suspend or terminate the current award\" for \"materially fail[ing] to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2095.62\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 95.62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Clearly, disqualification as an eligible institution under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202371\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as explained above, is a failure to comply with applicable federal statutes. The University's claim that the statutory requirement of continuous accreditation was not a term of the grant is not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, the University argues that a requirement of continuous accreditation is inconsistent with the DOL's conduct during this dispute. The University claims that the DOL permitted the University \"to remain unaccredited and continued funding for a number of months until [the DOL] improperly terminated the grant on February 8, 2016.\" Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. 10, ECF No. 35. The record and pleadings, however, evidences the contrary. The DOL suspended the University's grant effective September 16, 2015. J.A. at 69. The University itself seeks reimbursement for unpaid expenses from September 16, 2015 through the date of the Amended Complaint amounting to over $1.2 million. Am. Compl. \u00b6 48. In any event, evidence of the DOL's clemency towards the University over a period of months does not undermine the Court's statutory interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Given that the DOL acted within its authority to suspend and terminate the University's grant for remaining unaccredited by the set deadline, the question becomes whether the DOL acted arbitrarily and capriciously in setting a January 1, 2016 deadline for the University to regain accreditation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The deadline was not arbitrary and capricious: it gave the University nearly a year from the time the Council denied its appeal and over 16 months from the time the Council first revoked accreditation to cure its lack of accreditation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. at 36, 74. Although there is no set timeframe for determining what is or is not arbitrary and capricious, these timeframes are consistent with analogous circumstances. For example, the Department of Education may give an institution no more than one year to cure non-compliance\n   with an accreditation requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20602.20\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 602.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(i). While that regulation was not promulgated by the DOL, that timeframe is instructive and militates against the assertion that the deadline was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The University argues that an institution is barred from seeking accreditation from another accrediting agency for two years after losing its accreditation, and therefore, the shorter timeframe allowed by the DOL to regain accreditation was arbitrary and capricious. Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. 8 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.11\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ). This argument is unconvincing and bewildering. First, the University does not explain how this regulation-an Education regulation-applies to the circumstances at hand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the University's assertion is directly contradicted by the fact that it applied for, was evaluated, and received accreditation from MSA well within the two year period that it was supposedly barred from seeking accreditation from another entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. at 36 (letter from the Council stating that the University's accreditation was revoked as of August 21, 2014),\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.11\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.11\">\n    at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (letter from MSA dated February 19, 2016 notifying the University of accreditation). In addition, the record shows that the University applied to MSA for accreditation before November 17, 2015, further evidencing that the University's argument could not possibly be true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.11\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.11\">\n    at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (letter from MSA dated November 17, 2015 accepting the University as a candidate for accreditation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Instead, the situation here is analogous to a scenario in which a police officer issues a warning to a driver operating a vehicle with an expired license. The driver is in violation of the law, and the police officer is within his authority to issue a ticket for the violation. If the same officer stops the same driver the next day, and the day after that, but only issues a ticket to the driver on the fourth day, the driver can hardly complain that he was given insufficient time to cure his non-compliance with the law or that the officer's repeated warnings somehow call into question the legitimacy of the law, when the officer would have been fully justified in writing a ticket on the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, the DOL did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to extend its deadline to accommodate the University's late accreditation, nor not to recognize\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   the University's re-accreditation after the University's deadline for compliance had passed and after the DOL sent a termination notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. for Summ.
