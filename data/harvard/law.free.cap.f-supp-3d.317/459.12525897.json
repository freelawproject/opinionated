The relevant events occurred on December 4, 2017, when two Metropolitan Police Department (\"MPD\") officers approached Gorham at the Woodland Terrace apartment complex. At first Gorham ignored them, looking instead at his cell phone, but, as soon as one of the officers addressed him, Gorham fled. After a brief chase, an officer tackled him. Seconds later,\n   another officer frisked Gorham while he was still pinned on the ground, and that frisk revealed a handgun. Based on that evidence and evidence that Gorham had a prior felony conviction, Gorham is charged with one count of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). He moves to suppress the gun and statements that he made after the police caught him, arguing that the officers lacked reasonable suspicion to seize and to frisk him. For the reasons explained below, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court has reviewed Defendant's motion, Dkt. 5, the government's opposition, Dkt. 6, the government's supplemental brief, Dkt. 14, and Gorham's response to the government's supplemental brief, Dkt. 20. The Court held an evidentiary hearing on April 16, 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minute Entry (Apr. 16, 2018), and heard oral argument on May 18, 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minute Entry (May 18, 2018). A further evidentiary hearing was held on June 7, 2018, to hear from the officer who frisked Gorham,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minute Order (May 21, 2018); Minute Entry (June 7, 2018), and the Court heard further oral argument on June 29, 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minute Entry (June 29, 2018). Cornel Kelemen, one of the MPD officers present at Gorham's arrest, testified at the initial evidentiary hearing and footage from his body-worn camera was admitted into evidence as Government's Exhibit 1. Footage from the body-worn camera of Officer Artavius Williams was introduced into evidence as Government's Exhibit 2. Minute Order (June 8, 2018). Officer Michael Moshier, who frisked Gorham, testified at the June 7, 2018 hearing. Minute Entry (June 7, 2018). Footage from his body-worn camera was introduced into evidence as Government's Exhibit 6. Where not otherwise noted, the facts described below are derived from the Court's review of the body-worn camera videos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 4, 2017, Kelemen and three other MPD officers were on patrol near the 2300 block of Ainger Place, S.E., in the District of Columbia. Dkt. 22 at 19. All were members of the MPD's Seventh District Crime Suppression Team, Dkt. 5 at 2, a specialized unit that does not answer radio calls but, instead, goes \"to areas that have higher call volume, that have citizen complaints for drug activity, things like that.\" Dkt. 22 at 5.

His body-worn camera was on, but nothing meaningful is visible outside the vehicle. A second officer with a body-worn camera, Artavius Williams, was seated in the rear of the car on the passenger's side. Williams's video also shows little of what is occurring outside of the vehicle. Taken together with Kelemen's testimony,\n   however, the Court finds that, as the police car drove slowly down an alley toward the courtyard, the officers \"observed a group of individuals\"-more than five, less than ten-standing together in the area between the buildings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The government elsewhere describes Gorham's movements as \"blading his body away from the officers\" and \"walking without swinging his right arm.\" Dkt. 6 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At that point, Kelemen and two of the other officers exited their vehicle. Gorham and a man in a red sweatshirt continued walking away from the group of people toward a concrete path running between several apartment buildings. Gorham had a cellphone in his left hand, which appeared to occupy his attention as the officers approached. He walked slowly away from them. Although it is not clear from the video whether Gorham kept his right arm from swinging as he walked, it does show that his right side was turned away from the officers. Around this time Kelemen and Williams activated their body-worn cameras, triggering the recording of sound and preserving the two minutes of footage that led up to the initial in-person encounter. As the officers drew close to the two men, Gorham's view shifted back and forth between his phone and the police. Kelemen called out, \"How're you doing gentlemen? Happy holidays.\" At that point, Kelemen was only a few feet from Gorham, who stopped and raised his cell phone in his left hand, turning toward Kelemen. Gorham looked up from the phone momentarily, before turning to his right and sprinting away down the concrete walkway. None of the other individuals in the courtyard fled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Kelemen and Williams immediately gave chase. They said nothing to Gorham as they followed him at a full run down the pathway and around two apartment buildings. After about thirty seconds, Williams caught Gorham by his hair and pulled him to the ground. Once Gorham was on the ground, Williams handcuffed him with the assistance of Kelemen and the two other members of the patrol, all of whom arrived within a few seconds of Williams pulling Gorham to the ground. Moshier patted Gorham down after he had been handcuffed, and felt a weapon on Gorham's right thigh, inside of his pants. Dkt. 22 at 28-29. The officers loosened Gorham's belt and pulled down that side of his pants, revealing a handgun just below his waist on his right side. As Gorham was being handcuffed, he also said \"I've got weed on me,\" but no drugs were seized.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The police then ran the gun's serial number and Gorham's name through electronic databases, which showed that the gun had been reported stolen and that Gorham had a previous felony conviction. Dkt. 6 at 2. The officers arrested Gorham, who was charged in the D.C. Superior Court on January 10, 2018. On January 22, 2018, Gorham was arraigned in this Court, and, at that time, the D.C. charges were dropped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant's motion raises three issues. First, he challenges the legality of the\n   seizure of his person, arguing that Officer Williams lacked the reasonable suspicion required to conduct a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968). Second, although not set forth as a separate ground for suppression in his motion, Gorham's arguments raise the question of whether the frisk that Moshier conducted after Gorham's seizure was lawful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, because Gorham at times describes his motion as seeking to suppress physical evidence\n   <em>\n    and statements\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 5 at 1;\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (seeking only \"to suppress the firearm recovered on December 4, 2017\"); Dkt. 5-1 at 1 (same), the Court considers whether Gorham's statement \"I've got weed on me,\" made after he was seized, should be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court \"held that an officer may, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, conduct a brief, investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\"\n   <em>\n    Wardlow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n    528 U.S. at 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An officer making such an investigatory stop, however, \"must be able to articulate more than an 'inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \"hunch' \" of criminal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n    at 123-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Court in\n   <em>\n    Wardlow\n   </em>\n   applied the standard for reasonable suspicion articulated in\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   to hold that \"unprovoked,\" \"[h]eadlong flight\" in combination with \"presence in an area of expected criminal activity\"-elsewhere referred to in the opinion as a \"high[-]crime area\" or \"area of heavy narcotics trafficking\"-suffices to justify further investigation through a brief detention.\n   <em>\n    Wardlow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n    528 U.S. at 124-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Gorham's flight from the police occurred in a high-crime area, the Court concludes that the seizure of his person did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Each of Gorham's arguments to the contrary is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   First, Gorham disputes the characterization of his flight as \"unprovoked\" because Officer Kelemen was \"within two feet of\" Gorham when he fled. Dkt. 5 at 6. Gorham suggests that he was, in fact, the target of the police's approach and that Kelemen \"clearly ha[d] manifested his physical presence and ... direct[ed] it toward\" the defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He offers no support for the proposition that such actions somehow prevent the police from drawing the inference approved of by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Wardlow\n   </em>\n   . Although that opinion does not define what sort of flight falls under the aegis of \"unprovoked,\" the D.C. Circuit has observed that the Supreme Court \"str[uck] an explicit contrast between a person's 'right to ignore the police and go about his business' and 'unprovoked flight upon noticing the police.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Stubblefield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310500,4256143\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/445/\">\n    820 F.3d 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 451 (D.C.

The body-worn camera footage in this case reveals nothing unusual or aggressive about the approach of the police officers that would have prevented a reasonable person from continuing to \"go about his business.\" Gorham was free to walk away from the police-as indeed he did at first and the man in the red sweatshirt continued to do-and need not have\n   spoken with them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Conversely, the police were free to approach him and to attempt to engage him in conversation. His decision to sprint away from the officers as soon as one drew close enough to engage in such an exchange was more than \"a mere refusal to cooperate\" and represents the sort of unexplained, \"headlong flight\" contemplated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Wardlow. See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n    528 U.S. at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Second, Gorham asserts that the criminal activity the police have identified as occurring in the area where he was seized is of a different kind than the criminal activity at issue in\n   <em>\n    Wardlow\n   </em>\n   . He offers no legal basis, however, for drawing a distinction between \"an area known for heavy narcotics trafficking\"-as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Wardlow\n   </em>\n   -and an area suffering from a \"recent spate of gun violence\"-as was the case here. Dkt. 5 at 5. Nor does the case law support such a distinction.

At the evidentiary hearing held on April 16, 2018, the government presented two types of evidence in support of its characterization of the apartment complex as a high-crime area. First, it offered the testimony of Officer Kelemen regarding his own experiences in the area as a member of a special crime suppression team. Second, it provided a list of crimes recently committed in the area that Kelemen and another officer assembled using the MPD's database of police reports. Dkt. 22 at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Taken together, the testimony of Officer Kelemen-who patrolled the area on a near daily basis-and the report adequately establish that the apartment complex at issue is a \"high-crime area\" within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Wardlow\n   </em>\n   . There is significant narcotics activity in the area, Dkt. 22 at 10-11; the officers in Kelemen's unit frequently recover guns in the area (including two prior recoveries by Kelemen himself),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11; Kelemen has been personally involved in the arrests of more than ten people in the area,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9; gunshots are common in the area,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13; and relative to other areas within Kelemen's district, it has a higher than average number of \"illegal gun arrests\" and amount of gun violence,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. Government's Exhibit Five (as corrected,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 13 at 2) supports Kelemen's belief that the vicinity of the apartment complex has experienced a high degree of gun-related crime. In the thirty days preceding Kelemen's interaction with Gorham, there were four reports of gunshots, two reports of bullets striking property, an armed robbery, four assaults involving guns, and two incidents involving possession of unlicensed pistols in the area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Government's Ex. 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 22 at 17-19. Although the government has not offered any detailed comparison of crime in other neighborhoods or areas, the Court notes that on an absolute scale, the amount of crime in the weeks prior to Gorham's seizure was substantial. Indeed, the crime suppression team had been dispatched to the area on the day of Gorham's arrest at least in part because of a recent spate of gunshots. The Court further credits the testimony of Officer Kelemen that the apartment complex stood out among those within his patrol area as a frequent site of gun violence and drug distribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At oral argument, Gorham added a different twist to his argument, noting that the evidence of illegal gun use in the area involved activity occurring at night, while Gorham was seized in the late afternoon. He offers no support, however, for the proposition that the treatment of an area as a \"high-crime\" area for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Wardlow\n   </em>\n   depends on whether the flight and the past crime occurred around the same time of day. To be sure, time of day can factor into an officer's reasonable suspicion.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Absent much more than Gorham has offered, however, the time of day does not preclude an officer from reasonably\n   relying on an individual's decision to turn and flee when approached in a high-crime area, even if that criminal activity often occurs (or is often detected) later at night. To hold otherwise would run counter to the approach taken by the D.C. Circuit,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Laing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3475958,10527975\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/889/281/\">\n    889 F.2d at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing \"the 'high-crime' nature of the area\" and \"the time of day\" as separate considerations within the reasonable suspicion analysis, and not referencing any temporal element to the former);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cir. 1993) (same), and to the commonsense notion that drugs, guns, and other contraband do not simply appear and disappear as the sun sets and rises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that, because Gorham took headlong flight without provocation upon the approach of police officers in a high-crime area, the officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop. That conclusion is buttressed by the additional indicia of suspicious activity Gorham displayed. First, as officers approached the area, Gorham immediately walked away from a larger group of people while observing the police and while all but one of the remaining members of the group took no action. Second, his body language while leaving the group-in particular his failure to swing his right arm, his apparent effort to keep his right side facing away from the police, and his focus on his cell phone while ignoring the approaching officers-appeared indicative of firearm possession to an officer with special training in identifying armed individuals. Third, even though a second individual also walked away from the group, Gorham alone took flight as soon as Kelemen addressed him. At oral argument, Gorham's counsel stressed that this conduct is fully consistent with innocent or \"everyday\" behavior. May 18, 2018 Hrg. Tr. (Rough at 12:15-13:6). The Supreme Court, however, rejected a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    Wardlow\n   </em>\n   , holding that \"ambiguous\" conduct that is \"susceptible of innocent explanation\" can nonetheless support a reasonable suspicion when considered in light of \"the totality of the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Wardlow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n    528 U.S. at 125-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Fourth, Kelemen observed that, as Gorham ran, he at times failed to \"swing his right arm fully\" and \"a couple of times ... held [his right arm] for a second as if he's checking something or adjusting something while he's running.\" Dkt. 22 at 43-44. Although the body-worn camera footage is too choppy to confirm or refute this testimony, the Court finds that Kelemen's testimony was credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Gorham's final objection to the\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop rests on the fact that, even if Kelemen had reasonable suspicion to seize Gorham, Kelemen is not the officer that seized him. Gorham notes that the case law requires the reasonable suspicion inquiry begin with \"what facts were known to the officer\" at the time of the seizure,\n   <em>\n    United States v. McKie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521288,3494064\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/951/399/\">\n    951 F.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 402 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (per curiam), and argues that, because Williams-the seizing officer-did not testify, the facts known to him remain unclear. Although the Court would have benefited from hearing from Williams, the Court does not agree that his testimony was essential. As the D.C. Circuit has explained, \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   standard [is] one of objective reasonableness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521288,3494064\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/951/399/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That means that the Court is \"not limited to what the stopping officer says or to evidence of his subjective rationale; rather [the Court] look[s] to the record as a whole to determine what facts were known to the officer and then consider[s] whether a reasonable officer in those circumstances would have been suspicious.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521288,3494064\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/951/399/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Assuming for the sake of argument that Williams-situated mere feet away-saw\n   <em>\n    none\n   </em>\n   of the specific, suspicious movements described by Kelemen, the record makes clear that Williams still possessed sufficient information to support an investigatory stop. First, as shown by his pursuit of Gorham and his body-worn camera footage, Williams was fully aware that Gorham had taken headlong, unprovoked flight. Second, Kelemen's testimony regarding the high-crime reputation of the area leaves little doubt that this fact was widely known to the officers who patrolled the area. Kelemen testified, for instance, that the crime suppression team of which he and Williams were both members regularly responded to the area, was patrolling in the area after receiving ShotSpotter reports of gunfire, and was well aware of the criminal activity occurring in the area.

First, it suggests that headlong, unprovoked flight in a high-crime area, without more, supports a frisk upon apprehension.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4227422\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/142/49/#p56\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Rough at 3:21-4:3) (\"[F]light in a high-crime area ... give[s] an officer reasonable suspicion to stop and do a protective pat down, which is exactly what happened in this case.\"). At least on the present record, the Court is unconvinced. As\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   held, a protective pat down or frisk is a search, and whether a search is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment is distinct from whether a seizure that precedes such a search is reasonable.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There will of course be cases in which the justification for the seizure supplies the justification for the search-when, for example, an individual is stopped because the officers have reasonable suspicion to believe the individual recently committed or is about to commit a crime that often involves a weapon,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Bullock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5637681,3567975\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/342/\">\n    510 F.3d at 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nor is that omission surprising, since the government and the courts typically point to some additional indicia of risk to the safety of the police or others. As noted above, for example, the D.C. Circuit did not rest its decision upholding the search in\n   <em>\n    Dykes\n   </em>\n   exclusively on the defendant's flight from the police in \"an area 'known for the sales of cocaine and marijuana.' \" 406 F.3d at 720. To be sure, the court found that the defendant's flight was sufficient to justify his stop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But, when it came to the search, the court added that \"it was reasonable for the officers to fear that\" the defendant \"had a weapon in his waistband\" because he \"kept his hands near his waistband\" and resisted the officers' \"efforts to move his hands into plain view.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Here, the government fails to identify any such additional information that was available to Moshier, who testified that he merely believed that Gorham was \"concealing\n   <em>\n    some sort of\n   </em>\n   illegal contraband or [was the subject of\n   <em>\n    some sort of\n   </em>\n   ] a warrant.\" Dkt. 23 at 18 (emphasis added). As a result, the Court is left to consider without any relevant precedent, and without sufficient factual development, whether Gorham's flight alone justified Moshier's decision to conduct a frisk. Given these shortcomings, and in light of the Court's ultimate holding, the Court declines to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The government's second argument also raises an unsettled issue, but one that\n   can be resolved on the record currently before the Court. In its supplemental brief, the government argues that the doctrine of \"collective knowledge\" permitted Moshier to rely on facts known to other officers in forming his suspicion that Gorham was presently armed and dangerous, even though Moshier himself was unaware of the facts on which those officers' suspicion was based.

But the central premise of the decision is both persuasive and applicable to the facts of this case. At the time of the search, an officer present at the scene who was duty bound to act believed that the defendant possessed a gun and, therefore, posed a risk to that officer and others. The only reason that officer failed to conduct the search, moreover, was simply that another \"member of the team moved too swiftly.\"\n   <em>\n    Ragsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"261834\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/470/24/\">\n    470 F.2d at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If he had not done so, the officer who believed the defendant possessed a gun \"would surely have commanded it, or would have ... performed [the search] himself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"261834\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/470/24/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Unlike in the typical \"horizontal\" collective knowledge case,\n   <em>\n    Ragsdale\n   </em>\n   does not require a post-hoc aggregation of information among officers; rather, an officer with all the required information was present and \"it is clear the search would imminently and lawfully have been made.\" LaFave, Search and Seizure, \u00a7 3.5(c) (internal quotation marks omitted). As a result, the principal concerns raised in\n   <em>\n    Massenburg\n   </em>\n   are not present and the purposes of the exclusionary rule would not be served by excluding the evidence.

Kelemen was in possession of all the knowledge necessary to justify a protective frisk of Gorham and had, by chasing and helping to handcuff Gorham, \"indicat[ed] his mind had operated upon those facts so as to conclude that he could or should\" conduct a further investigation of Gorham. LaFave, Search and Seizure, \u00a7 3.5(c). He was working closely with three other officers, who had observed him pursue Gorham. Immediately upon the seizure of Gorham, the officers begin discussing what to do next, working together to handcuff him. These facts demonstrate a team working closely together as part of an investigation, and an officer (Kelemen) who was duty-bound to conduct a frisk-or to see to it that others conducted a frisk-the moment the defendant was secured. Unlike most \"horizontal\" collective knowledge cases, no aggregation is required in the present\n   case-one of the officers present and personally involved in the seizure of Gorham possessed all of the information necessary to support the frisk. Although he did not communicate his concern to Moshier, it is inconceivable that Kelemen would have sat by while the handcuffs were removed from a suspect who he believed to be armed without first ensuring that that his suspicion was allayed. \"The fact that one member of the team moved too swiftly,\"\n   <em>\n    Ragsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"261834\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/470/24/\">\n    470 F.2d at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and began the search before a directive could be given or Kelemen himself could frisk Gorham is of no moment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court's conclusion that Kelemen \"would surely have\" directed his colleagues to conduct a frisk, or \"would have ... performed it himself,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"261834\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/470/24/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , moreover, is bolstered by footage from the officers' body-worn cameras. That footage shows Kelemen personally involved in restraining Gorham, and it shows that as soon as Gorham was turned over, a large object can be seen on the right side of his thigh, where, according to Kelemen's testimony, he already believed Gorham had hidden his gun. Dkt. 22 at 43-44. In short, the Court is convinced that, if given another moment, Kelemen would have either communicated his concern or would have frisked Gorham himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, the Court notes that, as in\n   <em>\n    Ragsdale\n   </em>\n   , there is no evidence that Moshier or any of the other officers acted in bad faith. The Court has heard testimony from both Moshier and Kelemen and has reviewed the footage from the body-worn cameras used by Moshier, Kelemen, and Williams. This evidence, which depicts in detail the events surrounding the search, supports the conclusion that Moshier acted on a good faith belief that he possessed a reasonable suspicion that Gorham was armed and dangerous. The Court declines to reach the question whether that belief was in fact reasonable, and a good faith mistaken belief could not, of course, justify a search. But it is evident that Moshier was not attempting to justify an unlawful search based on the uncommunicated observations of his fellow officers. The presence of bad faith would compel a different result from the one the Court reaches here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although it is unclear whether the\n   <em>\n    Ragsdale\n   </em>\n   rule is best understood as a variation on the collective knowledge doctrine or as an exception to the exclusionary rule akin to the inevitable discovery rule, the soundness of the rule in the unique circumstances presented in\n   <em>\n    Ragsdale\n   </em>\n   , and here, \"is not open to serious question.\" LaFave, Search and Seizure, \u00a7 3.5(c).

The Court further concludes, moreover, that the gun discovered during Moshier's pat down of Gorham need not be suppressed. Finally, the Court concludes that Gorham's statement regarding marijuana after he was seized was spontaneous, and thus need not have been preceded by\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings to be admissible. The Court, accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's motion to suppress physical evidence and statements.
