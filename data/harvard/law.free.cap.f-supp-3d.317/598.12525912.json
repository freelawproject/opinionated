FRIEDRICH, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Concord Management and Consulting LLC moves to dismiss the indictment on the ground that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed unlawfully by Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Dkt. 36. The Court will deny Concord's motion. The Special Counsel's appointment complies with the Constitution's Appointments Clause because (1) the Special Counsel is an \"inferior Officer\"; and (2) Congress \"by Law vest[ed]\" the Acting Attorney General with the power to make the appointment. U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   First, the Special Counsel is an inferior officer because he is directed and supervised by the Acting Attorney General. Although the Special Counsel regulations may not permit the Acting Attorney General to countermand certain decisions made by the Special Counsel, the Special Counsel remains subject to the Acting Attorney General's plenary supervision: the Acting Attorney General has the discretionary power to rescind or revise the regulations; moreover, the Acting Attorney General effectively has the power to remove the Special Counsel at will, either via the regulations or by rescinding or revising the regulations. Second, Congress vested the Acting Attorney General with the power to appoint the Special Counsel. Even though no statute explicitly authorizes the Acting Attorney General to make the appointment, Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent make clear that the Acting Attorney General has the necessary statutory authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Concord's secondary arguments also fail. The appointment does not violate core separation-of-powers principles. Nor has the Special Counsel exceeded his authority under the appointment order by investigating and prosecuting Concord. Accordingly, and for the reasons stated below, the Court will deny Concord's motion to dismiss the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Office of the Special Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the Watergate era, special prosecutors were appointed through executive-branch regulations. In 1978, Congress enacted the Ethics in Government Act, which allowed for the appointment of a special prosecutor later renamed the \"independent counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 95-521, \u00a7 601(a) (1978);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ethics in Government Act Amendments of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-409, \u00a7 2 (1983). Under the Act, if the Attorney General determined that certain investigations or prosecutions were warranted, the Attorney General applied to a special three-judge court, which then selected and appointed an independent counsel. Pub. L. No. 95-521, \u00a7 601(a). In the face of a constitutional challenge, the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act were upheld in\n   <em>\n    Morrison v.

The provisions expired in 1999, and Congress declined to renew them. Then-Attorney General Janet Reno testified before the Senate, \"The Independent Counsel Act is structurally flawed and ... those flaws cannot be corrected within our constitutional framework....

Concord, however, raises strong arguments that \u00a7 533 does not confer the authority at issue here. First, the provision refers to \"officials,\" not \"officers.\" Although the two words share the same root and overlapping definitions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Investigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525704\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/315/602/#p623\">\n    315 F.Supp.3d at 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203688461\">\n    2018 WL 3688461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *31, they are not necessarily synonyms.

This definition may connote the subservience and lesser authority associated with a mere employee, functionary, or agent. In contrast, an \"officer\" holds the more substantial responsibility of an \"office of trust, authority, or command,\" not simply that of an \"office.\" Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary (1963).
