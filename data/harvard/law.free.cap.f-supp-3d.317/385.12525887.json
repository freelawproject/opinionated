COLLYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Air Transport Association of America, Inc. and the International Air Transport Association challenged a Final Rule issued by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) within the United States Department of Agriculture. The Final Rule set fees for checking international aircraft for unwanted pests, including an additional amount for a \"reserve.\" The Court agreed that the adoption of the Final Rule as to the reserve was problematic and remanded that portion of the Final Rule to APHIS for further rulemaking. Now the Plaintiffs move to reconsider the Court's order, particularly the remand of the reserve portion of the Final Rule without vacatur. They also ask the Court to impose a schedule for further rulemaking by the agency and ask that the Court certify part of its opinion for interlocutory review. Specifically, Plaintiffs ask the Court to certify for immediate review the question of whether APHIS violated the Administrative Procedure Act when it determined to apply the fee for commercial aircraft to passenger aircraft without explaining inconsistencies in the rulemaking record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court finds that: (1) the reserve portion of the Final Rule is properly remanded without vacatur; (2) a deadline and schedule for periodic status reports shall be imposed; and (3) certification for interlocutory appeal is not warranted. Thus, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Plaintiffs' motion to amend the March 28, 2018 Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.
