Plaintiffs seek conditional certification solely for the purpose of sending notice to potential class members. Therefore, at this time, the Court is only concerned with whether Plaintiff and the proposed class are similarly situated with respect to a common policy or plan established by Defendant that allegedly violates the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Betancourt v.

Conditional Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs claim Defendant violated the FLSA's overtime provisions by improperly classifying salaried CMEs as exempt, requiring them to work over 40 hours per week, and failing to pay them an overtime premium for this work. The Court must first determine whether an adequate showing has been made at this first step so that the Court may conditionally certify a class and authorize notice to potential class members. Plaintiffs move for conditional certification of the following group of employees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant's current and former nonsupervisory employees who worked more than 40 hours in at least one workweek over the past three years, who were paid a salary, and whose job duties included (1) asking members standardized questions to collect data for care assessments, (2) inputting answers to those questions into Defendant's computer systems, (3) coordinating care by performing such ministerial tasks as arranging appointments, referrals, and obtaining necessary authorizations from members, and (4) supplying members with additional information and resources to educate members concerning their health plan needs, or other similar work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff's Reply in Support of Their Motion for Notice to Potential Plaintiffs and Conditional Certification (\"Plaintiffs' Reply\"), [ECF No. 55], at 2-3; First Amended Complaint, [ECF No. 18], \u00b6 27. According to Plaintiffs, this definition specifically includes all salaried, nonsupervisory CMEs that worked in Defendant's Care Coordination Department that Defendant reclassified as non-exempt in December of 2017:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Behavioral Health] Clinical Care Coordinator, Care Coordination Auditor, Care Coordination Clinical Auditor, Care Coordinator Support Specialist, Care Coordinator, Complex Case Manager, Community Care Coordinator, Community Health Outreach Worker, Eligibility Specialist, and Nurse Clinical Specialist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff's Reply, [ECF No. 55], at 3. Plaintiffs also move for notice to salaried \"Inpatient Review Nurses,\" \"Utilization Management Care Coordinators,\" and \"Medicare/Medicaid Benefit Care Coordinators.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201548964\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court will not at this time authorize notice to Behavioral Health Clinical Care Coordinators, Care Coordination Auditors, Care Coordination Clinical Auditors, Complex Case Managers, Eligibility Specialists, or Nurse Clinical Specialists. There are no declarations from current or former employees with these job titles. The only evidence Plaintiffs have submitted in support of their contention that these positions should be included in the class definition is a slide from a PowerPoint presentation, which shows only that these positions are part of the \"Care Coordination Department,\" and were reclassified from salaried employees to hourly employees as of December 25, 2017. [ECF No. 40-1]. This is not enough, even under the lenient standard applied at this stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Betancourt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201548964\">\n    2011 WL 1548964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (\"Even under this lenient standard ... the factual showing required to meet the similarly situated standard is not a 'mere formality.' \"). Simply because a position falls under the umbrella of the \"Care Coordination Department\" does not mean it involves \"Care Coordination\" or \"Utilization Management\" duties, as evidenced by the affidavit of Carolyn Rossi, the Senior Director of Care Coordination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   However, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of a \"modest factual showing\" with respect to the remaining job titles: Care Coordinator, Community Care Coordinator, Community Health Outreach Worker, Utilization Care Coordinator, Care Coordinator Support Specialist, Medicare/Medicaid Benefit Care Coordinator, and Inpatient Review Nurse. Sworn declarations submitted in support of Plaintiffs' Motion indicate that the primary duties of current and former CMEs with these job titles consisted of data collection, data entry, care utilization, plan education, and care coordination. Plaintiffs' Brief, [ECF No. 40], Exs. B-T, each at \u00b6 1. According to these declarants, these job duties did not involve the exercise of independent clinical judgment, providing traditional nursing care in a clinical setting, or providing direct medical care to members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. These declarants say they performed their work in accordance with Defendant's policies, procedures, guidelines, and guidance embedded in Defendant's\n   computer software.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. Defendant provided training on how to use these decision-making tools to perform the work in a consistent manner, and the employees were not permitted to significantly deviate from Defendant's guidelines in performing their work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant does not dispute that Care Coordinators were classified as exempt employees and were not paid overtime. Rather, it contends that these employees have different job functions and the state and federal contracts that these employees work under are significantly different. Defendant's Response, [ECF No. 48], at 8. But \"plaintiffs can be similarly situated for purposes of the FLSA\" even when \"there are distinctions in their job titles, functions, or pay.\"\n   <em>\n    Jirak v.

Muzingo Affidavit, [ECF No. 48-1], \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8; Rossi Affidavit, [ECF No. 48-2], \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15.

Class Definition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant first argues that the class Plaintiffs seek to notify is too broad, and proposes limiting the notice to Care Coordinators, Community Care Coordinators, and Utilization Management Care\n   Coordinators who work in Illinois. Defendant's Response, [ECF No. 48], at 20-21. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As discussed above, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden with respect to seven specific job titles. Further, the Court sees no reason to limit the collective to Illinois employees only. The declarations submitted by Plaintiffs in support of their Motion include employees from both Illinois and Michigan, and Defendant has not offered any substantive argument as to why the collective should be limited to employees who worked only in Illinois. Notice is authorized to those who are encompassed by the collective action that the Court has conditionally certified as set forth above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Opt-In Period\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs request that putative members of the collective action be given sixty (60) days to opt-in to this lawsuit. Plaintiffs' Brief, [ECF No. 40], at 11. Defendant does not address this issue. Therefore, the Court will permit a 60-day notice and opt-in period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Reminder Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs also request that the Court authorize the issuance of reminder notice to all collective members. Plaintiffs' Motion, [ECF No. 39], at 1. Defendant does not address this issue. However, because the Court is permitting Plaintiffs to issue notice in multiple forms, including those discussed below, the Court concludes that a reminder is not necessary in this case. If Plaintiffs' counsel learns of evidence that the authorized methods of issuing notice are ineffective and has reason to believe that sending a reminder will address that deficiency, counsel should so inform the Court and this issue can be revisited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hudgins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207426135\">\n    2016 WL 7426135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (\"Absent any evidence that notice via first-class mail and e-mail is ineffective, these additional forms of notice are unnecessary and overly intrusive.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Potential plaintiffs who want different counsel are \"free to file [their] own lawsuit,\" instead of opting into the suit, as the proposed notice already explains. [ECF No. 40-21, at 2].

In her First Amended Complaint [ECF No. 18], Plaintiff alleged she worked as a Care Coordinator from approximately August 2014 to January 2016. First Amended Complaint, [ECF No. 18], at \u00b6 17. However, her declaration, executed in February 2018, indicates she continues to be employed by Defendant as a Community Care Coordinator. Slaughter Declaration, [ECF No. 40-11], at \u00b6 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    As of the date of this Memorandum Opinion and Order, Declarants Ciara Smith and Angela Harris [ECF Nos. 40-4 and 40-10] have not opted into this lawsuit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Rossi states that Care Coordination Auditors and Clinical Care Coordination Auditors do not perform \"Care Coordination\" or \"Utilization Management\" duties. Rossi Affidavit, [ECF No. 48-2], \u00b6 11. Plaintiffs say, if this is true, they are willing to withdraw their request for Step One Notice for these two auditor positions. Plaintiffs' Reply, [ECF No. 55], at 3-4. On this record, there is no reason for the Court not to take Rossi's statement as true.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Defendant's argument proves too much. Plaintiffs presumably also gave Defendant their home or other mailing addresses for the purpose of securing employment, and courts routinely approve mailed notice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Plaintiffs' Motion, worded differently than the Memorandum in Support, seeks \"a computer-readable data file containing the names, last known mailing addresses, last known personal and work email addresses, mobile telephone numbers, social security numbers (for those notices returned undeliverable), and work locations for all collective members.\" Plaintiffs' Motion, [ECF No. 39], at 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
