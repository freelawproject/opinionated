Doc. No. [59]. Kani has also filed a motion to seal an affidavit submitted by\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Seok Hwi Cha (\"Cha\"). Doc. No. [66]. The Court addresses the motion to seal first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. MOTION TO SEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In conjunction with Plaintiff Cha's response to Kani's motion for summary judgment, he filed a document that contains his own affidavit, his responses to Kani's interrogatories, spreadsheets with his calculation of overtime owed to him, and a settlement letter from Kani.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [65]. At issue here is the settlement letter. Kani moved to seal the document because the settlement letter is marked \"HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL\" and is inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 408. Doc. No. [66]. Rule 408 prohibits using any evidence of settlement offers to establish the amount of a disputed claim. Fed. R. Evid. 408(a). As Cha submits the settlement letter in an attempt to prove the value of his case, it is inadmissible as evidence. Therefore, the Court finds good cause to maintain Cha's document under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Finally, Kani asks the Court to enter summary judgment on Plaintiff Cha's claims for unpaid break time, unpaid tips, and unpaid taxes (to the extent that Plaintiff Cha intends to assert these claims), because there is no factual or legal basis for such claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1.

Doc. No. [59-1], p. 3, \u00b6 13. However, Kani fails to show that Plaintiff's primary duty required the type of invention, imagination, originality or talent described in the FLSA and the Code of Federal Regulations. Kani describes Cha's duties as follows: he \"regularly interacted with customers and created unique dishes for his customers based on their specific requests,\" he \"prepared unique sushi dishes and offered creative suggestions\" about menu items, and he \"had the opportunity to express himself artistically through the creation of his sushi dishes and through his role in assisting to create the sushi menu.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11, 12. Viewing these facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff Cha, the Court cannot say no dispute of fact exists regarding Cha's classification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Kani has established that Cha's job involved customizing dishes for customers and offering menu suggestions. However, taken in the light most favorable to Cha, this could simply mean that he substituted avocado for cucumber at a customer's request and that he gave suggestions that were not necessarily acted on. The Code of Federal Regulations makes clear that a creative professional's\n   <strong>\n    primary\n   </strong>\n   duty must\n   <strong>\n    require\n   </strong>\n   invention, imagination, originality, or talent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.300\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Kani's undisputed facts do not show that Cha's \"creative\" contributions were his primary duty, nor that his job required such contributions. Nothing in the facts presented by Kani establishes that Cha was a \"truly original chef\" who \"regularly created unique dishes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Outside Sales and Computer Employees,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022122\">\n    69 Fed.

Rather, the evidence viewed most favorably to Cha shows he was a typical sushi chef, preparing dishes listed on the menu that were created by someone else and responding to customers' requests to make changes to those dishes. A reasonable jury could find that Kani misclassified Cha under the FLSA.

Therefore, the salary that he received already compensated him for his regular rate of pay and calculating unpaid overtime at the one-half rate would be appropriate. Kani's motion for summary judgment on the issue of half-time back pay is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Waiver of Breach of Contract Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Kani asserts that Plaintiff Cha \"has waived the right to assert [a breach of contract] claim by failing to complain when he received less salary than he alleges he was entitled to and by accepting the lesser payment for the entirety of his employment.\" Doc. No. [59-4], p. 18. While it will be Plaintiff Cha's burden to establish the elements of a breach of contract claim at trial, it is Kani's burden to establish any affirmative defense to that claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Stamp Art, Inc. v. U.S. Postal Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3352752\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/1270/#p1274\">\n    456 F.3d 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1274 (11th Cir. 2006). Therefore, Kani must produce affirmative evidence to show that no reasonable jury could find in Cha's favor. Kani fails to meet that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To establish that Cha waived a breach of contract claim, Kani must show that the only reasonable explanation for Cha failing to complain about the difference in his pay is that he intended to waive such a claim.\n   <em>\n    MNM 5, Inc. v. Anderson/6438 Northeast Partners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"841534\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/215/407/#p410\">\n    215 Ga. App. 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 410,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"841534\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/215/407/#p410\">\n    451 S.E.2d 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (\"A party may by his conduct waive a legal right but where the only evidence of an intention to waive is what a party does or forbears to do, there is no waiver unless his acts or omissions to act are so manifestly consistent with an intent to relinquish a then-known particular right or benefit that no other reasonable explanation of his conduct is possible.\"). As the only fact that Kani offers to support its argument is that Plaintiff Cha accepted his pay without complaining to management, the Court cannot say that a jury could not find any other reasonable explanation for his behavior. Cha may not have complained because he feared being fired, or did not think he needed to complain before bringing a breach claim, or any number of other reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Kani has not produced enough affirmative evidence to establish as a matter of law that Cha waived his breach of contract claim. Therefore Kani's motion for summary judgment on the issue of waiver is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4. Other Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, Kani seeks summary judgment on Cha's \"other potential claims,\" such as unpaid break time, unpaid tips, and unpaid taxes. Doc. No. [59-1], pp. 19-20. Kani asserts that Plaintiff \"admitted in his deposition that he does not have any basis\" for such claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Furthermore, Kani contends that Cha is not entitled to recover unpaid tips because he was not a\n   tipped employee and was paid significantly higher than the minimum wage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Kani first points to an \"admission\" of a lack of evidence on Cha's part. However, an examination of the deposition testimony cited by Kani reveals that it does not fully support Kani's interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [60], pp. 26-27; 41-42; 43-45. In response to questions regarding tips, breaks, and taxes, Cha repeatedly said, \"I don't know well,\" and \"I do not remember.\" In fact, these refrains were Cha's answer to almost every question in his deposition. The facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to Cha, and construing \"I don't know well\" to mean \"I have no evidentiary basis for my claims\" is a stretch. The Court cannot say that Cha admitted he has no basis for his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Furthermore, it is not entirely clear whether Cha is attempting to bring independent claims for unpaid breaks and unpaid taxes, or whether his statements are simply related to his overtime and breach of contract claims. Neither the FLSA nor Georgia law requires employers to provide meal or rest breaks, and federal tax law holds employees responsible for paying their withholding taxes where an employer fails to do so. Thus, as independent claims, these claims cannot succeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   However, whether or not Cha took breaks for which he was not paid, impacts calculating Cha's regular rate for his overtime claims. Additionally, whether or not Kani agreed to pay taxes on his behalf relates to Cha's breach of contract claim. Despite the confusing nature of Cha's response to Kani's motion for summary judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   he does put forth factual evidence. Cha's response includes sections titled \"DESCRIPTION OF DEFENDANT'S FALSE STATEMENT\" and \"THE PLAINTIFF'S STATEMENT OF FACTS,\" which the Court roughly construes as a response to Kani's statement of facts and Cha's own statement of facts. Doc. No. [64], pp. 7-9; 10-18. The evidence included in these sections shows Cha working from \"Open\" to \"Close\" five days a week.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Kani generally operated from 11:30 a.m. (or 12:00 p.m. on weekends) to 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. every day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Calculating the number of hours Cha worked each day requires knowing, in part, whether or not any break time should be deducted. Cha also states that Kani deducted money from his pay for taxes, but did not pay that money to the Internal Revenue Service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. If Kani agreed to pay Cha $2800 per month and to deduct taxes from that amount, then its failure to pay these taxes is relevant to Cha's breach claim. To the extent that breaks and taxes are relevant to Cha's overtime and breach of contract claims, he may present evidence on such matters at trial. However,\n   to the extent they are intended as independent claims, Kani's motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Kani's argument regarding Cha's claim for unpaid tips also warrants summary judgment. The tip provisions of the FLSA apply to employees when the employee makes less than the minimum wage and the employer takes the tip credit.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malivuk v.

Ga. July 26, 2016). No evidence in the record suggests that Kani took the tip credit for Plaintiff Cha. Thus, Kani's request for summary judgment on claims regarding unpaid tips is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The motion is granted with respect to calculation of overtime damages at the half-time rate and to any independent claims for unpaid breaks, tips, or taxes. The motion is denied with respect to Cha's classification as a creative professional and as to waiver of his breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The parties are\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   to file their consolidated pre-trial order within\n   <strong>\n    thirty (30) days\n   </strong>\n   of the entry of this order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NDGa LR 16.4.

He did, however, filed a response that includes sections titled, \"DESCRIPTION OF DEFENDANT'S FALSE STATEMENT\" and \"THE PLAINTIFF'S STATEMENT OF FACTS.\" Doc. No. [64], pp. 7-9; 10-18. The Court has the authority to overlook a party's failure to comply with Local Rule 56.1 and to consider materials in the record other than those cited by the parties.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.

Therefore, to the extent that Cha did not refute Kani's facts, the Court deems each unrefuted fact admitted, unless it found the fact was not supported by the record citation.

Cha also failed to file a response to Kani's statement of undisputed facts or his own statement of additional facts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    NDGa LR 56.1.B(2). His response spends many pages outlining his opinions about this lawsuit and alleged illegal acts on Kani's part for which no private right of action exists. For example, Cha accuses Kani of hiring undocumented workers.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. [64], pp. 3-7. While this information may be of interest to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the Internal Revenue Service, the Court is not aware of any federal statute that provides individuals a private right of action against employers who hire illegal immigrants or pay them cash under the table without withholding taxes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Kani notes in its reply brief that Cha did not cite to record evidence in his response brief.
