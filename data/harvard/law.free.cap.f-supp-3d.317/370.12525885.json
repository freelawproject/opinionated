Plaintiff alleges that copies of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's e-mails were, for a time, stored on flash drives in a safe inside the law office of her private attorney, David Kendall of Williams &amp; Connolly, LLP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1, at \u00b6\u00b6 8-10. Through this lawsuit, Plaintiff seeks from Defendant, the United States Department of State, \"all records about [the] decision\" to allow \"David Kendall to maintain potentially classified State Department records at his [law] firm.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After Defendant made a series of rolling productions of documents to Plaintiff, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. One of the issues the parties disputed in their cross-motions was the adequacy of the State Department's search for responsive records. After Judge Amy Berman Jackson remanded a nearly identical case (\n   <em>\n    James Madison Project, et al., v. Department of State\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-cv-1478) back to the State Department to conduct further searches, the Court denied both parties' motions for summary judgment in this case without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 31, 2017 Order, ECF No. 32. The Court held that because Defendant had been ordered to conduct additional searches and prepare additional declarations with respect to the FOIA request in the matter before Judge Jackson-which Defendant had treated as identical to the request in this case-it only made sense for Defendant to provide those same documents and declarations to the Plaintiff in this case as well, and for the parties to then brief summary judgment again after that had occurred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. After the Court's Order, Defendant made additional rolling productions to Plaintiff while the parties filed intermittent Joint Status Reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties have now filed a Joint Status Report in which they represent that no further document productions need occur in this case, and that the Court need not issue an opinion on the adequacy of Defendant's searches.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Status Report, ECF No. 38. The parties further represent that only a narrow set of disputes remain regarding the propriety of withholding of documents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. These disputes had already been briefed in relation to the parties' previously-denied summary judgment motions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The parties ask the Court to rule on these disputes on the basis of their previously-filed briefs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Both parties agree that after the Court has made these rulings, this case will be fully resolved. This Memorandum Opinion addresses the parties' remaining disputes and resolves this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon consideration of the pleadings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the relevant legal authorities, and the record for purposes of this motion, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment for Defendant and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment for Plaintiff.

Second, Plaintiff argues that Defendant has improperly withheld non-privileged information from certain other documents under FOIA Exemption 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court rejects Plaintiff's arguments with respect to both categories of information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Public-Domain Doctrine\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   First, Plaintiff argues that the State Department improperly \"withheld information from five emails-C05963262, C05963195, C05998332, C05998335, and C05963193-which was previously made public through an official and documented disclosure.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 10.

Exemption 5 does not apply only to correspondence sent within a single agency. It expressly applies to \"inter-agency\" as well as \"intra-agency memorandums or letters.\" \u00a7 552(b)(5). Moreover, the deliberative process privilege in particular \"covers deliberative, pre-decisional communications\n   <em>\n    within the Executive Branch\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Sec. Archive v. C.I.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280867,4307381\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/460/\">\n    752 F.3d 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 462 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (emphasis added). It is not limited to communications only within one agency within the Executive Branch. Accordingly, the fact that this document constitutes a communication between members of two agencies does not preclude the application of the deliberative process privilege. This is especially so where, as here, the two agencies were\n   apparently communicating for the purpose of sharing their relative expertise in an attempt to reach a quality decision. This is precisely the type of conduct that the deliberative process privilege seeks to protect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nor is there any authority that Plaintiff has presented to the Court, or that the Court is aware of, that would prevent the State Department from asserting this privilege even though State was not the intended sender or recipient of the draft letter. Similarly, Plaintiff provides no authority for his claim that Defendant must submit a declaration from officials from the other agencies involved. Pl.'s Mem. at 12. The Court can discern from the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index and declaration Defendant has already submitted that the deliberative process privilege applies. Nothing more is required. Defendant is entitled to summary judgment with respect to this document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   2. C05963395 and C05963377\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, document C05963395 is \"an inter-agency e-mail exchange from the [National Archives and Records Administration] General Counsel to the Department of Justice, which was then forwarded to [Department of State] attorneys, regarding a letter to David E. Kendall from the [Department of State] Inspector General's Office regarding information pertaining to [a] preservation order.\"\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 33. Document C05963377 is \"an inter-agency e-mail exchange from the [Department of State] Deputy Legal Adviser to the [National Archives and Records Administration] General Counsel and the Department of Justice, regarding a letter from [the Department of State] to FBI Director Comey.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. In both documents, the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index states that \"the [Department of Justice] and [Department of State] attorneys discuss what information to include in an upcoming court filing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33, 34. Portions of both documents were withheld under Exemption 5 pursuant to the deliberative process, attorney-client, and attorney work product privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index makes clear that the disputed portions of both of these documents were properly withheld. Little discussion of this point is required. Both documents contained communications of legal advice sent from government attorneys to their clients. They are both deliberative and are both work product in the sense that they discuss what approach should be taken to an upcoming court filing. They are clearly privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The focus of Plaintiff's argument with respect to these documents is that it was improper for the State Department to redact text that was originally written by a National Archives and Records Administration attorney (as opposed to a State Department attorney).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 13. This argument goes nowhere. As an initial matter, Defendant has represented that in fact the redacted text at issue in document C05963377 was not written by a National Archives and Records Administration attorney, as Plaintiff postulated, but instead by a Department of Justice attorney. Regardless, even assuming that the portions of the documents were written by an attorney outside of the State Department as Plaintiff contends, that simply does not defeat the assertions of privilege. Legal advice does not lose its protected status simply because it incorporates statements from outside sources. Attorney work product and attorney-client communications do so routinely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, to the extent Plaintiff argues that the partial withholding of these documents required a declaration from National Archives and Records Administration or Department of Justice officials, the Court rejects that argument. The declaration and\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index in this case are sufficient to\n   demonstrate why the withholdings were proper. Defendant is entitled to summary judgment with respect to these documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that the narrow set of withholdings still at issue in this case were proper. Accordingly, summary judgment will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   for Defendant and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   for Plaintiff, and this case will be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .

In other words, the parties dispute whether or not there are certain FOIA exemptions to which the public domain doctrine categorically does not apply. The Court need not resolve this aspect of the parties' dispute. For the purposes of this Memorandum Opinion, the Court assumes that the public domain doctrine\n    <em>\n     can\n    </em>\n    apply to withholdings under any FOIA exemption. The doctrine simply\n    <em>\n     does not\n    </em>\n    apply here because the withheld information was never made public.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Plaintiff argues that\n    <em>\n     Students Against Genocide\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Muslim Advocates\n    </em>\n    are distinguishable because the disputed documents in those cases were shown but not given to the outside parties in question. Pl.'s Mem. at 10-11. Here, Mr. Kendall was not merely shown documents. Information in the disputed e-mails was actually sent to him. This distinction does not change the Court's conclusion. In a similar way that the limited disclosures in\n    <em>\n     Students Against Genocide\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Muslim Advocates\n    </em>\n    did not make the disputed information truly public because the information was made available to only a discrete group of individuals and not the general public, sending the disputed information in this case only to the personal attorney of the former Secretary of State simply is not enough to make the information \"public.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
