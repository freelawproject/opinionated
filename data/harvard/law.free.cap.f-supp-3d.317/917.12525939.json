in response, the military raided his home and made more threats against his person and his family.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The two events that finally convinced Mr. Gutierrez-Soto to flee Mexico were him noticing that he was being followed by persons he believed to be affiliated with the Mexican military and a friend warning him that the military intended to kill him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thus, Petitioners presented themselves at the United States border and applied for admission on June 16, 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, Petitioners were deemed inadmissible because they did not have valid entry documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, after being processed for expedited removal, Petitioners claimed fear of returning to Mexico and were interviewed by an asylum officer on June 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The asylum officer found that\n   Petitioners had a credible fear of persecution, so Petitioners were placed in detention until a decision could be made on whether to parole them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   After spending months in detention,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioners were paroled as arriving aliens with a credible fear of persecution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Due to Petitioners not having valid entry documents when they appeared at the border, they were placed in removal proceedings and charged as inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In accordance with their status as parolees, though, Petitioners were placed on the non-detained docket, and their hearing before an immigration judge was originally set for January 21, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, due to a series of delays, Petitioners' hearings were reset a number of times and finally occurred in November and December of 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 19, 2017, the immigration judge issued his order denying Petitioners' applications for asylum and ordered them removed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 21, Petitioners appealed the immigration judge's decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (the \"BIA\"), but the BIA dismissed the appeal as untimely on November 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the dismissal of their appeal, Petitioners filed an emergency motion to stay removal with the immigration judge, which was denied on November 17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioners also filed a request for a stay of removal with ICE, which was denied on December 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   On that same day, Petitioners reported to their previously scheduled meeting with ICE and were taken into custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   After being taken into custody on December 7, ICE placed Petitioners in a vehicle and proceeded towards the El Paso/Juarez border.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, before Petitioners could be deported that day, the BIA granted them a stay pending consideration of their motion to reopen filed on November 20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 22, the BIA granted Petitioners' motion to reopen and reinstated their appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nevertheless, despite the reinstatement of their appeal, Petitioners have remained in detention since ICE took them into custody on December 7, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 6, 2018, Petitioners filed the instant habeas petition asserting the following: 1) a Substantive Due Process claim under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, 2) a Procedural Due Process claim under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, 3) an Equal Protection claim under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, 4) a Freedom of the Press claim under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, 5 ) a Freedom of Speech claim under the First Amendment\n   to the United States Constitution, and 6) a claim under the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequent to filing their habeas petition, Petitioners received some good news. On April 17, the University of Michigan invited Mr. Gutierrez-Soto to join the Knight-Wallace Fellowship class of 2018-19, an esteemed program for journalists that offers a $75,000 stipend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, on May 15, the BIA remanded Petitioners' asylum claim back to the immigration judge for consideration of new evidence and the issuance of a new decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, Petitioners' positive developments do not dispose of this cause or moot the instant motion. Thus, the Court must address Respondents' contentions that it lacks jurisdiction and that Petitioners' claims are meritless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a threshold matter, there is a dispute regarding whether the Court has jurisdiction over this case.

Respondents further contend that such a challenge is barred on jurisdictional grounds by statute. Mot. at 6-10. However, Petitioners contest Respondents' characterization of the case. Petitioners counter that the Court has jurisdiction because they are merely challenging the constitutionality of their detention. Resp. at 6-9, ECF No. 27. For the following reasons, the Court holds that it has jurisdiction over all of Petitioners' claims except for their APA and Procedural Due Process claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the center of this dispute over jurisdiction are the statutory provisions precluding judicial review of the Attorney General's discretionary decisions.

Since Congress has not provided an alternate and effective substitutionary remedy as is mandated under the Suspension Clause, such an interpretation would throw the constitutionality of the REAL ID Act into question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124606\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/372/#p381\">\n    430 U.S. at 381-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124606\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/372/#p381\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In essence, Petitioners ask the Court to review whether Respondents properly weighed the factors and determined them to be flight risks; Sections 1226(e) and 1252(B)(ii) bar exactly that sort of review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

For example, while \"securing the border\" has an adverse impact on Mexican immigrants, it also affects other immigrants coming from other nations in Central and South America. Further, the Court is reluctant to read discriminatory animus into an administration's discretionary decisions based solely upon the president attempting to\n   enact an agenda at the center of his campaign.

This is significant because it is before the immigration judge issued the removal order in July 2017, which became final in August 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 15. Moreover, Mr. Gutierrez-Soto criticized ICE and the government in a very public manner while accepting a prestigious award from the National Press Club. Pets.' Brief at 28 (accusing United States immigration authorities of \"bartering away international law\" with regard to asylum seekers). His arrest occurred only a couple months later. Finally, William McCarren, the Executive Director of the National Press Club, affirms under oath that an ICE official told him to \"tone it down\" during a meeting regarding Mr. Gutierrez-Soto, and he interpreted the comment in the context of the conversation to mean that the media should stop attracting attention to Petitioners' cause. Writ, Ex. 47 \u00b6 15, ECF No. 1-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Taking all of this evidence into account, Petitioners have offered enough evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Respondents violated their First Amendment rights. Petitioners have offered evidence that allows for an inference that they were targeted before their asylum case was denied and ICE officials did not approve of the negative press that Petitioners were generating. Drawing these inferences in favor of Petitioners, the nonmoving party, there is support for Petitioners' claim that Respondents retaliated against them for asserting their free press rights. This is also sufficient evidence for the trier of fact, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Petitioners, to conclude that Respondents' reason for detaining Petitioners is a pretext.

Further bolstering Petitioners' case is evidence of Respondents' alleged pattern of conduct. Petitioners list five other vocal activists who, like Mr. Gutierrez-Soto, were allegedly targeted between December 2017 and January 2018 by ICE. Resp. at 30-31. Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Petitioners, the evidence could establish that Respondents retaliated against immigrant activists who criticized the government's policies. For example, the ICE official's comment towards Bill McCarren could be taken as evidence that ICE disapproves of negative publicity. When that is taken in conjunction with ICE's alleged pattern of targeting other immigration activists after they spoke out and Mr. Gutierrez-Soto being detained shortly after he spoke out, there is enough evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Respondents retaliated against Petitioners for Mr. Gutierrez-Soto's comments.
