Substantive Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case concerns an alleged pattern of fraud committed by a group of interrelated individuals and corporations on apartment construction projects around the country. Plaintiffs are funds created to bankroll the apartment construction projects. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 16(a)-(h) ). They are managed by Continental Properties (\"Continental\"). (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 17). Defendants George Albertelli and his son David Albertelli (collectively, the \"Albertellis\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   own ACI, which is a commercial construction company. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 1, 18). George also has an ownership interest in MFDC, a shell\n   company. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 19, 24). David controls or owns\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Foundation, a shell company;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 KMM, a subcontracting company;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 National, a subcontracting company;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Team CCR, LLC, a subcontractor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Westcore I, a general contractor; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Westcore II, a shell company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 820, 121, 134-35, 153). David is also the trustee and beneficiary of US Construction, which owns part of Westcore I. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Brooke Kozlowski is an officer and owner of ACI, Foundation, Westcore I, and Westcore II. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 21). Amy Butler was or is ACI's accounting manager. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 26). Kevin Burke is the Chief Financial Officer and agent of Foundation, and an agent of MFDC and Westcore II. (Doc. 117 \u00b6 at 27). Kerry Heltzel was or is an accountant for ACI, Westcore I, Westcore II, and Foundation. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 29). John Salat was or is an officer of Westcore I, has represented that he is Westcore I's owner, and is an owner of Westcore II. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 28). Angelo Eguizabal (\"Eguizabal\") is the former Vice President of Construction at Continental, and the creator and owner of Bravo 21, LLC (\"Bravo 21\"), a shell corporation. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   From 2011 to 2017, Albertelli-affiliated companies were awarded over $200,000,000.00 in apartment construction contracts, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 An August 22, 2013, contract between Plaintiff Continental 245 Fund LLC (the \"Lexington Fund\") and ACI for a project in Lexington, Kentucky (the \"Lexington Project\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 On April 25, 2014, contract between Plaintiff Continental 298 Fund LLC (the \"Savage Fund\") and ACI for a project in Savage, Minnesota (the \"Savage Project\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 A November 21, 2014, contract between Plaintiff Continental 306 Fund LLC (the \"New Braunfels Fund\") and ACI for a project in New Braunfels, Texas (the \"New Braunfels Project\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 A February 20, 2015, contract between Plaintiff Continental 332 Fund, LLC (the \"Fort Myers Fund\") and ACI for a project in Fort Myers, Florida (the \"Fort Myers Project\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 A June 23, 2015, contract between Plaintiff Continental 326 Fund LLC (the \"Rochester Fund\") and ACI for a project in Rochester, Minnesota (the \"Rochester Project\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 A January 19, 2016, contract between Plaintiff Continental 355 Fund LLC (the \"Bryan Fund\") and Westcore I for a project in Bryan, Texas (the \"Bryan Project\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 A February 19, 2016, contract between Plaintiff Continental 347 Fund LLC (the \"Waco Fund\") and Wesctore I for a project in Waco, Texas (the \"Waco Project\"); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 A July 16, 2016 contract between Plaintiff Continental 342 Fund LLC (the \"Longmont Fund\") and Westcore I for a project in Longmont, Colorado (the \"Longmont Project\") ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 44(a)-(h) ). Each Project was allegedly completed defectively. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 44(a)-(h) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While securing and undertaking the Projects, Defendants allegedly engaged in a wide swath of intentionally fraudulent activity (the \"Scheme\") \"designed to extract as much money as [they] could, as quickly as [they] could, without regard to contractual performance or any lawful right to payment.\" (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 52-53). Because it is alleged the Scheme was carried\n   out by a bevy of Defendants, on eight Projects, and over the course of six years, the Court summarizes the facts according to the type of actions alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    1. Bribery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Beginning in 2014, the Albertellis purportedly paid Eguizabal to provide them with internal Continental information and to persuade Continental to award construction contracts to Albertelli-affiliated entities. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 75, 80). From May 2013 to May 2014, the Albertellis used a third-party company to transfer at least thirteen payments totaling $244,724.20 to Eguizabal's bank account. (Doc. 117 at 66). During this time, the Lexington and Savage Projects were awarded to ACI. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 44(a)-(b) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Then, from July 2014 to August 2016, the Albertellis, Burke, and Kozlowski formed MFDC as a shell company, and the Albertellis and ACI used it to funnel at least $669,302.00 to Eguizabal. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 67-8). During this stretch, Continental awarded the New Braunfels, Fort Myers, Rochester, Bryan, Waco and Longmont Projects to ACI and Westcore I. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 44(c)-(h) ). In May 2016, Eguizabal also formed his own company, Bravo21, to receive payments. (Doc. 117 at 69). The Albertellis, ACI, MFDC, Burke and Kozlowski then occasionally sent Eguizabal's payments to Bravo21, amounting to at least $50,000.00. (Doc. 117 at 69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Eventually, the payments became so commonplace that David, Kozlowski and Salat included a line item for Eguizabal on the Waco, Bryan and Longmont Projects. (Doc. 117 at 69-70). In total, over $1,464,735.00 was funneled to Eguizabal from 2011 to 2017, which was financed through misrepresentation of costs on the Projects, including amounts due to subcontractors. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 75, 78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    2. Other Albertelli Entities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Westcore I\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After ACI entered into a number of contracts with Continental, it performed its duties poorly and deliver Projects late. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 44(a)-(e) ). As a result, Continental internally decided to avoid awarding future contracts to ACI. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 7). To continue seeking Continental contracts, David convinced his acquaintance Gregory Hilz to form a general contracting company called Westcore I. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 22, 89, 91). David and Hilz agreed to joint ownership of Westcore I, but David concealed his ownership and control. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 86-87, 89). David later stated that Westcore I would be funded by including an extra $240,000.00 in the price of the Fort Myers Project. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   David then invented a fictitious business history for Westcore I to bolster its chances of securing additional Continental contracts. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 92). This included falsifying a sworn qualification statement with Hilz and Kozlowski, which was submitted in November 2015. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 93, 101). Among the allegedly false representations, were\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 A statement in the Qualification Statement that Westcore I was formed in 1992, even though it was formed in February 2015;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 A statement in the Qualification Statement that Westcore I performed an average of $376,196,476 worth of work over the previous five years, even though it had existed for less than two months at the time;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 A certification by Westcore I's Chief Financial Officer, Michael Breaton, that the facts in the Qualification Statement were true, even though Michael Breaton does not exist;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 A financial statement representing Westcore I had total assets of more than $69,000,000.00;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 A letter from a surety representing Westcore I had a bonding capacity of $325,000,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 85, 97-99). Westcore I was then granted the Bryan, Waco and Longmont Projects. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 44(f)-(h) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Westcore II\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   After Westcore I began to secure construction contracts, David, Salat, Kozlowski, Burke, and Foundation formed Westcore II. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 138-39). Westcore II (Westcore Construction, L.L.C.) is very similar in name to Westcore I (Westcore Construction, LLC). (Doc. 117 at 5). Plaintiffs allege David, Salat, Kozlowski, Burke, Heltzel, and Foundation used the nearly identical names to mislead Continental and direct it to make payments to Westcore II (instead of Westcore I) for the Waco, Bryan, and Longmont Projects. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 140-144). The diversion of payments from Westcore I eventually resulted in subcontractors imposing more than $8,000,000.00 in liens on the Projects. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 145-46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    3. Fraud\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    ACI's Savage Project Change Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In early 2015, the Savage Project fell behind schedule and ACI was subjected to contractually-mandated liquidated damages. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 113). The parties then agreed to a change order where ACI accepted responsibility for $401,780.00 in liquidated damages in return for an extension of the deadlines to turn over some buildings and continued progress payments. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 114). Despite this agreement, David, Kozlowski, and ACI later demanded that the Savage Fund pay for ACI's alleged costs due to the delays that ACI itself had caused. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 116). David, Kozlowski, and ACI then attempted to leverage Savage Fund by slowing the already-delayed Project and threatening not to complete the work. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 117). ACI also filed a lien on the property that included the delay-related damages ACI had previously accepted as its responsibility. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 118). The entire process allowed ACI to obtain extended construction deadlines and to receive payments it would not have otherwise have received, while the Savage Fund was forced to defend itself against the lien claim. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 120).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    ACI's Involvement with National Framing on the Fort Myers Project\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In November 2016, David, on behalf of ACI, executed a payment application for $1,072,397.64 for work done on the Fort Myers Project. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 121,124). Part of the application represented National Framing was due a $60,673.14 payment for subcontracting services, and thereafter the balance due to it would be $364,783.75. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 122). Notably, David owns both ACI and, through Foundation Management, National Framing. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20, 31-32). The Fort Myers Fund then relied on the application and paid ACI $1,072,397.64, with the requested $60,673.14 earmarked for National Framing. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 124). Four months after that, George signed a Claim of Lien and an Affidavit representing National Framing was due $581,470.90, which was $216,687.15 more than ACI had previously represented was owed. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 125-26). The Fort Myers Fund was then forced to procure a lien bond to as collateral for the lien claim. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 127).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    ACI's Involvement with National Framing on the Rochester Project\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While working on the Rochester Project, ACI subcontracted with KMM, which is\n   owned by David through Foundation Management, and National Framing. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 33, 136). David failed to disclose his interest in KMM and National Framing. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 136). ACI then allegedly failed to pay for services rendered, causing KMM and National Framing to impose liens on their work, and to sue the Rochester Fund. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 136).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Team CCR\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   While working on the Longmont Project, David, Salat, Kozlowski, Foundation, Westcore II, and Heltzel used a system of self-dealing to profit from subcontracted work. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 147-48, 159). In substance, Westcore I received $2,083,723.71 for subcontracting services on the Project. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 160). But, in actuality, Westcore I subcontracted with a company called Consolidated Resources for $1,805,450.55. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 160). Consolidated Resources then informed both Continental's project manager and Westcore I that it intended to change the company name to Team CCR. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 149-150). David, Salat, Kozlowski and Burke then seized on the Team CCR name and formed a company called Team CCR, LLC (\"Albertelli Team CCR\"). (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 151). Using an online portal, Albertelli Team CCR input payment application data as if it was performing the work, while Consolidated Resources submitted paper-based payment applications to Westcore I. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 153). This allowed Albertelli Team CCR to masquerade as if it were Consolidated Resources, and concealed that Consolidated Resources had been subcontracted for less than the amount allocated by the Longmont Fund for the Project. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 154-55, 160). In sum, Albertelli Team CCR pocketed $278,273.16, which was the difference between the amount granted to Westcore I for the subcontracting services and the subcontracting agreement with Consolidated Resources. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 160). Westcore I also failed to pay Consolidated Resources, which resulted in Consolidated Resources recording a mechanic's lien on the Longmont Project. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 161).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    Westcore I's Involvement with Peale &amp; Associates\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   While working on the Waco Project, Westcore I submitted a sworn payment application for $3,241,194.33 for siding and framing labor. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 164). But it then subcontracted that work to Framing USA, a company also owned by David through US Construction Trust, who then sub-subcontracted it to a third company, Peal &amp; Associates, for $1,907,000.00. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 165-66). Westcore I then defaulted on its work on the Waco Project and was terminated in June 2017. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 171). By that time, the Waco Fund had paid Westcore I $2,325,864.35 for the work, which was $418,864.35 more than it had been sub-subcontracted for. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 171-72). Westcore II, David, Salat, Kozlowski, Foundation Management, and Burke benefitted from the overpayment. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 172). Then the Waco Fund had to complete the Waco Project for more than the budgeted cost. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 173).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    4. Theft\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In December 2016, David improperly deposited thirty-five checks worth over $2,000,000.00 into ACI's bank account. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 182, 196, 205). The Fort Myers and Rochester Projects made the checks out jointly to ACI and the individual subcontractor the payment was meant for. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 184-85, 187, 189-90, 194, 199-201). As is customary in the construction industry, ACI was supposed to endorse the check and deliver it to the subcontractor, creating a paper trail showing payment. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 184). But instead of forwarding the checks to the subcontractors, David deposited them into\n   ACI's bank account. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 182, 184, 196, 205, 209). Then, through David, Kozlowski, and Butler, ACI mailed lien releases or waivers to the subcontractors that had performed the work and used parcel tracking numbers to indicate it had distributed the checks. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 185, 190, 195, 197-201, 203). Allegedly, ACI, David, Kozlowski, and Butler knew the Fort Myers and Rochester Funds would be induced to issue checks based on ACI's representations, and never intended to send the joint checks to the subcontractors. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 206-07). George knew about the theft, profited from it, and tried to retain the stolen money. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 211). Though Continental's bank reimbursed the amounts transferred to ACI's bank, ACI returned none of the money. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 211).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Fort Myers, Savage, New Braunfels and Rochester Funds filed a Complaint against David and ACI in January 2017. (Doc. 1). After Defendants moved to Dismiss, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint against the Defendants, along with Eguizabal and Bravo 21. (Doc. 49). Defendants again moved to dismiss. (Docs. 80; 81; 82; 83; 84; 85; 86; 87; 88). Before the Court could enter an Order on the then-pending motions, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed Eguizabal and Bravo 21. (Doc. 93).

The court there noted that although the claim seemed to track with \u00a7 1962(c), the defendants were \"clearly entitled to have notice of which specific provisions of \u00a7 1962 plaintiffs [were] relying on.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3587065\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/569/1575/#p1581\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    Ralston\n   </em>\n   , however, is not the law of the land.

As evidence, they cite paragraph 214, which alleges, \"[e]ach Defendant is part of the [Scheme], had knowledge of one or more predicate acts committed by the [Scheme], conspired to commit or committed one or more predicate acts, or has knowingly agreed to the commission of one or more illegal predicate acts by the\n   [Scheme].\" (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 214). They claim that to achieve requisite notice, Count 1 should allege each Defendant's specific acts, including whether the Defendant conspired to commit, committed, or knowingly agreed to the commission of predicate acts. But this argument fails because Rule 8(d)(2) states that \"a party may set out [two] or more statements of a claim\" and that such a claim will survive if \"any one of them is sufficient.\" Plaintiffs are well within the law to allege in the alternative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Returning to substance, Count 1 alleges each Defendant's specific acts. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 216-252). It also states that the acts giving rise to the claims were part of the same pattern because they were committed to further the Scheme. (Doc. 117 at 52-53). Moreover, Defendants' Motion to dismiss addresses Count 1's claims in relation to each subsection of \u00a7 1962, and indicates no prejudice or confusion regarding the current state of the allegations. Consequently, the mere fact that Count 1 contains multiple causes of action is not grounds for dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Defendants argue that even if pleading multiple claims in the same count is permissible here, Count 1 should still be dismissed because it improperly combines the claims of eight separate plaintiffs. While this argument does not fit into a\n   <em>\n    Wieland\n   </em>\n   shotgun pleading type, Defendants cite to the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.\n   </em>\n   , to argue that the claims of separate plaintiffs must be alleged in separate counts.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3640232\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/516/955/\">\n    516 F.3d 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 980 n.57 (11th Cir. 2008). This misconstrues\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   .

But it is not. Rule 10(b) -the basis for that footnote-is a flexible standard that turns on whether pleading multiple claims in one count advances or hinders the interests of clarity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CIV. P. 10(b). Other courts have found that the interests of clarity can be advanced by joining multiple plaintiffs in a single claim based on a pattern of behavior that caused injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Erickson v.

And so it is here. Count 1 alleges Defendants participated in a clear and individualized pattern of behavior over a course of time. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 52-54). Each Defendant's actions are spelled out, as is how each Plaintiff was affected. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 216-252). These factors, and the fact that the Scheme was perpetrated by several Defendants against several Plaintiffs, in several locations, over several years, indicate that the interests of clarity are served by including multiple Plaintiffs in Count 1. A different conclusion would lead to a duplicative and unwieldy pleading that would benefit neither the parties nor the interests of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Still, Defendants contend that even if their prior arguments do not prevail, Count 1 should be dismissed as a shotgun pleading because it joins all Defendants into one count. This argument\n   casts Count 1 as the fourth type of shotgun pleading identified in\n   <em>\n    Wieland\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054943\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1313/#p1320\">\n    792 F.3d at 1323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, like the ones before it, Defendants' argument fails. The Court does not read\n   <em>\n    Wieland\n   </em>\n   to prohibit all instances where a count lodges a claim against multiple defendants, but rather only where such a claim fails to provide Defendants with adequate notice of the claims against them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weiland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054943\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1313/#p1320\">\n    792 F.3d at 1323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

They claim the Albertellis started the Scheme and that it grew to include each of the Defendants. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 51). The alleged purpose of the Scheme was to obtain Continental construction contracts \"by bribery, [to] obtain payments for work that [was] not done or [was] deficient, and [to] add unfounded costs to construction projects to ensure that the maximum price\n   [was] paid.\" (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 53). Through these actions, the Scheme aimed to \"extract as much money as it could, as quickly as it could, without regard to contractual performance or any lawful right to payment of the participants.\" (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Third Amended Complaint also establishes a nexus between the purpose of the Scheme and the acts it carried out, and a relationship between individuals that comprised the Scheme itself. First, it connects the acts with the Scheme's aims by alleging Defendants intended to defraud Continental through several avenues and that Defendants followed through with those aims by sending bribe payments (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 57-81), falsifying documents and engaging in self-dealing (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 82-181), and committing theft (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 182-211). Second, it establishes each Defendant's relationship with the Scheme by specifying their purported actions. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 52-56, 212-526). The common thread among each Defendant was that they were connected to David, and that they either had knowledge of acts, actually committed acts, or conspired to commit acts, against Continental. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 52-56, 157, 189, 192, 206-07, 212-14, 216, 218, 221, 224, 226, 228, 231-32, 234, 237, 239, 241, 243, 245, 247, 249, 251). Last, Plaintiffs allege the acts took place over at least eight work sites during six years. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 52). These facts plausibly support the allegation of an association in fact enterprise and they are not grounds for dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <em>\n    3. Predicate Acts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Defendants next argue Count 1 should be dismissed because it does not adequately plead fraud-related predicate acts. Under RICO, fraudulent predicate acts must meet Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading threshold.\n   <em>\n    Liquidation Comm'n of Banco Intercontinental, S.A. v.

(Doc. 117 at \u00b6 14). The Third Amended Complaint spells out Defendants' individual roles in the commission of bribery, time\n   frames for the bribery, specific instances, and the temporal relation to specific projects. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 57-81, 212-252).

Such claims generally require a plaintiff to allege: \"(1) that defendants knowingly devised or participated in a scheme to defraud plaintiffs,(2) that they did so willingly with an intent to defraud, and (3) that the defendants used the U.S. mails or the interstate wires for the purpose of executing the scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Langford v.

Because it is the use or investment of racketeering income that violates \u00a7 1962(a), rather than the racketeering acts themselves, it makes sense that qualifying injuries under \u00a7 1962(a) should flow from the prohibited acts.

The Court disagrees. Plaintiffs allege Defendants secured income through a pattern of racketeering activity that began with bribery, and that they invested that income by establishing new entities, such as Albertelli Team CCR, and by funding contractors operating under false pretenses, such as Westcore I, that were intended to further the Scheme. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 54-55, 238, 240, 244, 251). These entities then furthered the Scheme and harmed Plaintiffs by committing other acts of bribery, submitting falsified documents and payment requests, and self-dealing. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 52-55, 70-71, 75, 161, 213, 224(a)-(e), 245(a)-(b), 257, 259).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Still, Defendants argue Plaintiffs' injuries were not proximately caused by the establishment of, or investment in, third-party entities, and instead result from poor contractual performance. But this attempt to sever the causational string falls short. Courts have found that proximate cause can be satisfied for a \u00a7 1962(a) claim where a defendant uses racketeering income to establish a new entity that then proximately causes harm to a Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ideal Steel Supply Corp. v.

Fla. 1992) (finding a \u00a7 1962(a) violation where \"the investment of the income\n   fraudulently obtained allegedly enabled the Defendants to perpetuate the operation of the enterprise and continue to defraud\" the plaintiff). With that in mind, the Court finds Count 1's allegations to be sufficient. Had Defendants never established Albertelli Team CCR or invested in Westcore I, those entities would not have been able to join the Scheme and commit predicate acts to further injure Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Defendants did establish the entities with the intent to use them to further the Scheme, it was foreseeable that they would cause Plaintiffs' injuries. Plaintiffs have plausibly pled proximate cause in relation to \u00a7 1962(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Next, Defendants argue Count 1 fails to allege they proximately caused actionable injuries under \u00a7 1962(b). The Court agrees. Under \u00a7 1962(b), \"[i]t shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity...to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.\" While \u00a7 1962(a) prohibits using funds acquired through a pattern of racketeering activity to invest in or acquire an enterprise, \u00a7 1962(b) prohibits the acquisition or maintenance of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 1962(a) - (b). Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged a violation of \u00a7 1962(b). While the Third Amended Complaint is rife with predicate acts that allowed Defendants to establish and fund enterprises, it is devoid of any allegation those enterprises were directly acquired or maintained\n   <em>\n    through\n   </em>\n   racketeering activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Complaint alleges Defendants bribed Eguizabal to gain influence on Continental's decision-making process. But it does not claim that Defendants gained any interest in Continental, or to control Continental's decision-making process. Likewise, Plaintiffs do not assert Defendants acquired, maintained, or controlled entities like Westcore I, Westcore II, or Albertelli Team CCR through direct racketeering activity. Rather, Plaintiffs claim Defendants committed racketeering activities that either enabled the enterprises to be formed or that racketeering activities were committed through the enterprises once they were formed. That is not enough. And because Plaintiffs do not plausibly allege a violation of \u00a7 1962(b), they cannot plausibly allege that such a violation proximately caused their injuries. To the extent Count 1 alleges a \u00a7 1962(b) claim, it fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Civil Theft\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Count 4 alleges the Albertellis and ACI committed civil theft. In Florida, theft occurs where a person knowingly obtains or uses the property of another without legal entitlement and with the intent to deprive another of the right to that property.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20812.014\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Florida has provided a civil cause of action for persons injured by theft, which carries a penalty of \"threefold the actual damages sustained...minimum damages in the amount of $200, and reasonable attorney's fees and court costs in the trial and appellate courts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20772.11\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 772.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants argue Count 4 should be dismissed for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   First, Defendants contend Count 4 must be dismissed because Plaintiffs were reimbursed by the bank for the joint checks that David purportedly deposited into ACI's bank account. This is a standing issue. To have standing, a plaintiff must allege (1) an actual or imminent injury or a concrete \"invasion of a legally protected interest,\" (2) causation, and (3) redressability.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). Here, Count 1 alleges that David and ACI deposited joint checks meant for subcontractors without the right to do so. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 182, 196, 205). In so doing, the Fort Myers and Rochester Projects suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest. Defendants cite no authority to suggest the court should look to recovery from a third-party when determining whether Plaintiffs have suffered an injury in fact. That type of recovery is typically addressed by the collateral source rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muzuco v. Re$ubmitIt, LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076991\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/297/504/#p512\">\n    297 F.R.D. 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 512 (S.D. Fla. 2013). What matters here is David and ACI's conduct. Allegations on that subject are strong enough to confer standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Second, Defendants argue Count 4 should be dismissed because Plaintiffs failed to provide a written demand to George. Florida Statute 772.11 requires that \"[b]efore filing an action for damages under this section, the person claiming injury must make a written demand for $200 or the treble damage amount of the person liable for damages under this section.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076991\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/297/504/#p512\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Plaintiffs argue, and the record substantiates, that such a demand letter was sent to David and ACI for the return of the stolen joint checks deposited by David into ACI's bank account. (Doc. 49-1 at 145-46). Plaintiffs claim they also provided sufficient notice to George because he was an owner of ACI and therefore he also had notice of the demand for return of the checks. But the language of Florida Statute 772.11 is clear. It requires that a demand for relief be made to each person liable for civil theft damages. ACI and George are separate persons under the law. While Plaintiffs addressed ACI's potential liability through their demand letter, they did not address that of George.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   But Plaintiffs' failure to supply George with a demand letter is not grounds for dismissal. As a threshold matter, the demand requirement in the statute is not substantive because it does not relate to the activities that give rise to the cause of action itself. It exists to \"encourage negotiation and settlement prior to the commencement of litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Tadlock\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:09-BK-712-PMG,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%208320065\">\n    2010 WL 8320065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. Sept. 1, 2010). Perhaps recognizing this finding, courts within this circuit have enforced the demand requirement leniently and have declined to dismiss nonconforming claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inglis v. Wells Fargo Bank N.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:14-CV-677-FTM-29CM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20637485\">\n    2017 WL 637485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (M.D. Fla.

Jan. 5, 2015). The Court agrees with this approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   By now, George has notice of the claim and no time machine exists to further the\n   interests of pre-suit negotiation. Moreover, it stands to reason that because he is a partial owner of ACI, the policy interests (but not the strict letter) of the statute were satisfied by serving a demand on ACI prior to suit. For these reasons, the Court does not find the lack of strict statutory compliance grounds for dismissal. But in an abundance of caution, Plaintiffs will comply with the statute by serving a demand upon George within 10 days. Count 4 survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Common Law Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Count 5 alleges all Defendants are liable for common law fraud. In Florida, the elements of fraud are \"(1) a false statement concerning a material fact; (2) the representor's knowledge that the representation is false; (3) an intention that the representation induce another to act on it; and (4) consequent injury by the party acting in reliance on the representation.\"\n   <em>\n    Butler v. Yusem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036741\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/44/102/#p105\">\n    44 So.3d 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 105 (Fla. 2010). Fraud claims are subject to Rule 9(b). Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Defendants argue Plaintiffs have not met this obligation as it relates to George and Butler. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Count 5 is based on some of the same predicate acts the Court found plausibly alleged in Count 1. The Court finds that both Defendants' roles are specifically alleged in the intentional preparation of incorrect payment applications on the Six Mile Project. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 63, 78, 109, 121-125, 218, 249). The Third Amended Complaint also establishes that George and Butler expected Plaintiffs to rely on the applications because they requested payments from the Six Mile Fund, and that the Six Mile Fund was injured when the payments were disbursed and subcontractors later claimed they were owed additional funds. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 121-126, 128).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   In addition, Count 5 plausibly alleges Butler played an active part in the theft of joint checks from the Six Mile and Rochester Funds by helping to prepare payment requests that ACI never intended to honor and by making numerous false representations regarding distributing said payments. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 189-91, 195, 199-200, 203-04, 206-207). Based on these representations the Fort Myers and Rochester Funds allegedly distributed payments in the form of joint checks and were injured when David deposited them into ACI's bank account. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 196, 205, 208). Count 5, thus, passes muster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Common Law Conspiracy to Commit Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Count 6 alleges all Defendants are liable for conspiracy to commit common law fraud. In Florida, the elements of a civil conspiracy are \"(a) a conspiracy between two or more parties, (b) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means, (c) the doing of some overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy, and (d) damage to plaintiff as a result of the acts performed pursuant to the conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    Walters v. Blankenship\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8411078\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/931/137/#p140\">\n    931 So.2d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006). Conspiracy claims must also meet Rule 9(b)'s heightened particularity requirements.\n   <em>\n    Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3896924\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/1043/#p1065\">\n    480 F.3d 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1065 (11th Cir. 2007). Count 6 meets those requirements. First, it alleges individual Defendants agreed to participate, and took part in certain specific unlawful acts including bribery, falsification of documents, the surreptitious use of sham contractors and self-dealing, and the theft of joint checks, which was to further the Scheme. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6\u00b6 52-54, 62, 116, 212, 214, 216, 218, 218, 224, 226, 228, 231, 234, 237, 239, 241, 243, 245, 247, 249, 251, 319-320). It then alleges Defendants' unlawful acts injured Plaintiffs in several ways. (Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   117 at \u00b6\u00b6 304, 309, 313, 316). Count 6, therefore, survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Supplemental Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that the Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state court claims.

Here, Count 1 arises under the RICO Act, thereby providing the Court with original jurisdiction.

This is a puzzling argument because it does not relate whether the claim is a shotgun pleading. In any event, RICO Act defendants are subject to joint and several liability.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Allstate Ins. Co. v. Palterovich\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3761550\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/653/1306/#p1334\">\n     653 F.Supp.2d 1306\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1334 (S.D. Fla. 2009). The same is true for Florida Rico Act defendants.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Albertson's, Inc. v. Adams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7603429\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/473/231/#p233\">\n     473 So.2d 231\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 233 (Fla.2d DCA 1985) (\"Under Florida law \"[j]oint and several liability exists where two or more wrongdoers negligently contribute to the injury of another by their several acts, which operate concurrently, so that in effect the damages suffered are rendered inseparable.\"). Thus, as long as Plaintiffs allege Defendants took part in a RICO enterprise, all defendants are exposed to similar liability.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    Separately Defendants also argue Counts 5 and 6, which respectively allege all Defendants committed common law fraud and conspiracy to commit common law fraud, are shotgun pleadings because the claims plead multiple claims in the same counts, because they include multiple Plaintiffs, and because they include multiple Defendants. These arguments mirror those made in relation to Counts 1-3 and they fail for the same reasons. Counts 5 and 6 are not shotgun pleadings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    George also argues bribery is not sufficiently alleged as a predicate act because the Third Amended Complaint does not detail what bribery statute he purportedly violated. This argument is a non-starter. First, as the Court found above, the failure to cite specific statutory authority in a pleading is not grounds for dismissal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12592388\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/346/#p346\">\n     135 S.Ct. at 346\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In any event, the Amended Complaint does list various state bribery laws to which George Albertelli is subject. (Doc. 117 at \u00b6 256). The claim survives.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    To the extent Defendants allege Plaintiffs seek to treble ordinary breach of contract claims by characterizing Defendants' activities as fraudulent, this argument fails as well. For one thing, this argument does not contest the substantive allegations of the Third Amended Complaint. For another, Defendants cite no authority definitively holding RICO Act claims are incompatible with ordinary breach of contract claims. But the Eleventh Circuit has allowed such claims to co-exist.\n    <em>\n     Cox v. Adm'r U.S. Steel &amp; Carnegie\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1830282\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/17/1386/#p1411\">\n     17 F.3d 1386\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1411 (11th Cir.), opinion modified on reh'g,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535001\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/30/1347/\">\n     30 F.3d 1347\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (11th Cir. 1994). Defendants' argument fails.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    The Court recognizes a decision from the Southern District of Florida holding that \"Florida law does not require a demand for the return of the money in order to state a cause of action for civil theft.\"\n    <em>\n     Century Sr. Servs. v. Consumer Health Ben.

Fla. 2011). But, in light of the relatively straightforward language of the statute, the Court declines to embrace that holding here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
