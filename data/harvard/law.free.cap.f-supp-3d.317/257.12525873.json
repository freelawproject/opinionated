The IRS has moved to dismiss, claiming that MEF's request was for a third party's \"return information,\" which is protected by the confidentiality provision of the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\").\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206103\">\n       26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . However, as MEF made clear after the IRS's initial denial, the request sought only any information that was\n      <em>\n       not\n      </em>\n      protected return information. By failing to complete a FOIA search to determine whether any responsive, non-protected material existed, the IRS failed to meet its obligation under FOIA to produce responsive records or adequately explain its refusal to do so. Because the appropriate remedy for an agency's failure to produce records under FOIA is an injunction, the IRS's motion to dismiss will be denied with respect to MEF's claim for injunctive relief and granted with respect to MEF's claim for declaratory judgment.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      <em>\n       <strong>\n        BACKGROUND\n       </strong>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      FOIA requires agencies to respond to any records request which \"(i) reasonably describes such records and (ii) is made in accordance with published rules stating the ... procedures to be followed.\"\n      <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n       5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (a)(3)(A).
