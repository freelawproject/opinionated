INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Memorandum Opinion addresses a specific, narrow issue: The impact of District\n   of Columbia (\"D.C.\") Code \u00a7 29-406.31(d), which shields directors of charitable corporations from damages except in specific circumstances, on this Court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While the issue here is narrow, the underlying lawsuit to which this issue relates arose from a much broader dispute over the extent to which an exclusively academic organization should involve itself in political issues. Plaintiffs are current and former members of the American Studies Association (\"ASA\"), a nonprofit, charitable corporation dedicated to the promotion of the study of American culture. They have sued the ASA and several of its current and former leaders, including Defendants Lisa Duggan, Curtis Marez, Avery Gordon, Neferti Tadiar, Sunaina Maira, Chandan Reddy, Jasbir Puar, J. Kehaulani, Kauanui, Steven Salaita, and John Stephens (\"Individual Defendants\"), alleging that the Individual Defendants improperly introduced and implemented a resolution calling for the academic boycott of Israel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During recent briefing regarding whether Plaintiffs could amend their complaint,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029-406.31\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 29-406.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) emerged as a possible impediment to the Court's subject matter jurisdiction. For the reasons stated below, the Court, concludes that \u00a7 29-406.31(d) does not defeat its jurisdiction at this stage in the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The American Studies Association\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The ASA is a nonprofit organization in service of \"the promotion of the study of American culture through the encouragement of research, teaching, publication, the strengthening of relations among persons and institutions in this country and abroad devoted to such studies, and the broadening of knowledge among the general public about American culture in all its diversity and complexity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Const. &amp; Bylaws of the Am. Studies Ass'n (\"ASA Const. &amp; Bylaws\"), Const., Art. I, \u00a7 2, ECF No. 21-3. The ASA's founding documents provide that the society was \"organized exclusively for education and academic purposes.\" Pls.' Sec. Am. Compl. (\"SAC\") \u00b6 30, ECF No. 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The ASA was incorporated in D.C. as a private, nonprofit corporation, and is therefore governed by D.C. law. SAC \u00b6 17. Moreover, it has been designated by the Internal Revenue Service as a tax-exempt, charitable organization under the Internal Revenue Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because it is exempt from taxation under \u00a7 501(c)(3), it is considered to be a \"charitable corporation\" under D.C.'s statutory framework governing nonprofit corporations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029-401.02\">\n    D.C.

The National Council is charged with \"conduct[ing] the business, set[ting] fiscal policy ... and oversee[ing] the general interests of the [ASA].\" ASA Const. &amp; Bylaws, Const., Art. V, \u00a7 2. It consists of thirteen voting members. ASA Const. &amp; Bylaws, Const., Art. V, \u00a7 1.

ASA's Boycott Resolution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In November 2013, at the ASA's annual meeting, ASA leadership introduced a resolution advocating for the boycott of Israeli academic institutions (the \"Resolution\"), in response to the allegation that Israel\n   restricts academic activity in formerly Jordanian territory currently under Israeli control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 89, 98. The Resolution's operative clause states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   It is resolved that the American Studies Association (ASA) endorses and will honor the call of the Palestinian civil society for a boycott of Israeli academic institutions. It is also resolved that the ASA supports the protected rights of students and scholars everywhere to engage in research and public speaking about Israel-Palestine and in support of the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Am. Verified Compl. (\"FAC\") \u00b6 31, ECF No. 19. Plaintiffs allege that the Individual Defendants engaged in improper conduct, in contravention of their duties to the ASA and its members, and in violation of the ASA's bylaws and D.C. law, to ensure that the Resolution was formally endorsed by the ASA.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   SAC. They also allege that the Individual Defendants improperly utilized ASA funds to defend the Resolution after its passage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029-401.02\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that the Resolution has harmed ASA in multiple ways. First, Plaintiffs claim that, since the Resolution, several members of the ASA have resigned in protest, depriving the ASA of membership dues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 174. Second, Plaintiffs claim that the ASA has experienced reputational harm because of the reaction to the Resolution by the academic community and the general public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 154-55, 176. And third, Plaintiffs claim that the ASA has suffered financial harm because of an alleged decrease in donations and an increase in public-relations and legal spending in response to the public backlash resulting from the Resolution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 171, 175, 185. Although the complaint does not specify an amount of damages sought, it does state that \"the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.\" SAC \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Relevant Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs filed suit in this Court in April 2016, ECF No. 1, and later amended their complaint in June 2016, ECF No. 19, and in March 2018, ECF No. 81. They challenge various acts relating to the passage of the Resolution and its aftermath, seeking damages, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties,\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   acts, breaches of contract, violations of the D.C. Nonprofit Corporation Act, and corporate waste.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   SAC. They claim that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"inasmuch as there exists complete diversity of citizenship between Plaintiffs and Defendants and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.\" SAC \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Soon after the First Amended Complaint's filing, Defendants moved to dismiss it. Among other arguments, Defendants argued that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiffs failed to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement-$75,000-necessary to maintain a diversity suit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Those arguments are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Court's subject matter jurisdiction remains intact because (1) two individual Defendants-Jasbir Puar and Neferti Tadiar-were not ASA directors, and therefore their actions do not fall within the scope of \u00a7 29-406.31(d) ; (2) while the remaining individual Defendants may have been ASA directors, their alleged illicit conduct does not fall within the scope of \u00a7 29-406.31(d) because they were not acting in their capacities as directors when that conduct occurred; (3) Plaintiffs have alleged conduct that constitutes intentional infliction of harm on the ASA, which is exempt from \u00a7 29-406.31(d) ; and (4) Section 29-406.31(d) is an affirmative defense which Defendants have failed to plead, and it therefore cannot deprive the Court of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Code exculpatory provision, \u00a7 29-406.90(b);\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that Defendants' conduct is exempt from \u00a7 29-406.31(d) ; and (3) Plaintiffs have only claimed damages suffered by the ASA, and the Court has already dismissed Plaintiffs' derivative claims, therefore Plaintiffs cannot legally pursue the damages they seek.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

The answer, at this stage, is no. Even assuming that all Individual Defendants were ASA directors potentially protected by \u00a7 29-406.31(d) during the period challenged in the complaint, that provision does not prevent Plaintiffs from seeking damages arising from conduct that constituted \"[a]n intentional infliction of harm.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029-406.31\">\n    D.C.

While the parties dispute whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded an intentional infliction of harm, they seem to agree on the standard governing that exemption. Following the parties' guidance, to flesh out the standard the Court will look to the exemption's legislative history and the very few cases that have interpreted similar provisions. As explained below, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded that the Individual Defendants' conduct rises to the level of intentional infliction of harm, and therefore that it is exempt from \u00a7 29-406.31(d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Both parties state that D.C.

Br. at 9. Section 2.02 of the Model Act, which governs the provisions that a nonprofit corporation may include in its articles of incorporation, contains a subsection that is nearly identical to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029-406.31\">\n    D.C.

This subsection explicitly does not apply to charitable corporations such as the ASA, but its official comment states that the \"[i]nclusion of the type of provision authorized by Section 2.02(c) in the articles of incorporation of a charitable corporation is not necessary because the same liability shield is provided for directors of a charitable corporation by Section 8.31(d).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029-406.31\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   cmt. at 2-9.

The use of the word \"intentional,\" rather than a less precise term such as \"knowing,\" is meant to refer to the specific intent to perform, or fail to perform, the acts with actual knowledge that the director's action, or failure to act, will cause harm, rather than a general intent to perform the acts which cause the harm. No public policy should permit the members to eliminate or limit the liability of directors for conduct intended to cause harm to the corporation or its members.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Model Act \u00a7 2.02(c) cmt. at 2-12-13. Thus, according to the Model Act's Official Comment, a director's conduct rises to the level of intentional infliction of harm if the director (1) intends the conduct; (2) with the knowledge that the conduct will cause harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

Br. at 2 (quoting an email in which an Individual Defendant stated, \"I don't care if [the Resolution] 'splits' the organization\").
