Because Herbin has not met his burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction and has not made a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   both motions for default judgment without prejudice.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises from a putative business dispute between Plaintiff Jervon Herbin and Defendant Shawnita Wilkins Seau. During the relevant events, Herbin was incarcerated in Virginia, where he remains today.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 at 1. According to Herbin, he developed an idea for \"a dating/social networking website\" that would \"target[ ] [b]lack consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4 (Compl. \u00b6 5). He decided to go into business with Seau, \"a former college classmate,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5), with whom Herbin had \"reconnect[ed] after ... a 17[-]year hiatus in their ... friendship,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8 (Compl. \u00b6 12). They \"entered into a [p]artnership agreement,\" and Herbin gave Seau a \"copy of [his] business plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 5). Although the two friends worked well together at first, Herbin eventually grew dissatisfied with what he perceived to be Seau's lack of follow-through.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 5). He alleges that she \"failed to meet her partnership obligations [by] failing to execute the task[s] needed to bring the business to fruition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 5). In particular, Herbin asserts, Seau did not register a domain name for the website, skipped a workshop at the D.C. \"Bar Entrepreneurship Pro Bono Program,\" and failed to email potential investors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 5);\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-11). Disillusioned, Herbin asked Seau \"to return his business plan,\" warned her not to \"steal\" his idea, and\n   \"informed her ... that the partnership was to be dissolved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4, 7-8 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 12). Although Seau agreed to return the document and said she would not compete with him, she allegedly has not returned Herbin's business plan to him despite multiple requests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8 (Compl. \u00b6 12). Herbin alleges that, as a result, he has missed out on \"professional assistance in launching the business,\" including \"assistance from potential investors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4 (Compl. \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Herbin, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , filed this diversity action against Seau. Dkt. 1. He asserts a variety of contract and tort claims based on her alleged \"fail[ure] to honor the partnership agreement\" as well as unspecified intellectual property claims stemming from her \"refusal to return [his] business plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17). He seeks compensatory damages in the amount of $152 million as well as punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12 (Compl. Prayer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Seau was served on July 24, 2017, Dkt. 11 at 3, and has failed to respond to the complaint. Herbin moved for a default judgment on December 4, 2017, before the Clerk of the Court had entered a default. Dkt. 15. Three days later, the Clerk entered the default. Dkt. 14.

Although Herbin is incarcerated in Virginia, he asserts that he is \"a citizen and resident of the District of Columbia.\" Dkt. 1 at 1 (Compl.). The Court, accordingly, lacks jurisdiction if Seau resides in the District as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On this score, the record is mixed. According to the complaint, Herbin \"is not exactly sure of where\" Seau \"resides\" because \"there is some discrepancy as to her exact address.\" Dkt. 1 at 3 (Compl. \u00b6 4). She allegedly provided Herbin with \"two different addresses\" located in Stafford, Virginia, and \"also occasionally resides at her brother's house in Alexandria, Virginia.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703378,7635215\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/52/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 4). Further confusing matters, Seau allegedly informed Herbin that she \"use[s] ... other relative[s'] address(es)\" in the District of Columbia \"as her place of residence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703378,7635215\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/52/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 4). In subsequent filings, Herbin has continued to express uncertainty as to Seau's place of residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 2 at 1 (\"There is [a] discrepancy as to [Seau's] residential address ... and the only other address [Herbin] has ... is a work address in Alexandria, Virginia.\"); Dkt. 8 at 3 (noting that Seau \"list[s] several addresses in different jurisdictions as her place of residence\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The return of service affidavit, moreover, does not shed any additional light on Seau's domicile. Because Herbin is proceeding\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   , the U.S. Marshals Service effected service. To do so, the Marshals Service looked to the addresses that Herbin provided for Seau in his complaint. The Marshals Service reported that Seau was served at the first of those addresses, but that it was her workplace in Alexandria, Virginia. Dkt. 11 at 1-2. The Marshals Service further reported that the second address-the Stafford, Virginia address-was Seau's \"old house.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Beyond providing these addresses-neither of which establishes Seau's domicile-Herbin has not provided any evidence that Seau is a citizen of Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In sum, it is unclear whether Seau is domiciled in Virginia, which would allow this case to proceed under the Court's diversity jurisdiction, or, alternatively, whether she lives in the District of Columbia, which would preclude this Court from considering the merits. The burden of establishing the Court's jurisdiction rests with Herbin, and he has not done so. As a result, the Court cannot consider Herbin's motions for the entry of a default judgment. Moreover, in order to permit the Court to decide whether this case is properly before it, the Court will order Herbin to submit evidence regarding Seau's domicile. If Herbin is not able to meet his burden of establishing the Court's subject matter jurisdiction, the Court will dismiss this action without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Personal Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to establishing subject matter jurisdiction, to obtain a default judgment Herbin must make a prima facie showing that the Court has personal jurisdiction over Seau.

Assuming that Seau is not domiciled in the District of Columbia, it is unclear from Herbin's complaint and other filings that she is subject to personal jurisdiction in the District of Columbia. Herbin was incarcerated in Virginia during the relevant events,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 at 1, and Seau's whereabouts during the formation and dissolution of the alleged partnership cannot be discerned from the filings. The only (sparse) link to the District of Columbia appears to be Herbin's allegation that Seau failed to attend a workshop \"at the DC Bar ... in the District of Columbia.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2013-423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2013-423\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 9).
