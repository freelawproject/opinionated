Instead, the only dispute is whether Mr. Williams has sufficiently alleged facts suggesting that any adverse action he suffered was because of his sexual orientation. Specifically, MPD argues that Mr. Williams has not alleged that the individuals who made the decision to force plaintiff to reapply for his supervisory position-and who decided, eventually, to terminate plaintiff's employment-were aware of his sexual orientation.

Questions about the scope of Ms. Dawkins' authority and the depth of the terminating officials' knowledge regarding Mr. Williams' sexual orientation raise \"factual question[s]\" that are \"not properly resolved at the motion-to-dismiss stage when all reasonable inferences must be drawn to the plaintiff's benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs v. von Eschenbach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562892,3566332\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/695/\">\n    495 F.3d 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 723 (D.C.

The D.C. Circuit has held that a plaintiff is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not required\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to allege that a specific supervisor had knowledge of protected activity to plead a claim for retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v.

Cir. 2012). In\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   , the defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to show that the supervisor who took the adverse employment action had knowledge of the plaintiff's complaint to the agency.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050673,3769317\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/666/1344/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050673,3769317\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/666/1344/\">\n    at 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reversing the district court's decision to grant summary judgment to the defendant on the plaintiff's retaliation claim, the D.C. Circuit explained that, at the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   stage, \"the fact that [the plaintiff] submitted the complaint to the agency is sufficient.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050673,3769317\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/666/1344/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bartlette v.

In his amended complaint, Mr. Williams states that he complained multiple times to Mr. Moore, an Operations Manager in MPD's Human Resources Department, between July 2016 and September 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., ECF No. 11 \u00b6\u00b6 24, 37-42, 48-51. Mr. Williams specifically alleges that, on or about September 7, 2016, he \"told Mr. Moore that he believed that he was being treated differently because he was gay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Less than four weeks later, on September 30, 2016, Mr. Williams was terminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53. The Court concludes that these allegations are sufficient at this stage to plead a plausible claim for retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v. D.C. Water &amp; Sewer Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280044,4274374\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/65/\">\n    791 F.3d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 69 (D.C.

Accordingly, MPD's motion to dismiss plaintiff's retaliation claims is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On the other hand, the Court concludes that Mr. Williams allegations-which are the same ones upon which his discrimination and retaliation claims are based-are insufficient to support his hostile work environment claim. To state a claim under Title VII or the DCHRA based on a hostile work environment, a plaintiff must allege facts establishing that his \"workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the [plaintiff's] employment and create an abusive working environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

He must therefore establish that \"(1) he ... is a member of a\n   protected class; (2) he ... was subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment occurred because of the plaintiff's protected status; (4) the harassment was severe to a degree which affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment; and (5) the employer knew or should have known about the harassment, but nonetheless failed to take steps to prevent it.\"\n   <em>\n    Peters v.

In evaluating these factors, the \"court looks to the totality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, its offensiveness, and whether it interferes with an employee's work performance.\"\n   <em>\n    Baloch v.

This standard is a demanding one, as Title VII is not intended to function as a \"general civility code\" that regulates the \"ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing.\"\n   <em>\n    Faragher v.

Compl., ECF No. 11 \u00b6 71. These allegations consist of discrete instances of alleged discrimination or retaliation-indeed, Mr. Williams relies on these very same allegations to form the basis of his other claims. \"[A]s a general matter, courts in this Circuit frown on plaintiffs who attempt to bootstrap their alleged discrete acts of retaliation into a broader hostile work environment claim\" and are \"reluctant to transform mere reference to alleged disparate acts of discrimination against plaintiff into a hostile work environment claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Dudley v.

Moreover, even in instances in which courts have permitted a plaintiff to rely on \"discrete acts that the plaintiff claims .... are actionable on their own,\" those facts must be \"sufficient to show that those decisions were part of a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     severe and pervasive pattern of harassment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Outlaw v.
