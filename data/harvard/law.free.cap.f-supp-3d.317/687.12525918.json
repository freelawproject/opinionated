(Dkt. 19). The Commissioner of Social Security (\"the Commissioner\") did not object to the request, but the Commissioner did raise the issue of whether the motion had been timely filed. (Dkt. 21 at 3-4). On April 11, 2018, the Court issued a Decision and Order denying the motion for attorneys' fees as untimely. (Dkt. 23). In issuing its decision, the Court recognized that there was a split of authority as to the appropriate standard governing the timeliness of a \u00a7 406(b) motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7). Although several district courts in this Circuit have touched upon this issue to varying extents, the Second Circuit has yet to weigh in on the debate. Ultimately, the Court agreed with those courts that have determined that a \u00a7 406(b) motion was constrained by the 14-day time limitation set forth in Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10). The Court held that a \u00a7 406(b) motion is timely if it is filed within 14 days after entry of the judgment against the Commissioner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d) (\"Unless a statute or a court order provides otherwise, the motion must ... be filed no later than 14 days after the entry of judgment.\"). In order to avoid an unjust result, the Court adopted the approach taken by the Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517989\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/593/274/\">\n    593 F.3d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2010), and held that this time limit would be equitably tolled until the Commissioner's notice of award was issued and the plaintiff's counsel was notified of that award. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 23 at 9-10, 13). In so holding, the Court rejected the Tenth Circuit's approach in\n   <em>\n    McGraw v. Bamhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3089370\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/493/\">\n    450 F.3d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2006) -and the approach now advocated by Plaintiff-which would permit a \u00a7 406(b) motion to be timely filed within an unspecified reasonable period of time. (Dkt. 23 at 7-19);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6), (c)(1) (providing that \"the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\" for any \"reason that justifies relief\" upon a motion filed \"within a reasonable time\"). Due to the absence of Second Circuit precedent on this issue, the Court also held, in the alternative, that Plaintiff's motion was not timely filed within a reasonable period under\n   the\n   <em>\n    McGraw\n   </em>\n   approach. (Dkt. 23 at 19-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court is Plaintiff's motion to alter this Court's judgment. (Dkt. 24). Plaintiff argues that the Court erred in determining that Plaintiff's initial motion for attorneys\" fees was governed by the constructs of Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure -as determined by the Third, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuits-and that the Court should have applied the principles articulated in\n   <em>\n    McGraw\n   </em>\n   in resolving the attorneys' fees motion. (Dkt. 25). For the purposes of this Decision and Order, the Court assumes the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts and the Court's prior analysis as set forth in its April 11, 2018, Decision and Order. For the following reasons. Plaintiff's motion to alter judgment (Dkt. 24) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"district courts may alter or amend judgment to correct a clear error of law or prevent manifest injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    Munafo v.

The Court's April 11, 2018, Decision and Order-in resolving which rule of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governed the timeliness of a \u00a7 406(b) motion, and answering how Rule 54(d) could be reconciled with the requirements of \u00a7 406(b) -represents nothing more than an exercise of the Court's judicial authority to \"say what the law is.\" Accordingly, the Court rejects Plaintiff's view that the Court has somehow promulgated a new local rule\n   under the constructs of its congressionally delegated rule-making authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     The Court's Application of Rule 54(d) is Not Inconsistent With the Law in Other Circuits\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the Court failed to consider how the 14-day filing constraint in Rule 54(d) has been applied in the Third, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuits. (Dkt. 25 at 6-8). Plaintiff appears to suggest that the Court's prior ruling is inflexible to varying circumstances that may impede the timely filing of a \u00a7 406(b) motion. In support of this position, Plaintiff contends that even courts that apply the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   approach still retain \"broad discretion to expand the filing deadlines.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   However, the Court's April 11, 2018, Decision and Order did not set forth a contrary rule. The Court noted that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   did \" 'not alter the authority of the district court to expand th[e] filing deadline at the request of the parties.' \" (Dkt. 23 at 16 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517989\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/593/274/\">\n    593 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   280 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2)(B) ) ) ). Nevertheless, there was not, and never has been, a request to expand the Rule 54(d) filing deadline in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this regard, Plaintiff's reliance upon\n   <em>\n    Rucker v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec.\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-CV-5226 (CCC),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201269505\">\n    2015 WL 1269505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. Mar. 18, 2015) is misplaced. In that case, the plaintiff raised arguments that questioned whether the Commissioner had actually sent the notice of award to the plaintiff's counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The Commissioner did not refute these contentions, and thus, the court found that the plaintiff had \"shown\n   <em>\n    good and sufficient cause\n   </em>\n   as to why the instant motion was filed more than ten (10) months after the date shown on the Notice of Award.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). By contrast, Plaintiff failed to make any request for this Court to extend the 14-day time period in the event that the Court found that Rule 54(d) was the applicable federal rule governing the timeliness of her motion. Indeed, Plaintiff has still not provided any reason for why any such extension of time would be appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Court \"arbitrarily\" applied Rule 54(d) in this context. (Dkt. 25 at 5, 8). While Plaintiff may disagree with the Court's April 11, 2018, Decision and Order, there is no merit to the suggestion that the Court reached its conclusion in a capricious manner. Confronted with a split of authority on this issue, the Court was forced to review the competing approaches and analyze their legal and practical consequences. Without the benefit of the Second Circuit's guidance, the Court was required to rely upon out-of-circuit precedent as well as the decisional law of other district courts within this Circuit in determining whether Rule 54(d) or Rule 60 governed Plaintiff's \u00a7 406(b) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For her part, Plaintiff was fully aware that the law remains unsettled on this issue, and that the Court could decide that the principles favoring the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   approach were more persuasive. Despite the fact that the Commissioner raised this issue in her responsive brief, (Dkt. 21 at 3-4), Plaintiff did not request leave to file a reply to assert any of the arguments now raised for the first time on this motion. \" '[A] judgment in a civil case does not constitute 'manifest injustice' where the movant's arguments for relief 'were available to the [party] below and [the party] proffer[s] no reason for [its] failure to raise the arguments.' \"\n   <em>\n    Corsair Special Situations Fund, L.P. v.

Plaintiff has offered no explanation for why she failed\n   to assert any of the arguments she now raises within her original motion papers or as a response to the Commissioner's brief. Plaintiff also fails to cite to any binding authority that would require this Court to accept the\n   <em>\n    McGraw\n   </em>\n   approach over the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff fails to provide any substantive reasons for the Court to amend its alternative holding that her motion for attorneys' fees was untimely even under the\n   <em>\n    McGraw\n   </em>\n   analysis. Despite citing to a number cases that have found \u00a7 406(b) motions to be timely filed beyond the 14-day time constraint of Rule 54(d), Plaintiff has not explained why it was reasonable for her to delay the filing of her motion for over six months after the Commissioner's notice of award was issued and received. Plaintiff cites to only one case where a court in this Circuit granted a \u00a7 406(b) motion for attorneys' fees over seven months after the issuance of the notice of award.\n   <em>\n    Nieves v.
