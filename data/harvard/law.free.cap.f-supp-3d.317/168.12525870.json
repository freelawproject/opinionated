Rulemaking History Leading to the 2005 Final Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At issue in this lawsuit is the treatment of patient days in the Medicare fraction or the Medicaid fraction for individuals who were eligible for both programs-\"dual eligible\" individuals-but for whom Medicare did not pay for care, either because the patient had exhausted his or her Part A benefits for that period of hospitalization or because an entity other than the Medicare Trust Fund paid for that care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 1; Def.'s Mem. at 4. Specifically, this dispute centers on whether such \"dual-eligible exhausted days\" should be counted in the Medicare fraction or instead in the Medicaid fraction. If dual-eligible exhausted days were included in the Medicare fraction, they would be added to the denominator of the Medicaid fraction and, if the patient had been entitled to SSI benefits, also to the numerator. If dual-eligible exhausted days were included in the Medicaid fraction, they would be added to the numerator of the Medicaid fraction. The denominator of the Medicaid fraction is not at issue, because that value includes\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   patient days regardless of eligibility or exhaustion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This distinction matters, because the denominator of the Medicaid fraction (total patient days) is greater than the denominator of the Medicare fraction (patient days for patients \"entitled to benefits under part A\"). Thus, including dual-eligible exhausted days in the Medicare fraction denominator (and, when appropriate, numerator) rather than in the Medicaid fraction numerator will often tend to give those days more of an impact on a hospital's DPP and, correspondingly, on its DSH adjustment.

The 2004 Proposed Rule explained that currently, \"[i]f a patient is a Medicare beneficiary who is also eligible for Medicaid, the patient is considered dual-eligible and the patient days are included in the Medicare fraction of the DSH patient percentage but not the Medicaid fraction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C154\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C154\">\n    at 27,207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Many commenters supported the policy that the Secretary had described as the existing policy-namely, the inclusion of dual-eligible days in the denominator (and, when entitled to SSI benefits, also in the numerator) of the Medicare fraction, regardless of whether the patient's Part A coverage had been exhausted-and opposed the proposed change to begin including dual-eligible exhausted days in the numerator of the Medicaid fraction.

This policy will be effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004.

In the relevant portion of the 2004 Proposed Rule, the Secretary stated that \"we are proposing to\n    <em>\n     clarify\n    </em>\n    that once a beneficiary elects Medicare Part C, those patient days attributable to the beneficiary should not be included in the Medicare fraction\" but should instead be included in the Medicaid fraction. 2004 Proposed Rule, 68 Fed.

In the 2005 Final Rule, however, the Secretary made no such \"clarif[ication]\" and instead \"adopt[ed] a policy to include the patient days for [Part C] beneficiaries in the Medicare fraction\"-the exact opposite of the policy the Secretary had \"propos[ed] to clarify.\" 2005 Final Rule, 69 Fed.

In the Final Rule, the Secretary detailed several themes of the comments received on the proposed rule, and he explained that the agency \"agree[d] with\" a comment that \"including the days in the Medicare fraction has a greater impact on a hospital's DSH patient percentage than including the days in the Medicaid fraction.\" 2005 Final Rule, 69 Fed.

Indeed, the DSH adjustment aims to compensate hospitals for treating sick, low-income patients-in other words, individuals who are likely to exhaust their Part A coverage but who remain in the hospital for treatment. Including patient days for these individuals in the Medicare fraction, where the days will often have a greater impact, furthers the purpose of the DSH adjustment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mem. at 21.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Notably, the Sixth Circuit has examined this same rule and concluded that the 2005 Final Rule \"appears to be the result of a reasoned deliberative process, reflecting HHS's experience in case-by-case administrative adjudications and in federal-court litigation, and its benefitting from stakeholder input through notice-and-comment rulemaking.\"\n    <em>\n     Metro.

As relevant to this dispute, the requirements of the APA and the Medicare Act are substantially similar: the Medicare Act provides that if a final regulation \"is not a logical outgrowth of a previously published notice of proposed rulemaking or interim final rule, such provision shall be treated as a proposed regulation and shall not take effect until there is the further opportunity for public comment and a publication of the provision again as a final regulation.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395hh(a)(4). Thus, the conclusions reached on the APA claim are equally applicable to the Medicare Act claim.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-122\">\n     The plaintiffs at times seem to dispute that dual-eligible exhausted days must be included in either the Medicare or the Medicaid fraction, arguing that, \"complicating the matter, the actual practice prior to the rulemaking challenged in this case was that, at least for some years, such days were nonsensically excluded from both fractions.\" Pls.'

This dispute rests on a misreading of\n     <em>\n      Catholic Health\n     </em>\n     , which noted only that \"the policy of excluding dual-eligible exhausted days from the Medicaid fraction was announced [in 2000], and the [2004] rulemaking was simply a reiteration of this position.\"\n     <em>\n      Catholic Health Initiatives\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4050267,3664636\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/914/\">\n      718 F.3d at 921\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n     <em>\n      Catholic Health Initiatives\n     </em>\n     does not indicate that the prior practice was to exclude dual-eligible exhausted days from both fractions. In addition, the plaintiffs have acknowledged that \"the unambiguous language of the Medicare Act requires such days be included in one fraction or the other.\" Pls.' Mot. at 1-2.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"8\">\n    <p id=\"p-123\">\n     In support of this argument, the plaintiffs offer a hypothetical situation: Suppose that, ignoring dual-eligible exhausted days, a hospital's Medicare fraction is 7 percent (that is, 70 out of 1000 Medicare covered days are attributable to patients with unexhausted Part A benefits and also entitled to SSI benefits). Suppose also that, again ignoring dual-eligible exhausted days, the same hospital's Medicaid fraction is also 7 percent (that is, 140 out of 2000 total covered days were attributable to patients eligible for Medicaid but not entitled to Medicare Part A benefits). If this hospital also had 50 dual-eligible exhausted days for patients not entitled to SSI benefits, then including the exhausted days in the Medicare fraction would have the impact of reducing the Medicare fraction to 6.67 percent (or 70 out of 1050 Medicare covered days), because the 50 exhausted days would be added only to the denominator. By contrast, including the exhausted days in the Medicaid fraction would increase the Medicaid fraction to 9.5 percent (or 190 out of 2000 days), because the days would be included in only the numerator.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Pls.' Mem. at 22-23. The plaintiffs' example does not acknowledge, however, that if the hospital instead had 50 dual-eligible exhausted days for patients who\n     <em>\n      were\n     </em>\n     entitled to SSI benefits, then including the exhausted days in the Medicare fraction would increase the Medicare fraction from 7 percent to 11.4 percent (or 120 days out of 1050 Medicare covered days), while including those days in the Medicaid fraction would increase the Medicaid fraction from 7 percent to only 9.5 percent, as shown above. Indeed, the poorest patients are those that are most likely to be entitled to SSI benefits,\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Catholic Health\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4050267,3664636\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/914/\">\n      718 F.3d at 916\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (characterizing SSI as \"welfare\"), and the inclusion of their exhausted days in both the numerator and the denominator of the Medicare fraction will therefore have the effect, generally, of increasing the DPP more than including those days in the Medicaid fraction would increase the DPP.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
