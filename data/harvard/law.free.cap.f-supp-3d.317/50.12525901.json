Plummer celebrated our Nation's independence, as many Americans do, by drinking alcoholic beverages at a friend's party. In the wee hours of July 5, Plummer decided to drive himself home. While trying to maneuver his car in the alley behind his house, Plummer struck a neighbor's garage. Other neighbors called the police, who found Plummer in his own open garage, unconscious at the wheel of his car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After a protracted encounter, the police arrested Plummer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plummer filed this lawsuit against Defendants the District of Columbia (the \"District\"), the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (\"MPD\"), and the District of Columbia Fire Department (\"DCFD\"), as well as four first responders who Plummer asserts were involved in his arrest: Officer Sandro Lukanovic, Lieutenant John Kutniewski, Officer John F. Nelson, and Battalion Fire Chief Henry Welsh. Plummer claims, among other things, that his arrest violated the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the common law of the District of Columbia, and that the District of Columbia negligently maintained the alley behind his house. Defendants have moved for summary judgment. ECF No. 14. For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion will be granted and judgment will be entered in their favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Officer Nelson spoke with the fire officials, who reported that Plummer appeared to be intoxicated but had refused medical assistance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:4-8. Officer Nelson also, at some point, interviewed Plummer's neighbors, who informed him-consistent with the 911 call-that they had found Plummer unconscious with the engine running after striking Taylor's garage, and that Plummer had been woken up and parked in his garage, where he had lost consciousness once more.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:18-25:10; Defs.'

Ex. 6 (Lukanovic Dep.) at 62:16-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Once awake, Plummer appeared to the officers to be confused and disoriented.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 63:15-64:4; Defs.' Ex. 7 (Nelson Dep.) at 15:10-16:3. Plummer mumbled unintelligibly and struggled to keep his eyes open.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. 8 (Arrington Dep.) at 119:14-20. Plummer also occasionally \"revved\" or \"cranked\" up his engine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119:21-120:9. At a fire official's request, Plummer shifted the car's transmission into park. Defs.' Ex. 10 (Welsh Dep.) at 16:5-10. At some point, Plummer attempted to close the garage door, prompting officers to prevent it from closing on top of them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. 7 (Nelson Dep.) at 137:1-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As the encounter was unfolding, Plummer called 911 to complain about the officers' presence in his garage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. 9 (Plummer 911 call) at 0:01-1:00. The officers, he said, may have damaged the garage when they prevented the door from closing.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:34-52, 12:25-56. \"I'm under siege!\" he said.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:05-11. The 911 operator-who had also taken Landrum's call-asked Plummer whether he had hit someone's garage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:20-25. \"No I did not,\" Plummer answered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:25-27. \"I'm in my garage, no vehicle has crashed. There's no crash here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:07-12. After speaking with the officers, Plummer told the 911 operator, \"These people are lying to me, they're telling me I hit a garage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:27-7:31. The 911 operator, ever helpful, told Plummer, \"Just\n   be mindful that you're on a recorded line.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:45-7:52. \"Just do what the police ask you to do,\" the operator suggested.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:46-49. \"Are you crazy?\" Plummer responded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:49-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officials on the scene, including Chief Welsh of the fire department (one of the Defendants), tried to coax Plummer out of his vehicle. According to Chief Welsh, Plummer appeared to be either intoxicated or having a medical emergency. Defs.' Ex. 10 (Welsh Dep.) at 18:5-15. In particular, Chief Welsh was concerned that Plummer might be having a \"diabetic emergency\" and felt that it was his \"duty to act\" for the welfare of both Plummer and, in the event Plummer chose to drive away, others as well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:2-9, 20:16-21:4, 27:4-5. Chief Welsh urged Plummer to exit the car so that officers could check his blood-sugar level.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:18-20. At some point,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   officers did in fact test his blood sugar, which was normal. Defs.' Ex. 10 (Welsh Dep.) at 24:5-8; Pl.'s Resp.

Plummer then either exited or was removed from the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. 6 (Lukanovic Dep.) at 57:16-58:7; Am. Compl. \u00b6 30. Because there was no officer on the scene who was certified to administer a field sobriety test, police did not test Plummer's sobriety there. Defs.' Ex. 7 (Nelson Dep.) at 22:9-11, 42:11-14. Plummer was arrested for having failed to leave identification after colliding with Taylor's garage, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2050-2201\">\n    D.C.

Ex. 12 (declaration of officer who administered sobriety test). Officer Nelson testified that he should have also arrested Plummer for driving while intoxicated, and that his failure to do so was a \"rookie\" mistake. Defs.' Ex. 7 (Nelson Dep.) at 42:15-20, 53:12-54:3. Nonetheless, Plummer was never charged with drunk driving.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2050-2201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2050-2201\">\n    at 22:12-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . All charges against Plummer arising from the incident were ultimately dismissed just before trial. Am.

ECF No. 3-1 (Superior Court record) at 99-109. After receiving two extensions of time to serve his original complaint, and briefly having his case dismissed for failure to serve process (an order that was later vacated), Plummer ultimately served his amended complaint (the operative pleading).\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2050-2201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2050-2201\">\n    at 23-40, 84-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As explained above, under federal law an arrest is valid so long as there was probable cause to believe the defendant committed\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   offense, not necessarily the one actually charged.

And Officer Nelson wrote in the arrest report that Plummer subsequently \"started\" his car in the officers' presence, which may (though does not necessarily) imply that the engine was off when the officers arrived.

But the Court concludes that, in this case, considerations of judicial economy militate in favor of addressing the underlying constitutional violation Plummer has alleged. Plummer's constitutional and common law claims raise similar questions about the lawfulness of his arrest. Additionally, Plummer asserts a claim for municipal liability in Count V based on the same underlying constitutional violations, and municipalities do not enjoy qualified immunity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pearson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/\">\n     555 U.S. at 242-43\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/\">\n     129 S.Ct. 808\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

For example, he disputes Defendants' recitation of his address \"to the extent that the Defendants do not indicate whether the Plaintiff lives in the state of Washington or Washington, D.C.\" Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6 1. Even more distressingly, Plummer at times disputes facts that he himself has asserted. For example, Defendants claim that Plummer \"lost control of his car and struck Mr. Taylor's garage.\" Defs.' SoMF \u00b6 8. Plummer disputes this statement \"to the extent that Plaintiff did not state that he lost control of his car.\" Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6 8.
