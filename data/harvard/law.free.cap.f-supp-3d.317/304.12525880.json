Upon careful consideration of the parties' submissions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court concludes that it must grant in part and deny in part the defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As an initial matter, the defendant argues that the Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed Facts fails to comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the local rules of this Court, and therefore, \"the Court should ... not accept any argument [raised] therein as creating a factual dispute that may defeat [its] motion, deem each of [its] factual statements as admitted, and grant summary judgment in [its] favor on the record evidence it presents in support of its motion.\" Def.'s Reply at 3. The defendant further argues that \"the Court should disregard all of the unsupported 'facts' and unauthenticated exhibits [the p]laintiff relies upon in opposing [its] motion,\" emphasizing that the plaintiff has \"not set[ ] forth any of her 'facts' in her [s]eparate [s]tatement[, and] has complied with none of the[ ] requirements [in the federal and local rules] for the purported 'facts' in her brief.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1402.11\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1402.11\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court agrees with the defendant that the plaintiff's submissions to the Court fail to comply with both the federal and local rules in a number of respects. The Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed Facts fails to comply with Local Rule 7(h), which requires \"[a]n opposition ... [to include] a separate concise statement of genuine issues setting forth all material facts as to which it is contended there exists a genuine issue necessary to be litigated, ... [and] references to the parts of the record relied on to support the statement,\" LcvR 7(h)(1), and also Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)(1), which similarly requires that \"[a] party asserting that a fact ... is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by [ ] citing to particular parts of materials in the record,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). Although the Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed Facts purports to identify seven broad \"issues\" in dispute, it fails to set forth any statements of fact or provide any corresponding citations to the record.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Disputed Facts \u00b6 4 (asserting merely that \"[t]here is a genuine material issue of fact in dispute as to whether [the d]efendant's claimed reason for terminating\n   [the p]laintiff[ ] was a pretext and a cover up\"). Furthermore, the Plaintiff's Statement of Disputed Facts fails to specifically respond to the individual statements of fact asserted in the Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1402.11\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-1402.11\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (generally asserting only that \"[w]ith the exception of [ ] nos. 1-6, ...

R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2) advisory committee's note to 2010 Amendment, subsection c, and the plaintiff has failed to do that here, at least not in a manner that is apparent to the Court. And finally, the defendant is correct that aside from intermittent citations to these same exhibits, the plaintiff's opposition is almost entirely devoid of citations to the record.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although the Court is troubled by the plaintiff's counsel's non-compliance, which \"makes the work of the Court more onerous,\"\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v.

Furthermore, the Court will make an independent assessment as to whether the facts in the Defendant's Statement of Undisputed Facts are indeed undisputed by the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

However, the DCOHR's Letter of Determination submitted by the defendant suggests that a charge of discrimination was indeed filed with the EEOC, as the letter purports to relate to an \"EEOC No.\" of \"10C-2013-00242,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot., Att.

Def.'s\n   Mem. at 10. The plaintiff testified that Ryan's comment was made approximately two months before she began her leave of absence on February 2, 2011,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Said Dep. 89:9-10, and therefore, was allegedly made approximately eleven months before her termination on November 4, 2011,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6 52. Although eleven months is a significant period of time, this Circuit has instructed that \"[e]ven if [ ] a statement [made significantly before the relevant employment action] carries less weight than one made at the time of the [action], it is nonetheless probative evidence of a supervisor's discriminatory attitude, at least when it is targeted directly at the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310439,4323943\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/658/\">\n    825 F.3d at 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering racially charged remarks allegedly made by the plaintiff's supervisors as early as three years prior to the challenged suspension). Here, the plaintiff alleges that the remark was targeted directly at her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Said Dep. 87:22-24 (asserting that Ryan \"mentioned to [her] ... I thought it was you, because you all look alike\"). Additionally, contrary to the defendant's contention,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 10, the fact that there is no evidence in the record that Ryan made any other race-based comments to or about the plaintiff during the eleven months between Ryan's alleged remark and the plaintiff's termination is not particularly probative given that for nine of these months, the plaintiff was not at work and the record reflects that her contact with Ryan was limited to a single phone call in May 2011,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Said Dep. 85:10-15. Although evidence of additional race-based comments by Ryan would certainly bolster the plaintiff's showing of discriminatory intent, the Court cannot conclude that the absence of additional comments, especially under these circumstances, forecloses an inference of racial animus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that Ryan's alleged remark is evidence of Ryan's discriminatory intent that must be \"consider[ed] alongside ... all other evidence[ ] to determine whether [the] plaintiff has met her burden.\"\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310439,4323943\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/658/\">\n    825 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   670 (citing\n   <em>\n    Aka v.

For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that the plaintiff has identified sufficient evidence to cast doubt on some of the defendant's proffered reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    i. The Plaintiff's Alleged Failure to Communicate with the Defendant During Her \"Extended Leave of Absence\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The plaintiff first disputes the defendant's assertion that she \"fail[ed] to communicate\n   with Amtrak during her extended leave of absence,\" Def.'s Mem. at 6, arguing that \"she was in constant contact with\" her managers and supervisors, Pl.'s Opp'n at 3. Although it is not entirely clear what time period the defendant considers to be the plaintiff's \"extended leave of absence,\" the defendant appears to be referring to the period between April 2011 and February 2012, when the plaintiff attempted to return to work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 8 (asserting that the plaintiff \"did not speak with anyone at Amtrak from April 2011 until January 2012,\" \"except for bumping into [ ] Brewer in a grocery store\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1 (asserting that the plaintiff \"did not contact Amtrak for [ten] months about her status\"). The evidence before the Court, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, shows that during this time period, the plaintiff had at least three contacts with Amtrak employees. First, the plaintiff testified that she spoke with McClinton on the phone \"sometime before early May 2011,\" when McClinton called her to \"check[ ] to see how [she] was doing\" and told her that \"she[ ] [would] continue to put [her] on leave without pay.\" Said Dep. 85:16-20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6 18 (\"[The p]laintiff and [ ] McClinton spoke [ ] at some point in or around April 2011, at which time [ ] McClinton verbally extended [the p]laintiff's leave without a specific return date.\"). Second, the plaintiff testified that she spoke with Ryan on the phone sometime in May 2011, when he called her regarding a request for information he had received from her deceased husband's life insurance carrier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   57:4-14; 85:10-15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 28-29 (acknowledging that Ryan \"called [the p]laintiff on her phone\" when he \"received correspondence from [the p]laintiff's husband's insurance carrier,\" but asserting that the phone call occurred \"[i]n [or] about April 2011\"). And third, it is undisputed that the plaintiff spoke with Brewer in person at a grocery store in July 2011, when the two women unexpectedly encountered each other there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6 30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 18 (describing the encounter with Brewer as \"a chance/unscheduled face-to-face meeting\"). Although the Court is not convinced that a reasonable jury could find that the plaintiff's chance encounter with Brewer at the grocery store constitutes a \"communicat[ion] with Amtrak,\" Def.'s Mem. at 6, the facts show that her other contacts with McClinton and Ryan occurred when those employees were acting as representatives of Amtrak,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6 18 (agreeing that during McClinton's phone call with the plaintiff in or around April 2011, McClinton \"verbally extended the plaintiff's leave\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29 (representing that Ryan's phone call to the plaintiff concerned her husband's life insurance carrier's \"request[ ] that\n   <em>\n    Amtrak\n   </em>\n   verify certain information\" and \"\n   <em>\n    Amtrak's\n   </em>\n   response\" to that request (emphases added) ). Therefore, although the plaintiff does not assert that she had any other specific contacts with the defendant's employees during this extended leave of absence period,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Said Dep. 86:4-12 (testifying that after her May 2011 phone call with McClinton, she did not speak with McClinton again until February 2012), a jury could reasonably conclude from these two contacts that the plaintiff did not \"fail[ ] to communicate with Amtrak during her extended leave of absence,\" Def.'s Mem. at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Plaintiff's Alleged Failure to Advise the Defendant of the Reason She Continued to Be on Leave or Her Expected Return Date\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As to the defendant's assertion that the plaintiff \"fail[ed] to advise Amtrak of the reason she continued to be on leave,\" Def.'s Mem. at 6, which appears to refer to \"the reason she needed to continue her leave beyond the initial bereavement\n   period,\" Def.'s Reply at 8, the plaintiff argues that \"Amtrak[ ] and its managers ... knew everything about the reason behind [her] absence from work[ ] [and] her ill health, including surrounding circumstances and happenings,\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 18. As support, she argues that \"McClinton, ... Brewer, ... and ... [another employee] signed and put into her personnel file[ ] three [ ] separate Leave of Absence[ ] [ ] form[s] on [her] behalf,\" and that she discussed her health issues with her supervisors, presumably referring to Brewer and McClinton, who consequently \"gave her oral permission over the phone ... to take all the time she needed to get well[ ] before returning to work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (asserting that she \"informed [ ] McClinton that she had been dropped from her husband's health insurance, and that she ha[d] no money to pay for her doctors' visits or to buy needed medication, and asked [ ] McClinton whether Amtrak would cover her\"); Said Dep. 55:4-6 (testifying that \"McClinton and [ ] Brewer said [to her] take all the time that [you] need to get well\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant responds that the plaintiff \"\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   provided Amtrak with any doctor's note regarding her condition, nor did she tell anyone at Amtrak about the details of her medical condition,\" and \"[s]he also never notified her [U]nion that she needed an extended medical leave of absence or requested [Family and Medical Leave Act] leave from Amtrak.\" Def.'s Reply at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the Court concludes that the plaintiff has identified evidence creating a genuine factual dispute as to whether she \"fail[ed] to advise Amtrak of the reason she continued to be on leave.\" Def.'s Mem. at 6. First, the defendant admits that during the plaintiff's phone conversation with McClinton \"in or around April 2011, ... McClinton verbally extended [the plaintiff's] leave without a specific return date.\" Def.'s Facts \u00b6 18. A reasonable jury could find this fact compelling, given that McClinton presumably would not have extended the plaintiff's leave of absence without a reason provided by the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2338951,1567119\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/156/1284/\">\n    156 F.3d at 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Events have causes[.]\"). Furthermore, the plaintiff testified that during a phone call with McClinton sometime before early May 2011, potentially the same phone call just referenced, the plaintiff \"told [McClinton that she] still wasn't doing well\" and that her \"body was deteriorating,\" to which McClinton responded that she would \"continue to put [the plaintiff] on leave without pay.\" Said Dep. 85:16-86:3. The plaintiff further testified that when she spoke with Ryan over the phone in early May 2011, \"[h]e asked [her] how [she] was doing\" and she \"told him not that good,\" to which he responded, \"take all the time you need to get well to return to work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   57:10-14. Notably, the defendant does not appear to dispute the occurrence of these communications or their content.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem.; Def.'s Reply. Based on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that, contrary to the defendant's position,\n   the plaintiff did not \"fail[ ] to advise Amtrak of the reason she continued to be on leave.\" Def.'s Mem. at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In an apparent attempt to dispute that the plaintiff notified it of the reasons for her continued leave of absence, the defendant argues that \"the fact that the CBA governing [the p]laintiff's employment prohibits\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   leave exceeding [ninety] days without joint agreement between Amtrak and the [U]nion (which indisputably did not occur here) undermines any argument by [the p]laintiff that she had permission for an unlimited leave,\" Def.'s Reply at 8-9, invoking Rule 22 of the CBA,\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6 20 (\"McClinton did not have authority to grant a leave of absence of more than [ninety] days.\" (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Rule 22);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Said Dep., Ex. 3 (CBA) at 28-29 (\"Except for physical disability ..., leaves of absence in excess of ninety [ ] days in any calendar year shall not be granted unless by agreement between ... [Amtrak] and ... the [Union].\"). However, the significance of this argument is unclear to the Court, given that the defendant has not asserted that it terminated the plaintiff because she did not have \"permission\" to be on leave or, more specifically, because she violated Rule 22 of the CBA. Rather, it has admitted that \"in or around April 2011, McClinton verbally extended [the p]laintiff's leave without a specific return date,\" Def.'s Facts \u00b6 18, notwithstanding her alleged lack of authorization. Furthermore, in this litigation, it has explicitly invoked Rule 24, not Rule 22, as the reason for the plaintiff's termination,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 6 (\"[The p]laintiff was terminated pursuant to Rule 24 of the [ ] CBA[.]\"), and the Court is unaware of any evidence in the record demonstrating that at any point prior to this litigation, the defendant invoked lack of authorization or violation of Rule 22 as a justification for the plaintiff's termination. Therefore, for these reasons the Court concludes that this argument has no bearing on its summary judgment analysis of whether the plaintiff has identified sufficient evidence to cast doubt on the defendant's proffered reasons for the plaintiff's termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chudson v.

Although the plaintiff purports to dispute this assertion,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Opp'n at 4, she has not produced any evidence to demonstrate that she notified the defendant of her expected return-to-work date or that the defendant was otherwise aware of it. As the defendant points out,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 17, although the plaintiff testified in her deposition that her doctor estimated that she would be able to return to work on February 19, 2012,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Said Dep. 144:22-24, she also testified that she did not notify the defendant of that return-to-work date until she reported to work on February 7, 2012,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   143:19-144:10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6 38 (asserting that the plaintiff did not \"provide any information about an expected return to work date until approximately three months after her termination\" (emphasis removed) ). And, although the plaintiff testified that her return-to-work date appeared on a doctor's slip she submitted to the Board in connection with her sickness benefits claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Said Dep. 137:11-25 (testifying that a document introduced during the plaintiff's deposition as Exhibit\n   21 was a \"doctor's slip\" that reflected a return-to-work date of February 19, 2012);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   140:8-12 (testifying that she provided Exhibit 21 to the Board), she testified that she never provided this document to the defendant,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   140:19-21, and the plaintiff's broad claim that the Board must \"give a railroad employer notice whenever an application for [benefits] is made,\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 33, even if true, is plainly insufficient to establish that the Board specifically notified the defendant of the plaintiff's expected return-to-work date or provided the defendant with documentation of the date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. The Application by the Defendant of Rule 24 to the Plaintiff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The plaintiff also disputes that her conduct violated Rule 24 of the CBA. Specifically, she argues that \"Rule 24 is predicated on [an] employer's lack of knowledge of an employee's whereabouts,\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 18, and \"[b]ecause [the d]efendant knew that [she] was absent from work due to illness, ... Rule 24 was not available to [it] and [its] use of [the Rule] to terminate [the p]laintiff[ ] was [ ] pretext,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. The defendant argues that \"nothing in Rule 24 limits its use to cases where Amtrak has no information about the reason for an employee's absence,\" Def.'s Reply at 9, and nothing in the record demonstrates \"the circumstances under w[hich] [ ] [R]ule [24] is normally invoked,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. The defendant further argues that \"it is neither [the p]laintiff's nor the Court's role to question how Amtrak and the [Union] interpret Rule 24 or the circumstances under which Amtrak customarily invokes it, so long as there is no evidence of discriminatory application, as is the case here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although the defendant is correct that the plaintiff has not introduced any evidence of the circumstances under which Amtrak typically invokes Rule 24, the plaintiff's position that Rule 24 was inapplicable to her situation finds some support in the plain language of Rule 24, which purports to apply where an \"[e]mployee [ ] [is] absent from work for ten [ ] days\n   <em>\n    without notifying the corporation\n   </em>\n   .\" Said Dep., Ex. 3 (CBA) at 30 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court finds that because a reasonable jury could conclude that the plaintiff notified the defendant of her absence and the reasons for it,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.B.2.ii, it could also conclude that the plaintiff's conduct did not violate the letter of Rule 24, which in turn could lead the jury to be \"quite suspicious\" of the defendant's Rule 24 justification.\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310439,4323943\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/658/\">\n    825 F.3d at 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Evans v.

First, the plaintiff argues that the defendant \"intentionally sent her notice and termination letters via FedEx to her old address[,] because it was part of [its] scheme[ ] to insure that she d[id] not find out [about her termination i]n time[ ] to challenge her managers,\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 3, when it \"knew, ha[d] reason to know, or should have known ... her [correct] address,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Furthermore, she argues that pretext is demonstrated by the fact that the defendant \"sen[t] mail for a second time to the same address, when the first mail had come back undelivered,\" and\n   the \"[d]efendant and its managers and supervisors and Human Resources office, who had her telephone number in their 'system'-the same number [ ] Ryan called her on[ ] in April[ ] 2011 ..., did not use the phone and call [the plaintiff].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court concludes that the vast majority of the plaintiff's evidence fails to demonstrate that Ryan or anyone else involved in her termination knew or should have known her correct address. Although the plaintiff testified that \"Ryan had [her] address on the letter from the [life] insurance company that was sent to [her] home,\" Said Dep. 114:24-25, the plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence to demonstrate that Ryan received such a letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, although the plaintiff testified that McClinton and other employees knew her correct address,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Opp'n at 22 (asserting that she \"g[a]ve [her] address to [ ] McClinton\" and thereafter \"receive[d] a condolence card from [ ] McClinton at her new address\"); Said Dep. 116:13 (\"Everybody knew where I lived.\"), she does not claim that any of these people informed Ryan or anyone else who was involved in her termination of the new address,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n; Said Dep. Nor does she claim that Baylor, Brewer, or Bateman, the individuals who were copied on the defendant's Rule 24 correspondence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 48, 52, had knowledge of her new address. Indeed, she admits that \"she did not inform [her] Union\" of her new address. Said Dep. 101:18-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Moreover, as the defendant notes, the plaintiff has not shown that there is reason to believe that her address was ever updated in the defendant's records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 8 (\"[N]either Amtrak nor the [ ] Union had any [ ] address [other than her old address] on file for her[.]\"). She has not provided sufficient evidence to dispute Ryan's deposition testimony that the plaintiff's address on record when the Rule 24 correspondence was sent was her District of Columbia address,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Facts \u00b6 47 (asserting that in preparing the Rule 24 notification letter, \"Ryan ... us[ed] the address on file in Amtrak's [ ] database ...

And, evidence in the record regarding her attempts to update her address with the defendant does not establish that those attempts were ultimately successful,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Said Dep. 113:17-25 (asserting that she faxed her new address to the defendant's Wilmington, Delaware office \"about a week after ... [she] moved\" but that she was uncertain as to whether she received a fax receipt confirmation);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   id. 115:12-15 (testifying that she could not remember whether she received or returned a change-of-address form sent to her by Amtrak in April 2011), particularly in light of the defendant's assertion that it \"has no record of a fax from [the p]laintiff in or around February 2011[,] regarding a change of address,\" Def.'s Facts \u00b6 26, and that it \"has no record of [the p]laintiff returning the change-of-address form ... sent to her in April 2011,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   However, the Court cannot entirely dismiss the plaintiff's argument that pretext is to some extent demonstrated by the circumstances surrounding the defendant's Rule 24 correspondence. First, the plaintiff has provided some, albeit very little, evidence that Ryan knew her correct address at the time he sent her Rule 24 correspondence, in the form of her testimony that \"Ryan knew about [her] new address because [during their] call[ ] ... [in the] first part of May [2011],\" Said Dep. 124:23-24, \"[she] told him [she] had moved,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   125:7-8. Second, it is undisputed that approximately six months later, when the Rule 24 notification letter was returned as undeliverable, \"Ryan ... did not use the phone and call [the plaintiff].\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 32. Although the defendant argues that \"Ryan did not attempt to contact [the p]laintiff by telephone[ ] because it is Amtrak's policy to send Rule 24 communications exclusively in writing, so as to have a clear record of the same,\" Def.'s Facts \u00b6 51 (citing Ryan Dep. 53:20-56:4), and that \"[i]t is not the Court's role to assess whether Amtrak's procedures were optimal, but [only] whether its actions were motivated by discrimination,\" Def.'s Mem. at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    Dudley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326989\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/924/141/#p169\">\n    924 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   169 ), \"the plaintiff's attack on the employer's explanation must always be assessed in light of the total circumstances of the case,\"\n   <em>\n    Aka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2338951,1567119\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/156/1284/\">\n    156 F.3d at 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And it is undisputed that in or around May 2011, just six months before he sent the Rule 24 notification letter, Ryan \"called [the p]laintiff on her phone (the number of which did not change when she moved)\" and spoke to her regarding her life insurance claim. Def.'s Facts \u00b6 29. Therefore, although the record demonstrates that Ryan did make some effort to investigate the plaintiff's\n   correct address after the Rule 24 notification letter was returned as undeliverable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50 (asserting that Ryan \"contacted [ ] Bateman to determine whether the [Union] had a different address for [the p]laintiff\"), it is clear that Ryan knew of another way to contact the plaintiff, but failed to use it. The Court concludes that a reasonable jury could be \"quite suspicious\" of this omission in light of the other evidence proffered by the plaintiff, including the plaintiff's testimony that Ryan knew she had moved, as well as other evidence undermining some of the defendant's proffered reasons for her termination and the plaintiff's testimony regarding Ryan's allegedly racially discriminatory remark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310439,4323943\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/658/\">\n    825 F.3d at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that a plaintiff cast doubt on the defendant's explanation for her suspension in part because her supervisor provided \"unpersuasive explanations for [her] failure\" to reply to a memorandum accusing the plaintiff of unprofessional conduct).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In sum, the plaintiff has identified facts in the record sufficient to cast doubt on two of the defendant's proffered reasons for her termination-that the plaintiff failed to communicate with the defendant during her extended leave of absence and failed to notify the defendant of the reason for her extended leave of absence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 6-and to make a reasonable jury \"quite suspicious\" of the defendant's application of Rule 24 to the plaintiff and the circumstances surrounding the defendant's Rule 24 correspondence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310439,4323943\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/658/\">\n    825 F.3d at 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court acknowledges that the plaintiff has not cast doubt on all of the defendant's proffered reasons for her termination, specifically, that the plaintiff did not communicate her expected return-to-work date to the defendant and did not respond to the defendant's Rule 24 correspondence, and that in the absence of any other evidence of discrimination, this might mean that the plaintiff's evidence attacking the legitimacy of the proffered reasons would fall short.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Barbour\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11665045,3670518\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/181/1342/\">\n    181 F.3d at 1347-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that evidence that \"calls into doubt only part of the [defendant]'s proffered explanation\" was not sufficient to demonstrate pretext in light of the plaintiff's \"inability to adduce any other evidence\").
