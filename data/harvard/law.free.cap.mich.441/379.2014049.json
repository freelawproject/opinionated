The issue is whether summary disposition was properly granted in favor of the defendant manufacturers and sellers on the basis that they had no duty to warn of the danger of a headfirst dive into the shallow water of an aboveground pool, which the parties do not dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>is a simple tool,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that is, a product all of whose essential characteristics are fully apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The lengthy factual and procedural background for this inquiry is set forth in the appendix. In brief, each plaintiff sustained tragic injuries when he dove into the shallow water of an aboveground pool. Each previously had been in the pool in question and each acknowledged that he knew the depth of the water in the pool and that a deep dive into shallow water was dangerous. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in <em>Glittenberg v </em>Wilcenski, 174 Mich App 321; 435 NW2d 480 (1989), and <em>Horen v Coleco Industries, Inc, </em>169 Mich App 725; 426 NW2d 794 (1988), and affirmed summary disposition in <em>Spaulding v Lesco Int\u2019l Corp, </em>182 Mich App 285; 451 NW2d 603 (1990). This Court\u2019s plurality result in <em>Glittenberg v Doughboy Recreational Industries, Inc, </em>436 Mich 673; 462 NW2d 348 (1990) <em>(Glittenberg </em>I), led to rehearing and consolidation of these cases. 437 Mich 1224 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">After meticulous consideration of the records below and the significant issues implicated,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we now hold that summary disposition was properly granted in favor of the defendants. The manufacturer of a simple product has no duty to warn of the product\u2019s potentially dangerous conditions or characteristics that are readily apparent or visible upon casual inspection and reasonably expected to be recognized by the average user of ordinary intelligence. On this record we conclude that the product is not defective or unreasonably dangerous for want of a warning. Because the duty question involves the issue of fault for which there is no material issue of fact, we reverse the decisions of the Court of Appeals in <em>Glittenberg </em>and <em>Horen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Spaulding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">In the products context, duty to warn has been described as an exception to the general rule of nonrescue, imposing an obligation on sellers to transmit safety-related information when they know or should know that the buyer or user is unaware of that information. As agreed in <em>Glittenberg, </em>the question of duty is to be decided by the trial court as a matter of law. <em>Antcliff v State Employees Credit Union, </em>414 Mich 624, 640; 327 NW2d 814 (1982); <em>Smith v Allendale Mutual Ins Co, </em>410 Mich 685, 713-715; 303 NW2d 702 (1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Most jurisdictions that have addressed similar cases have been unwilling to impose liability on the pool manufacturer or seller.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Summary judgment in favor of the defendant has been based on lack of a causal connection between the alleged negligent failure to warn and the plaintiff\u2019s injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Courts typically focus on the plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony, establishing familiarity with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>pool and awareness of the depth of the water in relation to the body, and hence recognition of the need to execute a shallow, flat dive in order to avoid contact with the bottom of the pool and injury. From this, it is concluded that, because the plaintiff was aware of the shallow condition of the pool\u2019s water and the dangers inherent in a headfirst dive into observably shallow water, the absence of a warning conveying those very facts could not be a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Although these cases could be decided on the fact specific basis of causation, the temptation to do so or to rely on the observation that a jury should be permitted to determine whether the asserted danger is latent, Levin, J., <em>post, </em>p 418, simply postpones to another day the need to grapple with the more difficult duty analysis. On the record here presented, we find that the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence fails to demonstrate the existence of a necessary antecedent to resolution of the causation issue, i.e., that the defendants owe the plaintiffs a duty to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Manufacturers have a duty to warn purchasers or users of dangers associated with the intended use or reasonably foreseeable misuse of their products,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but the scope of the duty is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>unlimited.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As one commentator observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">If there were an obligation to warn against all injuries that conceivably might result from the use or misuse of a product, manufacturers would find it practically impossible to market their goods. [Noel, <em>Products defective because of inadequate directions or warnings, </em>23 SW L J 256, 264 (1969).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">A manufacturer\u2019s or seller\u2019s duty to warn of its product\u2019s potentially dangerous condition \"is not a duty which necessarily attaches to the status of manufacturer or seller, nor is it one which exists regardless of the nature of the product.\u201d Anno: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>Manufacturer\u2019s or seller\u2019s duty to give warnings regarding product as affecting his liability for product-caused injury, </em>76 ALR2d 9, 16. For policy reasons, the law qualifies a manufacturer\u2019s duty to warn by declaring some risks to be outside that duty. See <em>Antcliff, supra </em>at 630-631,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Elbert v Saginaw, </em>363 Mich 463, 475-476; 109 NW2d 879 (1961),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and <em>Friedman v Dozorc, </em>412 Mich 1, 22; 312 NW2d 585 (1981).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">A duty is imposed on a manufacturer or seller to warn under negligence principles summarized in \u00a7 388 of 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, pp 300-301.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Basically, the manufacturer or seller must (a) have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>actual or constructive knowledge of the claimed danger, (b) have \"no reason to believe that those for whose use the chattel is supplied will realize its dangerous condition,\u201d and (c) \"fail to exercise reasonable care to inform [users] of its dangerous condition or of the facts which make it likely to be dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Comment k to subsection 388(b) explains the conditions necessary for recognition of the duty to warn, stating the generally accepted rule that a manufacturer or seller has no duty to warn of open and obvious dangers connected with an otherwise nondefective product.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See anno: 76 ALR2d 38. See also 3 American Law of Products Liability, 3d, \u00a7 33:25, p 52. A manufacturer has no duty to warn if it reasonably perceives that the potentially dangerous condition of the product is readily apparent or may be disclosed by a mere casual inspection, and it cannot be said that only persons of special experience will realize that the product\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>condition or characteristic carries with it a potential danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">In the context of warnings of the obvious danger of simple products, the duty inquiry asks whether people must be told what they already know. Warnings protect consumers where the manufacturer or seller has superior knowledge of the products\u2019 dangerous characteristics and those to whom the warning would be directed would be ignorant of the facts that a warning would communicate. Thus, it has been observed that no duty exists where \"the consumer is in just as good a position as the manufacturer to gauge the dangers associated with the product . ...\u201d 3 Products Liability, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 33:25, p 55. Anno: 76 ALR2d 29-30. See also Madden, <em>The duty to warn in products liability: Contours and criticism, </em>89 W Va L R 221, 231 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The seminal case regarding \"simple tools\u201d is <em>Jamieson v Woodward &amp; Lothrup, </em>101 US App DC 32, 35, 37; 247 F2d 23 (1957), cert den 355 US 855 (1957). The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">A manufacturer cannot manufacture a knife that will not cut or a hammer that will not mash a thumb or a stove that will not burn a finger. The law does not require [a manufacturer] to warn of such common dangers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">[W]here a manufactured article is a simple thing of universally known characteristics, not a device with parts or mechanism, the only danger being not latent but obvious to any possible user, if the article does not break or go awry, but injury occurs through a mishap in normal use, the article reacting in its normal and foreseeable manner, the manufacturer is not liable for negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Determination of the \"obvious\u201d character of a product-connected danger is objective. The focus is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>the typical user\u2019s perception and knowledge and whether the relevant condition or feature that creates the danger associated with use is fully apparent, widely known, commonly recognized, and anticipated by the ordinary user or consumer. 3 Products Liability, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 33:22, p 47.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Open and obvious dangers are <em>conditions </em>that create a risk of harm that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">is visible, ... is a well known danger, or ... is discernible by casual inspection. Thus, one cannot be heard to say that he did not know of a dangerous condition that was so obvious that it was apparent to those of ordinary intelligence. [3 Products Liability, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 33:26, p 56.][<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Thus, a plaintiff\u2019s subjective knowledge is immaterial to the antecedent determination of an open and obvious danger. It is relevant, rather, to the determination whether, given the existence of a duty, the defendant\u2019s failure to. warn was the legal or proximate cause of a plaintiff\u2019s injuries. 3 Products Liability, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 33:23, pp 48-50.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Our jurisprudence recognizes the well-established rule that there is no duty to warn of dangers that are open and obvious.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We have also narrowed application of the no-duty rule to those cases involving \"simple tools or products.\u201d <em>Owens v Allis-Chalmers Corp, </em>414 Mich 413, 425; 326 NW2d 372 (1982). We have rejected the proposition that the \"open and obvious danger\u201d rule is an incantation that obviates the threshold inquiry of duty in design defect cases. We have not held that the duty inquiry should be similarly limited as to the obligation to communicate safety-related infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>mation upon which the warnings leg of products liability claims rest.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, the narrow issue presented here is whether there is a duty to warn of the dangerous characteristics of a simple product that are readily apparent or easily discoverable upon casual inspection by the average user of ordinary intelligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">In the design defect context, obvious risks may unreasonably breach the duty to adopt a design that safely and feasibly guards against foreseeable misuse. Because the manufacturer\u2019s liability for choice of design is not determined solely by looking at the obvious nature of the alleged defect, obviousness of the danger does not preclude the possibility that an alternative design could reduce the risk of harm at a cost and in a manner that maintains the product\u2019s utility. <em>Owens, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">In the failure to warn context, the obvious nature of the simple product\u2019s potential danger serves the core purpose of the claim, i.e., it functions as an inherent warning that the risk is present. Stated otherwise, if the risk is obvious from the characteristics of the product, the product itself telegraphs the precise warning that plaintiffs complain is lacking.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See Henderson &amp; Twerski, <em>Doctrinal collapse in products liability: </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>The empty shell of failure to warn, </em>65 NYU L R 265, 282 (1990). Thus, this is not a situation in which duty is based on the negligence principle of omission to protect against foreseeable injury. Nor is it a situation where the manufacturer is held to a higher standard to protect against unknown or unappreciated properties of the product or in its use, <em>Jennings v Tamaker Corp, </em>42 Mich App 310; 201 NW2d 654 (1972). The dissent\u2019s observation notwithstanding,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> all properties of the pools in these cases were knowable, and known. The fact that most individuals do not understand how the laws of physics operate during a dive no more alters the perceived danger in the use of this product than failure to understand the medical reasons why a cut with a knife that severed a major artery could lead to death or catastrophic injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">In a simple product situation, the warning leg of products liability for products in normal use presents no real risk/utility issue, nor does it serve to protect a knowledgeable user who is distracted or inattentive. Thus, the obvious nature of the danger serves the exact function as a warning that the risk is present. Reduced to its simplest terms, the obvious danger rule in the context of a warning with regard to a simple product is both fair and logical. Where a warning is not needed because the product\u2019s potentially dangerous condition (and not the consequences of ignoring that condition) is fully evident, providing a warning does not serve to make the product safer.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">There is no duty to warn as to the obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>danger of a simple product because an obvious danger is no danger to a \"reasonably\u201d careful person. See <em>Pomer v Schoolman, </em>873 F2d 1262 (CA 7, 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The dissent\u2019s resort to rhetoric requires us to emphasize that today\u2019s holding signals no retreat from <em>Owens</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Obviousness of danger is merely one factor in the analysis of whether a design is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">We hold today only, that where the very condition that is alleged to cause the injury is <em>wholly </em>revealed by casual observation of a simple product in normal use, a duty to warn serves no fault-based purpose, <em>Prentis v Yale Mfg Co, </em>421 Mich 670; 365 NW2d 176 (1984), and that this approach is consistent with <em>Owens, supra. </em>It is one thing to say in a design defect case, even if a danger is open and obvious, that a manufacturer has a duty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>if feasible, to adopt a design to minimize harm and that the manufacturer is at fault if it does not do so. It is quite another thing to say that a manufacturer has an obligation to warn of a simple product\u2019s potentially dangerous condition when the condition is readily apparent and its danger widely recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Warning analysis is not preferable to design defect analysis as an approach to products liability. That there may be limited situations when a product implicitly states its warning through the openness of the danger in normal use must not obscure the fact that the ultimate inquiry in products liability is the safety of the overall design.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A warning is not a Band-Aid to cover a gaping wound, and a product is not safe simply because it carries a warning. See, generally, Twerski, Weinstein, Donaher &amp; Piehler, <em>The use and abuse of warnings in products liability </em>\u2014 design <em>defect litigation comes of age, </em>61 Cornell L R 495 (1976). The converse is also true; design defect analysis must not be used to evaluate failure to warn claims. When a design defect claim is examined, the obvious nature of the product-connected danger will not preclude a court from entertaining a plaintiff\u2019s claim that an alternative design could feasibly reduce the risk of injury. However, when a negligent failure to warn claim is examined, the open and obvious danger of a simple product may preclude a plaintiff from establishing the requirement of duty of the prima facie case.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Our holding does not \"effectively immunize[] manufacturers and sellers of aboveground swimming pools from liability . . . <em>Post, </em>pp 413-414. We do not hold that there is no duty to warn regarding all conditions alleged to be open and obvious. Whether the condition is open and obvious, and whether the very danger asserted is the cause of an injury that a warning would allegedly have prevented, must be addressed on a product-byproduct basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In summary, when a defendant claims that it owes no duty to warn because of the obvious nature of a danger, a court is required, as a threshold matter, to decide that issue. The court must determine whether reasonable minds could differ with respect to whether the danger is open and obvious.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> If reasonable minds cannot differ on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the \"obvious\u201d character of the product-connected danger, the court determines the question as a matter of law. If, on the other hand, the court determines that reasonable minds could differ, the obviousness of risk must be determined by the jury. 3 Products Liability, supra, \u00a7 33:42, pp 69-70.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Viewing the materials presented by plaintiffs in the most favorable light, there is no dispute that the aboveground pools are simple products. No one can mistake them for other than what they are, i.e., large containers of water that sit on the ground, all characteristics and features of which are readily apparent or easily discernible upon casual inspection. As Justice Griffin highlighted in <em>Glittenberg I, supra </em>at 695-696:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">[TJhere is nothing deceiving about [their] appearance, nothing enigmatic about [their] properties. [They have] no mechanical devices, but rather [are] uncomplicated . . . produces] with universally known characteristics._</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>The condition creating the asserted danger, i.e., shallow water, is a fact that is readily apparent or discoverable upon casual inspection. The record evidence does not counter that fact. The records and reasonable inferences do not support the contention that the potential for injury from a dive into the observably shallow water of these pools is not a common and generally recognized danger. The record does not support the inference that users of aboveground pools are not aware of the general risk of injury,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and special experience is not required to perceive the danger or risk of injury presented by the shallow water.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The obvious risk of this simple product is the danger of hitting the bottom. When such a risk is objectively determinable, warnings that parse the risk are not required. The general danger encompasses the risk of the specific injury sustained. In other words, the risk of hitting the bottom encompasses the risk of catastrophic injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The gravamen of each of the plaintiff\u2019s argument is that the danger presented is not open and obvious because the specific harm of paralysis or death is not generally recognized.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Horen and Spaulding add the argument that the danger is not open and obvious because the average user does not generally recognize that the laws of physics, biomechanics, and hydrodynamics can transform a miscalculated shallow dive into a deep dive that is recognized as dangerous.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> However, the threshold issue is not whether a shallow dive can be successfully executed but, rather, whether people in general are unaware of the fact that there is a risk of serious harm when diving in shallow water. The fact that all plaintiffs acknowledged the necessity to perform a shallow dive simply underscores the conclusion that the risk of diving in shallow water is open and obvious. In effect, plaintiffs seek to convert the duty to warn argument by conceding a readily apparent and generally recognized dangerous condition for which no duty exists, while claiming that because a specific consequence or degree of harm from that dangerous condition, i.e., paralysis or death, is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>generally recognized, a specific warning is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">There is no question that under either negligence or strict liability principles, a fault-based theory of liability will be recognized where the product is defective, either because its design presents an unreasonable danger given the conditions of use, or because there is an unknown risk in use of the product.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> However, where the facts of record require the conclusion that the risk of serious harm from the asserted condition is open and obvious, and no disputed question exists regarding the danger of the product, the law does not impose a duty upon a manufacturer to warn of all conceivable ramifications of injuries that might occur from the use or foreseeable misuse of the product.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> As the court observed in <em>Jamieson, supra </em>at 39:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">[S]urely a manufacturer, to be protected from liability for negligence, need not enumerate the possible injuries which might befall one .... We have in the case at bar a detached retina, but we might have had any of an infinite number of injuries to eye, mouth, ear, nose, etc. We do not agree with, and find no authority to support, a holding either that a manufacturer must utter a general warning of danger from mishap with an article such as this rope or that he must catalog injuries possible upon such a mishap.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">See also Noel, <em>supra, </em>p 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">These are difficult cases.

Each sued, alleging that his injuries were proximately caused by the pool manufacturer\u2019s or seller\u2019s negligence in failing to provide a warning against diving.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">A. <em>GLITTENBERG v DOUGHBOY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">David Glittenberg was permanently paralyzed when he struck his head on the bottom on an aboveground swimming pool. Mr. Glittenberg testified that he intended to make a shallow or surface dive from the shallow end of the pool toward his wife who was on a floating chair in the deep end of the pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">The pool, located in the backyard of the plaintiff\u2019s neighborhood friends, the Wilcenskis, was built into the side of a hill at the rear end of the house so that the top edge of the pool itself was approximately two feet above the ground level on the west end, and approximately fo\u00fcr feet above the ground level on the east end. Doughboy Recreational Industries manufactured the pool, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>which was surrounded by an attached redwood deck and fence. The water level was approximately three and one-half feet in the shallow end and seven and one-half feet at the deepest point. There was a ledge three and one-half feet below the water line to allow easy access to the water. There was no ladder, no diving board, no depth markings, and no warnings against diving posted on or near the pool.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">It is undisputed that the plaintiff was an experienced swimmer and diver, and that he was familiar with the pool, including its depth, having been in the pool at least twice before the accident. He was aware that a deep dive into shallow water was dangerous because he could hit the pool bottom and possibly break an arm or suffer a concussion. However, he considered it safe to make a shallow dive in shallow water, if you \"were versed in diving and knew what type of dive you were doing . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Mr. Glittenberg brought an action against the defendant, Doughboy, and others, alleging in pertinent part that he was seriously and permanently injured as a result of the defendants\u2019 negligent conduct in failing to warn of the grave risk of paralysis or death that is inherent when diving into an aboveground pool. The trial court granted Doughboy\u2019s motion for summary disposition on the basis that, because the swimming pool was a simple product and the hazards of diving into its shallow water were open and obvious, the defendant had no duty to warn the plaintiff under these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>facts.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s subsequent motion for rehearing was denied.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court, 174 Mich App 326, holding that the open and obvious danger rule is no longer viable in Michigan and that, under the facts of this case, the swimming pool was not a simple tool, and the danger of paraplegia was not open and obvious:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">Nothing in the appearance of the pool itself gives a warning of the very serious consequences to which a mundane dive can lead. Nor are we convinced that the danger of serious injury from a dive is a risk of which the public is generally aware.[<footnotemark>38</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Doughboy appealed, and we granted leave to appeal, 433 Mich 880 (1989).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> However, because the majority was unable to agree on the viability of the open and obvious danger doctrine in cases raising a negligent failure to warn claim, the Court ordered the case remanded to the trial court for a determination of the threshold question whether the duty of reasonable care required a warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">B. <em>HOREN v COLECO INDUSTRIES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">On July 3, 1981, Bill Horen was permanently paralyzed from the chest down when he attempted a shallow or surface-type dive from the deck partially surrounding his in-laws\u2019 pool and struck his head on the bottom. At the time of the accident, plaintiff was thirty-three years of age, five feet ten inches tall, and weighed 150 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The pool measured four feet in height and twenty-four feet in diameter and included partial, manufacturer-supplied<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> decking and fencing which totally enclosed the pool and deck area. There was a ladder leading up to the enclosed pool area and another leading into the water. The center of the pool was dug out to a depth of approximately five feet. The water level ranged from approximately three and one-half feet to four and one-half feet. At the time of the accident</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">[t]he pool contained only one small, faded and peeling warning label affixed at the base of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>corner of the chain-link wall adjoining the deck, which read: \"No Diving. Shallow Water.\u201d However, Mr. Horen testified that he saw no warning labels or signs in or around the pool to indicate that there should be no diving. He also testified that he was a recreational swimmer of limited swimming and diving experience and that he had never received any diving instruction. [169 Mich App 727.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">On the date of the accident, Mr. Horen had not been drinking and was not taking medication. He testified that he had swum in the Coxes\u2019 pool once before the accident, had successfully dived from the deck area at that time and on the day of the accident, and, on both occasions, he had seen other adults successfully dive into the pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Plaintiff acknowledged that he could see the bottom of the pool from the deck, could tell the depth of the water by where it was in relation to his body, that he was aware of some danger of hitting the bottom of the pool, and that he could scrape or bruise himself if he performed a deep dive. However, he believed the Coxes\u2019 pool was a safe depth for a surface or shallow-type dive.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">As in <em>Glittenberg, </em>the thrust of plaintiff\u2019s claims is that the defendants breached a duty to warn of the dangers of diving into the pool. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition brought pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(8),<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> concluding that, because the danger involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>diving headfirst into an aboveground swimming pool is open and obvious, the pool manufacturer had no duty to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court, concluding, as did the panel in Glittenberg, that this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Fisher v Johnson Milk Co, Inc, </em>383 Mich 158; 174 NW2d 752 (1970), that there is no duty to warn of an obvious danger associated with a simple product or tool, had been modified by <em>Owens v Allis-Chalmers Corp, supra. </em>Thus, the panel held, where the injury was reasonably foreseeable, a jury question remained concerning whether the manufacturer used reasonable care in guarding against unreasonable, foreseeable injuries, even where the danger was obvious.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">C. <em>SPAULDING v LESCO INT\u2019L CORP</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Allan Spaulding was rendered quadriplegic as a result of diving into and striking his head on the bottom of an aboveground swimming pool at the home of his friend, Richard Henwood. The pool measured twenty-four feet in diameter by four feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>in height and the depth of water varied from approximately three and one-half feet at the sides to approximately four feet at the center.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Mr. Henwood estimated the water depth in the center to be about forty-six or forty-seven inches. On the day in question, plaintiff dived from a small eighteen-inch by eighteen-inch wooden platform that sat a few inches above the lip of the Henwood pool at the top of an \"a\u201d frame metal ladder that provided access to the pool. No warnings against diving were displayed on any part of the pool or the ladder.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> At the time of the accident, plaintiff was thirty-six years old, six feet tall, weighed 215 pounds, and considered himself to be a good swimmer. He had received some instructions in diving, could not recall any specifics, but had been in the Henwood pool on at least one prior occasion, and was in the pool at least fifteen to twenty minutes on the day of the accident. Mr. Spaulding testified that he stood upright in the pool and was aware that the depth of the water was somewhere around his chest level, and that during the time that he was in the pool on August 5, he got in and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>out of the pool about ten to fifteen times, jumped from the platform into the pool, and dived headfirst from the platform into the pool two to four times.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Plaintiff sued the defendants, claiming they breached duties owed him under a number of theories including negligent design, manufacture, and warning, and breach of express and implied warranties of fitness and safety. The trial court granted summary disposition in favor of the defendants, essentially finding in pertinent part regarding all defendants no duty to warn of the open and obvious danger of diving into shallow water. <em>Spaulding v Lesco Int\u2019l Corp, supra </em>at 289-290.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Plaintiff appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Disagreeing with the <em>Horen </em>and <em>Glittenberg </em>panels, the <em>Spaulding </em>Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">[A] manufacturer still has no duty to warn of obvious and patent dangers when a simple product is involved. We believe that the above-ground pool in this case was a simple product and that the dangers of making a deep dive into the pool were obvious. Moreover, we agree with the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the failure to warn in this case was not the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Plaintiff knew how deep the water was, how tall he was, and the dangers of making a deep dive into shallow water, including breaking his neck. <em>[Id. </em>at 293.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The trial court in each case granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition on the basis that the danger of diving into shallow water was open and obvious and that the defendants therefore owed the plaintiffs no duty to warn of the danger. The Court of Appeals reversed the ruling of the trial court in <em>Glittenberg v Wilcenski </em>and in <em>Horen v Coleco Industries, Inc, </em>and affirmed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>trial court ruling in <em>Spaulding v Lesco Int\u2019l Corp. </em>This Court\u2019s plurality result in <em>Glittenberg v Doughboy Recreational Industries, Inc, </em>led to rehearing and consolidation with <em>Horen </em>and <em>Spaulding. </em>437 Mich 1224 (1991).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-6\"> A different issue would be presented if it were contended that the pools involved in these cases could not be so characterized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\"> The prior record was inadequate to allow us to evaluate whether a material issue of fact regarding the open and obviousness of the danger could be created.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\"> See Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 96, p 686; 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 388, pp 300-301; 3 American Law of Products Liability, 3d, \u00a7 33:25, pp 52-54; and Twerski, Weinstein, Donaher &amp; Piehler, <em>The use and abuse of warnings in products liability </em>\u2014 design <em>defect litigation comes of age, </em>61 Cornell L R 495, 523-524 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b546-10\"><em> </em>See cases cited in n 5 and also <em>Smith v Stark, </em>103 AD2d 844; 478 NYS2d 353 (1984); <em>Neff v Coleco Industries, Inc, </em>760 F Supp 864 (D Kan, 1991); <em>Mucowski v Clark, </em>404 Pa Super 197; 590 A2d 348 (1991); <em>Greibler v Doughboy Recreational, Inc, </em>160 Wis 2d 547; 466 NW2d 897 (1991); <em>Winant v Carefree Pools, </em>709 F Supp 57 (ED NY, 1989).

The Court concluded that this Court\u2019s \"prior decisions support a policy that a manufacturer\u2019s standard of care includes the dissemination of such information, whether styled as warnings or instructions, as is appropriate for the safe use of its product.

The Court was careful to note that the manufacturer\u2019s interests are also entitled to protection. Furthermore, in <em>Owens v Allis-Chalmers Corp, </em>414 Mich 413, 432; 326 NW2d 372 (1982), and <em>Prentis v Yale Mfg Co, </em>421 Mich 670, 683; 365 NW2d 176 (1984), this Court recognized that product manufacturers and sellers are not insurers and, thus, they are not \"absolutely liable for any and all injuries sustained from the use of [their] products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The dissent cites <em>Moning v Alfono, </em>400 Mich 425; 254 NW2d 759 (1977), to support the argument that placing a product on the market creates the requisite relationship between a manufacturer and persons affected by use of the product giving rise to a legal obligation or duty to the persons so affected, <em>post, </em>p 420, n 17. However, we note that the Court in <em>Moning </em>relied on Prosser, Torts (4th ed), \u00a7 37, p 206, which provided: \"It is no part of the province of a jury to decide whether a manufacturer of goods is under any obligation for the safety of the ultimate consumer,\u201d to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">It is now established that the manufacturer and wholesaler of a product, by marketing it, owe a legal duty to those affected by its use.

The scope of their duty now also extends to a bystander.

Both of those cases involved manufacturer liability when defectively made products foreseeably injured innocent bystanders. Imposing a duty of safety upon retailers and manufacturers to persons injured by the use or misuse of a product sold, without regard to the type of product, the method of marketing, or whether it was defective, is in effect, absolute liability; a concept rejected by this Court in <em>Prentis v Yale Mfg Co, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b549-5\"> This Court stated in <em>Antcliff </em>at 631:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">The terse legal conclusion that a duty is owed by one to another represents a judgment, as a matter of policy, that the latter\u2019s interests are entitled to legal protection against the former\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> As the <em>Elbert </em>Court elucidated at 476:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">[T]he problem of duty is simply the problem of the degree to which one\u2019s uncontrolled and undisciplined activities will be curtailed by the courts in recognition of the needs of organized society. ...

However, the condition, although readily observable, may be one which only persons of special experience would realize to be dangerous. In such case, if the supplier, having such special experience, knows that the condition involves danger and has no reason to believe that those who use it will have such special experience as will enable them to perceive the danger, he is required to inform them of the risk of which he himself knows and which he has no reason to suppose that they will realize.

Richardson, diving coach at the University of Michigan, testified that divers do not really understand the potential for serious injury when diving in a shallow pool: \"the general public just does not understand about entering the water and what can happen, even at depths that appear to be, to everybody concerned, safe depths .... <em>It\u2019s just a lot more going on there than </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>people understand and can imagine is going on.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The majority argues that \"[t]he fact that all plaintiffs acknowledged the necessity to perform a shallow dive simply underscores the conclusion that the risk of diving in shallow water is open and obvious.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Performance of a shallow dive, while it is evidence that the diver recognizes a need to modify his actions in response to a perceived danger, is also evidence that divers incorrectly perceive that execution of a shallow dive is sufficient protection from the danger presented by diving in a shallow aboveground swimming pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Viewing the evidence most favorably to the plaintiffs, we would conclude that they offered sufficient evidence both of the latency of the specific risk of catastrophic injury, and that divers are unaware of the risks posed by diving in shallow water, to pose a genuine issue of material fact whether the specific risk is open and obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The majority frames the analysis by distinguishing design defect cases from failure to warn cases for the purpose of applying the open and obvious, or \"patent\u201d danger rule. The majority, while acknowledging that the decision of this Court in <em>Owens v Allis-Chalmers Corp, </em>414 Mich 413; 326 NW2d 372 (1982), abrogated the patent danger rule in design defect cases, holds that the open and obvious/patent danger rule still governs in failure to warn cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">The patent danger rule was abrogated in <em>Owens, supra, </em>because, in part, the rule removed the incentive for adopting safer product designs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The correlative rationale applies to a failure to warn; a manufacturer should provide warnings that make a product safer to use.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">To be sure, there is no legal obligation to supply \"superfluous\u201d warnings, warnings that are by definition unneeded. A superfluous warning is not required because a warning is required only when it would make the product safer to use. We all agree that a product warning that does not apprise a consumer of anything of which he is not already aware does not make a product safer to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The plaintiffs in the instant cases do not claim that the defendants should have warned of obvious dangers associated with aboveground swimming pools. The plaintiffs claim rather that there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>risk of catastrophic injury, quadriplegia, that may result from diving in shallow aboveground pools, that this risk is <em>not </em>obvious, and that such pools would be safer to use if manufacturers provided a warning concerning the risk of catastrophic injury. A jury might properly conclude from the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence that the asserted danger is latent, and that a warning would make the product safer to use. Such a warning would not, on such a finding, be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The majority attaches considerable significance to what it describes as the \"simple\u201d character of aboveground pools. The majority argues that because an aboveground pool is a \"simple product\u201d its inherent \"characteristics and features . . . are readily apparent or easily discernible upon casual inspection.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">This description of \"simple product\u201d begs the question, since it assumes that all characteristics of a \"simple\u201d product are universally known, and therefore such products cannot present a latent danger. Under the majority\u2019s approach, a latent danger could never be found, and a warning never would be needed with a \"simple product\u201d because the characteristics of such products are, <em>by definition, </em>\"universally known.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">At some point \"simplicity\u201d and \"complexity\u201d come full circle. If simple products require no warnings because their characteristics are universally known, so too complex products because their characteristics are universally unknown, and consumers should reasonably treat them with caution. If a car battery is not a simple product, then it can be argued that it is mysterious enough to warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>extreme caution in its use.

The pertinent inquiry is whether a danger is latent.

However, four of the cases, <em>Winant, </em>n 28 <em>supra, Howard, </em>n 23 <em>supra, Belling, </em>n 23 <em>supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>and <em>Smith, </em>n 24 <em>supra, </em>were decided under the law of a single jurisdiction, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">A variation on the swimming pool cases is found in <em>Griebler v Doughboy Recreational, Inc, </em>160 Wis 2d 547, 560; 466 NW2d 897 (1991), where the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that diving in water of unknown depth presented a danger open and obvious as a matter of law. The plaintiff presented testimony from experts to the effect that the average consumer does not appreciate the risks of diving into water of unknown depth. The nature of the analysis is unclear, but the court appears to have looked at proximate cause instead of duty issues. The plaintiff apparently introduced expert testimony to support his argument that his conduct was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The <em>Griebler </em>court grounded the result on two Wisconsin cases that represented \"nearly twenty years of precedent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 561, and seemed to imply that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">We refuse to overrule <em>Scheeler </em>[v <em>Bahr, </em>41 Wis 2d 473; 164 NW2d 310 (1969),] and <em>Davenport [v Gillmore, </em>146 Wis 2d 498; 431 NW2d 701 (1988),] and adopt the rule advanced by the court of appeals. Doing so would open the door to plaintiffs recovering for <em>injuries they suffered as the result of their own unreasonable behavior.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">Although expert opinion may be relevant in determining what is an open and obvious danger, <em>the test is ultimately one of reasonableness. [Id. </em>at 559-560. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">The court briefly discussed <em>Corbin v Coleco Industries, Inc, </em>748 F2d 411, 417-418 (CA 7, 1984) but merely dismissed it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">We have already rejected this position as a reason to overrule nearly twenty years of precedent. [160 Wis 2d 561.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b589-12\"> <em>Stanton v Miller, </em>66 Ohio App 3d 201, 204; 583 NE2d 1080 (1990), concerned a diver seriously injured after diving in an aboveground pool. The court reversed a grant of summary judgment in favor of the manufacturer and retailer, holding that diving in the pool did not constitute \"primary assumption of the risk,\u201d and that the record did not demonstrate that the dive constituted even an \"implied assumption of risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">Although using the taxonomy of \"assumption of risk,\u201d the holding of the court implicates duty to warn issues. The court distinguished \"primary\u201d and \"implied\u201d assumption of risk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-14\">[Primary assumption of risk] is predicated upon a determination, as a matter law, that the <em>defendant owes no duty to the plaintiff. . . because certain risks are so inherent in some activities that they cannot be eliminated.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Implied assumption of risk is, on the other hand, defined as the plaintiff\u2019s consent to or acquiescence in an appreciated, known or obvious risk to the plaintiff\u2019s safety. <em>[Id. </em>at 203-204. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\"Clearly, there is a risk of injury while diving into a shallow pool. <em>The risk, however, is not so inherent as to relieve pool operators from any duty whatsoever </em>to all divers.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 204 (quoting <em>Collier v Northland Swim Club, </em>35 Ohio App 3d 35; 518 NE2d 1226 [1987]). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">By declining to find that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct constituted \"primary assumption of risk,\u201d the court refused to find that the dangers of diving in an aboveground pool were so obvious as to preclude a duty to warn on the part of the manufacturer or retailer. Had the court found evidence sufficient to raise the issue of \"implied\u201d assumption of risk, the issue would ordinarily have gone to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">In <em>Erickson v Muskin Corp, </em>180 Ill App 3d 117, 121-125; 535 NE2d 475 (1989), the court applied an \"assumption of risk\u201d analysis to a case concerning a diver who broke his neck after diving through an inner tube in an aboveground pool. The court affirmed a jury verdict finding both that defendant owed a duty to warn of the danger of diving into the pool, but that the plaintiff assumed ninety-six percent of the risk. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-11\">A subjective test [for whether the plaintiff assumed the risk] is used, i.e., what plaintiff actually knew. Plaintiff\u2019s age, experience, knowledge, and understanding, in addition to the <em>obviousness of the defect and the danger it poses will all be relevant factors for the jury\u2019s consideration.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-12\">Moreover, plaintiff\u2019s use of expert testimony to show that the public may not be aware of the hazards of diving into an above-ground pool is not relevant to what Lance [Erickson] himself knew. Lance\u2019s knowledge, or lack thereof, and whether he had assumed all or part of the risk was a question of fact to be resolved by the jury. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">The duty to warn in this case was determined by an \"objective standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122. The obviousness of the danger neither prevented the case from reaching a jury, nor did the jury\u2019s involvement produce a windfall for the plaintiff, whose recovery was reduced by ninety-six percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">See also <em>King v S R Smith, Inc, </em>578 So 2d 1285, 1287 (Ala, 1991) (reversing summary judgment in favor of a manufacturer who argued no duty to warn of the danger of diving from a diving board into an in-ground pool); \"Whether a danger [is] 'open\u2019 and 'obvious\u2019 does not go to the issue of duty of the defendant .... Instead, 'open\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>'obvious\u2019 danger relates to the affirmative defense of assumption of risk . . . and the issue of causation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">In <em>Shaw v Petersen, </em>169 Ariz App 558; 821 P2d 220, 222 (1991), parents of a 19-month-old child who was injured after falling in a pool claimed the owner should have warned of danger of the pool. The Court said: \"Whether a reasonable person would believe a pool was an open and obvious hazard to a 19 month old child is a question that relates to breach of duty, not its existence. Whether a hazard is 'open and obvious\u2019 is not relevant to determine the existence of duty, rather it is relevant to determining if the duty was breached.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 417-418.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b591-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 417.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b591-10\"> <em>Id. </em>at 418.
