The question arises against a backdrop of complex issues including equitable school financing, the intricacies involved in state school aid formulas, and the fiscal problems of the state. These underlying issues shape the arguments of the parties and amicus curiae and color their perspective. However, mindful of the fact that construction of a constitutional provision enacted as a result of voter initiative requires a special emphasis on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>duty of judicial restraint,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> our interpretation is ultimately drawn from the words of the amendment and our understanding of the purpose the voters sought to effectuate by ratification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The principal theories of the parties may be fairly summarized as a claim by local units of government that they are entitled to funding of mandated state programs on a unit by unit basis and a claim by the state that the Headlee obligation is met by funding a proportionate share of the mandated activity on a statewide basis wherever it is spent. Thus, having examined the language of \u00a729 supporting their respective positions, Justice Levin\u2019s dissent ultimately turns on the belief that the voters intended to preclude <em>any </em>shift of responsibility for mandated services from state to local governments, <em>post, </em>p 285, while the opinion of the Chief Justice implicitly accepts the proposition that the voters adopting the Headlee Amendment intended that the state could fulfill its Headlee obligation by discretionary redirection of amounts recaptured from mandatory programs, <em>post, </em>pp 274-275.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Because we conclude that the voters intended neither to freeze legislative discretion nor to permit state government full discretion in its allocation of support for mandated activities or services, we hold that the statewide-to-local ratio for calcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>lating the state\u2019s funding obligation for existing services and activities under \u00a7 29 preserves voter intent by securing a minimum funding guarantee while simplifying calculations and avoiding inequitable anomalies. We further hold that social security coverage is not a state-required activity or service within the meaning of the Headlee Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Section 29 of the Headlee Amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law. A new activity or service or an increase in the level of any activity or service beyond that required by existing law shall not be required by the legislature or any state agency of units of Local Government, unless a state appropriation is made and disbursed to pay the unit of Local Government for any necessary increased costs. The provision of this section shall not apply to costs incurred pursuant to Article VI, Section 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The plaintiffs in this case, fifty-one Michigan school districts and fifty-one taxpayers residing in each of those districts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> contend that the state has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>violated \u00a7 29 by reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs incurred by the plaintiff school districts in providing certain state-required activities and services.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">When the Headlee Amendment was adopted by the voters of Michigan as part of the Michigan Constitution in 1978, state law provided for programs for special education, special education transportation, bilingual education, and lunch and supplemental milk.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since the adoption of the Headlee Amendment, the Legislature has appropriated funds to school districts pursuant to the State School Aid Act, MCL 388.1601 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.1919(901) <em>et seq., </em>as amended annually. The act generally provides for two types of state funding: \"restricted\u201d and \"unrestricted.\u201d Unrestricted funds can be used for any school-related purpose authorized by law. Restricted or \"categorical\u201d funds are earmarked for specific programs, some of which are voluntarily provided by local districts, and some of which are mandated by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The state allocates unrestricted funds according to a formula, set forth in \u00a7 21(1) of the act, that guarantees to each district a minimum level of funding per pupil. Generally speaking, the amount of unrestricted funds provided per pupil equals the difference between the amount guaranteed and the amount per pupil generated from local revenues.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Districts are only eligible to receive unrestricted funds if the amount of revenue per pupil generated locally does not exceed the amount of funds guaranteed per pupil by the state. Districts that are so eligible are said to be \"in-formula.\u201d Districts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>whose local revenues per pupil exceed the state-guaranteed amount are ineligible for unrestricted funds and are said to be \"out-of-formula.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The act contains a \"recapture\u201d or \"base revenue deduction\u201d provision appearing in \u00a7 21(5) as amended by 1990 PA 207 and 1991 PA 118.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This provision authorizes the \"recapture\u201d of funds tentatively allocated to an out-of-formula district<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> under all other provisions of the act, including funds allocated for mandated categorical programs. The recaptured funds are withheld from out-of-formula districts and are available for distribution to in-formula districts in accordance with the act. The amount of the recapture or base revenue deduction is determined according to a complex set of formulas, the details of which are not relevant here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">It is this recapture provision that, according to the plaintiffs, has resulted in a violation of \u00a7 29 of the Headlee Amendment by reducing the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>financed proportion of the necessary costs incurred by the plaintiff school districts in providing the activities and services mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The plaintiffs also allege that the state has violated \u00a7 29 by reducing its prior one hundred percent proportional funding of the plaintiff school districts\u2019 employer share of federal social security taxes paid on behalf of their employees. Since 1987, the state, in accordance with federal law, has required local school districts to remit all federal social security taxes directly to the appropriate federal agency. At the same time, the state has undertaken to appropriate to each district funds sufficient to cover the district\u2019s employer share of such social security taxes. See MCL 388.1746; MSA 15.1919(1046), originally enacted by 1987 PA 128, as amended annually (\"\u00a7 146\u201d); see also MCL 38.1341(9); MSA 15.893(151X9), as amended by 1989 PA 194.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Before 1989, \u00a7 146 was included in a list of provisions under which the funds due school districts were exempted from recapture. See MCL 388.1621(5); MSA 15.1919(921X5), as amended through 1988 PA 318. The Legislature, however, in 1989 PA 197, removed \u00a7 146 from that list, thus subjecting to recapture the funds allocated for reimbursement of the social security taxes paid by out-of-formula districts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See MCL 388.1621(7); MSA 15.1919(921)(7), as currently amended.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>according to the plaintiffs, has resulted in the unconstitutional reduction of the state financed proportion of social security taxes paid on behalf of their employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The plaintiffs filed their original complaint in the Court of Appeals, pursuant to \u00a7 32 of the Headlee Amendment,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> on September 13, 1990, and filed an amended complaint on October 9, 1990. The Court of Appeals, on November 9, 1990, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action under the Headlee Amendment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court reasoned that the plaintiffs had alleged only a reduction of the state financed proportion of their particular budgets on a unit-by-unit basis, and that \u00a7 29 would be violated only by a reduction of the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing state-required activity or service as calculated on an aggregate, statewide basis, covering all relevant units of local government.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court, on January 14, 1991, clarified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>the reasoning of its earlier order and denied rehearing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The plaintiffs applied for leave to appeal to this Court, which we granted on April 23, 1991. 437 Mich 974.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In our order granting leave to appeal, we directed the parties</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">to include among the issues to be briefed (1) whether the obligation of the state under Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29 should be measured by one of the following: (a) the ratio of total state aid for a required activity to total necessary costs for the required activity in the base year compared with the ratio of total state aid for the activity to total necessary costs for the activity in the year of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>challenged funding; (b) the ratio of state aid to an individual local unit of government for a required activity to necessary costs of that unit for the activity in the base year compared with the ratio of state aid to the unit for the activity to the necessary costs of that unit for the activity in the year of challenged funding; (c) the ratio of total state aid for a required activity to total necessary costs for the required activity in the base year compared with the ratio of state aid to an individual local unit of government for the activity to the necessary costs of that unit for the activity in the year of challenged funding; or (d) such other ratios as advanced by the parties .... [Id.][<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The first two sentences of \u00a7 29 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law. A new activity or service or an increase in the level of any activity or service beyond that required by existing law shall not be required by the legislature or any state agency of units of Local Government, unless a state appropriation is made and disbursed to pay the unit of Local Government for any necessary increased costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Only the statewide-to-local district funding ratio for calculating the state\u2019s obligation pursuant to \u00a7 29 gives full effect to the language and advances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the purposes that voters sought to achieve in ratifying the Headlee Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">This approach requires an initial calculation of the proportion of statewide funding for a particular mandated activity to the total necessary costs of providing that activity.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The necessary costs to each local unit in the funding year at issue are then calculated. Next, the proportion of state financed funding for the activity or service in the base year is compared to the proportion of funding provided to the district in the year at issue. The state is obligated to afford each unit providing the activity or service the same proportion of funding that the state provided on a statewide basis in the year that the Headlee Amendment was ratified.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The first sentence of \u00a7 29 speaks of \"the state financed proportion,\u201d suggesting a single proportion of multiple necessary costs for state-required activities and services. While not direct enough to be certain, the language suggests that the electors thought that a common percentage would be applied to measure the state\u2019s obligation to fund each activity or service.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The question is whether, in the year at issue, i.e., the payout year, each unit of local government is entitled to the same percentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In <em>Durant v State Bd of Ed, </em>424 Mich 364, 379; 381 NW2d 662 (1985), we interpreted the language in \u00a7 29 to \"reflect an effort on the part of the voters to forestall any attempt by the Legislature to shift responsibilities to the local government . . . .\u201d <em>Durant, supra, </em>p 379. We explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the two sentences must be read together \"[b]ecause they were aimed at alleviation of two possible manifestations of the same voter concern . . . <em>Id. </em>That reasoning suggests that the section was intended to impose an obligation on the state vis-\u00e1vis each unit of local government with respect to mandated activities or services as well as new requirements. The first sentence focuses on a single proportionate obligation by the state measured during the base year, i.e., the year that the Head-lee Amendment became effective. The only language in \u00a729 that speaks directly to payment occurs in the second sentence, which requires a \"state appropriation ... to pay <em>the </em>unit of Local <em>Government </em>for any necessary increased costs.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) This language references a singular unit and a singular governmental body. It suggests that the framers intended, and the voters understood, that the state\u2019s obligation ran to each unit of local government. Thus, although the language is indirect, the section as a whole supports the state-to-local method.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>The state-to-local formulation satisfies the voters\u2019 intent in enacting the Headlee Amendment. When the voters ratified the Headlee Amendment, they sought to ensure that when the state mandates a program, funds are provided to the local government to pay for that program. The state-to-local method of calculating the state\u2019s obligation achieves the voters\u2019 desire to secure a minimum level of funding for the local government unit for mandatory programs and to link the mandating of programs with the necessity for taxing to pay for those programs. This approach also creates the appropriate balance between the state\u2019s desire for discretion in allocating funds and the desire of the local units of government for minimum funding. The state-to-local ratio provides a uniform allocation of resources for mandatory programs. The state is free to supplement that minimum funding on the basis of its perception of need, but the local government is guaranteed its proportionate share.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The state-to-local formulation also simplifies the calculations necessary to determine the state\u2019s obligation pursuant to \u00a7 29. Calculating the state financed proportion in the base year under the local formulation would entail numerous complicated questions regarding each governmental entity\u2019s spending in the year that the Headlee Amendment took effect. In contrast, using a statewide method for calculating the percentage in the base year entails examining the necessary costs to the state in relation to the state\u2019s proportionate share of funding, a single calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Requiring the state to pay each local govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>ment the same percentage in the payout year will also avoid some of the anomalies present with a local base-year calculation. For example, if a district in existence in the base year was not providing a mandatory program when the Headlee Amendment took effect, this method would entitle the district to the same proportionate share as every other local unit that previously provided the programs. This formulation also simplifies funding where new districts are created by consolidation, or reorganization, or otherwise. If the newly organized district adds a program that was \"mandated\u201d when the Headlee Amendment took effect, any district providing the program is then entitled to the same proportionate share as every other unit providing the activity or service. Thus, the anomaly of funding at either zero or one hundred percent (pursuant to the second sentence of \u00a7 29) is avoided. New districts, like previously existing districts, would be entitled to the same proportionate share of state funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Section 29 of the Headlee Amendment embodies a dual view of government; the voters\u2019 purpose comprehended balancing the rights and obligations of state and local governments. The state-to-state and local-to-local methods each fail for the same reason \u2014 they do not embody the dual approach that was reflected in the text and purpose. The state-to-state approach focuses on the first sentence of \u00a7 29 and its reference to a single statewide proportionate share. The local-to-local formulation stresses the second sentence of \u00a7 29 and its reference to payment to individual units of government. Rather than viewing these two approaches as embodying conflicting principles requiring a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>choice, the state-to-local method gives effect to the supplementary principles embodied in the statute and most closely captures the full meaning and spirit of the text of \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">This dual purpose is reflected in the language of \u00a725:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">Property taxes and other local taxes and state taxation and spending may not be increased above the limitations specified herein without direct voter approval. The state is prohibited from requiring any new or expanded activities by local governments without full state financing, from reducing the proportion of state spending in the form of aid to local governments, or from shifting the tax burden to local government. [Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 25.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The text reflects the Headlee Amendment\u2019s purpose of limiting the state\u2019s discretion in several ways. First, it expresses the desire to prohibit the state from requiring new or expanded activities without fully funding them. The clause that embodies this purpose refers to funding for \"local governments,\u201d a plural reference, which implicitly suggests that funding must be provided to those local governments of whom the programs are required. Second, the language evidences a purpose of preventing the state from reducing \"the proportion of state spending in the form of aid to local governments.\u201d This language again includes a singular description of the state spending \"proportion\u201d along with a plural reference to the \"local governments\u201d that are receiving the aid. Finally, the language embodies an antishifting purpose that prevents the state from shifting \"the tax burden to local government.\u201d This text evidences the aggregate antishifting purpose embodied in the text of \u00a7 30. It also may be read to incorporate an absolute prohibition of any shifting to local gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ernment, including the type of shifting advocated by the state and supported by Chief Justice Cavanagh.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The Chief Justice contends that the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of an existing activity or service does not mean the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of each unit of local government. Rather, he asserts that the state financed proportion of the necessary costs should be calculated on the basis of the necessary costs of all units of local government that provide the activity or service in the aggregate. <em>Post, </em>pp 266-267. Relying on the plural \"units of Local Government\u201d and the framers\u2019 failure to include language specifying \"each unit,\u201d it is concluded that \"the statewide-to-statewide interpretation appears to be the most logical and persuasive way to read the provision.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 267-268. According to Chief Justice Cavanagh, the language of \u00a7 30 neither supports nor undercuts the interpretation that he favors for the text of \u00a7 29. <em>Id., </em>pp 271-273. Thus, he rejects Justice Levin\u2019s assertion that when \u00a7 29 and \u00a7 30 are read together, it becomes apparent that \u00a7 29 was intended to prevent shifting in respect to the local units of government, while \u00a7 30 was intended to prevent shifting in respect to the local governments in the aggregate.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Chief Justice Cavanagh insists that the voters\u2019 antishifting purpose is adequately realized by adopting a statewide-to-statewide formula for measuring the state\u2019s \u00a7 29 obligation. <em>Post, </em>p 269. He observes that the unit-to-unit interpretation \"require^] the state to subsidize . . . wealthier districts in perpetuity,\u201d <em>id., </em>p 269, n 6, when no evidence suggests that voters sought to achieve that result. To the extent that this observation rests on the assumption that the state will not keep its promise to educate all of Michigan\u2019s chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>dren because the political costs are too high,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> it is wide of the mark. To the extent it rests on the text and purpose of the first sentence of \u00a7 29, it is likewise not well taken. The state is not prohibited from redirecting other revenue in the interest of equalization, nor is it required to maintain mandatory programs in perpetuity. All that Headlee requires is that when the state mandates a program one factor in its determination of whether to require the activity or service must be the proportionate share of funding that the state must bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The state-to-state formulation is also contrary to implicit assumptions that this Court acted on in <em>Durant. </em>In Durant, we analyzed the state\u2019s potential funding obligation under \u00a7 29 by considering the effect of funding decisions on the local unit of government. As the <em>Durant </em>plaintiffs correctly observed in an amicus curiae brief filed with this Court, both the parties, this Court, and panels of the Court of Appeals have proceeded on the assumption that \u00a7 29 had application to each unit of local government, and not in any aggregate sense. The rule of \"common understanding,\u201d as described by Justice Cooley, is applicable here. He explained that the constitutional construction to be given to a provision should give voice to the interpretation that \" 'the great mass of the people themselves, would give it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405; 185 NW2d 9 (1971), quoting Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (6th ed), p 81. The parties, the Court, and the state assumed in <em>Durant, </em>litigation that closely followed the effective date of the Headlee Amendment, that a payout to each governmental entity was required. Although this assumption does not constitute a holding, it nevertheless constitutes some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>evidence that the language of \u00a7 29 does not compel a state-to-state approach.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Use of aggregate funding in the payout year as required by the state-to-state method frustrates the voters\u2019 purpose as understood by this Court in both <em>Durant </em>and <em>Livingston Co v Dep\u2019t of Management &amp; Budget, </em>430 Mich 635; 425 NW2d 65 (1988). We emphasized in <em>Durant </em>that the two sentences of \u00a7 29 must be read together. We explained that both \"clearly reflect an effort on the part of the voters to forestall any attempt by the Legislature to shift responsibility for services to the local government, once its revenues were limited by the Headlee Amendment, in order to save the money it would have had to use to provide the services itself.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 379. We further explained that \"while the voters were concerned about the general level of state taxation, they were also concerned with ensuring control of local funding and taxation by the people most affected, the local taxpayers.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 383. We rejected an interpretation of the scope of \u00a7 29 on the basis that it \"would . . . force some taxpayers to supplement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the school district budgets of others\u201d when the \"supplementing taxpayers would have no control over how those funds would be spent . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">State-to-state funding fails to protect local units of government from the need to increase taxes for state-required programs and permits the state to fund some state programs by shifting moneys away from certain local units of government and toward others at the state\u2019s sole discretion.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Pursued to its logical conclusion, this rationale would allow the state to meet its Headlee obligation by funding the cost of all mandated services in one county and none in the other eighty-two. The Headlee Amendment sought \"to link funding, taxes, and control,\u201d balancing rights and obligations at both the state and local levels. <em>Durant, supra, </em>p 383. Yet, the state-to-state method fails to effectuate the intended protection when viewed from the perspective of the local taxpayer._</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Ultimately Chief Justice Cavanagh concludes that \"as long as the state does not attempt to shift its aggregate, statewide funding responsibilities\u201d onto local units of government, it has satisfied the Headlee obligation established in \u00a7 29. (Emphasis deleted.) Post, p 270. Implicit in this analysis is the assumption that the drafters of the amendment were content to let the acceptability of discrete decisions within the aggregate responsibility, be evaluated in the polling place. It is this proposition that is most difficult to square with what we perceive to be the voters\u2019 intent.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> If there is anything that the referendum was motivated by, it is that those who introduced it did not believe that the legislators\u2019 determination of local responsibilities and its distribution of resources to local government could be fully harnessed by the political process. Although the statewide approach may ensure that the state saves no money<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> from any shifting of funding between local units of government, it fails to protect all local taxpayers from the need to increase taxes to pay for programs over which they lack control. In other words, the statewide approach permits the state to shift funding from some districts to others while still requiring those districts to carry out mandated pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>grams. This separation of the taxing question from the programing question is contrary to one of the primary purposes of the Headlee Amendment. See <em>Durant, supra, </em>p 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The argument for adoption of a local-to-local method for calculating the state\u2019s Headlee obligation pursuant to \u00a7 29 is also not persuasive. Justice Levin asserts that the words \"taken as a group\u201d should not be read into \u00a7 29 in contradistinction to \u00a7 30 where the framers included them, and concludes that the proper method to measure the state\u2019s \u00a7 29 Headlee obligation is to compare the state financed proportion of local funding in the base year to the state financed proportion of local funding in the year at issue. He rejects the aggregate approach to the state\u2019s obligation under \u00a7 29 because it would \"effectively deprive many school districts of any protection under \u00a7 29\u201d and force them to raise local taxes. <em>Post, </em>p 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Like the observations of the Chief Justice, these observations are inapposite. The question is not whether the local districts will be forced to raise local taxes to support their programs of choice, it is whether the state may mandate programs for which it does not pay a proportionate share. Justice Levin also maintains that, unless a local-to-local ratio is employed, wealthier districts will be presented with the \"Hobson\u2019s choice\u201d of raising taxes or cutting programs contrary<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> to the purpose of the Headlee Amendment. <em>Id., </em>p 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">However, enforcing a local ratio in the base year would freeze funding at widely varying propor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>tions<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> that would guarantee disparities and severely limit the state\u2019s ability to exercise discretion in the allocation of funds. We do not view the Headlee Amendment as being the voters\u2019 expression of intent to freeze the status quo. Indeed, as we observed in <em>Durant, </em>\"egregious mandated disparities would seriously affect the state\u2019s ability to provide the basic necessities for a 'free education\u2019 to all students . . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 384.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Use of a local ratio in the base year as advocated by Justice Levin would freeze the state\u2019s obligation in disparate proportionate shares, virtually mandating inequitable school financing. Varying shares of state funding not related to programing presumably reflected the relative wealth or need of the districts as determined by the Legislature. But, if the Headlee Amendment freezes those disparities, the proportionate share a local district obtains will no longer be on the basis of relative need, it will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>based on the fortuity of the district\u2019s share when Headlee became effective. Nothing in the text of the Headlee Amendment or any statement of the voters\u2019 purpose suggests that voters sought to freeze funding disparities regardless of changes in the wealth or need of a particular district over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We also consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the state is obligated to pay the employer\u2019s share of social security coverage for all school district employees. We agree with the Court of Appeals that plaintiffs\u2019 social security coverage claim is not cognizable under \u00a7 29 of the Headlee Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Plaintiffs sought to frame their social security costs claim as though social security coverage constituted a separate state-required activity or service. However, social security coverage is directly imposed by federal law and therefore not required by state law within the meaning of \u00a7 29. Second, social security coverage does not constitute an activity or service within the meaning of \u00a7 29. Therefore, regardless of the method of calculating the funding ratio, plaintiffs\u2019 claim for social security costs is defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The opinions filed today reflect what must honestly be acknowledged as an attempt to fill the gap in the text of Headlee.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Thus, each illustrates the juridical reality that a commitment to judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>restraint and a desire to give effect to the meaning as understood and ratified by the voters does not end the process of constitutional construction where the text is indeterminate. We must examine a host of factors such as the common meaning of the text, the structure of the provision, and the historical context in which the amendment was passed. Legal argument founded on multiple factors can be characterized as \"cable-like.\u201d Eskridge <em>&amp; </em>Frickey, <em>Statutory interpretation as practical reasoning, </em>42 Stanford LR 321, 351 (1990). The writers observe that \"[t]he text, one probable purpose, some legislative history, and current policy each lend some \u2014 even if not unequivocal \u2014 support to the result. Each thread standing alone is subject to quarrel and objection; woven together, the threads\u201d persuade that a particular result is in order. <em>Id. </em>The cable metaphor aptly describes the arguments in this case. The text, purpose, structure, and historical context all suggest that the strongest \"cable\u201d is woven from a state-to-local method. The theme of a single state obligation measured during the base year and the theme of state obligation owing to each local government are not logical alternatives but combinable strategies. So viewed, the strongest cable is that which winds together the Headlee Amendment\u2019s dual focus into a single strong whole \u2014 the state-to-local method.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We remand to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The Court of Appeals order of dismissal was based on theories developed by it without the benefit of full argument by the parties. Although this Court has had the benefit of briefing and argument regarding the method of measuring the state\u2019s obligation pursuant to \u00a7 29 and the social security coverage issue, there has been no opportunity to discuss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>remedy or to evaluate the viability of discrete claims of districts or individuals. We indicate no opinion regarding whether the method of measurement recognized today should be applied either fully retroactively or fully prospectively, or whether limited retroactivity is appropriate.</p>\n<judges id=\"b424-5\">Brickley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-8\"> See Posner, <em>Legal formalism, legal realism, and the interpretation of statutes and the constitution, </em>37 Case WRLR 179, 189 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">In our system of government the framers of statutes and constitutions are the superiors of the judges.

As the Court noted, count vi appears to assert only certain alleged rights of the plaintiff school districts as third-party beneficiaries of an agreement regarding social security coverage entered into in 1951 between the State of Michigan and the federal Social Security Administration, and that the state is in breach of its obligations under that agreement by reducing its funding of the plaintiff school districts\u2019 social security taxes paid on behalf of their employees, pursuant to the recapture provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">The Court of Appeals was correct in holding that such a contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>claim falls outside the limited jurisdiction conferred by \u00a7 32. However, while the complaint is inartfully worded, it can be construed to assert a claim that the alleged reduction in social security funding as a result of the recapture provision violates \u00a7 29. While count vi does not explicitly refer to \u00a7 29, paragraph 49 of count vi does \"reallege and incorporate\u201d the preceding paragraphs of the complaint. Paragraph 45 of the complaint explicitly refers to MCL 38.1341(9); MSA 15.893(151X9) (dealing with state funding of school districts\u2019 social security taxes paid on behalf of their employees) as dealing with one of the activities or services allegedly required by state law, with regard to which the state has allegedly failed to meet its funding obligations. Count v, paragraphs 42-48, generally asserts that the state\u2019s failure to meet its alleged funding obligations with regard to both social security taxes and other mandated school programs violates \u00a7 29. Thus, we construe the plaintiffs\u2019 social security claim in this regard as being, on its face, within the jurisdiction conferred by \u00a7 32, and we address it on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\"> Unpublished order entered January 14, 1991 (Docket No. 132677).

We cannot accept this reading. In order to apply \u00a7 29, three ratios are required: 1) the ratio in the base year, 2) the ratio in the payout year, and 3) the ratio between the two years. It is apparent that the language prohibits a reduction of state funding, and, thus, requires funding in the payout year to remain equal to or greater than funding in the base year. While this ratio is clear, the text of \u00a7 29 fails to precisely articulate the components of the other two ratios. Neither plaintiffs nor the state have been able to precisely locate in the text the components of a base-year or payout-year ratio. Each contends that the language supports a particular ratio, while discounting additional language counseling for a different ratio. The problem, of course, is that the actual computations by any resolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>of this dispute are more complex than that suggested by the amendment\u2019s singular reference to a \"proportion.\u201d However, our interpretation is faithful to that language.

However, as Chief Justice Cavanagh points out, the merit of the shift is not before us. The sole question is whether \u00a7 29 of Headlee prevents such a shift. If the state has the power to shift funds, it may shift funds from poorer districts to wealthier as well as from wealthier to poorer. Furthermore, although the state argues that it ought to retain discretion to increase funding, tacitly suggesting that it will shift funds to districts more in need of funding, that result is not required or prevented under the state\u2019s interpretation. The parties agree that the base revenue deduction, the device by which the state has shifted funds, is based on the local millage, the adjusted gross income of residents per child, and the school district\u2019s state equalized valuation per child. A district with a great deal of vacant land per child (such as rural districts in northern Michigan) might be deemed \"wealthy\u201d under the formula. But when land is vacant and not producing income, residents will be unable to pay, and unwilling to enact, increased millage.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Redistributing income to insure equality of education is good policy. However, nothing in the state-to-state ratio requires the state to follow that policy. The state could transfer money the other way, as it appears to do in part in sparsely populated districts. Most importantly, the policy of redistributing income is unrelated to the funding of the programs protected by the Headlee Amendment. To the extent that redistribution has any relation to Headlee, it seems to violate the amendment\u2019s intent to protect local district income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b419-5\"> Chief Justice Cavanagh answers this argument regarding the drafters\u2019 intent by urging that it is \"fundamental\u201d that the state \"is free to do whatever it wants to do, subject only to the democratic verdict of the voters.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 280. What this rejoinder misses is that this opinion seeks to discover and effectuate the intent of the voters in adopting the antishifting portion of the Headlee Amendment. That is, the \"democratic verdict of the voters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A vivid contrast between the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion and this opinion is the absence in the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion of any discussion on whether the voters\u2019 common understanding of the antishifting provision of the Headlee Amendment gave any protection to local taxpayers in their capacities as taxpayers of each local unit of government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b419-6\"> Even this is a fallacy. The state saves the money that it otherwise would have had to spend to raise in-formula districts to the state-desired level of funding. The money is \"saved\u201d by use of the recapture formula.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b420-9\"> Although it has not been argued, the drafters\u2019 notes suggest that the \"Hobson\u2019s choice\u201d perceived may be illusory, at least for future funding years. If the view that a local unit is not legally obligated to offer an unfunded mandated program was found to be authoritative and applicable to programs mandated before Headlee was adopted, the local unit would have local control of its resources, in which case offering the \"mandated\u201d program would be a real choice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b421-5\"> Because the record in this case is not well developed, we do not know precisely what gave rise to the variance in funding during the base year. Funding disparities may be program related. It is possible that some districts provided more than the minimum requirements for mandated programs and earned extra funds by so doing. These variances should disappear after deciding what constitutes a necessary cost. The state also may have had different funding rates for distinct service delivery methods. For example, the state may have funded a program offered in a regional school at a higher level than if it was housed at a single neighborhood school. These variances may be avoided by a proper determination of the scope of each mandated service or activity. Variances also might have been created by block grant funding. For example, the state might have provided a minimum basic amount to each school that provided a program such as its first ten-thousand dollars in cost.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b421-6\"> Indeed, we employed an example that emphasized the inequity in freezing a proportion so that one district would forever be entitled to fifty percent of its budget in state aid while another would get only twenty-five percent, regardless of \"how the property values declined in succeeding years . . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 384. To be sure, this example was employed to justify a limited view of the scope of \"state law\u201d in \u00a7 29, not to describe the parameters of the state financed proportion of necessary costs.

Contrary to the reasoning and conclusions reached in the opinions of my Sister Boyle and my Brother Levin, I conclude that the \"statewide-to-statewide\u201d interpretation of this provision is the most persuasive, and I would accordingly affirm on that basis the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and dismiss without prejudice the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">I. THE LANGUAGE OF \u00a7 29</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">As this Court has held, in order to properly interpret the meaning of the Headlee Amendment, \"we must ascertain the intent of the voters who passed [it].\u201d <em>Durant v State Bd of Ed, </em>424 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>364, 378; 381 NW2d 662 (1985). The starting point for that inquiry is \"the language of the constitution itself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Section 29 of the Headlee Amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law. A new activity or service or an increase in the level of any activity or service beyond that required by existing law shall not be required by the legislature or any state agency of units of Local Government, unless a state appropriation is made and disbursed to pay the unit of Local Government for any necessary increased costs. The provision of this section shall not apply to costs incurred pursuant to Article VI, Section 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The dispositive issue in this case is the proper meaning of the language in the first sentence of \u00a7 29, \"the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law.\u201d The question is whether that language refers to the state financed proportion of (1) the necessary costs of all activities and services required by state law of all units of local government, calculated on a statewide basis, (2) the necessary costs of each state-required activity or service taken individually, but calculated on a statewide basis with regard to all relevant units of local government, or (3) the necessary costs incurred by each unit of local government, taken separately, with regard to each state-required activity or service.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The first of these alternatives is clearly precluded by \u00a7 29\u2019s reference, in the singular, to \"any existing activity or service.\u201d Clearly, the state must, with regard to each state-required activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>or service, maintain at least the same proportionate level of financing of that activity or service that prevailed in 1978-79. But does it follow that the state must maintain the same proportionate financing of the costs incurred by <em>each unit of local government </em>with regard to each activity or service, as under the third alternative? Nothing in \u00a7 29 suggests that. The relevant sentence refers to \"units of Local Government\u201d in the plural, not in the singular.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That reference occurs as part of the adjectival phrase, \"required of units of Local Government by state law,\u201d which defines \"existing activity or service.\u201d That adjectival phrase reflects the obvious fact that any given state-required activity or service will apply to a large number of local units across the state.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>refers to \"the state financed proportion of the necessary costs <em>of any existing activity or service\u201d </em>it seems eminently logical to calculate the \"necessary costs\u201d on the basis of the aggregate costs incurred by all \"units of Local Government\u201d that are required to provide each activity or service.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Section 29 does not refer to \"the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of <em>each unit of Local Government.\u201d </em>If such a local-to-local interpretation had been intended, that meaning could have been conveyed in any number of clearer and more sensible ways. Section 29, for example, could have been phrased in relevant part as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs <em>incurred by any unit of Local Government in providing </em>any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law. [Emphasized words added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Or, perhaps less clearly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of <em>any unit </em>of Local Government by state law. [Emphasized words added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">In sum, because \u00a7 29 focuses on \"the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of <em>any existing [state-required] activity or service,\u201d </em>not on the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of <em>each unit of local government, </em>and because \u00a7 29 refers in the relevant sentence to \"units\u201d in the plural, the statewide-to-statewide interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>appears to be the most logical and persuasive way to read the provision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">II. THE PURPOSE OF \u00a7 29</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">This Court has held that in attempting to determine the meaning of a constitutional provision, \" 'the circumstances surrounding the adoption of [the] provision and the purpose sought to be accomplished may be considered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Livingston Co v Dep\u2019t of Management &amp; </em>Budget, 430 Mich 635, 642; 425 NW2d 65 (1988), quoting <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405; 185 NW2d 9 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the statewide-to-statewide interpretation undermines the purposes of \u00a7 29 and of the Headlee Amendment as a whole. There can be little dispute about those purposes. As this Court said in <em>Livingston Co, </em>430 Mich 644:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">Th[e] plan is quite obvious. Having placed a limit on state spending, it was necessary to keep the state from creating loopholes either by shifting more programs to units of local government without the funds to carry them out, or by reducing the state\u2019s proportion of spending for \"required\u201d programs in effect at the time the Headlee Amendment was ratified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">I disagree, however, with the contention that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>statewide-to-statewide interpretation in any way conflicts with the plan or purposes of the Headlee Amendment. The plaintiffs argue essentially that the statewide-to-statewide interpretation would permit the state to reduce its proportionate funding of the costs incurred by some school districts,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> while increasing its proportionate funding of others. This may be true, but it is irrelevant to the broad antishifting purpose of \u00a7 29. As the state notes in its brief, \"[t]he state does not realize one nickel in savings if it allocates funds for a particular activity or service to school district a instead of school district b.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">As long as the state is prevented from shifting its funding responsibilities onto local governments on an overall, statewide basis, the goal of \u00a7 29 is fully realized and effectuated. Because that is precisely what the statewide-to-statewide interpretation does, in fact, prevent, that interpretation does not open up any loophole in the Headlee Amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>I do not suggest that there are no potential legal grounds upon which to challenge any particular school funding equalization scheme. There may be any number of grounds for such a challenge. But we are not presented in this case with any such issues. The sole issue before us is whether the plaintiffs have stated a claim under \u00a7 29. That provision simply has no bearing on the validity of any equalization or redistribution of state funds <em>among </em>school districts, <em>as long as the state does not attempt to shift its aggregate, statewide funding responsibilities, with regard to \"any existing [state-required] activity or service,\u201d onto units of local government. </em>Because the plaintiffs in this case have not alleged any such aggregate, statewide shifting, their \u00a7 29 claim fails as a matter of law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>III. THE RELEVANCE OF \u00a7 30</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The plaintiffs, in urging the local-to-local interpretation of \u00a7 29, place heavy reliance on a comparison with \u00a7 30 of the Headlee Amendment, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">The proportion of total state spending paid to all units of Local Government, <em>taken as a group, </em>shall not be reduced below that proportion in effect in fiscal year 1978-79. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The plaintiffs argue essentially that because the words \"taken as a group\u201d do not appear in \u00a7 29, there is no basis for interpreting \u00a7 29 in a way that treats \"units of Local Government\u201d in the aggregate, as under the statewide-to-statewide interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In my view, the \u00a7 30 comparison does not support the local-to-local interpretation of \u00a7 29, nor does it undermine the statewide-to-statewide interpretation. It was obviously necessary to include the words \"taken as a group\u201d in \u00a7 30 to avoid a potentially serious ambiguity in that provision. Without the words \"taken as a group,\u201d \u00a7 30\u2019s reference to \"state spending paid to all units of Local Government\u201d might have been interpreted to mean state spending paid to <em>each and every </em>unit of local government. The effect would have been to freeze the allocation of state funds <em>among </em>all the units of local government.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">No comparable ambiguity exists in \u00a7 29, and there was therefore no need to add words such as \"taken as a group\u201d to convey a statewide meaning already clearly evident from the text of \u00a7 29. A comparable ambiguity in \u00a7 29 might perhaps have existed if \u00a7 29 had been phrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>state financed proportion of the necessary costs of <em>all units of Local Government. </em>[Emphasized words added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">But as enacted, \u00a7 29 refers to \"the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of <em>any existing activity or service </em>required of units of Local Government by state law.\u201d As we have already noted, the concluding phrase, \"required of units of Local Government by state law,\u201d is simply an adjectival phrase modifying \"any existing activity or service,\u201d which is the operative heart of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">It would not have been logical or coherent for \u00a7 29 to use the words \"taken as a group,\u201d because \u00a7 29, unlike \u00a7 30, was not designed simply to preserve a proportionate level of funding for all units of local government, <em>for all purposes. </em>Rather, \u00a7 29 was designed to preserve a proportionate level of funding with respect to <em>each \"existing [state-required] activity or service.\u201d </em>As I have already demonstrated, however, nothing in the first sentence of \u00a7 29 suggests that its requirements apply <em>not only </em>to each state-required activity or service but <em>also </em>to each unit of local government. To the contrary, as I have noted, the plural reference to \"units of Local Government\u201d suggests the opposite, as does the fact that each given activity or service will obviously apply to a large number of local units.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Finally, while the plaintiffs vest paramount significance in the absence of the words \"taken as a group\u201d from the first sentence of \u00a7 29, it is difficult to see where the words could have been inserted to produce the sought-after clarification. If they had been inserted following the words \"units of Local Government,\u201d they would only have created ambiguity and confusion by suggesting that only activities or services required of <em>all </em>units of local gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>ernment were implicated. If they had been inserted at the end of the first sentence, their referent would have been ambiguous, and if the referent were taken to be \"any existing activity or service,\u201d the plural implications of \"taken as a group\u201d would have conflicted inexplicably with the singular specification of \"any existing activity or service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In sum, the absence of the words \"taken as a group\u201d from \u00a7 29 does not undermine the statewide-to-statewide interpretation, because that interpretation already flows clearly from the existing language of \u00a729, because the words \"taken as a group\u201d serve a clarification purpose unique to \u00a7 30, and because adding the words \"taken as a group\u201d to \u00a7 29 would not have achieved any further clarity in that provision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The relevant issue is not whether the requirements of the first sentence of \u00a7 29 apply to units of local government \"taken as a group,\u201d but whether those requirements apply to state-required activities and services, taken individually. They clearly do, and this, in my view, leads with inexorable logic to the statewide-to-statewide interpretation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>IV. POLICY IMPLICATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">This Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 29 should not, of course, be swayed by the perceived policy implications. Our task is simply to arrive at the most persuasive and intellectually honest interpretation of \u00a7 29 that we can. But I find it nevertheless appropriate to point out, in view of the policy arguments raised by the parties, the amici curiae, and my colleagues, that the local-to-local interpretation of \u00a7 29, aside from being inherently unpersuasive, would, as the state argues, lead to irrational and inequitable consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Under the local-to-local approach, the pattern of state funding of individual school districts would, to a large extent, be permanently frozen according to the pattern existing in 1978, when the Headlee Amendment was adopted. Not only would the local-to-local approach tend to preserve whatever funding inequities may have existed in 1978, but it would hinder the state from responding to even more pronounced inequities that may have developed over the last fourteen years, and that may continue to develop into the foreseeable future, as a result of changing economic and demographic circumstances within districts across the state.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>By adopting the Headlee Amendment, the voters clearly intended to place strict limits on the growth of state taxation and spending. By including \u00a7 29, the voters clearly intended to prevent the state from evading the Headlee Amendment\u2019s restrictions by shifting its overall funding responsibilities onto local governments. But there is nothing in the language or background of the Headlee Amendment to support the conclusion that the voters intended to permanently freeze the <em>pattern </em>of state funding <em>among </em>school districts or other units of local government that happened to exist in 1978. I do not believe that Michigan voters intended to permanently immunize relatively wealthy school districts from the possible effects of funding equalization or redistribution schemes. I am aware of no evidence that such issues played any role at all in the debate or adoption of the Headlee Amendment. In any event, the amendment itself cannot fairly be read to require such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">V. THE STATEWIDE-TO-LOCAL INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">My Sister Boyle\u2019s opinion adopts the statewide-to-local interpretation first suggested as an option in our order granting leave to appeal, and urged before us by the mea. While that interpretation might, at first glance, appear to be a superficially attractive compromise, it is clearly untenable as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>construction of the language of \u00a7 29. It would require that the phrase, \"the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law,\u201d be interpreted in a fundamentally different manner depending on whether the base year (1978-79) or the year of challenged funding was at issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The relevant phrase, however, appears only once in \u00a7 29 and can have only one meaning. Whichever meaning is most persuasive must clearly apply both to the base year and the year of challenged funding.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> I would therefore reject the statewide-to-local interpretation as no more persuasive than the local-to-local interpretation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>My colleague attempts to evade the logical impossibility of the statewide-to-local interpretation by stressing that the first and second sentences of \u00a7 29 must be read together, and by stressing that the first sentence refers to \"the state financed proportion . . . See Boyle, J., <em>ante, </em>pp 249-251. I agree that it is generally appropriate to read a constitutional provision as a whole. In this instance, however, the different language of the first and second sentences of \u00a7 29 does not contain the key to the puzzle sought by my colleague. While the first and second sentences are obviously related, they address distinct and separable issues. The first sentence is a self-contained provision governing the funding of programs that were required by state law at the time the Headlee Amendment was passed. The second sentence is a self-contained provision governing the funding of new programs mandated by post-Headlee Amendment state laws. I have already acknowledged and discussed the obvious fact that the second sentence, <em>in contrast to the \u00f1rst sentence, does </em>\"apply on an individual unit basis.\u201d See n 2. Indeed, as I have noted, that very contrast in language supports the statewide-to-statewide interpretation with regard to the first sentence. See n 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">My colleague asserts that \"[t]he only language in \u00a7 29 that speaks directly to payment occurs in the second sentence . . . .\u201d Boyle, J., <em>ante, </em>p 251. But this is not really true, and does not support the conclusion that my colleague draws. It is true that the second sentence in \u00a7 29 contains a more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>explicit reference to the state\u2019s duty to \"appropriat[e]\u201d and \"disburse[]\u201d the required funding to local governments, but this refers only to the separate requirements imposed by the second sentence. The first sentence independently refers to the state\u2019s payment responsibility in the year of challenged funding, by providing that the state <em>shall not </em>\"reduc[ej\u201d the proportionate funding level existing when the Headlee Amendment was passed, which is simply another way of saying that the state <em>shall </em>maintain and continue paying that proportionate amount of funding.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The fact that the first sentence in \u00a7 29 refers to \"the state financed proportion\u201d does not support the statewide-to-statewide, the statewide-to-local, <em>or </em>the local-to-local interpretation, and simply does not provide the guidance discerned by my colleague. It is impossible to say, on the sole basis of the use of the word <em>\"the,\u201d </em>whether \"the state financed proportion\u201d refers to the proportion as measured on a statewide or local unit basis. Consider a hypothetical constitutional provision stating: \"The state shall annually appropriate to each unit of local government <em>the </em>amount of funds required by each unit to provide adequate police services.\u201d The use of \"the\u201d does not necessarily imply or require that the term modified by \"the\u201d be a unique, unitary, or statewide entity. \"[T]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>state financed proportion\u201d in \u00a7 29, like \"the amount of funds\u201d in our hypothetical provision, <em>could </em>refer to the multiplicity of varying amounts or proportions of funding relevant to different local units. The argument for the statewide-to-statewide interpretation rests not on the use of the word \"the,\u201d but primarily, as a textual matter, on the grounds I have stated in part i.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Shifting from textual to more broadly theoretical and policy-based arguments, my Sister Boyle joins my Brother Levin in asserting that the statewide-to-statewide interpretation might theoretically permit the state to engage in some bizarre, extreme, or irrational form of funding redistribution, such as the hypothesis that the state might \"fund[ ] the cost of all mandated services in one county and none in the other eighty-two,\u201d Boyle, J., <em>ante, </em>p 258, or the notion that the state might inadvertently, through the operation of the complex factors governing funding redistribution, \"shift funds from poorer districts to wealthier . . . .\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 258, n 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">This \"parade-of-horribles\u201d type of argument misses the point in my view. I have already noted that \"[t]here may be any number of grounds,\u201d apart from the Headlee Amendment provision at issue, \"upon which to challenge any particular school funding equalization scheme.\u201d See part n, <em>ante, </em>p 270. More to the point, it would simply be unreasonable to suppose that the Headlee Amendment was designed or intended to prohibit or forestall any conceivably unwise, unfair, or even evil state fiscal policy that might be imagined. The first sentence of \u00a7 29 of the Headlee Amendment, as its text reveals, has the specific and limited objective of preventing any overall shifting of funding responsibilities for state-mandated programs from the state onto local governments. As I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>have discussed in part n, the statewide-to-statewide interpretation fully vindicates this objective. That there may be many unwise, unfair, or even evil state policies that would <em>not </em>be prohibited by \u00a7 29 under the statewide-to-statewide interpretation is a meaningless and irrelevant observation that would be true of any constitutional provision. As a wise judge once said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">The process of Constitutional adjudication does not thrive on conjuring up horrible possibilities that never happen in the real world and devising doctrines sufficiently comprehensive in detail to cover the remotest contingency. <em>[New York v United States, </em>326 US 572, 583; 66 S Ct 310; 90 L Ed 326 (1946) (opinion of Frankfurter, J., joined by Rutledge, J.).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">My Sister Boyle takes me to task for what she describes as my \"assumption that the drafters of the [Headlee] [Ajmendment were content to let the acceptability of discrete decisions within the aggregate responsibility, be evaluated in the polling place.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 259. Translated into plain English, this amounts to the proposition that, to the extent the state is not governed by constitutional restraints, it is free to do whatever it wants to do, subject only to the democratic verdict of the voters. I would heartily embrace this proposition, which I had thought was fundamental to our form of government. While I recognize that my colleague and I have an honest difference of opinion regarding the scope of the constitutional restraint at issue, I reject the notion that my analysis is flawed simply because it would leave some funding and distribution decisions by the state, within the overall confines of the Headlee Amendment, to the democratic judgment of the political process. As Chief Justice John Marshall once said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">The wisdom and the discretion of [the members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>of the Legislature], their identity with the people, and the influence which their constituents possess at election, are, in this, as in many other instances, . . . the sole restraints on which they have relied, to secure them from [the] abuse [of power]. They are the restraints on which the people must often rely solely, in all representative governments. <em>[Gibbons v Ogden, </em>22 US (9 Wheat) 1, 197; 6 L Ed 23 (1824).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">VI. THE SOCIAL SECURITY ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">I turn finally to the plaintiffs\u2019 social security claim, as described in my Sister Boyle\u2019s opinion, pp 246-247. This claim suffers from a number of infirmities. First of all, the obligation of units of local government to pay the employer share of social security taxes is directly imposed by federal law, see <em>ante, p </em>246, n 10, and thus is not \"required ... by state law\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Second, social security coverage is not itself an \"activity or service\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 29. MCL 21.232(1); MSA 5.3194(602)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">\"Activity\u201d means a specific and identifiable administrative action of a local unit of government. The provision of a benefit for, or the protection of, public employees of a local unit of government is not an administrative action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">MCL 21.234(1); MSA 5.3194(604)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">\"Service\u201d means a specific and identifiable program of a local unit of government which is available to the general public or is provided for the citizens of the local unit of government. The provision of a benefit for, or the protection of, public employees of a local unit of government is not a program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">I agree with these definitions of \"activity or ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>vice\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 29,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and they clearly exclude a general employee benefit such as social security coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">It is also clear, however, that the cost of social security coverage for an employee engaged in carrying out any \"activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law\u201d does constitute part of the \"necessary costs\u201d of such an activity or service. This follows from the definition of \"necessary costs\u201d adopted in Durant, 424 Mich 389-391. Indeed, the state concedes this point in this case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Thus, the state would violate \u00a7 29 if any reduction of the state financed proportion of local government social security coverage costs resulted in a reduction, as compared to 1978-79, of \"the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law.\u201d However, as I have noted, the plaintiffs in this case have not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>alleged any such reduction under the statewide-to-statewide interpretation of \u00a7 29 that I would adopt; nor, for that matter, have they alleged any such reduction under the statewide-to-local interpretation adopted by my Sister Boyle. Thus, the social security component of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not state a claim under \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">I would adopt the statewide-to-statewide interpretation of the first sentence of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29. Under that approach, the proper comparison for purposes of assessing the state\u2019s compliance is between the state financed proportion in 1978-79, and in the year of challenged funding, of the total necessary costs incurred by all relevant units of local government, statewide, in providing the state-required activity or service at issue.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In accordance with that interpretation, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and dismiss without prejudice the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint._</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-9\"> My Sister Boyle suggests that the dispositive issue in this case is actually governed by <em>Durant v State Bd of Ed, </em>424 Mich 364; 381 NW2d 662 (1985). See <em>ante, </em>pp 256-260. My colleague admits, however, that <em>Durant </em>does not speak directly to the issue; rather, my colleague invokes certain alleged \"implicit assumptions\u201d in <em>Durant. </em>See <em>ante, </em>p 256. My colleague, however, departs from an express holding of <em>Durant, </em>by relying on the drafters\u2019 notes of the Headlee Amendment. See <em>ante, </em>p 257, n 24. But see <em>Durant, </em>424 Mich 382, n 12 (finding the drafters\u2019 notes to be \"of no value in this cas\u00e9,\u201d and citing the well-settled rule that \"comments made after the adoption or passage of a statute or constitutional provision are given little weight\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b426-6\"> In a noteworthy contrast, the second sentence of \u00a7 29, dealing with state financing of new or increased state-required activities or services, refers to \"unit of Local Government\u201d in the singular, by way of prohibiting the state from adding new program obligations or increasing the level of existing program obligations on local governments, \"unless a state appropriation is made and disbursed to pay the unit of Local Government for any necessary increased costs.\u201d Thus, the framers of \u00a7 29 were perfectly capable of referring to \"unit of Local Government\u201d in the singular when they wished to do so, and it would disregard the careful phrasing of \u00a7 29 to treat the plural reference to \"units of Local Government\u201d in the first sentence as if it were in the singular. Of course, it is entirely logical for the requirements of the second sentence of \u00a7 29 to apply on a local unit basis. The essence of the second sentence is to require that <em>all </em>new, increased costs resulting from new or increased state program requirements be one hundred percent funded by the state. This could not occur unless every unit\u2019s increased costs in that regard were funded one hundred percent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\"> Contrary to an argument asserted by the plaintiffs, there is no logical conflict between the statewide-to-statewide interpretation and the fact that many state-required activities and services may not apply to all units of local government in the state. Section 29 refers to programs \"required of units of Local Government,\u201d not programs \"required of <em>all </em>units of Local Government.\u201d For example, the state-required programs primarily at issue in this case, see n 2 and accompanying text, apply to all school districts but not to other types of units of local government. The focus under the statewide-to-statewide interpretation is simply on the state financed proportion of the aggregate \"necessary costs\u201d <em>of each activity or service, </em>regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>which category or categories of units of local government are required to provide that particular activity or service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\"> Inasmuch as I agree with my Brother Levin that \"unit of Local Government,\u201d as used in \u00a7 29, refers to individual units, including individual school districts, I do not follow the logic of my colleague\u2019s argument on pp 299-301, and I fail to see how that argument undercuts my analysis or advances that of my colleague. The issue is not the definition of \"unit of Local Government,\u201d which is not in dispute. Rather, as my colleague concedes, see <em>post, </em>p 303, the primary issue is the scope of the term, \"the state financed proportion.\u201d While I rely in part on the fact that \"units\u201d is rendered in the plural in the first sentence of \u00a7 29, that has nothing to do with the definition of \"unit of Local Government\u201d itself, and could not possibly conflict with the \u201cgeographically limited\u201d nature of a \"unit of Local Government.\u201d Cf. <em>post, </em>p 302.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b429-6\"> Specifically, of course, they argue that the state <em>has </em>reduced its proportionate funding of the plaintiff districts themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\"> My Sister Boyle asserts that this is a \"fallacy,\u201d <em>ante, </em>p 259, n 27, because it might, in fact, be more expensive for the state to finance any given equalization scheme if the state were simultaneously required to maintain certain wealthier school districts at a higher level of subsidy pursuant to \u00a7 29. The point of the state\u2019s argument, however, is that the state realizes no savings with regard to financing any particular state-required program, and thus, no shifting of the overall financial burden with regard to that program. That the statewide-to-statewide interpretation might make it easier for the state to pursue broader goals such as general funding equalization is not a reason to reject that interpretation. On the contrary, the fact that the local-to-local and statewide-to-local interpretations might make it effectively impossible for the state to pursue such equalization, by requiring the state to subsidize some wealthier districts in perpetuity at an unduly high level, is a very strong reason to doubt that the voters intended such unjust and irrational results. See part IV.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b429-9\"> The Headlee Amendment itself, in its introductory section, summarizes its intended effect by stating, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Property taxes and other local taxes and state taxation and spending may not be increased above the limitations specified herein without direct voter approval.

[Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 25.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">The references to \"local governments\u201d or \"local government\u201d are in generalized terms suggesting the overall balance between state and local responsibilities in the aggregate, not the balance between state responsibilities and the responsibilities of any individual unit of local government. Section 25 does <em>not </em>indicate that the Headlee Amendment\u2019s purpose is to prohibit the state \u201cfrom shifting the tax burden to <em>any unit </em>of local government.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b430-13\"> My Brother Levin asserts that the recapture provision in \u00a7 21(5) of the School Aid Act does, in fact, result in a statewide shifting of funding responsibilities in violation of \u00a7 29. <em>Post, </em>pp 294-295 (part iii[a]). My colleague misses the point. I neither deny nor concede the possibility that the recapture provision may operate in such a manner. Certainly, an allegation of such improper statewide shifting would state a claim under \u00a7 29. <em>But the plaintiffs have not made any such allegation in this case. </em>No such claim or issue is before this Court in this case, and my colleague\u2019s discussion of it therefore constitutes dicta.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b433-6\"> For the reasons I have stated in this section, my analysis of \u00a7 29 does not rest on \"reading] into \u00a7 29\u201d the words \"taken as a group,\u201d Levin J., <em>post, </em>p 304; nor, unlike my colleague, do I read the state\u2019s argument to rest on any such theory. I have no need to \"read\u201d anything \"into\u201d \u00a7 29 in order to arrive at the statewide-to-statewide interpretation. The whole point of my discussion in this section is to demonstrate that the appearance of the words \"taken as a group\u201d in \u00a7 30 does not, ultimately, have any relevance to the proper interpretation of \u00a7 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b433-7\"> The plaintiffs argue further that the statewide-to-statewide interpretation of \u00a7 29 would merely impose upon the state the identical obligations imposed by \u00a7 30, and thus render \u00a7 29 redundant and nugatory. This argument, however, is obviously erroneous. Nothing in \u00a7 30, standing alone, would prevent the state from reducing its proportionate level of financing of any given state-required activity or service, as long as the state continued to devote the same overall percentage of its budget as in 1978-79 to funding for all units of local government, taken as a group, for all purposes; yet \u00a7 29, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>statewide-to-statewide interpretation, obviously does prohibit any reduction in proportionate funding of any state-required activity. Conversely, nothing in \u00a7 29, under any of the interpretations urged in this case, would necessarily prevent the state from dramatically increasing funding in areas of its budget other than aid to local governments, while freezing or increasing at a lower rate the amount of local aid, thereby reducing the overall proportion of local aid within the state budget. Yet \u00a7 30 obviously does prohibit any reduction in the overall proportion of local aid within the state budget.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\"> Under the local-to-local approach, if the state financed thirty percent and seventy percent, respectively, of the costs incurred by school districts A and b with regard to a particular state-required program in 1978-79, the state would remain obligated, from 1978 to the present, and into the foreseeable future, to continue financing both districts\u2019 costs at the same guaranteed minimum rate. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>would remain the case even if, over time, school district a became the poorest district in the state, and school district b the wealthiest. This growing inequity might be further exacerbated if, as might be expected, the poorer district\u2019s costs with regard to certain state-required programs (such as bilingual education and lunch and supplemental milk programs) tended to increase as its economic and demographic profile shifted \u2014 for example, as a result of an influx of economically disadvantaged, non-English-speaking immigrants. Cf. <em>Plyler v Doe, </em>457 US 202; 102 S Ct 2382; 72 L Ed 2d 786 (1982) (holding that even illegal immigrant children are constitutionally guaranteed equal access to public education).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b436-6\"> With regard to the year of challenged funding, the statewide-to-local interpretation, like the local-to-local interpretation, looks to the state financed proportion of the necessary costs incurred by each individual district with regard to each required program.

The language simply does not allow for a different basis for calculating \"the state financed proportion\u201d in the year of challenged funding, as compared to the base year. A provision consistent with the statewide-to-local interpretation might perhaps have been phrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs incurred by any unit of Local Government in providing any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law, below the level of the overall state financed proportion, in the year of the adoption of this amendment, of the total necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\"> Furthermore, I doubt very much whether the statewide-to-local interpretation is, in fact, a desirable compromise even in practical policy terms. It appears that it would, like the local-to-local interpretation, lead to irrational and inequitable consequences.

I do not see any \"conflict\u201d between the first and second sentences under my interpretation, however, and I do not \"choose\u201d between their respective \"approaches,\u201d because, as noted in the text, the two sentences are each self-contained, address distinct issues, and impose distinct requirements. This case involves <em>only </em>the issue governed by, and the requirements imposed by, the first sentence.

Legislation enacted subsequent to the adoption of a constitutional amendment cannot, of course, be given much, if any, weight in ascertaining the intent of the voters who adopted the amendment. Cf. <em>Durant, </em>424 Mich 382, n 12 (disclaiming reliance on the drafters\u2019 notes published after the adoption of the Headlee Amendment). This Court, not the Legislature, has the ultimate authority and responsibility to interpret the meaning of any law or constitutional provision, see <em>Romein v General Motors Corp, </em>436 Mich 515, 539, n 20; 462 NW2d 555 (1990), aff\u2019d 503 US \u2014; 112 S Ct 1105; 117 L Ed 2d 328 (1992), and we have not hesitated in the past to reject legislative interpretations of the Headlee Amendment that we find to be inconsistent with the true meaning intended by the voters. See <em>Durant, </em>424 Mich 391-392 (rejecting the legislative definition of \"necessary costs\u201d under the Headlee Amendment). In this instance, however, I find the legislative definition persuasive and I would adopt it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> By the same token, the cost of social security coverage for employees engaged in general educational services apart from any specific state-required program would not be counted as part of the \"necessary costs\u201d of any such program. As this Court held in <em>Durant, </em>424 Mich 377-387, to whatever extent the mandate of Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 2, guaranteeing free public elementary and secondary education, applies either to the state or local governments, it does not constitute a requirement of \"state law\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\"> My Brother Levin mischaracterizes the state\u2019s argument and my analysis by repeatedly asserting that they are premised on the theory that the state may comply with \u00a7 29 by simply \"tentatively allocat[ing]\u201d funding to units of local government, rather than actually providing such funding. See <em>post, </em>pp 287-288, 290, 295-296, 298. Nothing in my opinion even remotely suggests such a theory, nor do I understand the state to suggest such a theory. Obviously, the state\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 29 must be measured by funding that is actually provided, not that which is merely \"tentatively allocated.\u201d Obviously, if the \"music\u201d were indeed \"stop[ped] . . . immediately after the allocation,\u201d as my colleague suggests, <em>post, </em>p 287, and if the subsequent adjustments in funding pursuant to the recapture provision were deemed legally irrelevant, the plaintiffs\u2019 entire argument, and my entire analysis responding to that argument, would be moot and pointless. As I have made perfectly clear, my analysis is premised, not on the state\u2019s \"tentative allocation\u201d of funding, but on the fact that <em>the plaintiffs have not alleged that the recapture provision has caused any actual reduction of proportionate state funding on </em>a <em>statewide basis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The statewide-to-statewide versus local-to-local issue, far from being a \"red herring,\u201d <em>post, </em>p 295, is the central and dispositive issue in this case, to which the parties have devoted virtually all their briefing and argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4\">(dissenting).

Headlee sought to bar additional \"taxes both at the local and the state level\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> without voter approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">These themes are also summarized in introductory \u00a7 25 of the Headlee Amendments, which provides that neither <em>\"state spending\u201d </em>nor property or other <em>local taxes </em>may be increased \"without <em>direct voter approval,\u201d </em>and that the state is prohibited \"from shifting the tax burden to local government,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The statutory scheme challenged by the plaintiffs embodies a budgetary dissimulation that would enable the state to avoid the Headlee \"ceiling on state spending\u201d by shifting to relatively wealthy school districts the cost of additional state spending to provide aid to poorer school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The Attorney General asks this Court to validate this statutory scheme by declaring that the state complies with \u00a7 29\u2019s edict \u2014 that there shall be no reduction in the proportion of the necessary costs of state-mandated programs \u2014 instanter, without actual payment, upon enactment of an appropriation bill that tentatively \"allocates\u201d to all school districts, wealthy and poor, the amounts required by \u00a7 29 to be paid.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Attorney General would stop the music immediately after the allocation, ignoring that it is further provided in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>School Aid Act that there shall be deducted and recaptured to the state treasury amounts so tentatively allocated to wealthy school districts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The Attorney General would thus treat the tentative allocations of the amounts required to be paid pursuant to \u00a7 29 as satisfying the state\u2019s obligation to avoid reducing the proportion of the necessary costs even though the amounts tentatively allocated will not, by reason of the recapture, be fully paid to wealthy school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In a word, what is \"allocated\u201d need not be paid in order to comply with \u00a7 29, although this Court recognized in <em>Durant </em>that the proportion of the actual cost \"must be paid\u201d to effectuate the goals of Headlee.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The result is that the sums recaptured from the tentative allocations are nothing more than bookkeeping entries, and need not actually be \"paid.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The tentative allocations are thus a sham, unless there is recognition that, by reason of the recapture, the amount tentatively allocated is not the actual allocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In <em>Durant, supra, </em>p 388, this Court held that \u00a7 29 does not require that unrestricted state aid<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to school districts be maintained at the level provided in the Headlee base fiscal year (1978-79) because the Legislature had not required school districts to offer a \"core curriculum,\u201d and hence unrestricted state aid is not funding for an existing activity or service required of local units of government by state law. \"Only specific, identifiable programs required to be provided by school districts by statute or agency rule are included under \u00a7 29. \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\"Specific, identifiable\u201d funding programs are referred to in the School Aid Act as restricted or categorical funding. There are thus two kinds of state school aid: unrestricted and restricted (categorical).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Having decided in <em>Durant </em>that \u00a7 29 does not require the state to maintain the same level of unrestricted aid, the question remained whether \u00a7 29 required the state to maintain the same level of restricted or categorical aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The dissent contends that \u00a7 29 does not require the state to provide each school district with the proportion of the cost of maintaining state-mandated programs extant when the Headlee Amendments were ratified by the people, but only so requires with regard to new or enlarged man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>dated activities.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, unless there are new, postHeadlee mandated programs,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the Attorney General\u2019s construction of \u00a7 29 would in effect eliminate \u00a7 29 in its entirety as an obstacle to transferring all restricted or categorical school aid from wealthier to relatively poorer school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s construction neuters \u00a7 29\u2019s prohibition against reducing the proportion of the necessary costs of pre-Headlee state-mandated programs. Section 29, as construed by the Attorney General, no longer would bar the state from shifting to wealthier school districts the entire cost<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> of maintaining in those school districts pre-Headlee state-mandated programs without any compensation from the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Insofar as pre-Headlee mandated programs are concerned, school districts, for all practical purposes, would be read out Of \u00a7 29 as \"local units of government.\u201d But the Attorney General\u2019s construction of \u00a7 29 is not limited to school districts. The allocation/recapture charade provides the means of neutering \u00a7 29 with regard to all preHeadlee state-mandated programs, thereby enabling the state to shift to local units of government the cost of providing funds for the \"proportion\u201d \u2014 so that there is no longer in actuality any proportion \u2014 of any pre-Headlee state-mandated programs, and thereby freeing up the \"saving\u201d achieved for expanded state spending for any purpose at the expense of local taxpayers who must either accept a reduction in other local services or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>vote for increased taxes at the local level to provide the funds needed to pay the proportion of the necessary costs of providing the pre-Headlee state-mandated service. The state thereby increases state spending with money provided by local governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Local units of government had the option, before the adoption of the Headlee Amendments, of paying for state-mandated programs by raising taxes or reducing nonmandated programs. Section 29 was not added to the constitution to preserve to local units of government those pre-Headlee options.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In voting for the Headlee Amendments, taxpayers were not voting for an abstraction, the reduction of the level of taxes generally, but rather were primarily seeking \"to lower their [own] taxes both at the local and state level.\u201d <em>Durant, supra, </em>p 378. Taxpayers sought primarily to reduce the taxes they personally are obliged to pay, not only the sum total of all the taxes paid by all taxpayers, \"statewide/taken as a group\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> in the aggregate._</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The roots of this controversy precede Headlee. There is an imbalance in the wealth of school districts that reflects the imbalance in wealth in society.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The Legislature and the Governors in all three administrations since Headlee was adopted have sought to increase state school aid funding of relatively poor school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Transferring state school aid from relatively wealthy to relatively poor school districts may be, and in the minds of many is, a laudatory goal. That three Governors \u2014 two from one political party and one from another \u2014 and the Legislature have year after year, on an ever-increasing scale, enacted this diversion of school aid from relatively wealthy to relatively poor school districts, is testimony that there is wide political support for this legislative-gubernatorial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The end does not, however, justify the means.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Constitutions divide and limit the powers of government. Although the goal may be laudatory, it is the function of this Court to thwart the Legislature and the Governor in accomplishing even a laudatory goal by unconstitutional means.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">The vice of the allocation/recapture charade is that it enables the state to do precisely what Headlee sought to prevent.

The dissent accepts this half-truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Every nickel that is paid in additional funding to poorer school districts is a nickel that wealthier school districts must provide from other sources\u2014 either by reduction in nonmandated programs or increased taxation \u2014 in order to maintain the preHeadlee state-mandated program. This is clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>violative of the letter \u2014 state <em>\"spending may not be </em>increasedthe state is prohibited \"from <em>shifting the tax burden to local government\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 and the spirit of Headlee whereby, as expressed by this Court in <em>Durant, </em>\"taxpayers were attempting to <em>limit legislature expansion of requirements placed on local government, </em>to put a <em>freeze on </em>what they perceived was excessive government <em>spending, </em>and to <em>lower their taxes both at the local </em>and the state level.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The dissent concludes that the \" 'statewide-to-statewide\u2019 interpretation\u201d of \u00a7 29 advocated by the Attorney General is more persuasive<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> than the \"local-to-local\u201d interpretation<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> advocated by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The dissent further states that because the plaintiffs in this case have not alleged any \"aggregate, statewide shifting,\u201d their \u00a7 29 claim fails as a matter of law.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The dissent explains that an aggregate statewide shifting does not occur \"as long as the state does not attempt to shift its aggregate, statewide funding responsibilities, with regard to 'any existing [state-required] activity or service/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>onto units of local government.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> (Emphasis deleted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">It is apparent, however, from the face of the recapture provision, that the recapture in fact shifts to wealthier school districts the portion of the \"aggregate, statewide funding responsibility\u201d that is recaptured. Money tentatively allocated to the wealthier school districts for the pre-Headlee state-required programs is recaptured by the state, to be used to partially fund additional unrestricted funding for poorer school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The debate over whether the statewide or local unit of government interpretation is the correct interpretation of \u00a7 29 is a red herring. It makes no difference whether the proportionate share is computed statewide/as a group/in the aggregate or, alternatively, on a local unit of government basis. The critical leap is the notion that compliance with \u00a7 29 occurs instanter when a tentative allocation is made without regard to whether the state is actually obliged to pay the money so allocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">If tentative allocation is viewed in isolation, without regard to the recapture or whether the money tentatively allocated is actually paid, the state achieves compliance with \u00a7 29 under either approach, statewide or local. If, on the other hand, tentative allocation is not viewed in isolation, but rather the underlying reality of the allocation/ recapture charade \u2014 the money recaptured is not, in fact, paid to the school district for the mandated programs \u2014 is recognized, then the state does not achieve compliance with \u00a7 29 under either approach, statewide or local.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">The critical question then is not statewide or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>local, but whether one looks at the tentative allocation in isolation or, rather, looks at the net result after deduction of the amount recaptured.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">We would look at the net result rather than focus on the fiction that compliance with \u00a7 29 occurs instanter upon the tentative allocation without regard to the recapture or whether the amount recaptured is actually paid to the school district to which tentatively allocated, or is in truth used to defray the cost of additional state spending to increase unrestricted school aid to poorer school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The linguistic arguments, of the majority<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the dissent,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> ignore the cardinal rule of constitutional construction recently again recognized in <em>Altman </em>v <em>Meridian </em>Twp, 439 Mich 623, 636; 487 NW2d 155 (1992), where this Court quoted approvingly the following statement in an earlier decision of this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">\"The primary and fundamental rule of constitutional or statutory construction is that the Court\u2019s duty is to ascertain the purpose and intent as expressed in the constitutional or legislative provision in question.

The second sentence addresses future services or activities.

This interpretation is consistent with the voters\u2019 intent that <em>any service or activity required by the Legislature or a state agency, whether now or in the future, be funded at an adequate level by the state and not by local taxpayers. [Id., </em>pp 379-380.

[Const 1963, art 9, \u00a729.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">We find further support for our conclusion not to read \"taken as a group\u201d into \"units of Local Government\u201d in the context of \u00a7 29, as well as the definitional language of the Headlee Amendments, and the legislation implementing it.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Considered in context, \u00a7 29 and \u00a7 30 cannot properly be read interchangeably. Section 30 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">The proportion of total state spending paid to all units of Local Government, <em>taken as a group, </em>shall not be reduced below that proportion in effect in fiscal year 1978-79. [Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 30. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Both \u00a7 29 and \u00a7 30 refer to \"units of Local Government,\u201d but only \u00a7 30 specifies that such \"units\u201d are to be \"taken as a group.\u201d This suggests that \"taken as a group\u201d clarifies \"units\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 30, and that \"units\u201d functions differently in \u00a7 30 than in \u00a7 29 and other sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">\"Local Government\u201d is defined in the Headlee Amendments as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-12\">any <em>political subdivision of the state, including, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>but not restricted to, school districts, </em>cities, villages, townships, charter townships, counties, charter counties, authorities created by the state, and authorities created by other units of local government. [Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 33. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Because school districts are a species of \"local government,\u201d the reference in \u00a7 29 to \"units\u201d of local government connotes a governmental entity smaller than a group comprised of all school districts in the state, and suggests that \u00a7 29 speaks of individual school districts.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The legislation implementing the Headlee Amendments defines \"Local unit of government\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">a <em>political subdivision </em>of this state, <em>including school districts, </em>community college districts, <em>intermediate school districts, </em>cities, villages, townships, counties, and authorities, <em>if the political subdivision has as its primary purpose the providing of local governmental services for residents in a geographically limited area of this state </em>and has the power to act primarily on behalf of that area. [MCL 21.233(5); MSA 5.3194(603)(5). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The section thus distinguishes between \"school districts\u201d and \"intermediate school districts,\u201d considering either alone to be a \"local unit of government,\u201d and implying that individual districts, not districts as a group, are \"local units.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Individual school districts provide government services for residents in \"geographically limited\u201d areas. The construction advocated by the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>General conflicts with this definition. Reading \"taken as a group\u201d into any reference to school districts or units of local government would eliminate the concept of a \"geographically limited area\u201d in the definition of a local unit of government. If \"school districts taken as a group\u201d designates all school districts in the state, then school districts would be geographically unlimited.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The Attorney General and amici curiae assert that the plain language of \u00a729, arguable policy implications of the construction for which we write, and the purpose that prompted adoption of the Headlee Amendments, support reading \"taken as a group\u201d into \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The Court of Appeals disposition is reflected in two orders. The Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">[N]o conclusory factual claim is made that corresponding reductions in unrestricted aid will cause the <em>overall state contribution to local school services and activities across all school districts in the state to fall below that mandated by Constitution 1963, art 9, \u00a7 29. </em>Plaintiffs claim only that individual districts will receive a lower percentage of their budgets than was the case in 1978-79; this is insufficient to state a cause of action, <em>unless state aid falls short of the level mandated by article 9, \u00a7 29 as to all districts in the state, considered \"as a group.\u201d Durant v State Bd of Ed, </em>424 Mich 364, 392-393 (1985). [Order entered November 9, 1990 (Docket No. 132677). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">The Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Durant </em>was erroneous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>The passage cited concerned the construction of \u00a7 30, not \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">In denying rehearing, the Court of Appeals provided a different rationale for its disposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">The \"taken as a group\u201d principle of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 30 applies to the present compliant, brought under the first sentence of article 9, \u00a7 29. <em>That provision of the State Constitution speaks of \"units of Local Government\u201d in the plural only. </em>[Order entered January 14, 1991 (Docket No. 132677). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The Court implied that the plural form of \"unit\u201d refers to the entire class of similar units, and thus that a claim would have been stated only if \u00a7 29 referred to \"necessary costs of any . . . activity or service required of a <em>unit </em>of local government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">For the reasons stated in part iv, we are persuaded that \"units\u201d functions differently in \u00a7 29 than in \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">The Attorney General argues that the first sentence of \u00a7 29 requires the state to maintain funding for the necessary costs of required \"activities\u201d or \"services,\u201d and does not require the state to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>maintain funding of the costs of \"units of local government.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s argument is selective and strained. Section 29 bars a reduction in the <em>\"state financed proportion\u201d </em>of the \"necessary costs\u201d of any \"activity or service\u201d required by law of \"units of Local Government.\u201d The issue central to this dispute is the meaning of \"state financed proportion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The Attorney General contends that the \"state financed proportion\u201d required to be maintained under \u00a729 is the amount of funding provided <em>statewide </em>for mandated programs. Plaintiffs assert that the \"state financed proportion\u201d means the amount provided by the state to each <em>local </em>school district. An argument that avoids addressing the meaning of \"state financed proportion,\u201d in terms of how the proportion should be calculated, ignores the constructional issue in dispute.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The Attorney General contends that \"taken as a group\u201d should be read into \u00a7 29 to avoid absurd and inequitable results. He maintains that unless \"taken as a group\u201d is read into \u00a7 29, \u00a7 29 will perpetuate funding inequities among school districts by continuing funding for mandated programs at 1978-79 levels, in effect freezing district entitlements according to the fortuities of circumstances as they were in 1978-79, and impair the ability of school districts to respond to changing economic circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s argument, in essence, is that the Headlee Amendments were a bad idea. Our task is to construe \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The voters approved an amendment to the Constitution that fixes 1978-79 as the base fiscal year.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The Attorney General argues that his construction of \u00a7 29 implements the intent of the Headlee Amendments to strengthen local control of government and that a contrary construction would generate overinvolvement by the state in the affairs of school districts. This argument assumes that reading \"taken as a group\u201d into \u00a7 29 would avoid the state \"microanalyzing\u201d each claim by a local district for reimbursement for mandated services.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Whether \"taken as a group\u201d is read into \u00a7 29 or not, a determination of the \"state financed propor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>tion of the necessary costs\u201d of mandated services in each school district is necessary. We recognize that the state has a legitimate concern with avoiding inaccurate claims. We fail to see, however, how that concern differs meaningfully whether there is a determination of the state financed proportion of funding for mandated services in a particular school district for a Headlee Amendments base fiscal year, or there is a determination for a particular school district under the recapture provision of the School Aid Act.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">We also find unpersuasive the Attorney General\u2019s argument that \"taken as a group\u201d should be read into \u00a7 29 because that is the only construction that preserves the \"historical discretion\u201d of the Legislature to allocate resources among competing constituencies, and the \"taken as a group\u201d reading of \u00a7 29 facilitates redistribution of funds from wealthier to needier school districts. This argument ignores that when the voters amend the constitution, they generally do so to limit governmental power, and that here they amended the constitution to limit legislative discretion to shift the burden of supporting state-mandated governmental services from the state to local units of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The Headlee Amendments were enacted to limit the discretion of the Legislature. Voters sought to limit legislative discretion to mandate new programs for local governments, without funding them._</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>F</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">In conclusion, if \"taken as a group\u201d is read into \u00a7 29, and the state may recapture funds allocated to mandatory educational programs, taxpayers in \"wealthier\u201d districts will face the meaningless choice either of raising taxes or cutting back on nonmandated core educational programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">State law requires school districts to provide special education, supplemental milk and lunch, bilingual education, and special education transportation programs. If the state may take funds for these mandated services away from some school districts and reallocate them to others, the school districts that lost funds would be obliged to compensate to fulfill their state-imposed obligations. Mandated programs would then be funded with money obtained either from cutbacks in non-mandated programs or increased taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">This choice is really no choice. This Court has held that neither education generally, nor any core curriculum is an \"activity or service required ... by state law\u201d for purposes of the limitations set forth in \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The \"taken as a group\u201d construction would effectively require local taxpayers to choose between raising their taxes, or cutting back on English, math, and science courses and significant traditional extracurricular activities.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In approving a tax relief measure, the voters did not intend to put traditional core educational programs at risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The Headlee Amendments do not insulate school districts from making difficult financial choices. Obliging local units of government to increase taxes in response to a reduction of funding for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>state-mandated programs cannot properly be characterized as a \"tough financial decision\u201d consistent with the spirit of the Headlee Amendments. Nor could it be properly characterized as anything other than a \"shift\u201d of a burden from the state to local school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The dissent would invest \u00a7 29 with only minimal antishifting effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">As long as the state is prevented from shifting its funding responsibilities onto local governments <em>on an overall, statewide basis, </em>the goal of \u00a7 29 is fully realized and effectuated. <em>[Ante, </em>p 269. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Such a narrow reading of \u00a7 29 would effectively deprive many school districts of any protection under \u00a7 29. The \"statewide interpretation\u201d of \u00a7 29 would allow the state to do incrementally what it is otherwise prohibited from doing comprehensively. Districts that are forced, for all practical purposes, to raise taxes to meet state-mandated spending obligations would be left only with the abstract comfort of knowing that not all school districts faced the same \"tough financial decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">The majority rejects both the statewide-to-statewide approach, advocated by the Attorney General, adopted and set forth in the dissenting opinion, and the local-to-local approach advocated by the plaintiffs and adopted in this dissenting opinion. The majority adopts the approach, dubbed \"state-to-local,\u201d advocated by amicus curiae Michigan Education Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">The mea argued that the \"state financed proportion of the necessary costs\u201d of mandated programs should be determined by first calculating the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>centage of total state aid provided in 1978-79 to all districts \"taken as a group\u201d for a particular mandated activity. All local districts would then receive that same proportion of aid for that activity every year. Thus, if the state funded, on a statewide average, fifty percent of the costs of special education in 1978-79, each district would continue to receive funding for fifty percent of the necessary costs of its special education program every year without regard to whether the proportion of funding received by that district in the base year was above or below the state average.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The mea contends that this approach is simpler to administer because it requires only a single calculation of overall state funding, and also because it would establish a guideline for funding mandated programs in districts created after the Headlee Amendments were enacted.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The state-to-local approach of the mea has the same flaw as the statewide-to-statewide approach advocated by the Attorney General. The mea approach still presents particular districts with Hob-son\u2019s choice: raise taxes or reduce core curricula.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The majority, in arguing for the state-to-local approach, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">When the voters ratified the Headlee Amendment, they sought to ensure that when the state mandates a program, funds are provided to the local government to pay for that program. The state-to-local method of calculating the state\u2019s obligation achieves the voters\u2019 desire to secure a minimum level of funding for the local government unit for mandatory programs and to link the mandating of programs with the necessity for taxing to pay for those programs. This approach also creates the appropriate balance between the state\u2019s desire for discretion in allocating funds and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the desire of the local units of government for minimum funding. The state-to-local ratio provides a uniform allocation of resources for mandatory programs.[<footnotemark>46</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Neither the \"state\u2019s desire for discretion in allocating funds\u201d nor the \"desire of the local units of government for minimum funding\u201d is relevant. The people resolved the policy questions when the Headlee Amendments were adopted. The majority departs from the Court\u2019s prior constructions of the Headlee Amendments in seeking a balance between the state\u2019s \"desire\u201d and the \"desire\u201d of local units of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Some units of local government will be advantaged by the state-to-local approach and others disadvantaged. It is unclear whether relatively wealthy school districts, as a group or in particular, will be advantaged or disadvantaged or poorer districts, as a group or in particular, will be advantaged or disadvantaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">We repeat what we said earlier in this opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">In voting for the Headlee Amendments, taxpayers were not voting for an abstraction, the reduction of the level of taxes generally, but rather were primarily seeking \"to lower their [own] taxes both at the local and state level.\u201d <em>Durant, supra, </em>p 378.

Since 1986, federal law has made local school districts directly liable to the federal government for social security obligations.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Since 1989, state law has provided for the recapture from \"wealthier\u201d school districts and reallocation to \"needier\u201d school districts of funds dedicated to social security coverage for school employees.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">We conclude, on the basis of <em>Durant, supra, </em>p 378, that to the extent state funds were allocated in the base years for social security coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>of employees engaged in general education, the funds were <em>not </em>used to defray a necessary cost of an activity or service required by state law. To the extent, however, that state funds were then allocated for social security coverage of employees engaged in mandated programs, such funds defrayed \"necessary costs\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> of providing mandated services.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The Attorney General contends that \u00a7 29 allows the state to reallocate funds dedicated to social security coverage because social security coverage is not mandated by state law, and that, even if it were, it is not an \"activity\u201d or \"service\u201d within the meaning of the Headlee Amendments. The Attorney General also argues that redistribution of social security funds prevents inequities that result from voluntary decisions of \"wealthier\u201d districts, as well as state overinvolvement in local decision making.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">We agree that social security coverage is not mandated by <em>state </em>law.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Federal law mandates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>social security coverage.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We also agree that social security is not a service within the meaning of the Headlee Amendments implementing legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">\"Service\u201d means a specific and identifiable program of a local unit of government which is available to the general public or is provided for the citizens of the local unit of government. <em>The provision of a bene\u00f1t for, or the protection of, public employees of a local unit of government is not a program. </em>[MCL 21.234(1); MSA 5.3194(604)(1). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">School employees are public employees of school districts, and school districts are local units of government. Social security is a benefit provided to school employees, and thus is not a \"service\u201d for purposes of the Headlee Amendments. Accordingly, even if there were a state mandate for social security, the strictures of the Headlee Amendments would not be triggered by a reallocation of funds formerly dedicated to pay social security costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The Attorney General has acknowledged that social security is a necessary cost of providing mandated services.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u00a7 29 requires that the cost of funding social security coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>for employees engaged in the delivery of mandated services be included in the calculation of the \"necessary costs\u201d of those services in each school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">While \"wealthier\u201d school districts might increase salaries of school employees in mandated programs, and thereby increase the burden of providing social security coverage for those employees, the Headlee Amendments were not enacted, as the Attorney General\u2019s argument implies, to equalize the financial status of school districts. The Attorney General\u2019s argument in this regard also ignores the attendant increase in the financial burden that a school district would assume to \"take advantage of\u201d state funding of social security coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The Attorney General again raises the specter of state overinvolvement in local decisions as a consequence of state funding of social security coverage. If it is true, as the argument assumes, that state control inexorably follows state funding, this militates against <em>any </em>state funding, not just the funding of social security for a limited number of school employees._</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Also relevant is that until recently the state, by subsidizing social security coverage for school districts, was engaged in exactly what is now contended constitutes state overinvolvement.

In all events, if funding social security coverage in \"wealthier\u201d school districts poses the risk of state overinvolvement, reallocation of those funds to \"needier\u201d school districts would pose the same risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">We would reverse and remand to the Court of Appeals for the entry of such orders as may be necessary to implement this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b474-6\">Riley, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-7\"> Section 29 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">The state is hereby prohibited from reducing the state financed proportion of the necessary costs of any existing activity or service required of units of Local Government by state law.
