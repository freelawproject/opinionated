Her son, Corey Warfield, who was fourteen years old, took the automobile without her permission during the nighttime while she was sleeping. Corey picked up friends, was involved in an automobile accident, and one of his friends was killed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Corey sustained serious and severe bodily injuries, necessitating medical treatment at a hospital. Meridian paid billings by the hospital until six months after the accident, when it informed Pries-man that it would not continue to pay because Corey had taken her vehicle without permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The circuit judge granted Meridian\u2019s motion for summary disposition with regard to Priesman on the ground that she lacked standing, granted a motion to amend the complaint to name Corey as a plaintiff, and granted Meridian\u2019s motion to dismiss with respect to Corey because the vehicle had been unlawfully taken. The Court of Appeals reversed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Meridian contended in the circuit court and the Court of Appeals that Corey was not entitled to no-fault medical benefits because an exception in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the no-fault act provides that a person is not entitled to no-fault benefits if, at the time of the accident, he is using a vehicle that he had \"taken unlawfully.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Meridian contended that Corey\u2019s taking of his mother\u2019s vehicle was \"unlawful\u201d because the Penal Code provides that it is a misdemeanor to take or use a vehicle \"without authority.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AxE\">The Court of Appeals, observing that Corey had not been charged or convicted, stated that the question was whether the \"mere fact of taking without permission by an underage driver who is the son of the owner and who lives in the owner\u2019s household is 'unlawful\u2019 under the no-fault act.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court observed that the term \"unlawful\u201d is not defined in the no-fault act, and said that, under \u00a7 3114<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Insurance Code, Corey was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>entitled to no-fault benefits because he was a relative of his mother domiciled in her household. The Court concluded that Corey did not lose that \"entitlement by virtue of using his mother\u2019s car without her permission,\u201d and that his use was not \"unlawful under the no-fault act\u201d: \"We cannot say that the Legislature intended that \u00a7 3113(a) of the act would apply under the circumstances of this case.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The no-fault automobile liability act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides that a no-fault insurer is required to pay medical benefits, without limitation in amount or duration,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and other no-fault benefits<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to any person who suffers accidental bodily injury arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle, without regard to fault.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">All persons,</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u2014those who own vehicles and those who do not;</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">\u2014those who insure a vehicle they own, and those who do not insure a vehicle that they own, unless a person who does not insure is injured while driving <em>that </em>uninsured vehicle;</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">\u2014the spouse and a relative domiciled in the same household of an owner of a vehicle without regard to whether the owner has insured the vehicle; _</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\u2014passengers, pedestrians, sidewalk gawkers, persons walking, sitting, or lying down in a parking lot or a field, and also those who become involved in a vehicular accident while in a structure</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">are entitled to recover full medical benefits without regard to fault and without regard to whether they or a family member has paid for no-fault coverage, under Michigan\u2019s most comprehensive no-fault act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">It is in that context \u2014 full medical benefits, unlimited in amount for every person, including even a person who does not insure a vehicle he owns (except when driving <em>that </em>vehicle) and the spouse and relatives domiciled in the household of the owner of an uninsured vehicle <em>even when driving or riding as a passenger in that uninsured vehicle </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\u2014that we assess the correctness of Meridian\u2019s contention that the Legislature did not intend that Corey recover medical benefits because, when he was fourteen years old, he took his mother\u2019s <em>insured </em>vehicle in the middle of the night, while she was sleeping, without her permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The Uniform Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act, a model act considered by the Legislature when the no-fault act was adopted, excepts from coverage a \"converter\u201d \u2014 a person who steals <em>\u2014unless </em>covered under a no-fault policy issued to the converter or a spouse or other relative in the same household.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Meridian contends that the Legislature, in substituting \"unlawfully\u201d for the umvara language excepting <em>uninsured </em>converters from no-fault coverage, intended to except from no-fault coverage not only those who convert, but also joyriders like Corey, who was not a \"converter\u201d because he did not intend to steal and, thus, would not have been excepted under the umvara even if his mother was not insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">While this is, indeed, arguable, the argument does not consider that there may be other explanations for the failure to adopt the umvara language.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The umvara exception permits, as Meridian acknowledges, a thief to recover no-fault benefits while driving the stolen vehicle if he is covered by insurance he purchased or by insurance purchased by his spouse or relative in the same household. The Legislature, in rejecting the language of the umvara exception, apparently decided to except from no-fault coverage a thief driving a stolen vehicle even if he or a spouse or relative had contributed to the no-fault pool of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The legislative purpose, in rejecting the umvara language, was thus to except from no-fault coverage thieves while driving stolen vehicles even if they or a spouse or relative had purchased no-fault insurance, and not necessarily to except joyriders from coverage. At the same time, the Legislature simplified the complex verbiage of the no-fault exception,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and thereby avoided litigation concerning what constitutes \"conversion,\u201d a term of art in criminal and personal property law. That, in substituting \"taken unlawfully\u201d for \"converts,\u201d the Legislature did not intend any substantial difference in scope or meaning from the prototypical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>umvara concept excepting thieves from no-fault coverage, appears to be the view of Judge Keeton and Professor Widiss, who read the Michigan provision as excepting a person injured in an automobile that he has \"stolen.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AH7\">Legislators generally are also parents and sometimes grandparents. Some may have had experience with children, grandchildren, nephews, nieces, and children of friends who have used a family vehicle without permission. Some may have themselves driven a family vehicle without permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We are not persuaded that legislators, sitting at a drafting session, concluded that the evil against which the umvara exception was aimed was not adequate because it did not cover teenagers who \"joyride\u201d in their parents\u2019 automobiles, especially automobiles covered by no-fault insurance, in the context that countless persons would be entitled, under the legislation they were drafting, to no-fault benefits without regard to whether they are obliged to purchase no-fault insurance or, if obliged to insure, do in fact do so.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">It appears that in the twenty years since no-fault automobile insurance legislation was first enacted, no appellate court has decided that a person like Corey is not entitled to medical benefit^_</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b229-5\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Mallett, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b229-6\">Boyle, J., concurred in the result only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-9\"> Corey\u2019s mother was insured for public liability for $100,000, in excess of the amount required by the no-fault act.

However, despite the clear and unambiguous language of both \u00a7 3113(a) and the joyriding statute, the majority holds that the exclusion does not apply in this case, finding, in effect, a \"family member\u201d exception to both provisions.

Corey Warfield took and used an automobile belonging to his mother. It is conceded that he did not have permission or authority to drive his mother\u2019s car, and that he knew he did not have permission or authority to drive the car.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor could he have had a reasonable belief that he was entitled to take and use his mother\u2019s car, since he was not licensed and had never been allowed to use the car.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">In reversing the trial court, the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>panel suggested that Corey\u2019s conduct was not unlawful because he was neither charged with nor convicted of violating the joyriding statute, and was a member of the vehicle owner\u2019s family.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, conduct that is proscribed by statute is unlawful without regard to whether that conduct ultimately results in a criminal conviction. This view is consistent with the results reached in other states that have considered the issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 3113(a) does not require a criminal conviction as a prerequisite to a finding that a taking was unlawful, and I would not read that requirement into the statute. Moreover, the-joyriding statute, applicable to \"any person\u201d who takes a motor vehicle without authority, clearly precludes the inference of an exception for minors or family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">When the language of a statute is certain, clear, and unambiguous, it is to be applied as written.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While our task is to discern and give effect to legislative intent, where the statute is unambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ous this intent is to be gleaned from the language of the statute itself.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The majority departs from these principles to conclude that because legislators \"generally are also parents and sometimes grandparents\u201d and \"[s]ome may have had experience with children, grandchildren, nephews, nieces, and children of friends who have used a family vehicle without permission,\u201d <em>(ante, </em>p 68) they did not intend to exclude coverage in cases such as this. Although such an argument may have emotional appeal, it is not supported by the language of \u00a7 3113(a), nor by the legislative history of that provision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The present language of \u00a7 3113(a) first appeared in 1971 with the introduction of SB 782.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, a House substitute bill was introduced, which provided that \"a person who <em>converts </em>a motor vehicle is disqualified from basic or added reparation benefits . . . from any source other than an insurance policy under which the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>verter is a basic or added reparation insured.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This language is identical to that found in \u00a7 21 of the Uniform Motor Vehicle Reparations Act (umvara),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> a model no-fault act.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, our Senate did not approve the language of the House substitute. Instead, both houses adopted a conference report enacting SB 782 with the present language of \u00a7 3113(a).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In its current form, \u00a7 3113(a) differs from \u00a7 21 of the umvara in two significant ways. First, \u00a7 21 imposes a disqualification only when there is a \"conversion\u201d of the insured automobile, while \u00a7 3113(a) denies benefits to a person injured while using a motor vehicle that he has taken \"unlawfully.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Second, under the umvara, a person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>converts a motor vehicle is entitled to benefits under his own policy or under another policy if he is a basic reparation insured.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> However, under \u00a7 3113(a) a person who takes an automobile unlawfully cannot collect benefits under any no-fault policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Our Legislature chose to adopt an exclusion from no-fault coverage where the taking and use of a motor vehicle was \"unlawful.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Before doing so, it had the opportunity to consider several versions of \u00a7 3113(a), one of which would have provided coverage for Corey under his mother\u2019s policy. In addition, the umvara was before it for guidance. However, the Legislature chose to depart from the umvara when it adopted the language in \u00a7 3113(a). Under these circumstances, I cannot conclude that the Legislature intended any result other than the result required by the clear and unambiguous language of the statute: Any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>who takes a vehicle unlawfully is excluded from no-fault coverage if he is injured while using that vehicle. Like the joyriding statute, \u00a7 3113(a) contains no exception for minors or family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The majority contends that the Legislature\u2019s purpose in rejecting the umvara language was to exclude only car thieves from coverage, and to simplify the language of the exclusion. <em>(Ante, </em>pp 67-68.) I disagree. If the Legislature had intended to limit the operation of \u00a7 3113(a) to car thieves, it could have stated simply that a \"car thief \u201d or one who has \"stolen\u201d a vehicle is not entitled to personal protection insurance benefits. It did not. Moreover, if the Legislature had intended to so limit the exclusion, the language \"unless the person reasonably believed that he or she was entitled to take and use the vehicle\u201d would be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Because Corey\u2019s taking and use of his mother\u2019s car was unlawful under the provisions of the joyriding statute, I would hold, in accordance with \u00a7 3113(a) of the no-fault act, that Meridian properly withheld payment of personal protection insurance benefits.</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-7\">Brickley and Riley, JJ., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-12\"> MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.13101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b229-13\"> 185 Mich App 123; 460 NW2d 244 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b229-14\"> MCL 500.3114(1); MSA 24.13114(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b230-10\"> MCL 750.414; MSA 28.646.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b230-11\"> <em>Bingham v American Screw Products Co, </em>398 Mich 546, 562; 248 NW2d 537 (1976).

In addition, in cases such as this one the parent has a strong financial incentive to minimize or disregard the criminal nature of a child\u2019s act, regardless of the quality of the family relationship. Thus, the proper guide for this Court\u2019s interpretation is not the general or ideal role of the family in our society, but the specific language of the statute selected by the Legislature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\"> In 1971, several other bills were introduced with the purpose of establishing a no-fault insurance system in Michigan. One bill, similar to the Uniform Motor Vehicle Reparations Act, provided that \"a person whose taking and using a vehicle of another is a conversion of that vehicle cannot qualify as an insured\u201d unless the converter had a good-faith belief that he was legally entitled to take and use the vehicle <em>or </em>was named as an insured in a policy on that vehicle. SB 520, \u00a7 3516. HB 4734, \u00a7 3015, would have allowed insurers to exclude from coverage a person who: a) intentionally caused the injury, b) drove under the influence of alcohol or drugs, c) knowingly used a motor vehicle without authority, d) drove without a license, e) raced or drove on a bet, and f) attempted to elude apprehension by a police officer. Neither of these bills was passed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\"> House substitute for SB 782, \u00a7 3136 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\"> 14 ULA 87-88.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\"> Language similar to \u00a7 21 has been adopted by several other no-fault states. See, e.g., Conn Gen Stat Ann 38a-375; Minn Stat Ann 65B.58; Ky Rev Stat Ann 304.39-190. In those states, a minor relative who converts a motor vehicle is entitled to no-fault benefits as a basic reparation insured. Of course, Corey would be entitled to such benefits under his mother\u2019s policy if the corresponding provision in Michigan\u2019s no-fault act were similar, but it is not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b234-10\"> 1972 Senate Journal 1944, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b234-11\"> The terms conversion and unlawful are not coextensive. Conversion is a civil wrong, which this Court has defined as \" 'any distinct act of dominion wrongfully exerted over another\u2019s personal property in denial of or inconsistent with his rights therein.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thoma v Tracy Motor Sales, Inc, </em>360 Mich 434, 438; 104 NW2d 360 (1960), quoting <em>Nelson &amp; Witt v Texas Co, </em>256 Mich 65, 70; 239 NW 289 (1931). Likewise, 1 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 222A, p 431, defines conversion as \"an intentional exercise of dominion or control over a chattel which so seriously interferes with the right of another to control it that the actor may justly be required to pay the other the full value of the chattel.\u201d In contrast, the term unlawful encompasses any illegal taking, even a less serious taking that would not constitute conversion, e.g., using a vehicle for a brief joyride with the intent to return it. See 1 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 227, pp 443-444, and accompanying comment. In addition, the mental element that excuses the taking of a vehicle is different under the umvara than under \u00a7 3113(a). The comment to \u00a7 6 of the umvara explains that \u201cone who takes a vehicle without permission is not a converter ... if he has an <em>honest </em>belief (whether or not that belief was reasonable) that he has permission to do so.\u201d 14 ULA 65. (Emphasis added.) To avoid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u00a7 3113(a) exclusion, however, a person must have a \"reasonable\u201d belief that he was entitled to take and use the vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\"> The umvara, \u00a7 1(a)(3), defines a \"basic reparation insured\u201d as a named insured and, if residing in the same household as a named insured, \"a spouse or other relative of a named insured; and a minor in the custody of a named insured or of a relative residing in the same household with a named insured.\u201d 14 ULA 42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\"> The exclusion ultimately chosen by our Legislature is unique among those states that have enacted no-fault laws. While at least three states have copied the approach of the umvara, requiring coverage for an insured even where he has converted a motor vehicle, see n 17, other states have refused to require such coverage. In Colorado a no-fault insurer may exclude from coverage any person injured while \"operating a motor vehicle as a converter without a good faith belief that he is legally entitled to operate or use such vehicle.\u201d Colo Rev Stat 10-4-712(2)(b). Other states provide an exclusion where a person is injured while knowingly occupying a stolen vehicle, Md Code Ann, Ins Art 48A, \u00a7 545(a)(2); NY Ins Law 5103(b)(3)(iii), or during the commission of a felony, Fla Stat Ann 627.736(2)(b)(2); NJ Stat Ann 39:6A-7(1); NY Ins Law 5103(b)(3)(i); Utah Code Ann 31A-22-309(2)(a)(iii)(B). Five states provide for exclusions from coverage for injuries sustained by a person operating a motor vehicle without the permission or consent of the insured, Fla Stat Ann 627.736(2)(a); Kan Stat Ann 40-3108(a); NJ Stat Ann 39:6A-7(b)(2); ND Cent Code 26.1-41-07(1); Utah Code Ann 31A-22-309(2)(a)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
