The accident occurred while plaintiff was traveling in Iron County on Hillside Road, a dead-end road described as an old logging trail wide enough for one car. Plaintiff collided with the pickup truck, traveling in the opposite direction, when plaintiff rounded a blind curve.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Before the accident, plaintiff was operating his motorcycle on off-road-vehicle trails. Plaintiff was on Hillside Road because it connected two sections of orv trails. Plaintiff suffered multiple injuries and filed suit against the defendant for payment of personal injury protection benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Defendant claims that plaintiff is barred from receiving benefits because he failed to insure his motorcycle as required by the no-fault insurance act, MCL 500.3103; MSA 24.13103,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and because he failed to register his motorcycle as an orv.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiff claims that his motorcycle is exempt from the no-fault act insurance requirement, MCL 257.1603; MSA 9.3300(3), because it is an off-road recreational vehicle under MCL 257.1601(m); MSA 9.3300(l)(m), and that it is irrelevant whether the motorcycle was registered as an orv.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> because the vehicle was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>motorcycle as defined in the no-fault act and plaintiff failed to obtain the required insurance. The trial court held that because the term motorcycle falls within both the no-fault act and the orv act, the no-fault act prevails; therefore, all motorcycle owners must obtain public liability insurance or forfeit personal injury protection benefits. The Court of Appeals affirmed,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The conflict in this case arose because the Legislature, in amending the no-fault act,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> added motorcycles to the list of vehicles for which owners are required to obtain insurance. The Legislature did not, however, amend the orv act, in which motorcycles are included in the definition of off-road recreation vehicles that are exempt from the insurance requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">It is this Court\u2019s duty to read the statutes together to avoid rendering any provision meaningless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>[T]his Court must still give the statute a valid and reasonable construction that will reconcile any inconsistencies and give effect to all its parts. <em>[Girard v </em>Wagenmaker, 437 Mich 231, 238; 470 NW2d 372 (1991).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">We find that the statutory sections can be reconciled.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The first provision apposite to such a reconciliation is the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> enacted in 1965, which sought to provide protection for those injured in a collision with an uninsured motor vehicle. The owner of an uninsured motor vehicle or uninsured motorcycle was required to pay a $45 uninsured motorist fee, which financed the accident claims fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">In October 1973, Michigan adopted the no-fault act. \"The goal of the no-fault insurance system was to provide victims of motor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic losses. . . . [W]hereby every Michigan motorist would be required to purchase no-fault insurance or be unable to operate a motor vehicle legally in this state.\u201d <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 578-579; 267 NW2d 72 (1978). The penalty for not obtaining insurance for a motor vehicle was forfeiture of personal injury protection insurance benefits. MCL 500.3113; MSA 24.13113. The no-fault act, however, expressly excluded motorcycles from the insurance requirement. MCL 500.3101; MSA 24.13101.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">In 1975 the Legislature enacted the orv act. The bill was introduced to \"require that all off-road vehicles . . . which are operated on or over land, snow, ice, marsh, swampland, or other natural terrain be registered with the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>State.\u201d House Legislative Analysis, HB 4729, May 14, 1975. The act specifically excluded orv\u2019s from the no-fault act and the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act requirements. At the time the orv act was enacted, uninsured motorcyclists still were required to pay into the uninsured vehicle fund under the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act. Following the orv act\u2019s enactment, only nonorv motorcycles were required to pay into the fund. This provision is the first time the Legislature distinguished between on- and off-road motorcycles.</p>\n<p id=\"Al9\">In 1975 the Legislature also amended the no-fault act to require motorcycles to obtain public liability insurance.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This amendment was enacted in response to proposed legislation that would abolish the Motor Vehicles Accident Claims Fund.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Apparently, the motorcycle insurance requirement was enacted as a substitute for the accident claims fund in the event it was abolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">In creating the substitute, the Legislature intended that only \"on\u201d road motorcycles be required to obtain public liability insurance. First, the Legislature knew that orv motorcycles already were exempt from the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act, thus no substitute was necessary.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Second, the Legislature knew that orv motorcycles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>already were exempt from the no-fault act,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and they did not take any steps to repeal that exemption. As a result, it appears the motorcycle insurance requirement was intended only for on-road motorcycles.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Furthermore, inherent in the definition of orv is the intention that only off-road vehicles be included. It logically follows that in including the term \"motorcycle\u201d in the orv definition, the Legislature intended to include only motorcycles that were specifically designed for off-road use. Thus, the no-fault act states which vehicles must be insured, and the orv exemption states which vehicles are exempt from the no-fault act insurance requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">For example, the general category of four-wheel motor vehicles must be insured under the no-fault act,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> but a smaller subset of four-wheel motor vehicles are exempt under the orv act. Similarly, orv motorcycles are a subset of the motorcycles otherwise required to be insured. Any motorcycle not designed for use as an orv is not protected by the orv exemption and must be insured under the no-fault act. Therefore, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that when the Legislature amended the no-fault act in 1975 to include motorcycles in the list of vehicles for which insurance was required, the orv exemption for motorcycles no longer applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The 1975 amendment of the no-fault act did not state what penalty would be imposed for failing to obtain public liability insurance for motorcycles. In 1986 the Legislature addressed this problem by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>amending \u00a7 3113 of the no-fault act stating, motorcyclists are \"not entitled to be paid personal protection benefits\u201d if they fail to obtain motorcycle public liability insurance. This amendment in no way indicates an intent to eliminate the distinction between on- and off-road motorcycles;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> it merely states the penalty for failing to obtain public liability insurance for motorcycles when so required.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">If the motorcycle meets the definition of an oev, it remains an oev even if it is not registered as an oev. The Court of Appeals rejected defendant\u2019s argument that registering the motorcycle as an oev is required to invoke the oev exemption. We agree. An oev is an oev regardless whether it is registered as such. In amending \u00a7 3113 of the act in 1986, the Legislature did not state that oev motorcycle owners would forfeit benefits for failing to register the vehicle as an oev.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Although oev motorcycles are exempt from the no-fault aet, an injured motorcyclist is entitled to personal injury protection benefits if the injury occurred in a collision involving a motor vehicle. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>MCL 500.3105; MSA 24.13105.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Once it is established that the accident involved a motor vehicle,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the motorcyclist will look to the no-fault act priority provision to determine the insurance company liable for paying benefits. MCL 500.3114(5); MSA 24.13114(5).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">If the motorcycle is an orv, then the driver is not required to carry any insurance and the priority provisions of MCL 500.3114(5); MSA 24.13114(5) control.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">Determination of no-fault payment priority under MCL 500.3114(5); MSA 24.13114(5) in this case neither subjects the trail bike (orv) to the provisions of the no-fault act nor negates the vehicle\u2019s release from the duties imposed by the no-fault act. <em>[Michigan Millers Mutual Ins Co v Farm Bureau General Ins Co, </em>156 Mich App 823, 829-830; 402 NW2d 96 (1986).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The Court of Appeals decision in <em>Michigan Millers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>is in accord with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Underhill v Safeco Ins Co, </em>407 Mich 175; 284 NW2d 463 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">In <em>Underhill, </em>this Court concluded that the \"act may not be construed as excluding the <em>motorcyclist </em>from its coverage for all purposes merely because <em>motorcycles </em>are excluded from the statutory definition of motor vehicle,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 186 (emphasis in the original), and thus are not required to obtain no-fault benefits coverage. It follows that orv motorcyclists are not excluded from the no-fault act priority provision merely because orv motorcyclists are excluded from the requirement to obtain liability coverage. \"[U]nder the terms of the no-fault act, motorcyclists are entitled to claim no-fault benefits when they are injured in accidents involving motor vehicles.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The only question remaining is whether the plaintiff sufficiently pleaded facts showing that his motorcycle falls within the orv exemption. In <em>Michigan Millers, </em>the parties stipulated facts that indicated that the plaintiff was operating a motorcycle, meeting the motorcycle definition of the no-fault act, but that the motorcycle fell under the orv exemption. The bike was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">not registered as a motorcycle with the State of Michigan and did not have a headlight, taillight, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>turn signals, rear view mirror, speedometer, or other certain devices necessary to be permitted to be used upon a public highway. <em>It was not designed to be used upon a public highway and it could not legally be operated upon a public highway. [Id. </em>at 825-826. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In this case, plaintiff\u2019s motorcycle could not legally be operated as a street bike on public highways because it did not have necessary safety features.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It was designed without a headlight, turn signals, or brake lights. Its knobby tires and higher suspension would be useful only in negotiating extremely difficult terrain. These facts, as those in <em>Michigan Millers, </em>result in a finding that this plaintiff\u2019s motorcycle also meets the orv exemption in that it is designed only for off-road use.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">We hold that the no-fault act and the orv act, read together, demonstrate that although motorcycles designed for use on public highways must be insured, motorcycles designed for off-road recreational purposes are exempt from the no-fault act insurance requirement. There is no evidence that the amendments of the no-fault act were intended to repeal or override the orv motorcycle exemption. Furthermore, failing to register an orv does not result in forfeiture of personal injury protection benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">In this case, plaintiff sufficiently pleaded facts showing that his motorcycle was designed solely for use as an off-road vehicle. The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Appeals, and we remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b681-4\">Levin, Brickley, Boyle, Riley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-5\"> Section 3103(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">An owner or registrant of a motorcycle shall provide security against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for property damage, bodily injury, or death suffered by a person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of that motor vehicle.

The Court of Appeals erroneously held that the instant the plaintiff entered the public road his vehicle became a motorcycle for which liability insurance was required under the no-fault act. In this case, it is undisputed that the road is an old logging trail, but the parties disagree whether it is a private or a public road. Nonetheless, being on a public road does not change the character of an orv and does not automatically disqualify its operator from eligibility for no-fault benefits under MCL 500.3113; MSA 24.13113. See also MCL 257.1614, 257.1624; MSA 9.3300(14), 9.3300(24).
