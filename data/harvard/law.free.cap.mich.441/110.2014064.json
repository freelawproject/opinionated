The Court of Appeals reinstated the award.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">We reverse and remand to the Court of Appeals to consider whether the circuit judge clearly erred in awarding $4,515 compensatory damages for humiliation, extreme embarrassment, emotional distress, indignities to Johnson and her character, and great mental anguish.</p>\n<p id=\"AHm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\">Johnson worked for the Silver Dollar Cafe for approximately fifteen months during 1983 and 1984. The owners, Paul Anson and his wife, Margaret Anson, both worked in the restaurant. Almost immediately after Johnson was hired, Paul Anson made explicit sexual remarks, including that he would like to suck Johnson\u2019s breasts and engage in cunniliiigus. He offered her money to go to bed with him. When she bent over to pick up a pad on the floor, he grabbed her buttocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Johnson complained to Margaret Anson, who sometimes observed this behavior. Margaret Anson would apologize and promise that she would speak to Paul Anson and see that such conduct ceased, and asked Johnson not to quit. But the harassment continued until, eventually, Johnson was discharged. The stated basis was that she had failed to report all the tips she had received.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Johnson claimed that she experienced nightmares, crying spells, and great emotional pain and distress. The Civil Rights Commission awarded Johnson $2,660 in back wages and $30,000 for humiliation, extreme embarrassment, emotional distress, indignities to her person and character, and great mental anguish.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The circuit judge affirmed the award of $2,660 in back wages, but reduced the compensatory award from $30,000 to $4,515, approximately twice the wages. The Court of Appeals reinstated the compensatory award of $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The Ansons do not challenge the finding of sexual harassment or the award of $2,660 in back pay. They contend that the Court of Appeals erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>in stating that \"the circuit court is permitted to substitute its findings of fact only when it has determined that the referee\u2019s findings were not supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence\u201d and may not \"substitute its own findings of fact merely because it disagrees with those reached by the referee.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AEM\">In <em>Walker v Wolverine Fabricating &amp; Mfg Co, Inc, </em>425 Mich 586; 391 NW2d 296 (1986), this Court held that a person who is aggrieved by a decision of the Civil Rights Commission may not introduce evidence on review by the circuit court, and that review by the circuit court is on the record made before the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The Civil Rights Commission contends that <em>Walker </em>also ruled that the review de novo contemplated by the constitution<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is limited to a determination whether there is competent, material, and substantial evidence to support the decision of the Civil Rights Commission, and, accordingly, the circuit court may not make its own findings of fact unless there is an absence of competent, material, and substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The Ansons did not seek to introduce additional evidence in circuit court, and thus there is no need to reconsider whether the decision in <em>Walker, </em>barring the introduction of additional evidence in the circuit court, should be reconsidered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>do not readdress the question actually presented and decided in <em>Walker. </em>As set forth in <em>Walker, </em>additional evidence may not be introduced in the circuit court on review of a decision of the Civil Rights Commission. Review by the circuit court shall continue to be on the record made before the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Although not necessary to decision, this Court in <em>Walker </em>opined regarding the scope of circuit court appellate review, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">[T]he circuit court shall review the record produced at the cec <em>anew, drawing its own inferences and conclusions </em>from that record.

This language is usually associated with the standard of review provided in Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28 and \u00a7 106 of the Administrative Procedures Act [MCL 24.306(d); MSA 3.560(206)(d)].[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">In an apparent effort to harmonize the \"confusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>and contradictory\u201d language of <em>Walker, </em>the Court of Appeals said: \"While the review of crc orders is labeled 'de novo,\u2019 we conclude that the scope of review is qualified by the inclusion of this limiting language\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 \"competent, material, and substantial evidence\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The Civil Rights Commission was established pursuant to Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 29, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">Appeals from final orders of the commission, including cease and desist orders and refusals to issue complaints, shall be tried de novo before the circuit court having jurisdiction provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The constitution also provides for judicial review of agency decisions, and that such review shall include \"as a minimum\u201d a determination whether an agency decision, in which a hearing is required, is supported by \"competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8s\">The Civil Rights Commission would read out of the clause \"tried de novo\u201d the words \"de novo\u201d as well as the word \"tried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The term \"de novo\u201d has been defined as \"anew; afresh; again; a second time; once more; in the same manner, or with the same effect.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It has been said:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The very concept, \"de novo\u201d hearing, means that all matters therein in issue are to be considered \"anew; afresh; over again,\u201d. . . . <em>[People v Bourdon, </em>10 Cal App 3d 878, 881; 89 Cal Rptr 415 (1970).][<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">To give meaning to the term \"de novo,\u201d we must hold that a circuit court, in reviewing a decision of the Civil Rights Commission, may substitute its assessment for the findings, conclusion, and decision of the Civil Rights Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Because it is clear that the circuit judge substituted his judgment for the judgment of the Civil Rights Commission, there is no need to remand to the circuit court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">It is, however, necessary to remand to the Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision. We agree with the Civil Rights Commission that the governing standard on review by the Court of Appeals of a decision of the circuit court, following review by that court of a decision of the Civil Rights Commission, is set forth in <em>Dixon v Ford Motor Co, </em>402 Mich 315, 318-319; 262 NW2d 666 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">In <em>Dixon, </em>the Civil Rights Commission determined that the plaintiff had been discharged be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>cause of race. The circuit court affirmed. The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the circuit court\u2019s decision was not \"supported by competent, material and substantial evidence.\u201d This Court reversed and reinstated the judgment of the circuit court. This Court said that the Court of Appeals reviews a decision of the circuit court under the clearly erroneous standard, and that the Court of Appeals shall \"substitute its own appraisal of the record where, on. review of the 'whole record,\u2019 it is 'left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 <em>Tuttle v Dep\u2019t of State </em>Highways, 397 Mich 44, 46; 243 NW2d 244 (1976).\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Beason v Beason, </em>435 Mich 791, 802; 460 NW2d 207 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">We reverse and remand to the Court of Appeals to consider whether the circuit judge clearly erred in awarding $4,515 compensatory damages for humiliation, extreme embarrassment, emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>distress, indignities to Johnson and her character, and great mental anguish.</p>\n<judges id=\"b278-4\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-12\"> 188 Mich App 147; 469 NW2d 42 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-6\"> <em>Id., </em>p 154.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\"> Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 29; see part m for text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\"> \"An appeal before the circuit court shall be reviewed de novo.\u201d MCL 37.2606(1); MSA 3.548(606)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b273-9\"> In <em>Walker, </em>the complainant appealed from a decision of the Civil Rights Commission dismissing his complaint after finding that there were insufficient grounds to issue a charge.

Mary Johnson began<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> working as a waitress for the owners of the Silver Dollar Cafe, defendants Paul and Margaret Anson, in July 1983. Almost from the beginning, Ms. Johnson became the object of crude, explicit sexual remarks made by Mr. Anson.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On one occasion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Mr. Anson \"grabbed [Ms. Johnson\u2019s] buttocks when she bend [sic] over to pick up her bill pad.\u201d Ms. Johnson became upset and, in response, grabbed \"a knife out of the drawer and threatened to use it if Paul Anson touched her again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Mr. Anson\u2019s conduct \"often reduced [Ms.] Johnson to tears.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She would become visibly upset and extremely nervous when Mr. Anson was present.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mr. Anson would on occasion wait in the cafe\u2019s parking lot at closing time, and because of this, Ms. Johnson often asked patrons to stay with her until she closed the cafe.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Mr. Anson made many of these remarks and performed many of these acts in his wife\u2019s presence. While Mrs. Anson had assured Ms. Johnson that she would talk to her husband and promised that his conduct would stop, it did not. In fact, Mrs. Anson eventually told Ms. Johnson that \"she had to wait on Paul Anson and be cordial toward him.\u201d However, when Ms. Johnson threatened to quit, Mrs. Anson \"begged\u201d her \"not to quit because she was needed.\u201d In October 1984, Ms. Johnson was fired ostensibly for underreporting her tips. The Civil Rights Commission found this to be pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\"No area of administrative law has been subjected to more attention yielding less clarity than the scope of review of administrative action.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Scope of review refers to \"how much a court will undertake to substitute its judgment for that of an agency which has made a decision.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To determine \"how much\u201d of its judgment a court may substitute for that of an agency, this Court must look to the underlying statute that created the agency.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">The Civil Rights Commission was created by Michigan voters when they approved the revised constitution in April 1963.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Article 5, \u00a7 29 pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>vides: \"There is hereby established a civil rights commission . . .

Under \u00a7 606 of the Civil Rights Act, \"An appeal before the circuit court shall be reviewed de novo.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, both the statute and the constitution provide for de novo review of Civil Rights Commission decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">This Court, in <em>Walker v Wolverine Fabricating &amp; Mfg Co, Inc, </em>425 Mich 586; 391 NW2d 296 (1986), interpreted the phrase \"[ajppeals . . . tried de novo\u201d in the constitution to require a review of the record before the Civil Rights Commission.

Notwithstanding the right and duty of the Supreme Court to make its independent evaluation of the evidence, it would not set aside the findings of the trial judge unless it was convinced that a clear showing of error had been made. Running through the opinions are phrases such as \"clear error,\u201d \"manifest error,\u201d \"palpably erroneous.\u201d. . . Especially when there was a sharp conflict in the evidence, the reviewing court would not disturb the trial court\u2019s determination of fact questions, unless it was clear that a wrong conclusion had been reached. The Supreme Court <em>was most reluctant </em>to disturb the findings of a trial judge based on credibility, since the trial judge, as the trier of facts, had the advantage of observing the witnesses. [Quoting 2 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Michigan Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), Authors\u2019 Comments accompanying Rule 517, p 596.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">More recently, in <em>Sparks v Sparks, </em>440 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>141, 147; 485 NW2d 893 (1992), we again discussed, albeit also in a different context, the meaning of de novo review. Chief Justice Cavanagh noted that because the trial court is in a better position to judge the credibility of the witnesses, the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact are entitled to considerable weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">While there does not appear to be a consensus regarding the exact meaning of the term de novo, one thing is clear: This Court has consistently recognized the superior position of the trial court in making findings of fact. In fact, one early article discussing the newly created Civil Rights Commission recognized the superior position of the factfinder in cases brought before the Civil Rights Commission. In discussing the potential interpretation of the term \"de novo\u201d in the constitution, he noted that the reviewing court would be required to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">exercise its independent judgment as to questions of fact, as well as law, on the record complied before the Civil Rights Commission. The difficulty with this view is that findings based on the credibility of witnesses (which are very important in the resolution of discrimination cases) are made by a trier who has neither seen nor heard the witnesses.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Thus, while I agree with Justice Levin that \"[t]o give meaning to the term 'de novo,\u2019 we must hold that a circuit court, in reviewing a decision of the Civil Rights Commission, may substitute its assessment for the findings, conclusion, and decision of the Civil Rights Commission,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 116,1 do not agree that the circuit court\u2019s review is one of unfettered substitution of judgment. The reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>court must recognize the superior position of the initial factfinder in resolving issues of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">I also cannot agree that the circuit court reviewed this matter de novo, as Justice Levin and the Court of Appeals suggest. As Justice Riley notes in her opinion, the circuit court applied the substantial evidence test to the record.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Indeed, the circuit court\u2019s order supports this conclusion. In it the court expressly stated that the Civil Rights Commission\u2019s findings of fact either were supported or not supported by the record. Moreover, the circuit court on review made no independent findings of fact. Thus, I would remand the case to the Court of Appeals for remand to the circuit court for review de novo of the findings and conclusions of the Civil Rights Commission, keeping in mind the superior position of the factfinder in matters of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The scope of the Court of Appeals review of the circuit court\u2019s decision presents \"[t]he question . . . whether each succeeding reviewing court should apply the same standard of review to the agency fact-finding or should instead limit their review to the decisions of the previous court.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aha\">Because the parties do not dispute that we must apply the clearly erroneous standard set forth in <em>Dixon v Ford Motor Co, </em>402 Mich 315; 262 NW2d 666 (1978), this is not the appropriate case to reexamine the clear error standard of appellate review.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Both Justice Levin and Justice Riley adopt that standard, and I agree that reexamination of the question should await another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>It is worth observing, however, that concerns regarding deference to agency expertise are raised not only by the concept of de novo review of the commission by the circuit court, but also by application of the clearly erroneous standard for appellate review articulated in <em>Dixon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Professor LeDuc differentiates between the substantial evidence standard of review and the clearly erroneous standard and concludes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">the clearly erroneous test gives a reviewing court greater flexibility and power than does the substantial evidence test. A decision could meet the substantial evidence test and be reasonable and still be overturned on review under the clearly erroneous test. ... If the appropriate standard is the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court cannot set aside a reasonable, but mistaken finding of fact. If the appropriate standard is the clearly erroneous standard, it can.[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\"><em>Dixon </em>assumed, without expressly deciding, that the Court of Appeals would review the circuit court and not the Civil Rights Commission, the method of review of the decision of the inferior tribunal that comports with the roles of the reviewing courts in the federal system.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In <em>Universal Camera Corp v Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd, </em>340 US 474; 71 S Ct 456; 95 L Ed 456 (1951), the Court characterized its own role in the review of agency findings of fact as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">Our power to review the correctness of application of the present standard ought seldom to be called into action. . . . This Court will intervene only in what ought to be the rare instance when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the standard appears to have been misapprehended or grossly misapplied. <em>[Id. at </em>490-491.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The effect of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Universal Camera </em>is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">the initial court of review operates as the primary locus of judicial review of agency fact-finding and bears the responsibility of applying the appropriate scope of review to such fact-finding. Each subsequent reviewing court reviews the findings of the earlier reviewing court, rather than the findings of the agency. This defines the function of the first reviewing court as the primary fact-finding check on agencies and represents a much better use of judicial resources.[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">In my view, the circuit court applied an incorrect legal standard when it reduced the compensatory damages award of the Civil Rights Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">The purpose of the Civil Rights Act is \"to eradicate discrimination and to make persons whole for injuries suffered as a result of discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As one treatise notes, \"one can easily imagine that some of the most damaging aspects of discrimination affect <em>the person suffering the discrimination </em>rather than his or her pocketbook. . . . [M]any victims of such discrimination describe the occurrence as the singularly most humiliating or enrag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>ing event in their life.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Damages for humiliation, outrage, and embarrassment are allowed under the Civil Rights Act to attempt to make persons whole for the injuries suffered.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7R\">We have held when reviewing a damages award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>for pain and suffering \"that there is no absolute standard by which to measure\u201d awards for pain and suffering,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and that \"awards for personal injury should rest within the sound judgment of the trier of fact, particularly awards for pain and suffering . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We have also recognized that \"since no trier of fact can value pain and suffering with mathematical certainty, a reviewing court must offer 'something more tangible than a difference of opinion as to amount\u2019 before it sets aside a non-jury award as clearly erroneous.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARc\">In <em>Precopio v </em>Detroit, 415 Mich 457; 330 NW2d 802 (1982), we cautioned against using past awards for analogous injuries as the guidepost for determining whether damages were excessive. Analogous cases are only one factor in this decision. Other factors include the evidence presented at the hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s suffering. However, we stated that \"if research uncovers a sufficient sample of reviewed awards, comparisons with analogous cases may prove of some value.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Thus, if awards are analogous, and if research uncovers a sufficient sample, a reviewing court may rely on those amounts._</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>In the instant case, however, the circuit court compared damages for the mental anguish caused by sexual harassment to damages for wrongful death and injury resulting from automobile accidents.

The distinction between the constitutional phrase \"tried de novo\u201d and the use of the statutory phrase \"review de novo\u201d is the source of disagreement between the litigants in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">In <em>Walker v Wolverine Fabricating &amp; Mfg Co, Inc, </em>425 Mich 586, 595; 391 NW2d 296 (1986), we considered the conflicting language and concluded that the constitutional phrase \"tried de novo\u201d is ambiguous with regard to whether it means a new trial appeal on the record or a new trial appeal based on the production of the new evidence. We determined that, given the Constitutional Convention debates and this Court\u2019s construction of the Fair Employment Practices Act in previous cases, the phrase \"appeals . . . tried de novo\u201d means an appeal on the record. <em>Id. </em>We then concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">one who is aggrieved by a final decision of the crc and who seeks review in the circuit court is not entitled to an entirely new evidentiary proceeding in the circuit court.

The lead opinion suggests that \"[t]o give meaning to the term 'de novo,\u2019 we must hold that a circuit court, in reviewing a decision of the Civil Rights Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>sion, may substitute [the referee\u2019s] assessment for the findings, conclusion, and decision of the Civil Rights Commission.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 116. We expressly rejected this holding in <em>Walker </em>because we determined that the Civil Rights Commission was never intended to be merely a precursor to circuit court action. We concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">[t]his interpretation furthermore meets the concerns of Constitutional Convention delegates who wanted to protect the public from an arbitrary and nonresponsible commission without making the commission an ineffective and toothless agency whose actions would be a perfunctory and largely useless prelude to the real action in the circuit court. Our analysis convinces us that trial of appeals on the record is what those who voted for a new civil rights commission really voted for, because anything else would not achieve their purposes. <em>[Id. </em>at 595-596.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In finding that the Constitutional Convention delegates created an agency whose findings would be upheld by a circuit court providing that substantial evidence supports the Civil Rights Commission\u2019s findings, we forbade the introduction of new evidence on appeal and limited circuit court review to the record. <em>Id. </em>at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">As a logical extension of this rule, the substantial evidence rule limits a reviewing court to examining the findings of the commission on the record and ascertaining whether there is a sufficient factual basis on the record to support the commission\u2019s findings. As one author explained, it is not the function of the reviewing court to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">look into the record\u2019s evidentiary facts to determine for itself whether on the merits it feels that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>it would make the same finding or, if not, then to remand; its own views on the merits are not competent; its only task is to ascertain the substantiality of the agency\u2019s findings as disclosed by the record. [Forkosch, <em>Judicial de novo review of administrative quasi-judicial fact determinations, </em>25 Hastings L J 963, 964 (1974).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In light of the analysis provided in <em>Walker </em>and the policy concerns that guided the Court\u2019s decision, I believe that circuit court review of decisions made by the Civil Rights Commission is limited to determining whether the commission\u2019s findings of fact and legal conclusions are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The lead opinion suggests that \"it is clear that the circuit judge substituted his judgment for the judgment of the Civil Rights Commission . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 116. This observation is not supported by the record. The record reflects that the circuit judge consciously,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> deliberately,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and methodically<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>reviewed the entire record<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the corresponding case law<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> before reaching his decision regarding whether the evidence supported the decision to award $30,000 in compensatory damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Indeed, it was the trial judge who thoroughly reviewed each and every page of the referee\u2019s record and the evidence produced to ascertain if the record substantiated the referee\u2019s award of $30,000 in compensatory damages, and if in fact the damages award was indeed compensatory, rather than punitive. One need only examine the trial court\u2019s review of the record in this action to reach this conclusion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Thus, in applying the substantial evidence test to the record and the evidence presented, the circuit court judge concluded that the evidence did not support the decision to award $30,000 in compensatory damages. Contrary to the majority\u2019s observation, he did not substitute his judgment for that of the Civil Rights Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">As the majority recognizes, we held in <em>Dixon v Ford Motor Co, </em>402 Mich 315, 318; 262 NW2d 666 (1978), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">[t]he constitutional standard for judicial review of agency action \u2014 competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record \u2014 is not a higher standard than the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>rule 517.1. Rule 517.1 requires that the reviewing court substitute its own appraisal of the record where, on review of the \"whole record,\u201d it is \"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Tuttle v Dep\u2019t of State </em>Highways, 397 Mich 44, 46; 243 NW2d 244 (1976). If the reviewing court, the Court of Appeals, concludes on its examination of the record that the judgment on appeal is not supported by \"competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record,\u201d then it should have a \"definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Because I am not \"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d by the circuit judge who reviewed the record and the evidence submitted in this case, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the circuit court for an entry of an order pursuant to its original decision. <em>Dixon, supra, </em>p 319.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\"> Equally established in this Court\u2019s First Amendment jurisprudence is that we will independently review the evidence and the record in libel cases, without substituting our judgment of the facts for that of the jury, to \"ensure that constitutional principles are properly applied,\u201d <em>Rouch v Enquirer &amp; News of Battle Creek (After Remand), </em>440 Mich 238, 253; 487 NW2d 205 (1992); <em>Locricchio v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>438 Mich 84, 110-114; 476 NW2d 112 (1991), thus using a higher standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-9\"> I have no argument with the finding of the hoard \u2014 or Bureau, that there has been a violation of civil rights. It would be ridiculous for me to state that I disagreed with them. The law again is very clear that once a finding is made, they \u2014 being the people who judge credibility cases \u2014 would be few and far between where a court interjected their opinion. I also have no problem with taking and accepting as true that which was claimed by the claimant herein, so far as the actions and the statements of Mr. Anson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b295-10\"> Here I agree with the findings, the actions of Mr. Anson did exceed propriety and I have no quarrel with that.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b295-11\"> But, again, I accede to the findings of the administrative law judge, such as they are.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\"> I have read through this voluminous 575 plus pages of transcript and find that about a good share of it never should have been testified to, had no bearing whatsoever. ... I also find that the briefs as filed either exaggerate or denigrate the facts that took place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\"> There\u2019s no argument in this particular case that the judge in that \u2014 administrative judge and myself cannot award punitive damages. The case cited by counsel, <em>Eide v Kelsey-Hayes, </em>431 Mich 26 [427 NW2d 488 (1988)] sets that one out with no reservations. So we\u2019re dealing strictly with compensatory damage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\"> No consideration was given, however, to the availability of equal or like employment or labor market or anything else in the Litchfield area. Possibly the claim was within the evidence, and I don\u2019t disturb it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b296-9\"> I noticed on one occasion, . . . where she can\u2019t sleep nights. I think this is in one of the briefs. The part I found in her testimony, at least, was that on one night she stayed up all night talking with her husband, much less than I can\u2019t sleep nights. This was one where they were discussing some action that had taken place by Anson. Claims that she had a complete change in personalities and so forth. And yet when I read the transcript she apparently was a very happy waitress, known to everybody as \"Smiles.\u201d Only when Mr. Anson came around she was not known as \"Smiles.\u201d I don\u2019t believe that Mr. \u2014 or Mrs. Johnson was a Dr. Jekell [sic] and Mr. Hyde. She apparently did have some concerns when Mr. Anson was present. Difficult for me to understand, however, that she can be known as \"Smiles\u201d to the trade for 19 hours a week; for the hour that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Anson is there, for whatever time period, has a complete change in personality.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Again, I concede to the findings of the administrative law judge. Don\u2019t necessarily agree with them all, but I concede to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">It appears that each and every problem that was testified to by Mrs. Johnson is attributable to the acts of Mr. Anson. Yet, as Mr. Susskind indicated, there has been no follow-up so far as her problems are concerned. The doctor who she saw, Dr. Jones, Patsy Jones, a chiropractor, apparently assisted her with some tightness in her back, on a half a dozen or so occasions. She wasn\u2019t sure how often. Such ended the medical treatment. No report was made to the Department of Civil Rights until after the employment terminated. And then, as I recall her testimony, she stated the story to four or five or six women at the state building, along with the person who reduced her complaint to writing. And that complaint leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to hearsay, much of which wasn\u2019t substantiated, by the way, insofar as the record is concerned. One statement I recall in that complaint as filed said that many people left the employment of the restaurant because of Anson\u2019s antics. Such was not substantiated from my reading of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Claimant in this case, Miss Johnson, had many problems, she indicated. I was somewhat surprised that neither counsel picked up on one portion of the transcript as to the reason for those problems. I like to quote transcripts that haven\u2019t been quoted in briefs. <em>That way I can convince the attorneys and the appellate courts that I did read them.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">On the hearing of December 8, 1987, page 99 \u2014 I don\u2019t know who at the time is examining her. I\u2019m looking at the index and it would appear that this is cross examination by Mr. Susskind. I\u2019m going to read a portion of this simply to state what I\u2019m talking about. Showing line 8:</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\"[Q.] You have not had any reason to treat with a doctor, ani I getting that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">\"A. I go for a mammogram.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">\"Q. Periodic checkups?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">\"[A.] Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\"><em>\"Q. </em>Just regular checkup type things?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">\"A. Uh-huh.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\"><em>\"Q. </em>Okay. And that would include psychologists, psychiatrists, any medical doctor, including chiropractors and whatever, true?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">\"A. I\u2019ve never went to a psychiatrist or any of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">\"Q. You had mentioned going to Patsy Jones, who is a chiropractor, while you were working there. Did you have just a back sprain or\u201d\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b297-17\">And here I underline, underscore and put in quotes, along with parentheses, if I can do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number><em>\"A. </em>No. I was under a lot of stress from the incidents of the verbal abuse. Plus I had \u2014 my husband had an accident and just everyday stress. And I had a few deaths in my family. And I would go because my neck \u2014 I would be real stiff and Patsy was the one to pull me out of their restaurant and take me down and help me.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\"><em>\"Q. </em>Give you an adjustment?</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">\"A. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">In reading the testimony I find that Mr. Johnson suffered apparently some severe war wounds, and that subsequent to that, in 1977, if I have my memory correct, was involved in a truck accident and became seriously injured. And according to all the hearsay that came into the hearing, Mrs. Johnson had been advised by Mr. Johnson\u2019s doctors that his life expectancy was not great after he attained the age of 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">Then she also states on page 99, as I just read, everyday stress, she had some deaths in the family, and she said she was under a lot of stress from the incidents of verbal abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\"><em>In other words, there\u2019s no one basis for the problems, whatever they may be, of Mrs. Johnson, and she so admitted. </em>It would appear from the transcript or from the findings of the referee or administrative judge, whatever they\u2019re termed, that all the troubles of the world and especially of Mrs. Johnson were laid at the feet of Mr. Anson due to his actions. I mention this only in passing, for the purpose of getting to where we\u2019re headed here, namely compensatory damages. [Emphasis added.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
