There are two issues: (1) whether claimant, disqualified under the act for voluntarily terminating his employment, can requalify for benefits under the act outside the State of Michigan; (2) whether claimant, after he moved home to Kentucky, was disqualified from receiving benefits for refusing the employer\u2019s offer of his former job or whether claimant\u2019s rejection of this reemployment offer was with \"good cause\u201d because the offer was not an offer of \"suitable work\u201d due to the unreasonable distance between his Kentucky residence and the Michigan job offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">At the outset, it is essential we bear in mind that our unemployment compensation act is part of a Federal-state unemployment compensation system. This Federal-state system is grounded in the Federal Social Security Act, the WagnerPeyser Act, and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, together with state laws enacted in conform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ity with the standards set forth by these Federal laws. The Federal-state system is implemented by a Federal tax offset to the employers of a state provided that the state\u2019s unemployment compensation law conforms to minimum Federal standards. Furthermore, every state legislature has included in its state unemployment compensation law provisions authorizing the responsible executive (in Michigan, the Michigan Employment Security Commission \u2014 MESC) to enter into interstate agreements. These agreements are essentially designed to deal with claimants who earned qualifying wages in one state but who upon being separated from employment moved their residence to another state and claimants who at the time of their separation from employment had accumulated wage credits sufficient to make them eligible for benefits in more than one state. Inherent in these agreements is the recognition of every state legislature of the Federal dimension of the unemployment laws and the mobility of labor essential to the operation of our private enterprise system. Both the spirit and letter of our act support these Federal and interstate aspects of unemployment compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Accordingly, because of the plain language of our act as well as the aforesaid state-Federal implications, we hold that claimant Bingham, a Kentucky worker who left a Michigan job because he could not find adequate housing for his family at a price he could afford, returned to Kentucky, registered for work with the appropriate employment office there, diligently sought and made himself available for suitable work, but turned down a job offer from his former Michigan employer due to the distance from his Kentucky residence, (1) requalified for benefits after serving the period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>disqualification under the act, and (2) was not disqualified for refusing his former employer\u2019s job offer because the offer was not an offer of \"suitable work\u201d and was therefore rejected by claimant with \"good cause\u201d due to the fact that the job was too far distant from his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">We reinstate the administrative determination of the Michigan Employment Security Commission, and reverse the trial court and the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">I \u2014 Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Claimant Arlie K. Bingham was employed by American Screw Products Company from February 17, 1969 to November 17, 1969. He worked as a machine operator; his last wage-rate was $3.10. per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Bingham testified that he left his Michigan employment because he had been unable to find adequate housing for his wife and four children in Michigan at a price which he could afford. Bingham explained that while he was employed in Michigan he had searched continuously for a home in which his wife and four children could live. His family came to Michigan and lived with him for approximately one month; but the living quarters were inadequate. Because he was unable to find adequate living quarters within his means, his family was forced to return to Pineville, Kentucky, his original home. After his family returned to Kentucky, Bingham made further efforts to find adequate living quarters, but his efforts proved futile. He thereupon severed his Michigan employment, returning to Pineville, Kentucky, to join his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">On December 2, 1969, Bingham filed an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>state claim for unemployment benefits with the Commonwealth of Kentucky Division of Employment Service in Middlesboro, Kentucky. On February 20, 1970 the Michigan Employment Security Commission issued a determination holding (1) claimant\u2019s separation from employment was \"a voluntary leaving without good cause attributable to the employer\u201d under \u00a7 29(l)(a) of the Michigan Employment Security Act; (2) claimant was thereby disqualified under \u00a7 29(1)(a) of the act for the week ending November 22, 1969 and was subject to a 6-week requalification period under \u00a7 29(3), the requalification period having been completed as of January 10, 1970; (3) claimant\u2019s benefit entitlement was reduced by 6 weeks as provided in \u00a7 29(4) of the act (from 2'6 to 20 weeks).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">On March 9, 1970, the employer protested the MESC determination. The employer took no exception to the MESC\u2019s finding that Bingham\u2019s separation was \"voluntary * * * without good cause attributable to the employer\u201d under \u00a7 29(1)(a) of the act. However, the employer stated that on March 9, 1970 notice had been sent to Bingham to report to work on his regular job not later than March 16, 1970. Bingham, at that time living in Kentucky, refused the offer of work because of its distance from his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">On April 3, 1970, the MESC issued a redetermination affirming its determination of February 20, 1970. The MESC held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">\"[C]laimant established good cause for not reporting when recalled to report on 3/12/70 and is not subject to disqualification under the provisions of subsection 29(l)(a) of the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">\"Claimant has a car for transportation and is seeking work within a radius of 50 miles of Middlesboro, Ky., where work is generally similar to work he performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>in Michigan is available. He is not placing any restrictions on his availability for work as to hours or wages. He is actively seeking work and the Kentucky agency stated that his chances of securing employment are fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">\"Claimant completed the requalification requirements of the Michigan act based on his separation. He fully meets the eligibility requirements of the Michigan act and is held eligible for benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">This redetermination was affirmed by a Michigan Employment Security Commission Referee on October 14, 1970. On March 24, 1971, the Michigan Employment Security Commission Appeal Board also affirmed the redetermination.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">On August 20, 1973, the circuit court reversed the appeal board decision. The court held that (1) the act prohibited Bingham from requalifying for unemployment benefits while residing outside the State of Michigan; (2) Bingham was required to have been available for work within the community where he lived when his employment relationship was severed (in this case Michigan) in order to have met the eligibility requirements of \u00a7 28(1)(c) of the act, MCLA 421.28; MSA 17.530; thus claimant was ineligible to receive benefits because he refused to accept the employer\u2019s Michigan job offer although he was living in Kentucky at the time the offer was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">On November 27, 1974, the Court of Appeals affirmed part (2) of the circuit court\u2019s opinion, which held \"suitable\u201d the Michigan offer of work made to Bingham while he was living in Kentucky. 57 Mich App 21; 225 NW2d 199 (1974). The court held that as a matter of law the act required Bingham be available for work both at the locality in which he resided at the time the offer of work was made (Kentucky) and at the locality at which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>he resided during the period he earned his base period credit weeks (Michigan). The Court did not rule on part (1) of the circuit court\u2019s opinion, <em>i.e. </em>whether Bingham could requalify for benefits while residing outside the State of Michigan. The Court held that this issue was not properly before it because the employer had not timely protested the February 20, 1970 MESC determination of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The MESC applied for leave to appeal the Court of Appeals decision. This Court granted leave on February 6, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">II \u2014 Claimant Requalified for Benefits While Outside the State of Michigan</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">The first issue, properly<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> raised by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>court, is whether Bingham satisfied the requalification requirements of \u00a7 29(3) while outside the State of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Section 29(3) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\"(3) An individual who is disqualified under subsection 29(1) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> shall * * * complete 6 requalifying weeks * * * for each of which he * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\"(b) would otherwise meet all the requirements of this act to receive a waiting period credit or a benefit payment if he were not disqualified under subsection 29(1) * * * \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> MCLA 421.29(3); MSA 17.531(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">In other words, a claimant can requalify for benefits by being <em>eligible </em>for benefits under the act during the 6-week requalification period. This being the case, the relevant question in determining the above stated issue is: was Bingham eligible for benefits under the act during the 6-week period beginning the week ending November 22, 1969, and terminating January 10, 1970, while in Pine-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>ville, Kentucky? The answer to this question is clearly yes. The act provided (\u00a7 28[1]):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\">\"An unemployed individual shall be eligible to receive benefits with respect to any week only if the commission finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">\"(a) He has registered for work at and thereafter has continued to report at an employment office in accordance with such regulations as the commission may prescribe and is seeking work * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\"(c) He is able and available to perform full-time work of a character which he is qualified to perform by past experience or training, and of a character generally similar to work for which he has previously received wages, and he is available for such work, full time, either at a locality at which he earned wages for insured work during his base period or at a locality where it is found by the commission that such work is available.\u201d MCLA 421.28(1); MSA 17.530(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Bingham registered for work, pursuant to \u00a7 28(1)(a), with the Kentucky Division of Employment Service in Middlesboro, Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Section 43 of the act defines \"employment office\u201d as \"a free public employment office or branch thereof operated by this state <em>or any other state as a part of a state-controlled system of public employment offices\u201d </em>MCLA 421.43; MSA 17.547 (emphasis added). Thus Bingham\u2019s registration was wholly satisfactory and in accord with the \"registration for work\u201d requirement of \u00a7 29(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">In addition, Bingham was \"seeking work\u201d (\u00a7 28[1] [a]) and \"able and available\u201d for work as required by the act. This Court, in <em>Bolles v Employment Security Commission, </em>361 Mich 378, 385; 105 NW2d 192 (1960), declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">\"Such is the purpose of the requirement (for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>eligibility to benefits) that a claimant be 'able and available\u2019 to work, that he register for work, and seek work. These * * * are indicia of genuine attachment to the labor market.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In <em>Dwyer v Unemployment Compensation Commission, </em>321 Mich 178, 188-189; 32 NW2d 434 (1948), we defined \"availability\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">\"The basic purpose of the requirement that a claimant must be available for work to be eligible for benefits is to provide a test by which it can be determined whether or not the claimant is actually and currently attached to the labor market. To be available for work within the meaning of the act, the claimant must be genuinely attached to the labor market, <em>i.e., </em>he must be desirous to obtain employment, and must be willing and ready to work.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">It is clear that Bingham was \"seeking work\u201d and \"able and available\u201d for work in the above sense, <em>i.e. </em>Bingham genuinely attached himself to the labor market within the environs of his home. It is also clear that Bingham was properly \"seek<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ing work\u201d and \"able and available\u201d for work although he was not doing so in the locality where he earned his base credit weeks <em>(i.e., </em>Michigan).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Section 28(1)(c) requires that a claimant must be available for work, full time, etc., \"either at a locality at which he earned wages for insured work during his base period or at a locality where it is found by the commission that such work is available\u201d. On its face the statute provides two alternative localities in which a claimant may be available for work: (1) where he earned his base credit weeks (in this case, Michigan); (2) where the commission finds suitable work available for the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The second alternative is obviously written into the statute to provide for the situation where a claimant registers for benefits in a locality other than that in which he earned his base credit weeks and seeks available work <em>(i.e. </em>genuinely attaches himself to the labor market), as is a claimant\u2019s statutory right under \u00a7 28(l)(a) read in conjunction with \u00a7 43 <em>supra. </em>Of course, the \"new locality\u201d in which a claimant registers for work, seeks work, and is \"able and available\u201d for work where the commission finds work available can be either in any part of Michigan or in another state. See discussion of \u00a7 28(l)(a) and \u00a7 43 <em>supra. </em>This conclusion is in full accord with other state courts who have adopted the \"availability\u201d test we adopted in <em>Dwyer. </em>As the Superior Court of Pennsylvania declared in <em>Sturdevant Unemployment Compensation Case, </em>158 Pa Super 548, 560-561; 45 A2d 898, 905 (1946):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">\"There is no requirement in the quoted section, nor elsewhere in the act, that a claimant shall be available for work in any particular place, such as the locality in which he earned his wage credits or where he last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>worked or resided. The mere fact that a claimant has moved from one locality to another does not create a basis for holding him unavailable for work. If he registers for work in the new locality, and labor-market conditions there afford reasonable opportunities for work, he is available for work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">See, in accord, <em>Employment Security Commission v Kosic, </em>12 Ariz App 455; 471 P2d 757 (1970); <em>Hunter v Miller, supra; Ashmore v Unemployment Compensation Commission, supra. </em>See, also, Anno, <em>Unemployment Compensation as Affected by Employee\u2019s or Employer\u2019s Removal from Place of Employment, </em>13 ALR2d p 874, pp 880-883.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Bingham therefore clearly satisfied the requalification requirement of \u00a7 29(3)(b) of the act by meeting all the requirements of the act \"to receive a benefit payment if he were not disqualified under subsection (1)\u201d, while in Pineville, Kentucky. The trial court\u2019s holding that Bingham could not re-qualify for benefits outside the state of Michigan is in error and is reversed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>III \u2014 Claimant Was Not Disqualified Prom Receiving Benefits Under the Act</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The second, central issue in this case is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Bingham (having requalified for benefits under \u00a7 29[3] [b]) was disqualified under the act because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>he refused an offer by American Screw Works of his former job.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Section 29(1) of the act states that \"[a]n individual shall be disqualified for benefits in all cases in which he * * * (e) Has failed without good cause to accept suitable work when offered him * * * \u201d. Section 29(6) of the act defines \"suitable work\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">\"In determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual, the commission shall consider * * * the distance of the available work from his residence.\u201d MCLA 421.29(6); MSA 17.531(6).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Was American Screw Works\u2019 offer of reemployment to Bingham an offer of \"suitable work\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 29(6)? The legal answer turns on the statutory meaning of the word \"residence\u201d in \u00a7 29(6), <em>i.e. </em>did Bingham have \"good cause\u201d to refuse the offer because of the unreasonable distance between the locality of the reemployment offer and his \"residence\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The word \"residence\u201d is not defined in the act. In the absence of a statutory definition of a term,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">\"it is an accepted rule of construction, that words of a statute are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning, for it is to be presumed that the legislature, not having indicated otherwise, so intended.\u201d 22 Callaghan\u2019s Michigan Civil Jurisprudence, \u00a7 121, p 479.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">See <em>Grand Rapids Gravel Co v Department of Treasury, </em>14 Mich App 677, 681-682; 166 NW2d 53 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">The common sense, \"plain and ordinary\u201d meaning of the word \"residence\u201d is clear: a person\u2019s \"residence\u201d is where that person actually lives. Bingham lived in Pineville, Kentucky. A job offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>in Farmington, Michigan is an unreasonable distance from Pineville, Kentucky and therefore not \"suitable work\u201d under \u00a7 29(6). Accordingly, Bingham should not be disqualified for refusing such a job offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The legal answer to the meaning of \"residence\u201d substantiates the common sense answer. In <em>Wright v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>117 Mich 244, 245; 75 NW 465 (1898), this Court defined the ordinary meaning of \"residence\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">\"Residence means the place where one resides; an abode; a dwelling or habitation; especially,- a settled or permanent home or domicile. Residence is made up of fact and intention. There must be the fact of abode, and the intention of remaining. <em>Estate of Heron, </em>6 Phila 87, 90 (Register\u2019s Ct, 1865).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">In <em>In re Scheyer\u2019s Estate, </em>336 Mich 645, 651-652; 59 NW2d 33 (1953), in discussing the ordinary meaning of \"residence\u201d, we affirmed the definition articulated in the <em>Wright </em>case. In addition, we declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">\"Throughout the definitions of 'home\u2019 and 'residence,\u2019 as herein quoted above, runs the thought of permanence, of a place to which one returns, a place where one intends to remain, a haven or domicile. <em>Suggested, too, is the thought of 1 unit or 1 place as contrasted with several. One cannot be permanently located in more than 1 place; </em>one cannot be domiciled in more than 1 place; <em>one cannot intend to remain for an extended period of time in more than 1 place. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Applying this definition to the facts of this case, it is clear that Bingham\u2019s \"residence\u201d, his \"settled or permanent home,\u201d where he \"intends to remain\u201d, is Pineville, Kentucky. Therefore, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>\u00a7 29(l)(e) read in conjunction with \u00a7 29(6), Bingham was not disqualified for refusing American Screw Works\u2019 reemployment offer because his refusal was with \"good cause\u201d; the offer was not an offer of \"suitable work\u201d because the locality of the reemployment offer (Farmington, Michigan) was clearly an unreasonable distance from his Pineville, Kentucky residence. We hold that the claimant was not disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The Court of Appeals, in a 2-to-l decision, however, held that Bingham was disqualified under \u00a7 29(l)(d) for having refused an offer of \"suitable work\u201d without \"good cause\u201d. The Court reached its holding by ruling, as a matter of law, that \"residence\u201d in \u00a7 29(6) \"means both the locality in which the claimant resides at the time the offer of the job was made <em>and </em>the localities in which claimant resided during the period he earned the base period credit weeks\u201d. (Emphasis added.) 57 Mich App 21, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">We find the Court of Appeals holding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">First, the Court\u2019s unorthodox interpretation of the word \"residence\u201d to mean that a claimant may reside in two (or more) places rather than one place must be rejected in light of the definition of the word \"residence\u201d pronounced by this Court in <em>Wright v Genesee Circuit Judge </em>and <em>In re Schemer\u2019s Estate, </em>the definition we must apply in this case because of the lack of a statutory definition of the term. Furthermore, to interpret \"residence\u201d as the Court of Appeals does would be essentially amending \u00a7 29(6) to reach a result contrary to that mandated by the plain language fixed by the Legislature. This we cannot do.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">\"It is not the proper function of the court to amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the statute to broaden or extend the disqualifications fixed, in plain language, by the legislature.\u201d <em>Thomas v Employment Security Commission, </em>356 Mich 665, 669; 97 NW2d 784 (1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Second, the result of the Court of Appeals holding is that where an offer of reemployment is made to an employee who has moved and established residence in a locality outside the radius of what constitutes a reasonable distance from the locality where he earned his base credit weeks, he must accept such an offer or be disqualified by the commission.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This result, which would effectively discourage (if not altogether impede) an involuntarily as well as voluntarily unemployed person who desires to exercise his fundamental right of freedom of movement to seek a job where it is best for him within our private enterprise system, is clearly contrary to those statutory provisions which enable the MESC to enter into reciprocal interstate agreements in recognition of the mobility of labor and must, therefore, be rejected.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Third, this result of the Court of Appeals hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ing is inconsonant with the underlying law and spirit of the Federal-state unemployment compensation system. The Employment Security Amendments of 1970, Internal Revenue Code of 1954, speak directly to this point. Section 3304(a)(9)(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">\"[C]ompensation shall not be denied or reduced to an individual solely because he files a claim in another State * * * <em>or because he resides in another State </em>* * * at the time he files a claim for unemployment compensation.\u201d 26 USC 3304(a)(9)(A). (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The need for conformity to basic Federal law in this area is illustrated by <em>California Department of Human Resources Development v Java, </em>402 US 121; 91 S Ct 1347; 28 L Ed 2d 666 (1971), where the Supreme Court enjoined the withholding of employee benefits pending employee appeal as violative of \u00a7 303(a)(1) of the Social Security Act, 42 USCA 503(a)(1), which requires administration of state unemployment compensation laws in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>manner \"reasonably calculated to insure full payment of unemployment benefits when due\u201d. 402 US 121, 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">However, under the Court of Appeals holding, an unemployed person who moves to another state (outside the radius of what constitutes a \"reasonable distance\u201d from the Michigan locality where he earned base credit weeks) and becomes eligible for benefits there, would have to accept a reemployment offer or be disqualified by the MESC. In effect, such a person faces the prospect of being denied compensation, \"because he resides in another state\u201d. This kind of ruling would, therefore, frustrate the Federal policy expressed in 26 USC 3304(a)(9)(A) as effectively as the construction enjoined in <em>Java. </em>If challenged, it is likely that it would be enjoined to secure Federal conformity. But we need not fear this prospect because our holding that the common, ordinary meaning of \"residence\u201d applies to \u00a7 29(6) vindicates, rather than frustrates, the Federal scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Finally, the Court of Appeals reached its holding that \"residence\u201d in \u00a7 29(6) means either a claimant\u2019s residence when the job offer is made or a claimant\u2019s residence at the time he earned his base credit weeks on the basis of erroneous statutory construction. First, the court argued that it would be anomalous to say the eligibility requirement in \u00a7 28(1)(c) conjunctively required seeking work <em>\"either </em>at a locality in which he earned his credit weeks or at a locality where the commission finds available work\u201d and not to rule the same way with respect to the disqualification in \u00a7 29(1)(d). However, the fact of the matter is that in part II we have already held that \u00a7 28(1)(c) is clearly disjunctive and not conjunctive. Consequently, there is no anomaly.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Second, the Court of Appeals feared an anomaly between \u00a7 29(6) and \u00a7 28(1)(a)(2). Section 28(1)(a)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">\"Except for period of disqualification, the requirement that the individual shall seek work may be waived by the commission where it finds that suitable work is unavailable both in the locality where the individual resides and in those localities in which the individual has earned base period credit weeks.\u201d MCLA 421.28(1)(a)(2); MSA 17.530(1)(a)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The Court of Appeals argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">\"This language clearly indicates that suitable work may exist not only in the locality where the claimant resides but also at the localities at which claimant earned credit weeks. We are thereby compelled to conclude that the term 'residence\u2019 as used in \u00a7 29(6) means both the locality in which the claimant resides at the time the offer of the job was made and the localities in which claimant resided during the period he earned the base period credit weeks.\u201d 57 Mich App 21, 29.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">The Court of Appeals argument, although superficially plausible, is fundamentally erroneous. First, \u00a7 28(1)(a)(2), instead of suggesting that \u00a7 29(6) refers to two (or more) residences, clearly recognizes that the locality of residence and where the individual earned base period credit weeks may be two separate localities. Section 29(6), of course, considers only the former, or locality of residence. Second, the locality of residence and the locality where base credit weeks are earned may be two separate places but not so distant from each other that work at the latter would not be within reasonable distance from the claimant\u2019s residence. Thus, \u00a7 28(1)(a)(2) and \u00a7 29(6) can be logically interpreted together.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Because of the clear language in the Michigan Employment Security Act, the interstate agreements accompanying it, and the Federal-state dimension integral to it, we hold that claimant Bingham, a Kentucky worker who left a Michigan job because he could not find adequate housing for his family at a price he could afford, returned to Kentucky, registered for work with the appropriate employment office there, diligently sought and made himself available for suitable work, but turned down a job offer from his former Michigan employer due to the distance from his Kentucky residence, (1) requalified for benefits after serving the period of disqualification under the act, and (2) was not disqualified for refusing his former employer\u2019s job offer because the offer was not an offer of \"suitable work\u201d and was therefore rejected with \"good cause\u201d due to the fact that the job was too far distant from his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We reinstate the administrative determination of the Michigan Employment Security Commission, and reverse the trial court and the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">No costs, a public question.</p>\n<judges id=\"b615-8\">Kavanagh, C.

The basis of the court\u2019s decision was that the employer did not file its protest of the February 20, 1970 determination within the 15-day period prescribed by \u00a7 32a of the act. Section 32a provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">\"The commission shall upon application by an interested party filed with the commission within 15 days after the mailing or personal service of a notice of determination, or may upon its own motion within said period, review any determination and thereafter issue a redetermination affirming, modifying or reversing the prior determination and stating the reasons therefor. * * * \u201d MCLA 421.32a; MSA 17.534(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Both the MESC and the employer contend the court\u2019s decision not to rule on this issue was in error. We agree. A review of the record reveals that the employer protested the February 20, 1970 determination on March 9, 1970. The fifteenth day after February 20, 1970 was Saturday, March 7, 1970.- Because the last day of the 15-day period was a Saturday, the time for filing the appeal was automatically extended to Monday, March 9, 1970, pursuant to \u00a7 49 of the act, which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">\"Whenever the last day of the 15-day period, provided for in sections 14, 32a, 33, 34 and 38, falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, such 15-day period shall run until the end of the next day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor legal holiday. * * * \u201d MCLA 421.49; MSA 17.553(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">When \u00a7 49 of the act is applied, it is clear that the employer\u2019s protest of the February 20, 1970 determination was timely filed on March 9, 1970.

We conclude that Murphy stands disqualified under the act.\u201d 29 Mich App 155, 165.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">We disagree with this reasoning and conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals in <em>Roman Cleanser. </em>The court fails to mention that in <em>Merren </em>this Court was presented with a statute <em>altogether different in substance from \u00a7 29(3). </em>Section 29(1)(a)(1) of the act, which was the statute at issue in <em>Merren, </em>(1955 PA 281) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">\"(1) An individual shall be disqualified for benefits:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-12\">\"(a) For the duration of his unemployment in all cases where the individual has: (1) Left his work voluntarily without good cause attributable to the employer or employing unit * * * .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-13\">\"Provided further, however, That if an individual leaves his work voluntarily without good cause attributable to the employer for the purpose of accepting permanent full-time work with another employer, and if, during the 39 weeks following his separation he is laid off for lack of work by his new employer, enough of his credit weeks with his separating employer whom he left voluntarily shall be reinstated so that the total number of weeks of benefits available to him from all employers at the time of such lay off will not be less than if he had been laid off by the said separating employer * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABkd\">In <em>Merren, </em>the claimant voluntarily left his Michigan employer and went to work in Florida for a Florida employer. He was then laid off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>by his Florida employer and filed a claim for benefits under the MESA, asking for reinstatement or use of a part of his Michigan credit weeks which were previously cancelled by his voluntary termination of employment in Michigan. The Court of Appeals accurately perceived the issue in <em>Merren </em>as being whether claimant, having been disqualified under the act for voluntarily terminating his Michigan employment was entitled to reinstatement or use of any part of the \"credit weeks\u201d he had acquired while working for his Michigan employer, which were cancelled as an incident of his disqualification. <em>See </em>3 Mich App 383, 385, 386. Claimant contended that he should not have been disqualified under the proviso of then \u00a7 29(1)(aX1) <em>supra. </em>Both the Court of Appeals and this Court recognized that the merit of claimant\u2019s contention turned on the meaning of the word \"employer\u201d as used in the portion of the proviso which states: \"for the purpose of accepting permanent full-time work with another employer\u201d. This, Court then looked to the interaction of \u00a7 40 and \u00a7 41 of the act. Section 40 of the act defined \"employing unit\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">\" 'Employing unit\u2019 means any * * * corporation, whether domestic or foreign, * * * which has or subsequent to this amendatory act, had in its employ 1 or more individuals performing services for it <em>within this state. </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Section 41 of the act defin\u00e9d \"employer\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">\" 'Employer\u2019 means (1) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">\"(b) Any employing unit which in each of 20 different weeks within the calendar year 1956 or within any succeeding calendar year * * * has or had in employment 4 or more individuals * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">We held that the reinstatement provision of \u00a7 29(1)(a)(1) of the act, read in conjunction with \u00a7 40 and \u00a7 41, mandated the conclusion that the reinstatement provision applied only when a claimant voluntarily left a Michigan employer to accept work with another Michigan employer and was subsequently laid off from the last Michigan employer. But this conclusion was necessitated by the particular statutory language of the proviso found in \u00a729(1)(a)(1). Section 29(1)(a)(1) required that both the separating employer and the new employer be <em>Michigan </em>employers because the MESC could not add credit weeks earned in Michigan (under the Michigan employer) to credit weeks earned in Florida (under the Florida employer). In <em>Merren, </em>the MESC had no legislative jurisdiction over the Florida employer; therefore, the MESC could not pay benefits to a claimant chargeable to the Florida employer. Clearly, <em>under \u00a7 29(1)(a)(1), </em>\"[T]o grant Merren\u2019s claim [would be] to penalize Lear Siegler [the Michigan employer], who would then pay Merren from its own account without any contribution from another 'employer.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">But in the instant case, no such restrictive provisions exist in \u00a7 29(3). The \"requalification\u201d requirement under \u00a7 29(3) has no adverse effect upon non-Michigan employers. Because <em>Merren </em>deals with altogether different substantive issues, its holding does not affect the question of whether a claimant can requalify outside the State of Michigan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\"> This would be true not only with respect to an eligible claimant who has been disqualified, and then requalified, under the act, but also to an eligible claimant who has never been disqualified under the act <em>(i.e. </em>one who is laid off). The act itself makes no distinction as to the eligibility or disqualification of those unemployed persons who are disqualified and then requalify and those unemployed persons who are never disqualified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> The Legislature, in the preamble to the act, declared, in part, that our unemployment compensation law was \"An act * * * to enter into reciprocal agreements and to cooperate with agencies * * * of other states charged with the administration of any unemployment insurance law\u201d. In addition to the preamble, the provisions of \u00a7 11 of the act, MCLA 421.11; MCLA 17.511, enable the MESC to enter into reciprocal agreements with other states to pay interstate claims. <em>See, </em>in particular, \u00a7 11(c), \u00a7 11(d), \u00a7 11(f), \u00a7 11(g). Accordingly, the commission has entered into two basic types of agreements: (1) the Interstate Benefit Payment Plan (formally accepted by the then Michigan Unemployment Compensation Commission at the Interstate Conference of Unemployment Compensation Agencies, November 28, 1937); (2) the Interstate Agreement for Combining Wages (both the Basic Interstate Plan for Combining Wages and the Extended Interstate Plan for Combining Wages); <em>see </em>MESC Manual, Appendices 1 and 2 to Chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>8600-8699, Part V, Unemployment Compensation Interstate Wage Combining Plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The Interstate Benefit Payment Plan is accurately described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\"><em>\"This plan makes it possible for individuals to collect unemployment insurance bene\u00f1ts from a state in which they have qualifying wages, although they are not present in that state. </em>The procedures developed under the plan provide that each state may act as an agent in taking claims for all other states. Thus, each state will pay benefits computed on the basis of wages earned under its law and determined under its benefit formula on claims taken in the local offices of any other state acting as an agent for the liable state. The plan is based on the principle that benefit payments to a multi-state worker are to be subject to the same requirements that would apply if he were actually in the state from which he claims benefits. In taking a claim from an unemployed worker, the 'agent\u2019 state does not and has no authority under the plan to make decisions regarding the worker\u2019s rights under the law of the 'liable\u2019 state. The 'agent\u2019 state merely obtains the necessary information from the worker and forwards it to the 'liable\u2019 state in order that the l\u00e1tter may make its own determination as to eligibility, and amount and duration of benefits in accordance with its own law. Before claiming benefits from any other state, the worker is required to exhaust whatever benefit credits he may have in the state in which he becomes unemployed. He may then file claim for benefits against any other state or states in which he may have acquired credits. In the event a multi-state worker has benefit rights under the laws of two or more 'liable\u2019 states, benefits are paid by those states in the same chronological order as the worker earned his benefit credits in the respective states.\u201d (Emphasis added.) IB Commerce Clearing House, Unemployment Insurance Reports, \u00b6 2050, p 4586 (1976). These agreements exist between all states. See IB Commerce Clearing House, Unemployment Insurance Reports, \u00b6 2050, pp 4585, 4586 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The Court of Appeals, in its conclusory remarks, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">\"We are not unaware of the provisions of \u00a7 11 of the act with respect to cooperative agreements which the commission may enter into with similar agencies in other states. Clearly, our holding herein will in no way affect any reciprocal agreement to pay a pro rata share of benefits based upon the respective credit weeks earned in the various states where the claim is made under the law of the other state.\u201d 57 Mich App 21, 29-30.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">This conclusion may be technically accurate as to the Basic Interstate Agreement for Combining Wages in which the MESC has agreed to pay a pro rata share of benefits for the claimant who has worked in two or more states (including Michigan) but who <em>is not eligible for bene\u00f1ts in any state </em>because of lack of qualifying wages. <em>See </em>MESC Manual, Appendix 1 to Chapter 8600-8699, Part V. The kind of claimant protected by these agreements, is not affected by the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Appeals holding because such a claimant, never having been eligible, does not face the prospect of being disqualified after he moves and refuses the reemployment offer. However, the Court of Appeals fails to mention the Interstate Benefit Payment Plan which is designed to benefit the unemployed person who <em>has </em>earned qualifying base credit wages in Michigan and thereafter exercises his right to freedom of movement in the labor market by moving from the locality where he earned base credit weeks to another state where he registers for work, seeks work, and is \"able and available for work,\u201d or the Extended Interstate Plan for Continuing Wages, which is designed to benefit the unemployed person who moves to another state, finds employment, and then becomes unemployed again. <em>See, </em>MESC Manual, Appendix 2 to Chapter 8600-8699, Part V. The obvious purpose of <em>these </em>agreements is to provide benefits for the eligible claimant who has earned qualifying base credit weeks in Michigan, moved to another state, and become eligible for benefits in the other state. The Court of Appeals holding, which discourages an otherwise eligible claimant from exercising his right to freedom of movement within the labor market, clearly undermines <em>these </em>agreements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b612-8\"> As we noted in fn 5, this Federal legislation became effective January 1, 1972. <em>See </em>Annotations, 26 USCA 3304(a)(9)(A) (Pocket Part 1976), p 171.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b615-10\">Fitzgerald, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKF\"><em>(concurring). </em>The result achieved by reversing the Court of Appeals in this case is contrary to one of the most basic policies underlying the Michigan Employment Security Act, which is to encourage employers to provide stable em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>ployment.

MESC reaffirmed its determination on April 5 and the company appealed to a referee who affirmed MESC on September 29, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">\"The issues involved in this appeal concern whether the claimant failed without good cause to report to his former employer within a reasonable time after notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>from such employer for an interview concerning available suitable work, coming under the provisions of \u00a7 29(l)(d) of the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">\"A further issue concerns whether the claimant was available for work and eligible for benefits in this respect under \u00a7 28(l)(c) of the act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The referee said the offered work \"was not suitable due to the distance from [Bingham\u2019s] residence as provided under \u00a7 29(6) of the act and, accordingly, no disqualification is imposed under \u00a7 29(1)(d) of the act\u201d. The referee also concluded that \"[u]nder the circumstances, and inasmuch as the claimant has not placed any undue restrictions on his availability, the claimant is deemed to have been available for work under \u00a7 28(1)(c)\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The company filed an appeal and the appeal board affirmed on March 24, 1971 by a 2-to-1 vote. The two members said simply that the referee\u2019s decision \"is in conformity with the law and facts\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The company appealed this decision to the Oakland circuit court which reversed. The judge ruled that claimant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">\"is disqualified from receiving benefits under the act by failing to requalify and by failing to accept suitable employment when offered. I agree with the conclusions of the employer that the stated purpose of the act neither in fact or law would neither be carried out. Neither would be carried out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">MESC was granted leave to appeal this decision. In an opinion issued November 29, 1974, the Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court but limited its review to the question of whether Bingham was disqualified under \u00a7 29(1)(d). The Court\u2019s analysis led to a conclusion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">\"the offer of the same job at the same location that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>claimant voluntarily left without good cause attributable to the employer or employing unit is suitable work within the meaning of \u00a7 29(6). Since plaintiff does not claim that the old job was unsuitable for any reason than the distance from the locality in which he presently resides, the work offered was suitable work as a matter of law. Plaintiff did not have 'good cause\u2019 to refuse to report to his former employer and thus he is disqualified under \u00a7 29(1)(d) by reason of his failure to report to his former employer upon receiving notice of the availability of his old job.\u201d 57 Mich App 21, 29; 225 NW2d 199 (1974)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">A difference in analysis is required between \u00a729(1)(d) matters (\"failed without good cause to report * * * for an interview\u201d) and \u00a7 29(1)(e) (\"failed without good cause to accept suitable work when offered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The employer\u2019s March 9 letter appears to be an offer of work but the panels and persons below have labeled it an offer to interview, although sometimes treating it under \u00a7 29(l)(e) standards. The result is at best confusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Therefore, we would remand to the appeal board for a clear determination of whether this is a \u00a7 29(1)(d) or \u00a7 29(1)(e) matter. If the former, there should be consideration of whether Bingham had good cause for failing to respond to the March 9 letter. If he claims that the interview would have concerned unsuitable work, the company should be afforded the opportunity to meet its burden of proof. If the latter, there should be consideration of whether the work offered was suitable. A conclusion should be reached by taking into account each factor of \u00a7 29(6) individually. This should entail a very careful and specific finding of fact prior to a conclusion of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Remand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\"> MCLA 421.29(1)(d); MSA 17.531(1)(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-12\"> MCLA 421.29(1)(e); MSA 17.531(1)(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
