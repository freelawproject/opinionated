The slayings took place in the factory parking lot as the employees reported for the day shift. Both victims died of gunshot wounds to the head. Later that same day defendant was apprehended by the police and charged with the murder of his wife. In May of 1970, defendant was bench-tried before Lenawee County Circuit Judge Rex B. Martin. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. MCLA 750.316; MSA 28.548. In his appeal of right, the Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction. 33 Mich App 598; 190 NW2d 347 (1971). Leave to appeal that decision to this Court was denied. 386 Mich 766 (1971). Defendant then filed a motion for a new trial with the trial court. Defendant appealed the denial of that motion to the Court of Appeals which again upheld the conviction. 51 Mich App 109; 214 NW2d 544 (1974). This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 392 Mich 803 (1974). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Initially, we consider defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly refused to direct a verdict of acquittal at the close of the prosecution\u2019s proofs. An appellate court tests the correctness of the denial of such motion by taking the evidence <em>presented by the prosecution </em>in the light most favorable to the prosecution and deciding if there was any evidence upon which the trier of fact could predicate a finding of guilty of murder in the first degree. <em>People v Vail, </em>393 Mich 460; 227 NW2d 535 (1975). <em>People v Abernathy, </em>253 Mich 583; 235 NW 261 (1931). To the extent that the case of <em>People v Qualls, </em>9 Mich App 689; 158 NW2d 60 (1968), holds to the contrary, it is expressly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">When moving for acquittal, defense counsel argued that there was no evidence linking defendant to the perpetration of the crime. We disagree. A number of persons who witnessed the slayings testified but were unable to positively identify defendant as the assailant. However, it was established that defendant had made several recent threats to kill his wife and anyone found with her; the assailant escaped in the defendant\u2019s car; and a police officer testified that when apprehended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>defendant admitted being in sole possession of his car during the time of the slayings. Defendant was known to have been in possession of a .22-caliber revolver and some ammunition. A police expert testified that the bullet recovered from the wife\u2019s body is of the type which could have been fired from such a pistol. The murder weapon was never recovered so a match between the bullet and the pistol could not be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Witnesses testified that the slayings took place between 6:30 and 6:45 a.m. One witness observed that the assailant was wearing a dark topcoat. After the shooting, the assailant entered defendant\u2019s car and calmly drove from the parking lot (in Clinton) towards Tecumseh, approximately four miles south. Defendant was observed driving his car in Adrian, 15 miles south of Clinton, sometime between 7:00 and 7:30 a.m. Defendant, wearing a dark trench coat, arrived at James McClarren\u2019s house, about ten miles from the prior sighting, sometime between 7 and 8 a.m. We believe this chain of circumstantial evidence was sufficient to allow the trial judge to deny the motion. In our opinion these proofs contained some relevant evidence on each of the elements of the crime charged and that defendant was the perpetrator of that crime. The trial judge properly denied the motion for a directed verdict of acquittal at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The next of defendant\u2019s four raised issues concerns the defense of voluntary intoxication. Defendant argues that the crime of first-degree murder requires the specific intent to kill. Defendant then argues that the law of this state is such that voluntary intoxication can be a defense to crimes which require a specific intent. Defendant concludes by arguing that the trial judge erroneously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>concluded that defendant was not so intoxicated that he did not form the specific intent to kill. In related subarguments, the defendant alleges that the trial court failed to find all of the necessary elements of first-degree murder; that the defendant was acting under diminished mental responsibility sufficient to negate the elements of specific intent and premeditation and deliberation; and that the evidence was insufficient for a finding of guilt of any crime greater than the crime of voluntary manslaughter. MCLA 750.321; MSA 28.553. We find these related issues to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Murder is homicide committed with malice aforethought. At the common law, the crime of murder was not divided into degrees. The present statutory scheme providing for the separation of murder into degrees was \"for the purpose of graduating the punishment\u201d. <em>People v Doe, </em>1 Mich 451, 457 (1850). This classification of murder by degree was first enacted by the State of Pennsylvania in 1794. In 1838, motivated by a concern that the more culpable forms of murder should be punished more severely, this state adopted a similar statutory scheme. <em>People v Potter, </em>5 Mich 1, 6 (1858); <em>People v Morrin, </em>31 Mich App 301, 325; 187 NW2d 434 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Courts in Pennsylvania have consistently held that their first-degree murder statute requires a specific intent to kill. <em>Commonwealth v Murray, 2 </em>Ashm (Pa) 41 (Phila O &amp; T, 1834); <em>Commonwealth v Fostar, </em>455 Pa 216; 317 A2d 188 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Michigan courts have not been so consistent. In <em>People v Scott, </em>6 Mich 287, 294 (1859), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">\"Except in cases expressly named in the statute, <em>murder in the \u00f1rst degree requires the existence of a deliberate intention to take life; </em>and any slaying in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>which a jury should find either the absence of deliberation, or that the intent was to commit another and a lesser injury, must be either murder in the second degree or one of the lighter grades of homicide.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">However, confusion began when this Court, on policy grounds, rejected the defense of voluntary intoxication in a prosecution of first-degree murder. <em>People v Garbutt, </em>17 Mich 9 (1868). Broad statements from cases involving second-degree murder convictions added to the confusion. <em>Wellar v People, </em>30 Mich 16 (1874).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Another problem with some of the cases is that the crime charged was not a homicide. An example is <em>Roberts v People, </em>19 Mich 401 (1870), which involved an assault with intent to commit murder. In hopes of ending the confusion and on the authority in <em>Potter </em>and <em>Scott, </em>we hold that nonfelony first-degree murder is a specific intent crime requiring an intention to take life.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Our holding is supported by the language of the first-degree murder statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">\"All murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, or lying in wait, or any other kind of wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing * * * shall be murder of the first degree\u201d. MCLA 750.316; MSA 28.548.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">A reading of the statute mandates the construction that \"wilful * * * killing\u201d means the intent to accomplish the result of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Voluntary intoxication can be a defense to crimes which require a specific intent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-12\">\"While it is true that drunkenness cannot excuse crime, it is equally true that when a certain intent is a necessary element in a crime, the crime cannot have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>been committed when the intent did not exist.\u201d <em>People v Walker, </em>38 Mich 156, 158 (1878).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In the case at bar, however, the trial judge rejected the defense of voluntary intoxication. We believe he did so properly. In his finding of facts, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">\"I think he formed an intent to do away with her [his wife] if he caught her with someone else. I think he went to Clinton early Monday morning with his pistol to kill her if the occasion arose and he thought he should.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">These findings of fact support the conclusion that the murder was premeditated and deliberated upon. The record also supports the trial judge\u2019s conclusion the defendant acted with wilfulness. The trial judge found the killing to be intentional rather than accidental:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">\"The physical facts themselves, the place where the bullet went in each person, the fact there were no powder burns, the path of the bullet, the type of gun, the fact that it had to be cocked every time it was fired would completely belie this story, so there wasn\u2019t any accidental killing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Defendant argues that certain remarks of the trial judge indicate that defendant was found to have been operating under a diminished mental capacity due to consumption of alcohol and lack of sleep. Specifically defendant points to these statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">\"I am convinced his ability to form a proper judgment was impaired by his voluntary consumption of intoxicants. * * <em>* </em>I am convinced he wouldn\u2019t have killed them, either one of them, if he had been sober.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>However, the entire passage from which those comments were excised evidences an entirely different conclusion. Our review of the transcript leads us to believe that the trial judge was properly convinced that, in spite of his drinking spree, the defendant had the ability to and did actually premeditate and deliberate over his wife\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">\"Now, the people must convince the court beyond a reasonable doubt of premeditation and malice to have first-degree murder. Dr. DuKay stated very emphatically among some of his other testimony that when you take the total picture of the alcoholism, the lack of sleep, the lack of food, etc., the defendant didn\u2019t have the ability to specifically form an intent to murder, and he was pretty definite about this. He also said another thing, and frankly, I looked at my notes, and I wasn\u2019t too sure that probably I got it down right, so I asked the reporter to type out this particular question and answer just to make sure I had heard Dr. DuKay correctly, and on cross-examination, Mr. Koselka asked him, 'Again, I want to be sure I understand this, doctor. You are saying then, doctor, that he did in your opinion have the intent to murder, but his ability to form this intent was impaired by the use of alcohol?\u2019 And the answer was, 'I think that that\u2019s what it really can be summarized.\u2019 So Dr. DuKay, in effect, has said he could have this intent and did have it and yet on another occasion he said he didn\u2019t think he had the intent. Now, I think Dr. DuKay also said again it wasn\u2019t his responsibility to make that determination, and, of course, he was correct in this. I am convinced that the defendant had the ability to form a proper judgment \u2014 pardon me. I am convinced his ability to form a proper judgment was impaired by his voluntary consumption of intoxicants. I believe his inhibitions were released by intoxicants. His basic subconscious hatred of his wife, because of her failure to be the mother, the housekeeper, and the wife he had wanted her to be, came to the forefront. Now, he knew that this dislike of his wife came to the forefront when he drank. He\u2019d been told this. He testified himself that he knew about this. I think he formed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>an intent to do away with her if he caught her with somebody else. I think he went to Clinton early Monday morning with his pistol to kill her if the occasion arose and he thought he should. I don\u2019t think he went there to give her the pistol at all. This doesn\u2019t make sense. He found her with Mr. Blevins [Rinehart]. It was an innocent meeting between the two of them. I think she went to Mr. Blevins to see if he had brought her work clothes so she could go into work. He killed them both. I am convinced he wouldn\u2019t have killed them, either one of them, if he\u2019d been sober. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question in my mind about that. I am convinced he was not so drunk as to have lost the ability to have malice, that malice arose in his heart and his mind. In fact, I think the drinking released the controls on the suppressed malice. That the court is convinced that he was not so drunk as to be unable to plan ahead to do what he did. I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that all the elements of first-degree murder have been proved. The court would find him guilty of that offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The nature of defendant\u2019s impairment was described as (1) his inhibitions were released, (2) his subconscious hatred of his wife came to the forefront, and (3) drinking released his controls on suppressed malice. Judged in light of his other comments about defendant\u2019s ability to form a proper judgment and entertain malice, we believe the trial judge must have concluded these \"impairments\u201d were of a minimal nature. Such a conclusion is supported by the trial judge\u2019s finding that defendant had exaggerated his testimony concerning consumption of intoxicants and lack of sleep. We find nothing in this record to indicate that defendant\u2019s consumption of intoxicants so clouded his ability to reason that he was unable to premeditate or deliberate over his actions at the time of the slayings.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">In a bench trial, it is the role of the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>sitting as the trier of fact to observe the witnesses and decide the weight and credibility to be given to their testimony. Where sufficient evidence exists to sustain a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the decision of the judge should not be disturbed by an appellate court. The task of the reviewing court must be to examine the record to determine whether the evidence was ample to warrant a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime charged. Our review of this record leads us to conclude that there was sufficient evidence on each and every element of the crime of first-degree murder to sustain the decision of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Next the defendant alleges that reversible error was committed when the trial judge, sitting as a trier of fact, read the entire transcript of the preliminary examination. To support his contention defendant cites the case of <em>People v Ramsey, </em>385 Mich 221; 187 NW2d 887 (1971). In <em>Ramsey, </em>this Court considered MCLA 768.26; MSA 28.1049, and held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\"[A]s an absolute rule it is reversible error for the trial court sitting without a jury to refer to the transcript of testimony taken at the preliminary examination except under the exceptions provided by [the above] statute.\u201d <em>Ramsey, supra </em>at 225.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The policy behind <em>Ramsey </em>was to \"assure that an accused has a right to confront all of the witnesses against him in open court, and to have all of the evidence against him placed in the record at the trial\u201d. <em>Ramsey, supra </em>at 224-225. However, we find defendant\u2019s reliance upon <em>Ramsey </em>misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The rule fashioned by this Court in <em>Ramsey </em>was not announced until one year after the trial of this case had concluded. Prior to <em>Ramsey, </em>review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>preliminary examination transcript was a generally accepted practice for the trial judge sitting as a trier of fact. We cannot fault the trial judge\u2019s reliance on this long standing practice especially in light of defense counsel\u2019s consent to it. Upon consideration of the standards enunciated in <em>Link-letter v Walker, </em>381 US 618; 85 S Ct 1731; 14 L Ed 2d 601 (1965), and <em>People v Hampton, </em>384 Mich 669; 187 NW2d 404 (1971), we hold the rule announced in <em>Ramsey </em>is not to be accorded retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Finally defendant contends that he was denied a fair trial by the defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the trial court\u2019s reading of the entire preliminary examination transcript. Defendant argues that this constituted the serious mistake and but for this mistake there was a great likelihood that he would not have been convicted. This is the two-prong test set forth in <em>People v Degraffenreid, </em>19 Mich App 702; 173 NW2d 317 (1969). Defendant also contends that he is entitled to a new trial under the doctrine established in <em>Beasley v United States, </em>491 F2d 687, 696 (CA 6, 1974). <em>Beasley </em>held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">\"Defense counsel must perform at least as well as a lawyer with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law and must conscientiously protect his client\u2019s interests, undeflected by conflicting considerations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">We do not believe the alleged error amounts to reversible error under either <em>Beasley </em>or <em>Degraffenreid. </em>In his findings of fact, the trial judge remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">\"I think we had a well tried lawsuit here. The witnesses were brought in and examined and cross-examined well, and it was well argued. * * * I wondered at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>first why defense counsel and his client had waived a jury in this case, and as I got to thinking about it, I could probably understand best after we heard Dr. DuKay\u2019s testimony, because this particular type of defense has been offered many times in this court, and frankly, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve ever had an occasion where a jury has accepted it as a defense. I don\u2019t think that we have ever had the case as a defense as well presented as we had it by Dr. DuKay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The trial judge read the preliminary transcript to help him to evaluate the testimony of Dr. DuKay. Considering the importance of Dr. DuKay\u2019s testimony in this trial, it is likely that defense counsel perceived the trial judge\u2019s reading of the preliminary examination transcript would be beneficial to the defense. Apparently the trial judge thought otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">\"Now, I went through the preliminary examination yesterday, and frankly, I don\u2019t think the preliminary examination set forth the defendant\u2019s case as strongly as the trial itself did. I think the testimony brought out at trial was much stronger * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\"><em>People v Degraffenreid, supra, </em>adopts a strict standard for the review of claims of effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">\"The constitutional right to counsel does not guarantee an accused person that his lawyer will not make a big mistake. The Constitution guarantees only that the accused person will enjoy representation by an attorney adequately equipped by his training in the law to undertake the case and who will diligently, conscientiously and honestly represent the accused person.\u201d <em>Degraffenreid, supra </em>at 712 (footnotes deleted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-10\"><em>Degraffenreid </em>goes on to state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>\"A claim that an adequate lawyer made a serious mistake does not raise the constitutional issue of right to counsel; it does not involve the concept of 'effective assistance of counsel\u2019, it should not be measured against the sham trial standard which circumscribes the constitutional right.\u201d <em>Degraffenreid, supra </em>at 717.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">However, even where assistance of counsel satisfies the constitutional requirements, defendant is still entitled to a fair trial. Defendant can be denied this right if his attorney makes a serious mistake. But a court should not grant a new trial unless it finds that but for this mistake defendant would have had a reasonably likely chance of acquittal. <em>Degraffenreid, supra </em>at 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">In <em>Beasley, supra </em>at 696, the Sixth Circuit rejects the farce or mockery standard as a meaningful test of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">We agree with the Sixth Circuit that the time has come for this Court to reject the \"sham test\u201d. However, in adopting <em>Beasley </em>and applying it to this case, we fail to find reversible error has been committed. We believe the decision of defense counsel not to object to the trial judge\u2019s reading of the preliminary examination transcript to be a conscious choice of trial strategy. Under <em>Beasley, </em>if such \"action that appears erroneous from hindsight was taken for reasons that would appear sound to a competent criminal attorney, the assistance of counsel has not been constitutionally defective\u201d. The alleged mistake is of this caliber. We conclude that defendant was deprived of neither a fair trial or effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b310-10\">Williams and Coleman, JJ., concurred with Lindemer, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Fitzgerald and Ryan, JJ., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b311-6\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad\"><em>(dissenting). </em>Henry Garcia shot and killed his wife, Eileen Garcia, and a man with her, Blevins Rinehart.

The judge did not find that Garcia had the \"ability to form a proper judgment\u201d. His finding of malice supports only a conviction of second-degree murder and does not reach the added elements of deliberation and premeditation necessary to escalate the offense to first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The Court seemingly applies to the judge\u2019s findings a reviewing standard akin to that applicable to a jury\u2019s verdict. On appeal from a conviction on a jury\u2019s verdict we consider whether there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict.

Some cases therefore have held that voluntary intoxication cannot be a defense to rape even though it blots out the intent to have intercourse, since that intent is a general intent and not a specific intent. But this is wrong on principle, for if intoxication does in fact negative an intention which is a required element of the crime (whether it be called specific intent or general intent), the crime has not been committed. Some cases have held that intoxication cannot be a defense to battery, a crime sometimes said to require only a general intent. This, however, is correct on principle, since battery can be committed not only with an intent to do the physical act of striking the other person (which intoxication can negative) but also, without any such intent to strike, by recklessly striking; and recklessness cannot, by the weight of authority, be negatived by intoxication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">\"A few jurisdictions, going even further astray, have held that voluntary intoxication is no defense even when it negatives the 'specific intent\u2019 or knowledge which a crime may require.

(The common-law felony-murder rule is an example of implied intent or implied malice aforethought.)\u201d <em>People v Morrin, supra, </em>pp 310-311.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">\"The fact that malice aforethought means merely that malice must exist at the same time as the act, in effect makes 'aforethought\u2019 meaningless surplusage.\u201d 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure, \u00a7 243, p 527.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">\"[T]he word 'aforethought\u2019 is a word without any practical significance in common law murder.\u201d Moreland, Law of Homicide, p 70.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">\"As a matter of law a killing may be with malice aforethought although it is conceived and executed 'on the spur of the moment.\u2019 \u201d Perkins on Criminal Law (2d ed), ch 2, \u00a7 1, p 35.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-11\"><em>See also </em>LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law, p 529; <em>People v Morrin, supra, </em>p 312, n 11 and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">The majority view is that intoxication is not a defense to second-degree murder \u2014 intoxication does not negative malice aforethought:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-13\">\"It is generally, held, however, that intoxication cannot further reduce the homicide from second degree murder down to manslaughter. Perhaps this is because the intent to kill or do serious bodily injury which (without any accompanying premeditation and deliberation) will do for second degree murder may be found in the defendant\u2019s use of a deadly weapon upon his victim. Doubtless a better explanation is that one may be guilty of second degree murder, in most jurisdictions which divide murder into two degrees, by killing without any intent to kill or injure but with a high degree of recklessness (the 'depraved heart\u2019 type of murder), and, as we shall see below, although intoxication can negative a required intention, it cannot (by the majority view) negative recklessness. Nevertheless, there is some authority for the proposition that intoxication which blots out not only the premeditation and deliberation but also the intent to kill or do serious injury will reduce a homicide down to manslaughter.\u201d LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 45, p 345.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">Similarly, <em>see People v Kelley, </em>21 Mich App 612, 620; 176 NW2d 435 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\"> \"One who, having already formed the intention to commit a crime, drinks in order to work up his nerve to commit the crime, cannot avail himself of the defense of intoxication even though, by the time he does commit the crime, he has become too intoxicated to entertain the intent which the crime requires.\u201d LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 45, pp 344-345.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\"> \"Malice is usually implied when homicide results if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">\"(a) There is intent to inflict great bodily harm</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">\"(b) An act is wilfully performed or omitted and the natural tendency of such behavior is to cause death or great bodily harm.\u201d Clark &amp; Marshall, Law of Crimes (7th ed, 1967), \u00a7 10.04, p 631.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">\u201c[A]n act may involve such a wanton and wilful disregard of an unreasonable human risk as to constitute malice aforethought even if there is no actual intent to kill or injure.\u201d Perkins, Criminal Law (2d ed, 1969), ch 2, \u00a7 1(B), p 36.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">\"Extremely negligent conduct, which creates what a reasonable man would realize to be not only an unjustifiable but also a very high degree of risk of death or serious bodily injury to another or to others \u2014though unaccompanied by any intent to kill or do serious bodily injury \u2014 and which actually causes the death of another, may constitute murder.
