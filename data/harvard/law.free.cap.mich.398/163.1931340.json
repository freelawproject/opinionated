The ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>tions relate to the feeding technique, \"hyperalimentation\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The hospital objected to interrogatories 5 through 14. The trial judge, on October 26, 1973, upheld the objections to all excepting number 5, which he ordered to be answered. He disclosed no factual or legal basis for the order. Plaintiff appealed the order and on March 18, 1974 the Court of Appeals ordered defendant hospital to answer interrogatories 8 through 14, finding that \"[t]he information sought to be gained by the interrogatories allowed is not protected from disclosure by \u00a7 12(2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the act regulating licenses of hospitals, 1968 PA 17, MCLA 331.411, <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 14.1179(1) <em>et seq.\u201d.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">Plaintiff next appealed the Court of Appeals order as it related to questions 6 and 7, the only interrogatories which the hospital is not now required to answer. These read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\"6. Upon how many patients was it [hyperalimentation] used before it was used on Duane C.

Of the patients upon whom it was used before Duane Marchand, how many died?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">On May 7, 1975, we remanded <em>Marchand </em>pursuant to the following order at 394 Mich 906 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\"On order of the Court, leave to appeal having been granted, briefs presented and arguments heard, this cause is remanded to the Circuit Court for the County of Wayne for further hearing(s) to permit the parties an opportunity to disclose more fully on the record why the information sought by interrogatories 6 and 7 does or does not deserve the protection provided by MCLA 331.422; MSA 14.1179(12).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">\"The Court anticipates that subsequent to the hearing(s) the record will disclose whether data had been collected relative to the challenged treatment and, if collected, whether it was for the purpose of review as protected by the Hospital Licensing Act. Further, if no data were collected, the record is expected to disclose the extent of the burden which would be imposed upon the hospital if required to gather such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">\n<em>\"The Court also anticipates that the record will reflect what, if any, relevancy the requested data may have to the death of Duane C. Marchand.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">\n<em>\"This remand also will afford the circuit judge an opportunity to detail more fully the basis of his order regarding interrogatories 6 and 7.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-11\">\"It is further ordered that this Court retain jurisdiction and that final disposition be held in abeyance pending the completion of the hearing(s) on remand and the filing of the supplemental record and findings of the trial judge with this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-12\">\"The parties will be informed if the Court requires further briefing.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">Pursuant to our order, hearings were held on November 13, 1975 and December 19, 1975. Fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>lowing the hearings, the trial judge issued the following order on January 13, 1976:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-3\">\"It is hereby ordered that the investigation and research entered into by Dr. Thomas A.

Fox and the plaintiffs attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Can you tell us a little bit about under what circumstances it was requested that you, on the patients that you worked on, should keep records in regard to hyperalimentation feeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\"><em>'A. </em>There was no request for me to keep records. I did this on my own initiative to see how this procedure worked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>In other words, just for your own, shall we say, education and for your own enlightenment you decided to keep records on the patients that were subjected to your care as to whether or not this procedure was effective or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>\u201dA. </em>That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>This would be your own records and not the hospital records that you decided to keep?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">'A. Well, any record that I keep is the hospital\u2019s record, at least to my way of thinking of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\"><em>\"Q. </em>But you were never requested by anybody on the staff of Ford Hospital that you should keep a specific record in regard to hyperalimentation and its effectiveness in regard to the treatment of patients?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\"><em>'A. </em>No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">The testimony indicates that the information sought by interrogatories 6 and 7 was not collected pursuant to a directive from a \"[committee] assigned this review function\u201d. While the November 13, 1975 transcript indicates that the information assembled by Dr. Fox was subsequently presented at a general staff meeting, the <em>ex post facto </em>submission does not satisfy the \"collection\u201d criteria bringing the data within the ambit of the evidentiary privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">At the December 19, 1975 hearing the following exchange occurred between defendants\u2019 counsel and the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-11\"><em>7Defense Counsel]: </em>So the data that was assembled by Dr. Fox and presented to the committee was data that was at the request of a committee that had the power to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-12\"><em>\u2019\u2019The Court: </em>Not true. That isn\u2019t his story. His story was he made these notes and his investigation on his own volition. He put them in the files because that was the logical place to keep them. Nobody asked him to do that. The only thing that ever happened was that the doctor in charged <em>[sic] </em>asked him to prepare a summary of what he had done voluntarily.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">We find that the statements of the trial court are supported by the transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>In our May 7, 1975 order, we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-3\">\"The Court also anticipates that the record will reflect what, if any, relevancy the requested data may have to the death of Duane C. Marchand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">There was little discussion of relevancy at the November 13 hearing. However, Dr. Fox did make the statement that \"[H]ow many lived because of it would be more like the question you should ask\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">At the December hearing, counsel for the plaintiff and the trial judge discussed the issue of relevancy in relation to the disputed questions 6 and 7. Plaintiffs counsel summarized his arguments stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">\"I think it is some of each, your Honor. There\u2019s more than one theory in this case. Number one, if he had knowledge that this isn\u2019t the type of individual that should be given hyperalimentation, it is very pertinent to this case. Number two, if he didn\u2019t give the procedure correctly as compared to the people that he\u2019d given it to before and if he changed since, it is very important to the outcome.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">While the trial judge made no specific finding as to relevancy, his finding of relevancy is implied in his decision to order the questions to be answered. While we may wish that the trial court had guided us with more elucidation on the question of relevancy, we will not disturb his implied finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Determining matters of the relevancy of interrogatories is within the trial judge\u2019s discretion and we will not interfere absent an abuse of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We make no comment upon the relevancy of the disputed question at the trial of the instant case. Michigan allows liberal discovery and the criteria utilized as to the relevancy of material differs at the trial and pretrial levels.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b214-6\">Kavanagh, C.
