Did the trial court err in refusing to consider the police officer\u2019s testimony regarding the contents of the police report on the issue of negligence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">2. Did the trial judge err in ruling that the facts did not support a finding of negligence on behalf of the bus driver?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">We find that the judge did not err in either instance and therefore affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">I \u2014 Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">The appeal revolves around the testimony of three persons \u2014 plaintiff, the bus driver arid a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">Plaintiff testified that on January 7, 1968 she was a passenger on a bus operated by defendant. She stated that the weather conditions included \"sleeting and snowing and raining\u201d. When her attorney asked about the incident, she replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>\"A. </em>Well, this bus driver \u2014 all I know, when I knowed anything, I was on the aisle in the bus, but what happened I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>You don\u2019t know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\"><em>\u2019A. </em>No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Now, do you know what speed the bus was driving at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\"><em>'A. </em>No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Do you know whether he was driving slow, medium or fast?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\"><em>'A. </em>He was driving kinda fast, but I don\u2019t know how many miles he was going though.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">After further questioning, counsel elicited testimony that the bus was \"going wigwag\u201d, that she fell from her seat and that the bus drove up and stopped on the shoulder of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">On cross-examination plaintiff could not recall the name of the street where the accident occurred, distance of the accident from the corner, or the lane in which it happened. It was revealed that the bus had stopped several times prior to the accident without incident. Plaintiff also indicated, contradicting earlier testimony, that the bus was traveling south on Beaubien.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">Plaintiffs attorney next introduced testimony from the police officer investigating the accident. The officer had a photostatic copy of the accident report and defendant objected to the testimony because the officer did not have the original. Plaintiffs attorney stated: \"I am not introducing the original. He can refresh his memory from anything he wants.\u201d The trial court responded: \"He can testify from memory as to what happened; whatever papers he has.\u201d The court further noted: \"I don\u2019t know what it is. He can use anything that he did to refresh his memory.\u201d The officer indicated that he did not have any notes independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>of the accident report, but that the report was in his own handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">During the ensuing examination of the police officer, it became apparent that he had no independent recollection of the events surrounding the accident. The. trial court observed that the officer was able to give testimony only by direct reference to the report, and concluded that his present memory of the accident was exhausted. Because the report was neither offered nor admitted into evidence, and no other foundation was laid for its use, the trial court disregarded the officer\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The third portion of disputed testimony came from the bus driver. He testified that there was packed snow on the street, that he was traveling at 10 to 15 miles per hour, had made several stops without incident, and began to slow down preparing to stop for a traffic light one block ahead. There was no back and forth movement of the bus. The bus was in the curb lane and it touched the curb (but did not go over it). He applied the brakes, the bus traveled about five more feet and came to a stop on a dry spot. When the bus stopped, passengers brought to the driver\u2019s attention that a lady had fallen.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The trial court returned a judgment of no cause of action. In so holding, he found the bus driver to be a more credible witness than plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">\"The testimony of Mrs. Moncrief is, at best, sketchy, it isn\u2019t her fault, she cannot remember the events of January 7, 1968. Not only can she not remember where she got on the bus, she cannot remember where it happened. I tried to find out when the bus swerved, how long before the accident it began to swerve. I couldn\u2019t, nor counsel, find out what she meant by 'too fast\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">\"Her testimony is such that she simply says the bus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>was going too fast. She testified it swerved back and forth and in the next breath she would say she didn\u2019t remember anything about it because she couldn\u2019t remember anything after she fell. I questioned her three different times and had to remind her that she testified last Thursday the bus had swerved, today she didn\u2019t know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\"I don\u2019t know if she knows what happened that day and it simply is the law that the plaintiff must prove the case, the defendant doesn\u2019t have to prove anything. The plaintiff has to prove the operator was driving at a speed inconsistent with that of a normal, ordinary, prudent person and I don\u2019t know if he was doing that or not because I don\u2019t think that her testimony is too reliable on other things.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In regard to negligence, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">\"I don\u2019t believe there is any liability on the part of the defendant because I can\u2019t find negligence. I can\u2019t find that merely because an accident happened gives cause of negligence. The simple fact that a bus hit the curb does not make it negligence, that can happen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Further, considering the driver\u2019s actions leading up to the stop, the court stated, \"I don\u2019t know what more a man can do\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Plaintiff subsequently made a motion for new trial, which was granted by the trial court. The court later vacated the order for new trial, holding that there was no negligence and that the police officer\u2019s testimony and report were properly excluded. The Court of Appeals affirmed and this Court granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">II \u2014 Police Report</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">There has been much confusion in this state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>regarding the use of police accident reports as evidence in trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">To maintain perspective, it is necessary to review some \"first principles\u201d. Because police reports are generally offered to prove the truth of their contents, their use as evidence at trial constitutes hearsay. Therefore, before they may be admitted into evidence, read into the record, or read to the fact finder by a witness in the course of his testimony, the proponent of the evidence must lay a foundation which establishes an exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The police report is a writing. It could be admitted into evidence as an exhibit if the proponent can show that it meets the requirements of the business records exception. However, because of the \"nature\u201d of police business and the circumstances under which such reports are usually made, the possibility of police reports so qualifying is unlikely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the report could be received into evidence if the proponent is able to demonstrate that the report constitutes its author\u2019s past recollection recorded. We reviewed the requirements of this hearsay exception in <em>Jaxon v Detroit, </em>379 Mich 405, 413; 151 NW2d 813 (1967), a case dealing with the use of police accident reports at trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">\"To qualify a writing otherwise objectionable as hearsay to be admitted in evidence as a past recollection recorded, a proper foundation must be laid. That foundation should consist in the following: (a) a showing that the witness has no present recollection of the facts, (b) a showing that the witness\u2019 memory is not refreshed upon reference to the document, (c) a showing that the document is an original memorandum made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>witness from personal observation, (d) a showing that the document was prepared by the witness contemporaneously with the event and was an accurate recording of the occurrence and, (e) a showing that the substance of the proffered writing is otherwise admissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In this case, the first element was adequately established in the record but the report was purportedly a photostat of one in the officer\u2019s own handwriting which plaintiff\u2019s counsel said he was not introducing into evidence but using to refresh the officer\u2019s memory. Also there was no attempt by plaintiff\u2019s counsel to show that the document was made by the witness from personal observation or was prepared contemporaneously with the event and based on his personal knowledge rather than, for example, statements of bystanders or witnesses. The report would not have been admissible if plaintiff would have offered it as past recollection recorded because no adequate foundation was laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Finally, the report could have been properly used by the witness to refresh his recollection if the appropriate foundation was established. To permit the use of a writing in order to refresh the memory of a witness, the proponent must show: (1) that the witness\u2019s present memory is inadequate; (2) that the writing could refresh the witness\u2019s present memory; and (3) that reference to the writing actually does refresh the witness\u2019s present memory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, the trial court correctly found that the third element of this foundation was not established. The officer\u2019s reference to his report did not refresh his present memory. Further testimony based on the police report absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>its qualification as an item of evidence as set forth above was properly disregarded by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We mention in passing that MCLA 257.622; MSA 9.2322 and MCLA 257.624; MSA 9.2324 have no application in this case. These statutes deal with reports by local police to the Director of State Police concerning accidents resulting in injury, death or property damage in excess of $200. These particular reports, commonly referred to as \"red-line\u201d reports, are made on forms supplied to the local police agencies by the state police, and include the investigating officer\u2019s opinion regarding the causes of the accident. The information is used for statistical purposes. The statute prohibits use of these reports in evidence. This statutory proscription, however, is confined to the reports mandated by the statute, and has no effect on the rules of evidence regarding the police officer\u2019s personal notes or the routine report, usually entitled \"Motor Vehicle Accident Report\u201d, that the officer takes at the scene of the accident. Exclusion of an otherwise admissible police Motor Vehicle Accident Report, which is not a \"red-line\u201d report, on the basis of this statute, would be error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>In this case, however, neither use of the report by the police officer to refresh his present recollection, nor its receipt by the court as an item of evidence had it been so offered, would have been proper because of the absence of proper foundation for either purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">We hold that the trial court did not err in refusing to consider the police officer\u2019s testimony regarding the contents of the police report on the issue of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Ill \u2014 Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in not holding the bus driver negligent. Plaintiff argues that Michigan has a version of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>(although it is not acknowledged by that name) which would compel a presumption of negligence on the instant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">In <em>Mitcham v Detroit, </em>355 Mich 182; 94 NW2d 388 (1959), the Court recognized a loosely defined version of the <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>doctrine. It held that plaintiff\u2019s testimony raised an inference of defendant\u2019s negligence. In <em>Gadde v Michigan Consolidated Gas Co, </em>377 Mich 117, 123-124; 139 NW2d 722 (1966), the Court recognized the uncertainty of the adoption of <em>res ipsa loquitur: </em>\"Whether Michigan has or has not a doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>in spite of many attempts to clarify the situation, continues to perplex the legal profession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">The doctrine, if applicable, may raise an inference of negligence solely upon plaintiff\u2019s testimony. However, the defendant may \"attempt to explain away or avoid, if he can, the inference of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>negligence\u201d. <em>Mitcham, supra, </em>at 192. The trial court must then weigh the evidence. After finding that plaintiff\u2019s testimony raised an inference of defendant\u2019s negligence, the <em>Mitcham </em>Court examined defendant\u2019s proofs trying to avoid the inference. The question was held to be for the fact finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">It is not necessary to decide whether Michigan law has the doctrine \u00f3f <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>The <em>Gadde </em>Court expertly characterized Michigan\u2019s position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\"Formal adoption of the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>whomsoever\u2019s version might be chosen, would add little to the jurisprudence of this State or to the attainment of justice. This is not to in any way overrule our past decisions or to say that in some cases, even possibly this one, the facts will not permit nice, neat, classification under this or that version of the doctrine. Whether they do is not the consequential issue. The doctrine is merely an uncertain blend of more fundamental concepts of law. Our concern is with the proper application of such concepts from the larger fields of negligence and evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">\"So here, the traditional concepts of the law of negligence and of evidence need not be refined and compartmentalized. If the decisions of this Court are applied, not in terms of dispute over a rule or doctrine but under the general law of negligence and evidence, the problems presented by a given case will be resolved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Even assuming that the doctrine by whatever name is appropriately applied in the instant case to raise an inference of negligence by the bus driver, the trial court (as the trier of fact) correctly weighed the evidence and found defendant not negligent. The trial court considered all of the competent evidence. In finding the bus driver not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>negligent, the court considered the driver to be a more credible witness than plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was generally confused and indefinite. She repeatedly answered, \"I don\u2019t know\u201d when questioned about speed of the bus, name of the street, distance of the accident from the corner and the lane in which the bus was driving. She testified at one time that the bus swerved but later had to be reminded of her testimony. She could not say at what point it allegedly swerved. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony on the weather conditions did not agree with the weather report for that day. On the other hand, testimony from the bus driver, as summarized in part I of this opinion, was specific and clear. The trial court correctly found that the bus driver was not negligent. We cannot find that the trial court was clearly in error. GCR 1963, 859(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Addendum</p>\n<p id=\"A2m\">November 22, 1976</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">In part II, Justice Levin states: \"My colleague, therefore, is mistaken in saying that 'the trial court correctly found\u2019 that reference to the report did not refresh the witness\u2019 present memory\u201d. To the contrary, the police officer inspected his memorandum, and short of reading it, could not independently recollect the facts it contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">In speaking of the police officer, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">\"He has before him notes he made himself. He has testified they are to refresh his recollection of that day. * * * He can use the notes to refresh the actual words he must put down on the record. He is looking at the notes he took in his own handwriting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>After many questions were asked, it became apparent that the officer remembered nothing of substance even with the memo to refresh his memory, leading the court to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">\"It is obvious upon reflection of the testimony of the officer he has no independent recollection of the events of the day.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The judge\u2019s conclusion was not so artfully phrased as might have been but just as unambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">\"He [the police officer] doesn\u2019t have any idea about anything that occurred. He could not answer any questions by defense counsel about where the bus was, how far it skidded, if he knew it skidded, and from whom he found that out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">\"He didn\u2019t know anything about it, himself, in fact, whenever defense counsel was holding the memorandum [police report] he didn\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Although an argument is also made in part II regarding the bases for admitting into evidence a police report as \"past recollection recorded\u201d, the fact is that the report itself was not offered in evidence. Plaintiff\u2019s complaints revolve around exclusion of the officer\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">It is difficult to understand how Justice Levin can conclude that the issue of the use of the police report for purposes of testifying is not before the Court. Plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal argued that the trial court improperly struck from the record the testimony of the police officer. Plaintiff-appellant\u2019s argument I as it appears in her brief is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-12\">\"The court committed error in excluding all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>testimony of the police officer who came to the scene, made a report of the accident, and used this report in testifying as to physical facts observed by him and admissions made to him by the bus driver at the scene of the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Plaintiff proceeds to argue the concept of \"past recollection refreshed\u201d, which theory is vital to the issue. The judge found that, short of reading the report, the officer could testify to virtually nothing. He had no memory of the details to be refreshed. The report itself was not offered in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">There was no need to discuss the question of the bus driver\u2019s statement at the scene as an \"admission\u201d by his employer. The officer could not remember it and the bus driver testified personally.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">It is not jurisprudentially sound to determine by hindsight what counsel possibly could have done at the initial trial and remand to allow a different trial strategy or a correction of an error of omission by plaintiff, if that by chance were the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">We must hear the case before us, not the case that \"might have been\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b240-11\">Fitzgerald, Lindemer, and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Coleman, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b240-12\">Kavanagh, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ann\"><em>(for affirmance). </em>I agree with Justice Levin that the testimony of the police officer could have been admitted if a proper foundation had been laid. I will concede on this record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>that the trial judge here without question would have erroneously excluded the testimony even if properly founded on account of his expressed misunderstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">I do not agree, however, that it was error to grant the motion to strike this footless evidence. Finding no error, I would affirm.</p>\n<author id=\"b241-5\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmL\">The plaintiff, Mrs. Willie Moncrief, was injured when a DSR bus stopped and she fell to the floor. The trial judge, hearing the case without a jury, found no cause for action.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The judge struck the testimony of the police officer who investigated the accident on the ground that it was based on his written report of the accident and the statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides that such a report is not \"available for use in any court action\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">We agree that in so ruling the judge erred. As my colleague states, the statute \"has no effect on the rules of evidence regarding the police officer\u2019s personal notes or the routine report, usually enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>tied 'Motor Vehicle Accident Report\u2019, that the officer takes at the scene of the accident\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">My colleague nevertheless would affirm on the ground that the officer\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because he had no present recollection of the accident, his memory was not refreshed on reading the accident report and a proper foundation for admission of the report itself under the hearsay exception for past recollection recorded was not laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The record supports the conclusion that the officer\u2019s memory was not refreshed on reading the accident report. His testimony was, however, received in evidence as present recollection refreshed without objection by the DSR\u2019s lawyer or ruling by the judge that his recollection was not refreshed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">A precondition to the admission of a memorandum as past recollection recorded is that the witness cannot refresh his recollection on reading it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no reason for Mrs. Moncrief s lawyer to make an offer of proof inconsistent with the basis on which the officer\u2019s testimony had been received in evidence without pertinent objection or ruling. Even if the offer had been made, it is apparent that the judge would have refused to admit the report itself because of his mistaken view that the statute barred use of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>The judgment cannot be affirmed on the ground that the right result was reached for the wrong reason. The reason relied on by my colleague for rejection of the officer\u2019s testimony was not raised in the trial court. Mrs. Moncrief could properly rely on the receipt in evidence, without pertinent objection or ruling, of the officer\u2019s testimony as present recollection refreshed. She has had no opportunity to respond in the trial court to the deficiency noted on appeal that the officer\u2019s recollection was not refreshed. It appears that a proper foundation for the admission of the accident report as past recollection recorded could be laid<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at a new trial and she is, therefore, entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">We agree that the statute does not bar from evidence either an accident report prepared by an investigating police officer or his testimony based on the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The provision of the Motor Vehicle Code precluding the \"use in any court action\u201d of accident \"reports required by this chapter\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> refers to the report required of a driver involved in an accident resulting in injury or death or property damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>exceeding $200, and not to \"notes or report\u201d made by an investigating police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">In <em>Wallace v Skrzycki, </em>338 Mich 164, 174, 177; 61 NW2d 106 (1953), after a review of earlier cases, this Court said that \"the statute * * * does not bar a police officer from testifying concerning physical facts observed by him or admissions made to him by drivers of vehicles at the scene of an accident and * * * police reports of accidents are not barred by the statute for use as evidence or refreshing a witness\u2019s recollection.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AEv\">In <em>Jaxon v Detroit, </em>379 Mich 405; 151 NW2d 813 (1967), this Court indicated that an accident report prepared by a witness who cannot recall the contents of the report and whose recollection cannot be refreshed by reference to it would be admissible in evidence as past recollection recorded if a proper foundation is laid.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">If a witness recalls the event without the aid of a memorandum he can testify on the basis of his \"present recollection\u201d. If he has no independent recollection and his memory can be refreshed upon reference to a memorandum or, indeed, anything else, he may testify on the basis of his \"present recollection revived\u201d. If his recollection cannot be revived, and the other preconditions to admissibility are satisfied (see fn 2), a memorandum of the event may be admissible as \"past recollection recorded\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The investigating police officer testified about the driving conditions and statements made by the bus driver shortly after the accident. On direct examination the officer said that he had refreshed his recollection on reading his report of the accident. On cross-examination, however, it became apparent that his memory was not refreshed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The DSR\u2019s lawyer at no time objected to the officer\u2019s testimony on the ground that his recollection had not been refreshed; indeed, he assisted the effort to use the report to refresh the officer\u2019s recollection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> His objection on direct examination was \"on the grounds that anything the bus driver said at that time was beyond the scope of his duty and is not admissible\u201d. When the officer\u2019s testimony was concluded, a motion to strike was made on the same ground.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">After the noon recess, the judge ruled, based on his erroneous reading of the statute, that the officer\u2019s testimony was inadmissible and it was stricken. The judge did not reach the ground of the DSR\u2019s lawyer\u2019s objection that the driver\u2019s admission was not binding on the DSR. Nor did he say that the officer\u2019s recollection had not been refreshed. The judge said, rather, that the officer had no present unrefreshed recollection and that his testimony refreshed by the accident report was inadmissible because the statute barred use of the report.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> My colleague, therefore, is mistaken in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>saying that \"the trial court correctly found\u201d that reference to the report did not refresh the witness\u2019 present memory. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge never reached that question; he would have been correct if he had so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">My colleague overlooks the failure of the DSR\u2019s lawyer to object and of the judge to rule that the officer\u2019s recollection was not refreshed, the error of the judge in ruling that testimony based on an accident report is inadmissible, and holds against Mrs. Moncrief on the ground that her lawyer did not, anticipating the deficiency noticed on appeal, lay a foundation and make a futile offer of the report itself.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>If the accident report had been offered as past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>recollection recorded, it is apparent that the judge would have refused to admit it in evidence because of his misunderstanding of the statute. The judge understood the statute to provide \"against admission of the accident report, itself.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The officer\u2019s testimony was at first received in evidence without pertinent objection or ruling that his recollection had not been refreshed. A memorandum is not admissible as past recollection recorded if the witness can, on examination of the memorandum, testify from present recollection refreshed. Mrs. Moncriefs lawyer cannot be faulted for failing to make an offer of proof inconsistent with the basis on which the officer\u2019s testimony had been received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">My colleague writes that \"there was no attempt by plaintiff\u2019s counsel to show that the document was made by the witness from personal observation or was prepared contemporaneously with the event and based on his personal knowledge rather than, for example, statements of bystanders or witnesses. The report would not have been admissible if plaintiff would have offered it as past recollection recorded because no adequate foundation was laid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">It appears that the officer wrote the report at the scene on a Detroit Police Department motor vehicle accident report form.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The report contains the officer\u2019s personal observation that \"the road surface was ice\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">It also contains the statement of a witness, the DSR driver, that he was \"driving at an estimated speed of 20 to 25\u201d miles per hour and \"slid on a patch of ice and a passenger from a seat slid on the floor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Although the report contains the statement of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>witness and both the report and his statement are hearsay \u2014 there is \"double hearsay\u201d \u2014 the report may, nevertheless, be admissible. Where there is multiple hearsay, or \"hearsay within hearsay\u201d, each separate hearsay link is examined. If hearsay exceptions apply to each link, then the evidence is admissible.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, while statements of bystanders or other witnesses to police officers at the scene of an accident are ordinarily not admissible,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> if the statements fall within another exception <em>(e.g., </em>an admission, excited utterance, declaration against interest) they are admissible.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The accident report in the instant case would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>admissible under the exception for past recollection recorded if the statement of the driver is within another exception to the hearsay rule, <em>e.g., </em>an admission by an agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The issue of jurisprudential significance presented by this case is whether the bus driver\u2019s statement ten minutes after the accident may be received in evidence as an admission by his employer, the DSR.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> My colleague does not reach that question, noticing on appeal an issue not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>preserved at the trial level,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and on the mistaken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>premises that the accident report does not contain personal observations of the officer and that a report containing the statement of a witness is necessarily inadmissible, even if that witness is a party or agent of a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The judge\u2019s error in striking the officer\u2019s testimony on the ground that the statute barred use of the accident report to refresh his memory was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">If the evidence of the bus driver\u2019s statement to the investigating officer had been admitted, the judge may have reached a different decision on the bus driver\u2019s credibility<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and may have concluded that Mrs. Moncrief had produced sufficient proof to preponderate: There was ice. The driver was proceeding at an immoderate speed in light of the road conditions. As a result of his negligence, the bus slid on a patch of ice causing Mrs. Moncrief to fall to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Mrs. Moncrief testified that it was sleeting and snowing. The bus driver \"was driving kinda fast, but I don\u2019t know how many miles he was going though.\u201d The bus \"was going wigwag, like that, real fast. He was driving fast.\u201d The driver drove up on the curb and she fell off the seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Mrs. Moncrief is an older woman suffering from a deterioration of the brain. Nevertheless, her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>testimony was not confused or indefinite. Although she did not know the exact speed of the bus, in the judge\u2019s words, \"she knew the bus was going too fast. She has been riding buses for 13 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The bus driver testified that it had snowed on the day of the accident \"[ejnough to make the surface slippery\u201d. He did not assert that there was no ice: \"My testimony is that I don\u2019t remember that there was any ice.\u201d He was traveling 15 miles per hour. He slowed down because of the road conditions. He did not swerve from side to side. He was going 10 miles an hour in the curb lane. When he \"hit\u201d the brakes the bus slid, hit the curb, slid about five feet and stopped at a dry spot. Mrs. Moncrief fell after the bus \"slid off the curb and hit the dry pavement and stopped\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The stricken testimony of the officer was that the bus driver said he was driving at an \"estimated speed of 20 to 25\u201d miles per hour, \"[hje slid on a patch of ice and a passenger from a seat slid on the floor\u201d. The accident report showed that the officer observed that the \"road surface was ice\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The cause of Mrs. Moncriefs injuries is not in dispute. The issue was whether the bus driver was negligent in failing to have the bus under control.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In resolving that issue it was important whether the road was slippery, as the driver testified, or icy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>as he is reported to have told the officer and the officer himself observed, and whether the bus driver was driving at the speed he told the judge or at the higher speed he is reported to have told the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">The plaintiff might prevail on a new trial at which the error in excluding the officer\u2019s testimony is not repeated. I would reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b255-5\">Williams, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-16\"> A third issue presupposes judicial error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\"> <em>See Palmer v Hoffman, </em>318 US 109; 63 S Ct 477; 87 L Ed 645 (1943); McCormick, Evidence (2d ed), \u00a7 308.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\"> <em>People v Rodgers, </em>388 Mich 513, 519; 201 NW2d 621, 624 (1972); McCormick, Evidence (2d ed), \u00a7 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\"> In refusing to consider the officer\u2019s testimony, the trial court indicated that reference to the report failed to refresh the officer\u2019s recollection, and that use of this report was barred by the statute. Thus, the trial judge stated two reasons for his holding, one correct and the other erroneous. Whether we affirm a trial court which reaches. the correct result for the wrong reason depends on the circumstances of the case. For example, it is generally stated that the overruling of a specific objection on an untenable ground will not be disturbed on appeal even if there was a tenable ground that could have been urged. Similarly, if a trial judge sustains a specific objection on an untenable ground, his ruling should be upheld if there was an unstated tenable ground unless it appears that the proponent of the evidence could have obviated the grounds for the true objection, if stated, \u00e1be McCormick, Evidence (2d ed), \u00a7 52, pp 117-118 &amp; fn 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">In this case, plaintiffs counsel stated on two separate occasions that he did not want to offer the report into evidence.

Or, further to illustrate, a dying declaration may incorporate a declaration against interest by another declarant. <em>See </em>McCormick \u00a7 290, p 611.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b250-13\"> McCormick on Evidence (1st ed), \u00a7 286, pp 602-603; <em>Johnson v Lutz, </em>253 NY 124; 170' NE 517 (1930).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b250-14\"> Investigating police officers have been permitted to read, under the exception for past recollection recorded, notes made by them or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>under their supervision of statements made by the accused person to the officer. <em>Jordan v People, </em>151 Colo 133; 376 P2d 699 (1962); <em>Lay v State, </em>461 P2d 1021, 1022-1023 (Okla Cr App, 1969). <em>See, also, People v Rodgers, </em>388 Mich 513; 201 NW2d 621 (1972) (dictum that on a proper foundation a police officer could read his notes of a conversation with the accused).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\"> The DSR\u2019s lawyer objected <em>(see </em>fn 9 and accompanying text) to the testimony of the police officer on the ground that the bus driver had no authority to bind the DSR by a declaration as to a past event. <em>See Hyatt v Leonard Storage Co, supra, </em>p 344; <em>Kalamazoo Yellow Cab Co v Kalamazoo Circuit Judge, </em>363 Mich 384; 109 NW2d 821 (1961); <em>Gorman v McCleaf, </em>369 Mich 237; 119 NW2d 636 (1963).

The authors of the current edition of McCormick on Evidence (2d ed), \u00a7 267, p 641, state:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-13\">\"Probably the most frequent employment of this test is in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>exclusion of statements made by employees after an accident, to the injured party, to a police officer, or to some bystander, about the accident not made in furtherance of the employer\u2019s interest, but as a 'mere narrative\u2019. This is the logical application of these tests, but the assumption that the test for the master\u2019s responsibility for the agent\u2019s <em>acts </em>should be the test for using the agent\u2019s statements as <em>evidence </em>against the master is a shaky one. The rejection of such post-accident statements coupled with the admission of the employee\u2019s testimony on the stand is to prefer the weaker to the stronger evidence. The agent is well informed about acts in the course of business, his statements offered against the employer are normally against the employer\u2019s interest, and while the employment continues, the employee is not likely to make the statements unless they are true. Moreover, if the admissibility of admissions is viewed as arising from the adversary system, responsibility for statements of one\u2019s employee is a consistent aspect. Accordingly, the trend is in the direction of broader admissibility of admissions by agents, exemplified by the Model Code provision which lets in the agent\u2019s statement, if 'the declaration concerned a matter within the scope\u2019 of the declarant\u2019s employment 'and was made before the termination of the agency or employment.\u2019 Cases in increasing number support this wider test. Its acceptance by courts generally seems expedient.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">The new Federal Rules of Evidence provide that a statement is not hearsay and is admissible as an admission by a party opponent if offered against a party and is \"a statement by his agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of his agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship\u201d. FR Ev, \u00a7 801(d)(2). The accompanying advisory committee note states: \"A substantial trend favors admitting statements related to a matter within the scope of the agency or employment\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\"><em>See also </em>Comment, <em>Admissions of Agents, </em>40 Mo L Rev 55, 62-63 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\"Criticism of this rule of admissibility is generally premised on the supposed lack of trustworthiness inherent in the agent\u2019s prior out-of-court declaration. It is submitted that such criticism is largely unfounded. Since the statement concerns an act within the authority of the agent, it can rarely be claimed that he is unfamiliar with what occurred. In light of the apparent unity of interest between principal and agent in seeing that the authorized act is performed, exclusion of the agent\u2019s statement would seem illogical. Admittedly, exclusion under the hearsay rule may seem theoretically sound if we look only to the physical absence of the principal at the time the statement was made, yet the broad scope of the agency relationship itself lends support to admitting the statement. Since the law deems the principal constructively present for the agent\u2019s authorized acts, the same theory should be applied to the agent\u2019s statements concerning those acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"> While it is sometimes said that an issue not preserved is \"not before the Court,\u201d I do not mean to suggest that it is beyond the Court\u2019s prerogative to consider an issue not preserved at the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>level.
