On December 23, 1971, defendant was sentenced to 6 months in jail and $150 costs, or an additional 30 days in jail on one count, and a suspended sentence of $100 fine and $100 costs on the other count.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Court granted leave to appeal limited to the two questions considered herein.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Defendant is a young black man and most of the police officers involved in the incident are white. Prior to trial, defense counsel submitted 120 questions to be asked during voir dire. In lieu of the defendant\u2019s 120 questions, the trial judge announced that he would utilize seven of the defendant\u2019s questions to cover any bias or racial prejudice in the proposed jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">1. Did the trial court\u2019s refusal to submit 120 questions to the jury on voir dire deny defendant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>trial by a fair and impartial jury by preventing a meaningful exercise of challenges for cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">2. Did the trial court\u2019s refusal to submit 120 questions to the jury on voir dire deny defendant a trial by a fair and impartial jury by preventing the intelligent use of peremptory challenges?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In Michigan, the examination of prospective jurors may be conducted by the court or, in its discretion, by the attorneys.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The scope of voir dire examination of jurors is within the discretion of the trial judge and his decision will not be set aside absent an abuse of that discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Voir dire affords attorneys an opportunity to elicit sufficient information to develop a rational basis for excluding veniremen whether for cause or by peremptory challenges.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Relying on <em>Ham v South Carolina, </em>409 US 524; 93 S Ct 848; 35 L Ed 2d 46 (1973), and related Federal appellate decisions, the defendant maintains he had a constitutional right to voir dire the veniremen further on racial prejudice. Although it is true that the <em>Ham </em>decision held that the Fourteenth Amendment required the trial judge to interrogate jurors upon the subject of racial prejudice after the defendant\u2019s timely request, <em>Ham </em>does not stand for the proposition that the trial judge must ask every question dealing with racial prejudice that the defense might wish to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\"We agree with the dissenting justices of the Supreme Court of South Carolina that the trial judge was not required to put the question in any particular form, or to ask any particular number of questions on the subject, simply because requested to do so by petitioner. The Court in <em>Aldridge </em>was at pains to point out, in a context where its authority within the federal system of courts allows a good deal closer supervision than does the Fourteenth Amendment, that the trial court had a broad discretion as to the questions to be asked,\u2019 283 US, at 310; 51 S Ct, at 471 [75 L Ed 1054 (1931)]. The discretion as to form and number of questions permitted by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is at least as broad. In this context, either of the brief, general questions urged by the petitioner would appear sufficient to focus the attention of prospective jurors on any racial prejudice they might entertain.\u201d 409 US 527.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">While concurring in part and dissenting in part with the majority\u2019s decision in <em>Ham, </em>Justice Marshall stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">\"I do not mean to suggest that a defendant must be permitted to propound any question or that limitless time must be devoted to preliminary <em>voir dire. </em>Although the defendant\u2019s interest in a jury free of prejudice is strong, there are countervailing state interests in the expeditious conduct of criminal trials and the avoidance of jury intimidation. These interests bulk larger as the possibility of uncovering prejudice becomes more attenuated. The trial judge has broad discretion to refuse to ask questions that are irrelevant or vexatious. Thus, where the claimed prejudice is of a novel character, the judge might require a preliminary showing of relevance or of possible prejudice before allowing the questions.\u201d 409 US 533.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Footnote 2 at 409 US 533 specifically holds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">\"I also agree with the majority that the judge may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>properly decline to ask the question in any particular form or ask any particular number of questions on a subject.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In its most recent pronouncement in this area, the Supreme Court of the United States, by Justice Powell, held that voir dire about racial prejudice is not constitutionally required absent circumstances comparable in significance to those existing in <em>Ham, supra. Ristaino v Ross, </em>424 US 589; 96 S Ct 1017; 47 L Ed 2d 258 (1976). Defendant Ross was a black man who was charged with two other blacks for the armed robbery, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and assault and battery with intent to murder of a white man employed by Boston University as a security guard. The trial judge refused to pose a question directly related to racial prejudice during the voir dire of the veniremen.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The Court\u2019s opinion said <em>Ham </em>\"reflected an assessment of whether under all of the circumstances presented there was a constitutionally significant likelihood that, absent questioning about racial prejudice\u201d, the jury would not be impartial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">\"The circumstances in Ham strongly suggested the need for <em>voir dire </em>to include specific questioning about racial prejudice. Ham\u2019s defense was that he had been framed because of his civil rights activities. His prominence in the community as a civil rights activist, if not already known to veniremen, inevitably would have been revealed to the members of the jury in the course of his presentation of that defense. Racial issues therefore were inextricably bound up with the conduct of the trial. Further, Ham\u2019s reputation as a civil rights activist and the defense he interposed were likely to intensify any prejudice that individual members of the jury might harbor. In such circumstances we deemed a <em>voir dire </em>that included questioning specifically directed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>racial prejudice, when sought by Ham, necessary to meet the constitutional requirement that an impartial jury be impaneled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Unlike <em>Ham, </em>\"the need to question veniremen specifically about racial prejudice\u201d did not rise \"to constitutional dimensions\u201d in <em>Ristaino.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Although the questions were not constitutionally required in <em>Ristaino, </em>footnote 9 of the opinion said \"the wiser course generally is to propound appropriate questions designed to identify racial prejudice if requested by the defendant\u201d. The states \"are free to allow or require questions not demanded by the Constitution\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In the instant case, the following colloquy took place between defense counsel and the trial judge in chambers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\"><em>\"Mr. Hayes: </em>Could you indicate to me which ones you are going to use?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\"><em>\"The Court: </em>25, 26 and 27, 91 and 92, 105 and 106 with additions making them to conform to the Court rulings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\"><em>\"Mr. Hayes: </em>May I ask \u2014 why you have rejected all the questions which I believe go to the essence of the matter, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\"><em>\"The Court: </em>The court will give the voir dire. I think the court\u2019s voir dire will cover any bias or prejudice any jurors may have \u2014 that is the purpose of it \u2014 it is hot to choose a jury which is biased or <em>[sic] </em>your viewpoint or the prosecution\u2019s, but to get a jury which is unbiased and unprejudiced, and I think the court\u2019s voir dire will fairly cover it. Knowledge of your instructions are <em>[sic] </em>contained in the court questionnaire signed by the jurors, and it would be repetitious to go into them\u2014 many of them are of the nature not proper for voir dire. These are not given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">During the voir dire, the trial court asked the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\"Have any of you had any dealings or experiences with black persons that might make it difficult for you to sit in impartial judgment on this case?

The trial court\u2019s voir dire contained questions regarding racial prejudice which were sufficient to afford defense counsel information necessary to challenge prospective jurors, either peremptorily<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or for cause. Defendant\u2019s right to be tried by an impartial jury was protected by the judge\u2019s questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b437-6\">Fitzgerald, Lindemer, and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Coleman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-13\"> 54 Mich App 554; 221 NW2d 411 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b431-14\"> 394 Mich 812 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\"> GCR 1963, 511.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\"> <em>Corbin v Hittle, </em>34 Mich App 631; 192 NW2d 38 (1971); <em>People v Brown, </em>46 Mich App 592; 208 NW2d 590 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b432-11\"> 2 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Michigan Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), p 465.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b436-16\"> GCR 1963, 510.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b436-17\"> Many of defendant\u2019s proposed questions are irrelevant, vague or inconsequential <em>(e.g.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-18\">\"61.

The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Harrell and all his witnesses were black. All the police officers giving testimony favorable to the prosecution were white.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Before the trial, Harrell\u2019s counsel submitted 120 <em>voir dire </em>questions, many designed to reveal latent racial bias or prejudice of the prospective jurors. The judge asked a number of the general questions on race, omitting the more probing questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">We would hold that where there are significant racial overtones, probing questions are necessary to enable a litigant to exercise intelligently his rights of challenge, and that the refusal to ask such questions is an abuse of the judge\u2019s discretion to control the <em>voir dire </em>examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Two police officers attempted to stop Harrell for drunk driving. Following a ten-block chase, he parked his car and ran down the street to the back of his parents\u2019 home. He was apprehended at the door and advised that he was under arrest for fleeing and eluding a police officer. A large crowd gathered.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">The prosecution called seven police officers as <em>res gestae </em>witnesses, six white and one black. The six white officers gave testimony favorable to the prosecution indicating that Harrell and the crowd were struggling with the police, and that the officers did not strike Harrell. The black officer testified that he saw officers dragging Harrell, limp and unconscious, to the street and then strike him several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Harrell\u2019s witnesses, some of them relatives, testified that he did not strike the officers, that the officers struck him, and that the crowd did not harrass the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Before the <em>voir dire, </em>Harrell\u2019s counsel asserted that the case involved a \"black-white confrontation\u201d in an emotionally charged atmosphere and that the alignment of witnesses along racial lines evidenced significant racial overtones which would be operative throughout the trial. He submitted the 120 <em>voir dire </em>questions, many exploring for racial bias. Counsel argued that an extensive and probing <em>voir dire </em>was necessary to provide a sufficient basis for intelligent exercise of the right to challenge prospective jurors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Among the questions submitted,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but not asked, were the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\"Have you ever made a statement to anyone that Negroes should be able to help themselves just like anybody else does?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">\"Do you think that the black people of Jackson County have a legitimate complaint when they accuse the white society of white racism?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">\"Do you think there is any difference between black people and white people?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">\"Are you aware of any racial friction in the Jackson community?

In line with another decision during the same term cutting back Federal <em>habeas corpus </em>review of state court convictions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Court eschewed expansion of the role of the United States district courts and courts of appeal in supervising state court criminal proceedings; a racial difference between the defendant and the victim will not alone support resort to the federal courts on <em>voir dire </em>issues.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The Court, in <em>Ristaino, </em>said that although <em>\"voir dire </em>questioning directed to racial prejudice was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>not constitutionally required [by the Fourteenth Amendment], the wiser course generally is to propound appropriate questions designed to identify racial prejudice if requested by the defendant. Under our supervisory power we <em>would have required </em>as much of a federal court faced with the circumstances here. See <em>Aldridge v United States </em>[283 US 308, 313; 51 S Ct 470; 75 L Ed 1054 (1931)] * * * .

(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In <em>Aldridge, </em>as in <em>Ristaino, </em>the defendant was black and the victim was white. The Court held that Aldridge was entitled to have the veniremen interrogated concerning racial prejudice; reviewing state decisions, the Court concluded that the \"propriety of such an inquiry has been generally recognized\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Aldridge had been convicted in the District of Columbia. The Court rejected the argument that such inquiry was unnecessary because of privileges and rights enjoyed by blacks in that jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">\"But the question is not as to the civil privileges of the negro, or as to the dominant sentiment of the community and the general absence of any disqualifying prejudice, but as to the bias of the particular jurors who are to try the accused. * * * [I]f any one of them was shown to entertain a prejudice which would preclude his rendering a fair verdict, a gross injustice would be perpetrated in allowing him to sit.\u201d <em>Aldridge v United States, supra, </em>p 314.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The authorities are in general agreement that where racial prejudice may affect a juror\u2019s attitude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the trial judge must permit <em>voir dire </em>inquiry concerning racial prejudice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">There is no disagreement in the opinions filed today concerning Harrell\u2019s right to inquire concerning racial prejudice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The issue here concerns the kinds of questions that may be asked and the extent of the judge\u2019s discretion to limit the inquiry, and not whether the judge or counsel conducts the examination.

Although the use of general questions has been approved by this court [citations omitted], the better practice in a sensitive case is to direct probing questions touching areas of possible prejudice to each individual juror, with the questions to be asked by the trial judge or counsel. Individual questioning is particularly necessary when the overall circumstances and surroundings suggest the possibility of racial bias.\u201d <em>United States v Bear Runner, </em>502 F2d 908, 911-912 (CA 8, 1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In the instant case, as in <em>Cochran </em>and <em>Bear Runner, </em>there are special circumstances indicating the presence of racial overtones.
