J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY6\"><em>(to reverse). </em>Bruno Krol was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>employed by the City of Hamtramck from June 1950 until his death on November 14, 1960. He worked in the traffic control division of the police department painting signs, curbs, crosswalks, and removing paint from signs. In the winter months he worked primarily indoors and was exposed to paint, kerosene and gas fumes. His death was caused by brain necrosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Under date of November 18, 1960, in response to its own inquiry, the city was given notice of Krol\u2019s death which contained the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">\"11-11-60. Right temporal craniotomy with removal of necrotic temporal lobe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Brain necrosis, questionable etiology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">In approximately November 1962, two years after Bruno died, his widow Lottie read a newspaper article which suggested to her the possibility that Bruno\u2019s death might have been work related.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">On April 3, 1963 she filed an application for hearing with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau. The bureau served the city a copy of her application on June 4, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">On June 26, 1969 an award of benefits was made by a referee. On February 10, 1972 the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board reversed because the plaintiff had failed to give notice within 120 days after her husband\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">On May 29, 1973 the Court of Appeals reversed the appeal board, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-13\">\"in claims arising out of occupational diseases, the statutory period for filing notice and claim begins to run when the disability is discovered <em>and </em>when the claimant knows, or reasonably should know, that his disability is related to his employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>On remand the appeal board again denied benefits, finding that Lottie knew in November 1962 that Bruno\u2019s death might have been work related and the notice from the compensation bureau on June 4, 1963 was untimely as being more than 120 days from November 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We granted leave to consider whether the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the appeal board\u2019s determination, erred in refusing to apply our decision in <em>Norris v Chrysler Corp, </em>391 Mich 469; 216 NW2d 783 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">We conclude that it was error not to apply <em>Norris, supra, </em>for we find that case controlling and accordingly we reverse the Court of Appeals and remand to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board for consideration of the substantive issues raised in the appeal from the referee\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The following statutory provisions are applicable to this claim: 1948 CL 412.15; MSA 17.165; now, without substantive change, MCLA 418.381; MSA 17.237(381) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">\"No proceedings for compensation for an injury under this act shall be maintained, unless a notice of the injury shall have been given to the employer within 3 months after the happening thereof, and unless the claim for compensation with respect to such injury, which claim may be either oral or in writing, shall have been made within 6 months after the occurrence of the same; or, in case of the death of the employee, within 6 months<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after said death * * * . In all cases in which the employer has been given notice of the happening of the injury, or has notice or knowledge of the happening of said accident within 3 months after the happening of the same, and fails, neglects or refuses to report said injury to the compensation commission as required by the provisions of this act, the statute of limitations shall not run against the claim of the injured employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>or his dependents, or in favor of either said employer or his insurer, until a report of said injury shall have been filed with the compensation commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">1948 CL 417.10; MSA 17.229, now, without substantive change, MCLA 418.441; MSA 17.237(441) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">\"The requirements as to notice as to occupational disease and death resulting therefrom and the requirements as to the bringing of proceedings for compensation for disability or death resulting from such occupational disease shall be the same as required in section 15 of part 2 of this act, except that the notice shall be given to the employer within 120 days after the disablement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">It is apparent from these provisions that in a claim for benefits arising out of an occupational disease, notice must be given the employer within 120 days after the disablement. This time period, as correctly noted by the Court of Appeals, begins to run at the time the claimant knows, or should have known, that the disease or disability might be work related. See <em>Finch v Ford Motor Co, </em>321 Mich 469; 32 NW2d 712 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the claimant did not meet the statutory time limits for giving notice to the employer, that is not the end of the inquiry. As cited above, MCLA 412.15; MSA 17.165 (now MCLA 418.381; MSA 17.237[381]) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">\"in all cases in which the employer has been given notice of the happening of the injury, or has notice or knowledge of the happening of said accident within 3 months after the happening of the same, and fails, neglects or refuses to report said injury to the compensation commission as required by the provisions of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>act, the statute of limitations shall not run against the claim of the injured employee or his dependents, or in favor of either said employer or his insurer, until a report of said injury shall have been filed with the compensation commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">This provision was considered in <em>Norris v Chrysler Corp, </em>391 Mich 469, 477; 216 NW2d 783 (1974), and for a unanimous Court, Justice Coleman wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\"The notice given must be sufficient to make the employer aware that an injury has been sustained. If, after inquiry, the employer does not believe the injury to be compensable, it need not report the accident. <em>However, in not reporting the accident, the employer assumes the risk that the injury will be found t\u00f3 be compensable. If such a determination occurs, the employer\u2019s penalty is a suspension of statutory limitations. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In this case, the evidence shows that the city had timely written notice of Bruno Krol\u2019s death and the cause of death. Nevertheless, the city chose not to notify the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau of Krol\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">As we said in <em>Norris, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\"To hold that defendant was charged with reporting only <em>compensable </em>injuries in order to impose the statutory limitations would be to hold that defendant was charged with judging the merits of the case. To the contrary, it was and remains the duty of the referee (with appellate levels provided) to determine compensability. The employer must report any injury of which it has notice if it is to have the advantage of the statutory limitations. Conversely, the employer need not report all or any injuries, but in failing to do so pays the price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>of the suspension of statutory limitations.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 391 Mich at 480.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Accordingly, the statutory time limits for the filing of notice and claim with the defendant employer for occupational disease and death were suspended, and this case is remanded to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board for a determination on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b392-6\">Williams, Levin, and Fitzgerald, JJ., concurred with Kavanagh, C. J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b392-7\">Coleman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbG\">We have been requested to excuse plaintiff\u2019s failure to give an employer timely notice of a claim for compensation because it does not appear the employer was prejudiced. As indicated by the dissent in <em>Kerkstra v Department of State Highways, </em>398 Mich 103; 247 NW2d 759 (1976), we should not engraft such conditions on the statute. We step outside our constitutional role when we judicially legislate.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Bruno Krol worked for the city of Hamtramck. He died November 14, 1960. The city received notice of the death which had this information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">\"11-11-60. Right temporal craniotomy with removal of necrotic temporal lobe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">Brain necrosis questionable etiology.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">On April 3, 1963, Mrs. Krol filed an application with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau. The claim related to \"disablement from occupational disease which occurred on or about November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>1960\u201d. The city was served with a copy of the application on June 4, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">After several dismissals, a hearing was held. On June 26, 1969 the referee awarded benefits. In an opinion filed February 10, 1972, the appeal board reversed because plaintiff failed to give notice within 120 days after her husband\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">By a per curiam opinion dated May 29, 1973, the Court of Appeals reversed the appeal board because it \"erred in holding that the period in which notice and claim must be filed is solely the date of disability\u201d. The Court said \"in claims arising out of occupational disease, the statutory period for filing notice and claim begins to run when the disability is discovered <em>and </em>when the claimant knows, or reasonably should know, that his disability is related to his employment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">On remand, the board noted this exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\"><em>\u201dQ. [By Mr. Thomas]: </em>Mrs. Krol, approximately when was it, approximately when was it that you first had reason to believe that Mr. Krol\u2019s illness could have been related to his employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\"><em>\"A. </em>Oh, I think about two years later I read in papers by Dr. Molner and stuff like that that from being exposed to fumes, paint and different things like acid and stuff like that, could damage your brain; and that\u2019s what they were diagnosing in the hospital, at Ford and Ann Arbor, that he had a damaged brain, but they couldn\u2019t know \u2014 they didn\u2019t know where it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">'The <em>Referee: </em>* * * When you say two years later, is this two years after your husband\u2019s death you are talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\"><em>'A. </em>No, no \u2014 yes, after he is dead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">The board found that Mrs. Krol had notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the relationship between death and employment in November 1962. The board found that the employer received notice of Mrs. Krol\u2019s claim on June 4, 1963. The board found no proofs from which it could conclude \"that the employer received notice or had knowledge of the alleged cause of death until they were served\u201d with Mrs. Krol\u2019s application. The board denied Mrs. Krol\u2019s claim and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">We are mandated by Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28 and MCLA 418.861; MSA 17.237(861) to accept findings of fact made by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board. See <em>DeGeer v DeGeer Farm Equipment Co, </em>391 Mich 96; 214 NW2d 794 (1974), and <em>Hlady v Wolverine Bolt Co, </em>393 Mich 368; 224 NW2d 856 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Plaintiff believes <em>Norris v Chrysler Corp, </em>391 Mich 469; 216 NW2d 783 (1974), controls. She claims defendant had notice of Mr. Krol\u2019s death. In <em>Norris, </em>the appeal board misapplied a decision of the Court of Appeals in concluding the employer was given insufficient notice of a personal injury. We reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The notice which defendant received in this case indicated Mr. Krol had a brain necrosis of questionable etiology. The appeal board found no proof from which it could conclude that defendant knew the cause of Mr. Krol\u2019s death prior to being served with Mrs. Krol\u2019s application. The board in this case did not find the notice legally insufficient. They found no notice at all prior to June 4, 1963. <em>Norris </em>does not apply to these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The remaining issue is whether the statutory requirement for timely notice was satisfied. The appeal board found that proper notice under the statute had not been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">An occupational disease was not an injury for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>which a remedy was provided by common law. Liability of the employer was created by express and specific statutory provisions. It is well established that such a statute must be strictly applied in cases which would take advantage of its terms. We cannot properly change its mandates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">\"It is not within the province of this Court to read therein a mandate that the Legislature has not seen fit to incorporate. Our duty is to apply the law as we find it.\u201d <em>Jones v Grand Ledge Public Schools, </em>349 Mich 1, 11; 84 NW2d 327 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">A claim that the employer was not prejudiced by the delay in notice cannot change the statute. In <em>Kerkstra, </em>we found \"no basis for the Court to add its own conditions to those provided by the Legislature\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The decisions of the appeal board and the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b395-7\">Lindemer and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Coleman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-10\"> Changed to 12 months by 1965 PA 44.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-12\"> This same sanction exists \"for failure to notify the department of such injury <em>or death\".
