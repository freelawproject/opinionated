In its written opinion, the board concluded that a reprimand was the appropriate penalty because the respondent had practiced law almost 20 years with \"an unblemished record\u201d and \"the complicated financial transactions\u201d in question took place among \"sophisticated business people\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The complaint against Mr. Charlip arose out of a series of real estate transactions. A warranty deed, signed by the respondent, conveyed certain property from his corporation to Mr. Freedman and Mr. Falk. The deed did not mention two mortgages on the property. Another instrument contained an agreement to discharge one of the mortgages. Mr. Charlip\u2019s signature also appeared on this instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The respondent testified that he did not intend to convey the property, but that Mr. Freedman and Mr. Falk completed the deed after he had signed a blank form. He stated that his promise to discharge the mortgage was contingent on payment of an additional $1,500 by the purchasers. The purchasers testified that they never agreed to pay the $1,500. Mr. Charlip instigated foreclosure proceedings on the disputed mortgage. The mortgage was foreclosed, and Freedman and Falk paid $8,875.61 to redeem from the foreclosure sale. The respondent retained this amount four years before returning it to Freedman and Falk.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">We find the respondent\u2019s foreclosure and retention of the entire redemption payment to be mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>conduct requiring the .imposition of discipline. We affirm the State Bar Grievance Board\u2019s evaluation of the appropriate penalty, but vacate the assessment of expenses against the respondent.
