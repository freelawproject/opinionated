S. 1.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b198-9\">Following this principle, the court holds that the^-true boundary line between the States of Arkansas and Tennessee is the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Mississippi, as it existed at the Treaty of Peace concluded between the United States and Great Britain in 1783, subject to such changes as have occurred since that time through natural and gradual processes.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b198-10\">Certain decisions of the Arkansas and Tennessee courts and acts of the Tennessee legislature, referred to in the opinion, fall short of showing that the States, by practical location and long acquiescence, established the boundary, at the place in dispute, as a line equidistant from the well-defined permanent banks of the river. It is therefore unnecessary to decide whether the supposed agreement between them would be valid without consent of Congress, in view of the third clause of Art.

The cause, having been put at issue by . the filing of answer and replication, was brought on to hearing upon stipulated facts, pursuant to ah intimation made by this court in <em>Cissna </em>v. <em>Tennessee, </em>242 U. S. 195, 198.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">The facts are as follows: By the Treaty of 1763 between England, France, and Spain, Art. VII (3 Jenkinson\u2019s Treaties, 177, 182), the boundary line between the British and French possessions at this place was established as \"a line drawn along the middle of the River Mississippi,\u201d with consequent recognition of the dominion of France over the territory now comprising the State of \u25a0 Arkansas, and the dominion of Great Britain over that now comprising the State of Tennessee. By the Treaty of Peace concluded between the United States and Great Britain, September 3, 1783, 8 Stat. 80, the territory comprising Tennessee passed to the United States, its w\u00e9st-erly boundary being described (Art. II) as \"a line to be drawn along the middle of the said River Mississippi.\u201d It formed a part of the State of North Carolina. In the year 1790 North Carolina ceded it to the United States (Act of April 2,1790, c. 6,1 Stat. 106). In a report made in the following year by Thomas Jefferson, then Secretary of State, and submitted to Congress by President Washington, the bounds of the ceded territory were described, the western boundary being \"the middle of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>river Mississippi.\u201d 1 American State Papers, Public Lands, p. 17. And by Act. \u00f3f June 1, 1796, c. 47, 1 Stat. 491, the whole of the territory thus ceded was made a State.. By the Louisiana Purchase, under the Treaty of April 30, 1803, 8 Stat. 200, the territory comprising Arkansas was acquired by the United States from France. It was admitted into the Union as a State by Act of June 15, 1836, c. 100, 5 Stat. 50, its easterly boundary being described as \u201cthe middip of the main channel of the said river.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-3\">According to the stipulated facts, the earliest evidence concerning the location of the river at the place in question relates to the year 1823, and is set forth upon a map made recently Jby Major Humphreys, purporting to. show the conditions as they existed at that time. The river flowed southward past Dean\u2019s Island on the Arkansas side, made a bend to the westward at or about the southernmost, part of this island, and then swept northerly and westerly around Island No. 37 (Tennessee), a lesser channel known as McKenzie Chute passing between that island and the main Tennessee shore; the main and lesser channels met at the southwestern extremity of Island No. 37, and the river flowed thence southwesterly past Point Able, Tennessee, opposite which it turned again easterly and then northerly, forming what is known as the Devil\u2019s Elbow, and flowed thence easterly or northeasterly around Bran-dywine Point or Island (Arkansas), until it came within a distance of about two miles from the place where it started its northerly turn opposite Dean\u2019s Island; and at this point it turned again to the southward. It is agreed that in 1823 the river ran substantially as indicated upon the Humphreys map, and that between that year and the year 1876 the width of the channel, by erosion and caving in of the Tennessee bank south, southwest, and west of Dean\u2019s Island, along the mainland and Island No. 37, had increased from its former width of about a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>mile or less to a width of <em>Vyi </em>or <em>lA </em>miles, with consequent narrowing of the neck of land opposite Dean\u2019s Island. It is a matter in controversy between the parties whether during the same period there were accretions to Dean\u2019s Island and Plum Island, in the State of Arkansas, and to Island No. 37 and the shore below Point Able, on the Tennessee side. A steamboat reconnaissance of the river was made by Colonel Suter under the direction of the War Department in 1874, and a map of the place in question was prepared under his direction and is in evidence. There being ho proof of material changes in the river between 1874 and 1876, this map, while not shown.to be entirely accurate, is agreed to represent the general situation as it existed in the latter year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-5\">On March 7, 1876, the river suddenly and with great violence, within about thirty hours, made for itself a new channel directly across the neck opposite the apex of Dean\u2019s Island, so that the old channel around the bend of the elbow (a distance of fifteen to twenty miles) was abandoned by the current, and although it remained for a few years covered with dead water it was no longer navigable except in times of high water for small boats, and this continued only for a short time, since the old bed immediately began to fill with sand, sediment, and alluvial deposits; In the course of time it became dry land suitable for cultivation and to a considerable extent covered with timber. The new channel is called, from the year in which it originated, the \u201cCentennial Cut-off,\u201d and the land that it separated from.the Tennessee mainland goes by the name of \u201cCentennial Island.\u201d \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-6\">The cut-off and the territory affected by it are the same that are mentioned and dealt with in the cases of <em>Stockley </em>v. <em>Cissn\u00e1, </em>119 Fed. Rep. 812; <em>State </em>v. <em>Muncie Pulp Co., </em>119 Tennessee, 47, and <em>Stockley </em>v. <em>Cissna, </em>119 Tennessee, 135. The State of Tennessee, in her answer, pleads and relies upon the first and second of these eases as judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>determinations and evidence of the boundary line between the States at the place in question. Their materiality and effect are matters to be determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\">Prior to 1876, notably around \u201cIsland 37\u201d and \u201cDevil\u2019s Elbow,\u201d the bank on one side of the river was high and subject to erosion, the effect of. the water against it; while on the opposite side' the bank was a flat or sloping shore, so that the width of the river was materially affected by the rise and fall of the water, being considerably wider at normal than at low-water stage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-6\">The following questions are submitted for the determination of this court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-7\">(1) Arkansas contends that the true boundary line between the States (aside from the question of the avulsion of 1876) is the middle of the river at low water, that is, the middle of the channel of navigation; whereas Tennessee contends that the true boundary is a line equidistant from'the well-defined banks at a normal stage of the river.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-8\">(2) Arkansas contends that by the avulsion of 1876 the boundary line between the States was unaffected, and remained in the middle of the river bed which was by the avulsion abandoned, whether the first or the second definition of the middle of the river be adopted; whereas Tennessee contends that the line was affected by the avulsion to the extent indicated by the opinion of the Supreme Court of that State in <em>State </em>v. <em>Muncie Pulp Co., </em>119 Tennessee, 47; that is, that the effect of the avulsion was to press back the line between the two States to the middle of the old channel as it ran previous to the erosions upon the Tennessee banks that occurred between 1823 and 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-9\">(3) Tennessee contends that, irrespective of the question of accretions and erosions, it is impossible now to locate accurately the line of the river as it ran in 1876 just prior to the avulsion, and that therefore the line of 1823 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>must prevail as the boundary line between the States, where it has been or can be located accurately and definitely; where\u00e1s Arkansas insists that there is no real difficulty in locating the middle of the river of 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-4\">Upon the determination of these points, the court is to appoint a commission to run, locate, and designate the line.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-5\"><em>Mr. Caruthers Ewing, </em>with whom <em>Mr: John D.

This court knows that the Mississippi River is sinuous, and that, on one side, in many places,, will be found a sloping bank contiguous to which the water is very shallow, and on the opposite side a, high bank with the water deep and navigable. If the contention of Tennessee be maintained, then at the point in controversy the navigable or steamboat channel of the river was wholly within the territorial limits of Tennessee or Arkansas dependent upon the nature of the bank at the particular point.- This question is important because at low water stage the river would be about one-half mile wide and the line would therefore be about one-quarter of a mile from the high bank. At a normal stage of water the river at the <em>locus in quo </em>might be about a mile and a half wide. The line would therefore be about three-fourths of a mile from the high or bluff bank. The difference amounts to a strip of land many miles in length and a quarter of a mile wide, <em>i. e., </em>about 4,000 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>In deciding otherwise and repudiating the rule announced in <em>Iowa </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>the Tennessee court <em>{State </em>v. <em>Muncie Pulp Co., </em>119 Tennessee, 47) misconceived earlier decisions in this court and ignored later ones.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-5\">It is recognized by all authorities that boundary lines are unaffected by an avulsion. The river\u2019s sudden abandonment of its bed left the line between the two States exactly as it existed at the time of this sudden and visible abandonment. <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>213 U. S. 68; <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>196 IT. S. 33; <em>Philadelphia Co. </em>v. <em>Stimson, </em>223 U. S. 6\u00d35, 624; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>214 U.

Rep. 5; and other cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-6\">Before the avulsion, the boundary line between the States followed the gradual and imperceptible shiftings of the river. What each State lost or gained by gradual and imperceptible shiftings was a permanent loss or gain except and unless these changes were undone as they were made, to wit, gradually and imperceptibly. Gradual and imperceptible changes in property rights and in-boundary lines are unaffected by the fact that as the re- \u2022 suit of an avulsion land which had been lost by erosion is-' uncovered. The doctrine of reliction only, applies, when land is uncovered gradually and imperceptibly; it never applies when the recession of the waters from the land is sudden and visible. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>18 How. 150, 156; <em>SCLouis </em>v. <em>Rutz, </em>138 U. S. 226; <em>Sapp </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>51 La. Ann. 1718; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>State, </em>3 Tex.

The case of <em>Mulry </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>100 N. Y. 424, is about the only support to be found for the proposition that the doctrine of reliction can be invoked when the land is uncovered by an avulsion. The statement in the court\u2019s opinion to this effect is mere <em>dictum. </em>See <em>Matter of City of Buffalo, </em>206 N. Y. 319. Land submerged by the sudden and violent action of the sea, as in <em>Mulry </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Norton, is land that is lost by an avulsion and the owner still has title thereto. He simply cannot use the land because it is covered with water. Land thus covered by water belongs to the owner wholly on the principle that an avulsion does not affect property rights and titles. To hold that the doctrine of reliction could be applied to land uncovered as the result of an avulsion would be to hold .that boundary lines and property rights are affected by an avulsion, whereas the law is well settled to the contrary.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b206-4\"><em>Mr. G.

Whatever may have been the proper construction of the Treaties of 1763 and 1783,.it is clear that on the admission of Tennessee into the Union the western boundary of' the United States was construed to be the \"middle of the channel or bed\u201d of the Mississippi River. It was so fixed by the treaty between the United States and Spain in 1795. Congress had no power to include within the territory of Arkansas, through the enabling act admitting it to the Union, territory within the boundaries of Tennessee, because Tennessee was the older State.

The contention of each State was supported by a decision of its court of last resort: <em>Dunlieth &amp; Dubuque Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>County of Dubuque, </em>55 Iowa, 558, 565; <em>Buttenuth </em>v. <em>St. Louis Bridge Co., </em>123 Illinois, 535, 548. This court recognized these cases as presenting in the clearest terms the different views as to the line of jurisdiction between neighboring States separated. by a navigable stream, and thereupon proceeded to analyze their reasoning and doctrine. From a review of the authorities upon international law, it was declared that when a navigable river constituted the boundary be-, tween two independent States the interest of each State in the navigation, and the preservation by each of its equal right,in such navigation, required that the middle of the channel should mark the boundary up to, which each State on its side should exercise jurisdiction; that hence, in international law, and by the usage of European <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>nations, the term \u201cmiddle of the stream/\u2019 as applied to a navigable river, meant the middle of the channel of such stream, and that in this sense the terms were used in the treaty between Great Britain, France, and Spain, concluded at Paris in 1763, so that by the language \u201ca line drawn along the middle of the River Mississippi,\u201d as there used, the'middle of the channel was indicated; that the <em>thalweg, </em>or middle of the navigable channel, is to be taken as the true boundary line between independent States for reasons growing out of the right of navigation, in the absence of a special convention between the States or long use \u00e9quivalent thereto; and that although the reason and necessity of the rule may not be as cogent in this country, where neighboring States are under the same general government, yet the same rule must be held to obtain unless changed by statute or usage of so great a length of time as to have acquired the force of law; and that the Illinois Enabling Act of April 18, 1818, \u00a7 2, c. 67, 3 Stat. 428, which made \u201cthe middle of the Mississippi river\u201d the western boundary of the State, the Missouri Enabling Act of March 6, 1820, \u00a7 2, c. 22, 3 Stat, 545, which adopted \u201cthe middle of the main channel of the Mississippi river\u201d as the eastern boundary of that State, and the Wisconsin Enabling Act of August 6, 1846, c. 89, 9 Stat. 56, which referred to \u201cthe centre of the main channel of that river,\u201d employed these varying phrases as signifying the same thing. Hence we reached the conclusion (p. 13) that as between the different views as to the line of jurisdiction between neighboring States, separated by a navigable stream, the. controlling consideration \u201cis that which preserves to each State equality in the right of navigation in the river.\u201d It was accordingly adjudged and declared that the boundary line between the contesting States was \u201cthe middle of the main navigable channel of the Mississippi River;\u201d and a final decree to that effect was afterwards made, 202 U. S. 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The rule thus adopted, known as the rule of the <em>\u201cthal-weg,\u201d </em>has been treated as set at rest by that decision. <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>202 U. S. 1, 49; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>211 U. S. 127, 134; 214 U. S. 205, 215. The argument submitted in behalf of the defendant State in the case at bar, including a reference to the notable recent decision of its- Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Muncie Pulp Co. </em>(1907), 119 Tennessee, 47, has failed to convince us that this rule ought now, after the lapse of twenty-five years, to be departed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">It is said that Arkansas has interpreted the line to be at a point equidistant from the well-defined and permanent banks of the river, that Tennessee likewise has recognized this boundary, and that by long acquiesc\u00e9nce on the part of both States in 'this construction, and the exercise of jurisdiction by both in accordance therewith, the question should be treated as settled. The reference is to certain judicial decisions, and two acts of legislation. In <em>Cessill </em>v. <em>State </em>(1883), <em>40 </em>Arkansas, 501, which was a prosecution for unlicensed sale of liquors upon a boat anchored off the Arkansas shore, it was held that the boundary line, as established by the original treaties and since observed in federal legislation, state constitutions, and judicial decisions was the \u201cline along the river bed equidistant from- the permanent and defined banks of the ascertained channel on either side.\u201d This was followed in subsequent decisions by the same court. <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>State </em>(1912), 104 Arkansas, 140, 143; <em>Kinnanne </em>v. <em>State </em>(1913), 106 Arkansas, 286, 290. The first pertinent decision by the Supreme Court of Tennessee is <em>State </em>v. <em>Muncie Pulp Co. </em>(1907), 119 Tennessee, 47, in which a similar conclusion'was reached, partly upon the ground that it had been adopted by the courts of Arkansas. The legislative action referred to consists of two acts of the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee (Acts 1903, p. 1215, c. 420; Acts 1907, p. 1723, c. 516), each of which authorized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>appointment of a commission to confer and act with a like commission representing the State of Arkansas to locate the line between the States in the old and abandoned channel at the place that we now have under consideration; and the Act of 1907 further provided that if Arkansas should fail to appoint a commission, the Attorney General of Tennessee should be authorized to institute a suit against that State in this court to establish and locate the boundary line. These acts, far from treating the boundary as a line settled and acquiesced in, treat it as a matter requiring to be definitely settled, with the cooperation of representatives of the sister State if practicable, otherwise by appropriate litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The Arkansas decisions had for their object the establishment of a proper rule for the administration of the criminal laws of the State, and were entirely independent of any action taken or proposed by the authorities of the State of Tennessee. They had no particular reference to that part of the river bed that was abandoned as the result of the avulsion of 1876; on the contrary, they dealt with parts of the river where the water still flowed in its ancient channel. The decision of the Supreme Court of Tennessee in <em>State </em>v. <em>Muncie Pulp Co., </em>119 Tennessee, 47, sustained the claim of the State to a part of the abandoned river bed which, by the rule of the <em>thalweg, </em>would be without that State. The combined effect of these decisions and of the legislation referred to, all of which were subsequent to the year 1876, falls far short of that long acquiescence in the practical location of a common boundary, and possession in accordance therewith, which in some, of the eases has been treated as an aid in setting the question at rest. <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>4 How. 591, 638, 639; <em>Indiana </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>136 U. S. 479, 510, 514, 518; <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Tennessee, </em>148 U. S. 503, 522; <em>Louisiana </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>202 U. S. 1, 53; <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>217 U. S. 1, 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Therefore we find it unnecessary to decide whether the supposed agreement between the States respecting the boundary would be valid without the consent of Congress, in view of the third clause of \u00a7 10 of Art. 1 of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The next and perhaps the most important question is as to the effect of the sudden and violent change in the channel of the river that occurred in the year 1876, and which both parties properly treat as a true and typical avulsion. It is settled beyond the possibility of dispute that where running streams are the boundaries between States, the same rule applies as between private proprietors, namely, that when the bed and channel are changed by the natural and gradual processes known as erosion and accretion, the boundary follows the varying course of the stream; while if the stream from any cause, natural or artificial, suddenly leaves its old bed and forms a new one, by the process known as an avulsion, the resulting change of channel works no change of boundary, which remains in the middle of the old channel, although no water may be flowing in it, and irrespective of subsequent changes in the new channel. <em>New Orleans </em>v. <em>United States, </em>10 Pet. 662, 717; <em>Jefferis </em>v. <em>East Omaha Land Co., </em>134 U. S. 178, 189; <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>143 U. S. 359, 361, 367, 370; <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>196 U. S. 23, 34-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">There is controversy with respect to the application of the foregoing rule to the particular circumstances of this case. It is insisted in behalf of the State of Tennessee that since the rule of the <em>thalweg </em>derives its origin from the equal rights of the respective States in the navigation of the river, the reason for the rule and therefore the rule itself ceases when navigation has been rendered impossible by the abandonment of a portion of the river bed as the result of an avulsion. In support of this contention we are referred to some expressions of Vattel, Almeda, Moore, and other writers; but we deem them inconclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>sive, and are of the opinion, on the contrary, that the contention runs counter to the settled rule and is inconsistent with the declarations of this court, in <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>143 U. S. 359, 367, that \"avulsion would establish a fixed boundary, to wit: the.centre of the abandoned channel,\u201d or, as it is expressed on page 370, \"the boundary was not changed, and it remained as it was prior to the avulsion, the centre line of the old channel,\u201d and in <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>196 U. S. 23, 36, that the boundary line \"must be taken to be the middle of the channel of the river as it was prior to such avulsion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">It is contended, further, that since the avulsion of 1876 caused the old river bed to dry up, what is called \"the doctrine of the submergence and reappearance of land\u201d must be applied, so as to establish the ancient boundary as it existed at the time of the earliest record, in this case the year 1823, with the effect of eliminating any shifting of the river bed that resulted from the erosions and accretions of the half century preceding the avulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">This contention is rested chiefly upon a quotation from Sir Matthew Hale, <em>De Jure Maris, </em>c. 4: \"If a subject hath land adjoining the sea, and the violence of the sea swallow it up, but so that yet there be reasonable marks to continue the notice of it; or though the marks be defaced; yet if by situation and extent of quantity, and bounding upon the firm land, the same can be known, though the sea leave this land again, or it be by art or industry regained, the subject doth not lose his propriety; and accordingly it was held by Cooke and Foster, M. 7 Jac. C. B., though the inundation continue forty years.\u201d (1 Hargraves\u2019 Law Tracts, 15; Note to <em>Ex parte Jennings, </em>6 Cow. 542.) To the same effect, 2 Roll. Abr. 168, I. 48; 7 Comyns\u2019 Dig., tit. Prerogative, D. 61, 62; 5 Bacon\u2019s Abr., tit. Prerogative, B. 1. A reference to the context shows that the portion quoted is a statement of one of several exceptions to the general rule that any increase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>of land <em>per reliction'em, </em>or sudden recession of the sea, belonged of common right to the King as a part of his prerogative. It amounts to no more than saying that where the reliction did but restore that which before had been private property and had been lost through the violence of the sea, the private right should be restored if the land is capable of identification. Such a case was <em>Mulry </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>100 N. Y. 424, the true scope of which decision was pointed out in <em>In re City of Buffalo, </em>206 N. Y. 319, 326, 327. But this doctrine has no proper bearing upon the rule we have stated with reference to boundary streams. Certainly it cannot be regarded as having the effect of carving out an exception to the rule that where the course of the stream changes through the operation of the natural and gradual processes of erosion <em>fhd </em>accretion, the boundary, follows the stream; while if the stream leaves its former bed and establishes a new one as the result of an avulsion, the boundary remains in the middle of the former channel. An avulsion has this effect, whether it results in the drying up of the old channel or not. So long as that channel remains a running stream, th\u00e9 boundary marked by it is still subject to be changed by erosion and accretion; but when the water becomes stagnant, the effect of these processes is at an end; the boundary then becomes fixed in the middle of the channel as we have defined it, and the gradual filling up of the bed that ensues is not to be treated as an accretion t\u00f3 th\u00e9 shores but as an ultimate effect of the avulsion; The emergence of the land, however, may or may not follow, and it ought not in reason to have any controlling effect upon the location of the boundary line in the old channel. To give to it such an effect is, we think, to misapply the rule quoted from Sir Matthew Hale.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">How the land that emerges on either side of an interstate boundary stream shall be disposed of as between public and private ownership is a matter to be determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>according to the law of each State, under the familar doctrine that it is for the States to establish for themselves such rules of property as they deem expedient with respect to the navigable waters within their borders and the riparian lands adjacent to them. <em>Pollard\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Hagan, </em>3 How, 212, 230; <em>Barney </em>v. <em>Keokuk, </em>94 U. S. 324, 338; <em>Hardin </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>140 U. S. 371, 382; <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby, </em>152 U. S. 1, 40, 58; <em>St. Anthony Falls Water Power Co. </em>v. <em>Water Commissioners, </em>168 U. S. 349, 358; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Lattig, </em>227 U. S. 229, 242. Thus, Arkansas may limit riparian ownership by the ordinary high-water mark; <em>(Railway </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>53 Arkansas, 314, 323; <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Driver, </em>61 Arkansas, 429, 435, 436;) and Tennessee, while extending riparian ownership upon navigable streams to ordinary low-water mark, and reserving as public the lands constituting the bed below that mark <em>(Elder </em>v. <em>Burrus, </em>25 Tennessee, [6 Humph.] 358, 368; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Nance, </em>40 Tennessee [3 Head], 649, 650; <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>83 Tennessee [15. Lea], 209), may, in the case of an avulsion followed by a drying up of the old channel of the river, recognize the right of former riparian owners to be restored to that which they have lost through gradual erosions in times preceding the avulsion, as she has done in <em>State </em>v. <em>Muncie Pulp Co., </em>119 Tennessee, 47. But these dispositions are in each case limited by the interstate boundary, and cannot be permitted to press back the boundary line from where otherwise it should be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">It is hardly necessary to say that <em>State </em>v. <em>Muncie Pulp Co., supra, </em>and <em>Stockley </em>v. <em>Cissna, </em>119 Fed. Rep. 812, relied upon in defendant\u2019s answer as judicial determinations of the boundary line, can have no such effect against the State of Arkansas, which was a stranger to the record in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Upon the whole case we conclude that the questions submitted for our determination are to be answered as .follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>(1) The true boundary line between the States, aside from the question of the avulsion of 1876, is the middle of the main channel of navigation as it existed at the Treaty of Peace concluded between the United States and Great Britain in 1783, subject to such changes as have occurred since that time through natural and gradual processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">(2) By the avulsion of 1876 the boundary line between the States was unaffected, and remained in. the middle of the former main channel of navigation, as above defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">(3) The boundary line should now be located according to the middle of that channel as it was at the time the current ceased to flow therein as a result of the avulsion of 1876.</p>\n<p id=\"A1v\">(4) A commission consisting, of three competent persons, to be named by the court upon the suggestion of counsel, will be appointed to run, locate, and designate the boundary line between the States at the place in question in accordance with the above principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">(5) The nature and extent of the erosions and accretions that occurred in the old channel prior to its abandonment by the current as a result of the avulsion of 1876, and the question whether it is practicable now to locate accurately the line .of the river as it then ran, will be referred to said commission, subject to a review of its decision by this court if need.be.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The. parties may submit the form of an interlocutory decree to carry into effect the above .conclusions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
