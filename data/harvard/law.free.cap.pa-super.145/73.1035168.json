In it she provided, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-10\">\u201cSecond \u2014 I hereby direct that all my real estate situated at 1121 Liverpool St., twenty-first ward, N. S. Pittsburgh, Pa., shall be sold as soon as possible at the best price than can be secured, and that the payment of all my debts and funeral expenses, and the erection of an appropriate monument be paid for from my estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-11\">\u201cThird \u2014 I give to my son, Andrew E. Douds, the sum of $2,000 to be paid from the amount received from the sale of my real estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-12\">\u201cFourth \u2014 I give to my son, Oliver A. Douds, the sum of $2,500 to be paid from the amount received from the sale of my real estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-13\">\u201cFifth \u2014 I give to Dr. D. N. Bulford the sum of $1,000 to be paid from the amount received from the sale of my real estate.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>All her residuary estate she bequeathed to her daughter, Agnes M. Bulford.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-4\">The real estate of testatrix was sold February 9, 1940 and the proceeds are insufficient to pay the legacies with interest. It is argued that the legacies are demonstrative and the interest is payable from other assets. The intention of the testatrix determines whether a legacy is specific or demonstrative; <em>Walls v. Stewart, </em>16 Pa. 275; <em>Balliet\u2019s Appeal, </em>14 Pa. 451. By very clear and unequivocal language testatrix limited the payment of the legacies to \u201cthe amount received from the sale of my real estate.\u201d Where real or personal property is devised or given to be sold, and the proceeds are to be paid to a certain named person or persons, the legacy is specific; <em>Moore v. Gilbert, </em>287 Pa. 102 relying on <em>Kenworthy\u2019s Estate, No. 1, </em>52 Pa. Super. 152; 28 R. C. L. 290; <em>Torchiana\u2019s Estate, </em>292 Pa. 470; <em>Earle\u2019s Estate, </em>331 Pa. 23. This is true not only when the entire proceeds of the sale are to be paid to certain persons, but also when only a part thereof is to be so paid; <em>Devine\u2019s Estate, </em>10 Dist. 273; <em>Schott\u2019s Estate, </em>11 D. &amp; C. 373. In an exhaustive discussion of English and American cases entitled \u201cSpecific Legacies of Unspecific Things,\u201d by Philip Mechem in 87 Penna. Law Review 547, 572 (1939) it is concluded that a \u201cdirection to sell lands and pay from the proceeds so much is usually treated as specific; a gift of so much, to be paid from the proceeds of land to be sold is usually demonstrative.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">The rule is well established that legacies should bear interest from the time they are payable. This time is to be ascertained from the intention of the testator, <em>Mayer\u2019s Estate, </em>319 Pa. 289, and when he fails to express that intention, the time is fixed by statute. Sec. 21 of the Fiduciaries Act of 1917, P. L. 447, expressive of the previously existing law, provides that interest on all pecuniary legacies shall begin to run from the expiration of one year from the date of death of testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>tor with the exception that interest on a legacy to a widow or child of testator shall run from the date of death, unless a contrary intention appear by will. Where, as in this case, a testator directs a sale of his real estate and the payment of certain legacies from the proceeds, the cases hold he has shown an intention that the legacies should not bear interest until they are payable, to wit, the date when the sale is effected; <em>Gunning\u2019s Estate, No. 3, </em>234 Pa. 148; <em>Hoskinson\u2019s Estate, </em>268 Pa. 447. The instant sale took place February 9, 1940; hence interest should run only from that date.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-3\">Since the legacies are specific and the proceeds of sale are insufficient to pay them in full, they should abate <em>protanto. </em>An abatement to be proportionate should include interest but where the legacies are all of the same character, the interest will be disregarded; 69 C. J. 2197. However, counsel for the residuary legatee has stated that the legacies, but not the interest, may be paid in full from the general estate as appears by the testimony, page 19:</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-4\">\n<em>\u201cThe Court:</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-5\">It appears that the legacies are payable from a fund which is insufficient to pay them in full, and consequently no interest can be allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-6\">\n<em>\u201cMr. Thompson:</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-7\">It is about $300 short, as far as making up the value of the amount of the legacies is concerned. We are willing to let them come out of the residue but we are opposed to paying interest.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-8\">Accordingly the legacies should be paid in full with no consideration to the interest due thereon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-9\">Exceptions to supplemental decree dismissed, before Trimble, P.
