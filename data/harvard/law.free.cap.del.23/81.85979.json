Hayes </em>and <em>George N. Davis, </em>pray the Court to instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\">1. That the Court charge the jury, as in the case of <em>Betts vs. The Wilmington City Railway Company </em>(3 <em>Pennewill, </em>450), as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-7\">\u201cWe find the duty of such <em>common </em>carrier to its passengers nowhere better expressed than in one of the decisions of our own State\u2014viz., <em>Flinn vs. P., W. &amp; B. R. R. Co., 1 Houst., </em>469\u2014 which is the leading case in this State on the subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-8\">\u201cThe Court there says: \u2018A common carrier of passengers is liable for injuries to the latter only in case of his negligence. But the law in its beneficence will not allow any trifling with the lives or personal safety of human beings, and therefore exacts great care, diligence and skill from those to whose charge as common carriers they are committed; common carriers of passengers are responsible for any negligence resulting in injury to them, and are required in the preparation, conduct and management of their means of conveyance, to exercise every degree of care, diligence and skill which a reasonable man would use under such circumstances. This obligation is imposed on them as a public duty, and by their contract to carry safely, as far as human care and foresight will reasonably admit. A railroad company, using as it does the powerful and dangerous agency of steam, is bound to provide skillful and careful servants, competent in every respect for the posts they are appointed to fill in their service.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-9\">The motive power in that case was steam, but the rule and the reason of the case apply equally to the cases at bar where the motive power was- electricity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-10\">2. The rule is that where a disease caused by' an injury received through defendant\u2019s negligence supervenes, as well as where the disease exists at the time of the injury, and is aggravated by it, the plaintiff is entitled to full compensatory damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-11\">3. Where one is injured by the fault or omission of another, and in consequence thereof becomes diseased or in delicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>health, the disease is considered the proximate, although not the natural, consequence of the injury, and the party may be allowed to recover compensation therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">4. That the Court charge the jury, as in the case of <em>Lynch's Executrices vs. Wilmington City Railway Company </em>(see p. 192), that if their verdict should be for the plaintiff, Etta B. Baldwin\u2019s administrator, it should be for such sum of money as would have reasonably compensated Etta B. Baldwin, if living, for her pain and suffering by reason of the injuries complained of, from the time she received such injuries to the time of her death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\"><em>5. </em>That in the case of the father, Lewis F. Baldwin, he would be entitled to recover such sum of money as would reasonably compensate him for money expended for medicines, for physicians\u2019 bills and for the loss of wages of Etta B. Baldwin, growing out of and resulting from the accident.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">6. That the plaintiff, Lewis F. Baldwin, can recover, if the jury should find for him, for loss of\u25a0 wages of Etta B. Baldwin up until the time she would have arrived at the age of twenty-one years, had she lived, or during her minority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-8\">Defendant\u2019s Prayers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-9\">The defendant, by its counsel, <em>Robert H. Richards, </em>prays the Court to instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-10\">1. This case is based upon the alleged negligence of the defendant. Negligence can never be presumed in such cases as this, but must always be proved. The burden of proving negligence, as attributable to the defendant, rests upon the plaintiff _</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-11\"><em>Queen Anne\u2019s R. R. vs. Reed, 5 Pennewill, </em>231.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-12\">2. There can be no recovery in this case unless it be proved to the satisfaction of the jury that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was injured in the manner alleged in the narr by reason of such an accident as is described in the narr, and was occasioned by defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-13\">3. If the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was not injured by the accident referred to in the narr, he cannot recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>4. Even if the accident described in the narr was caused by defendant\u2019s negligence, the said plaintiff cannot recover for any . injuries alleged to have been sustained by Etta Baldwin, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, unless such injury or injuries are shown to the satisfaction of the jury to have been the natural and probable consequence of the said negligence, and were, such injuries as ought to have been foreseen by the defendant in the light of the attending circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-6\">5. In order to warrant a finding that negligence is the proximate cause of an injury, it must appear that the injury was the natural and probable consequence of the negligence and that it ought to have been foreseen in the light of the attending circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-7\"><em>Schaffer vs. Railroad Company, </em>105 <em>U. S. </em>249.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-8\">6. The plaintiff cannot recover for any injuries proved to have been sustained by Etta Baldwin except such as are shown to have been the natural and probable consequences of the defendant\u2019s negligence and as ought to have been foreseen by the defendant in the light of the attending circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-9\">7. The plaintiff cannot recover in this cause for the effects of any disease or diseases contracted after the accident, unless such disease or diseases is or are clearly shown to have been the natural and probable consequences of the defendant\u2019s negligence, and was or were such as ought to have been foreseen by the defendant in the light of the attending circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-10\">8. For the effects of any disease or diseases, contracted after the accident by reason of a new and independent cause intervening between the accident (or the original injury caused thereby, if any), and the condition resulting from the disease, the defendant is not liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-11\">9. If the tuberculosis from which Etta Baldwin suffered for a long time prior to her death was caused by her vitality having been so reduced, by an injury resulting from defendant\u2019s negligence, as to make her unable to throw off the germs of tuberculosis which attacked her through the lungs, the defendant would not be liable for any pain, suffering, loss of earning power or loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>of services due to the tuberculosis, because the reception into the lungs of the germs of tuberculosis would be a new and independent cause, intervening between the original injury and the result, for which the defendant would not be liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-5\">10. If the jury should find for the plaintiff in No. 24 May Term, 1907, they can allow damages only for the pain and suffering caused to plaintiff\u2019s intestate in her life time by injuries which were the natural and probable consequences of the defendant\u2019s negligence only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-6\">11. If the jury should find for the plaintiff in No. 24 May Term, 1907, they cannot allow damages for the pain and suffering caused to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate by any injuries or diseases which were not the natural and probable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligence, or which were the result of any cause intervening between defendant\u2019s negligence and such injuries or diseases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-7\">12. If the jury should find for the plaintiff in No. 30 September Term, 1907, they can allow as damages only the pecuniary value to the plaintiff of the services of Etta Baldwin during that portion of her minority when she was rendered unable to work by reason of such injuries as were the natural and probable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligence, together with such expenses as were proved to have been incurred by the plaintiff for nursing, medicines and medical attendance in connection with such last-mentioned injuries only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-8\">13. In no event can damages be allowed except such as result directly from the negligent act of the defendant. Damages produced by other agencies than those causing the injury, or even by agencies remotely connected with those causing the injury, cannot be awarded as proximate or proper compensation, but only where the injury flows from the negligent act as its natural concomitant, or as the direct result thereof. Where speculation or conjecture has to be resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the injury results from the negligent act or from some other cause, then the rule of law excludes the allowance of damages for such injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-9\">6 <em>Thompson on </em>Negligence, <em>Sec. </em>7193.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>14.

One of the actions was brought by Etta B. Baldwin, the deceased, in her lifetime to recover damages for her pain and suffering from injuries alleged to have been caused by the defendant company in so negligently running one of its trolley cars from Brandywine Springs to this city, that in taking a sharp curve, at Cleveland and Lancaster avenues, the deceased was thrown from the car and so injured that she suffered great pain and finally died from tuberculosis or consumption as the result of her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The specific negligence relied upon is the excessive and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>dangerous rate of speed at which the car was running at the time of the accident, and also the inexperience and incompetence of the motorman who was running the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">After the death of Etta B. Baldwin her administrator, Lewis F. Baldwin, was made party plaintiff in her stead, and is now prosecuting that case. He is not, however, seeking to recover damages for the death of Etta B. Baldwin, but only damages for her pain and suffering resulting from the injuries she sustained on account of the said accident and negligence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u2022 The other case which you are trying was brought by Lewis F. Baldwin, the father of Etta B. Baldwin, to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by him on account of the loss of his daughter\u2019s services, and expenses incurred by him in the effort to cure her, occasioned by the injuries she received in the said accident, and which he alleges were caused by the negligence of the defendant. Neither is it sought in this case to recover damages for the death of Etta B. Baldwin, but only such damages as the father suffered on account of the loss of his daughter\u2019s services, and expenses incurred in attempting to cure her.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The father is entitled to the services of a minor child, and if such services were lost or impaired by the negligence of the defendant, the father is entitled to be reasonably compensated for such loss or impairment. But even if the defendant is liable, by reason of its negligence, for such loss of services, a recovery can be had only for such a sum as the evidence shows the father actually sustained on account of the injuries complained of caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence, and not for any loss of services caused by affliction, sickness, disease or anything else that did not result from the accident and defendant\u2019s negligence. In estimating the value of the daughter\u2019s services to the father you may consider her earnings and ability to labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">It is admitted that the defendant company was at the time and place of the accident lawfully operating by electricity, the car that caused the accident; that it was a common carrier at the time, engaged in the business of transportation of passengers for hire, and also that Etta B. Baldwin was a passenger on the defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>A common carrier of passengers is liable for injuries to the latter in case of the carrier\u2019s negligence. The law exacts great care, diligence and skill from those to whose charge as common carriers passengers are committed. They are responsible for any negligence resulting in injury to passengers, and are required in the preparation, conduct and management of their cars or means of conveyance to exercise every degree of care that a reasonable man would use under like circumstances. But while the common carrier is held to strict care in the safe transportation of its passengers, it must nevertheless be borne in mind that it is not an insurer of their safety, but responsible only for its own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">These actions are based upon negligence which has often been defined by this Court to be the want of ordinary care, that is, the want of such care as a reasonably prudent and careful man would use under similar circumstances. It is for you to determine from the evidence whether there was any negligence that caused the accident, and if there was, whether it was the negligence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">To entitle the plaintiffs to recover at all it must have been shown to your satisfaction by a preponderance of the evidence, that the negligence which caused the accident and injuries, if any there were, was the fault of the defendant company. The burden of proving such negligence rests upon the plaintiff, and the defendant can be held liable only for such negligence as constituted the proximate cause of the injuries complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The term ordinary care, when applied to the management of railway cars in motion, imports all the care which the peculiar circumstances of the place or occasion reasonably require, and this will be increased or diminished according as liability of danger and accident, and injury to others, is increased or diminished in the movement and management of such cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">It is the duty of a railway company to keep its cars under proper control, to slow up where danger is imminent, and where by so doing accident could be avoided. It is also its duty to have, in the management of its cars, careful and competent servants.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">In order for the plaintiff in either of the cases before you to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>recover at all, it must have been proved to your satisfaction (1) that Etta B. Baldwin was injured; (2) that she was injured in the manner alleged in plaintiff\u2019s declaration, that is, by being thrown from the car, and not otherwise; (3) that defendant\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of the injuries complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The plaintiffs cannot recover in either case for the effect of tuberculosis or any other disease contracted after the accident, unless it is satisfactorily shown to the jury that such disease was the natural and probable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\"><em>Brown vs. Craven, </em>175 <em>Ill. </em>413.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Nor can there be any recovery for the effects of any disease contracted before the accident unless the jury are clearly satisfied from the evidence that such disease was aggravated or increased by the negligent act of the defendant, and even then recovery could be had only to the extent that such effects were so aggravated or increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\"><em>R. R. Co. vs. Heecht, </em>115 <em>Ind., </em>443; and numerous cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">We say to you, therefore, that no recovery can be had for the effects of any disease contracted or suffered by Etta B. Baldwin which was not the natural and probable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">The question always is, was there an unbroken connection between the wrongful act and the injury\u2014a continuous operation; did the facts constitute a continuous succession of events so linked together as to make a natural whole, or was there some new and independent cause intervening between the wrong and the injury? Unless the evidence of the plaintiff is sufficient to show the connection between the immediate cause of the death and the injury received the plaintiff cannot recover for the effects or consequences of the disease that caused the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\"><em>Weber vs. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 12 N. Y. App. Div., Sup.Ct., </em>514.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">In no event can damages be allowed except such as resulted directly from the negligent act of the defendant. Damages pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>duced by other agencies than those causing the injury cannot be awarded as proper compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">6 <em>Thomp. on Neg., Sec. </em>7193.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">It is now for you, gentlemen, to carefully consider all the evidence in each of the cases before you and reach such verdict as your judgment and consciences will approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">If you should find in favor of the plaintiff in the case brought by Etta B. Baldwin for pain and suffering, your verdict should be for \"such a sum as would be a reasonable compensation for her pain and suffering from the injuries complained of caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">If you should find in favor of the plaintiff in the case brought by Lewis F. Baldwin, the father of Etta B.Baldwin, for the loss of services and expenses incurred, your verdict should be for such a sum as you believe from the evidence would have been the pecuniary value to the plaintiff of the services of his daughter during her minority when rendered unable to work by reason of injuries caused by defendant\u2019s negligence, together with such expenses as were proved to have been incurred by the plaintiff for medicines and medical attendance in connection with such injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">If you are not satisfied that the defendant company was guilty of any negligence that caused the injuries complained of your verdict in each case should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">Verdict for the plaintiff, in the case of Etta B. Baldwin\u2019s Administrator, for $900.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">Verdict for the plaintiff, in the case of Lewis F. Baldwin, for $600.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
