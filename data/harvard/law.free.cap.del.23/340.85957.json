That there is a material variance between the allegations in the information and the proof in the cause, it being alleged in the information that the defendant had a hearing and examination, and it not appearing by the evidence that such hearing and examination were in fact had.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-11\">2. It being alleged in the information that an examination and hearing were held, it is incumbent on the State to prove said allegation, as set forth in said information, in order that the Attorney-General may file said information and in order that the Court may entertain jurisdiction of the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-12\">6. That the first count charges an offer to pay money, and there is no proof whatever in this cause that the defendant made any <em>offer </em>to pay any money or other valuable thing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>(At this point Court adjourned to Friday morning, April 9, 1909, at 10 o\u2019clock, at which time argument upon the above prayers of defendant\u2019s counsel was heard, after which the Court rendered the following decision):</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-5\">Spruance, J.We may as well dispose of the sixth proposition now. Looking at the bail bond we see that this man was held to bail to the charge of offering or promising to pay, etc. It is admitted that this information could charge no other offense than an offense for which he was held to bail\u2014that is agreed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-6\"><em>Mr. </em>Reinhardt:\u2014Yes sir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-7\">Spruance, J.:\u2014But that the information might charge either the offering or the promising to pay\u2014either the one or the other. This count, which is the only one remaining in the information, is this: It charges that he did unlawfully offer to pay, etc. The question is whether the evidence before us sustains that allegation. Various language was used, but the sum and substance of it was that the accused, Barr, said to Hall, \u201cIf you will vote the Republican ticket I will pay you twenty dollars after the polls have closed.\u201d The question is, is that an offer to pay him (Hall) money, and is there or can there be any doubt that it was an offer? What more could you have to constitute an offer than that? This constitutional provision does not require an acceptance of the offer. The offer would be sufficient if a man would say, \u201cI will pay you twenty dollars if you will vote the Republican ticket,\u201d and the proposition was immediately rejected,\u2014the offer would be complete. Certainly there is no tender needed to make an offer. The ordinary way of making an offer is not by a tender of the money, and we do not see any difficulty about this at all. We think that the evidence in the case sustains the allegations of the information, and that it is most clearly an offer to pay money, and we therefore overrule that objection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-8\">The first and second objections relate to the same subject, viz.: the hearing and examination required before an information can be filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-9\">The proposal to change the method of trial in election cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>as first made in the Constitutional Convention did not provide for any preliminary proceedings before filing an information.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-5\">The Convention determined that it would not be safe to permit the Attorney-General to file an information of this kind without a preliminary examination which should in some degree be a substitute for the action of a grand jury, and it was therefore provided that prosecutions of this character should be \u201con information filed by the Attorney-General, after examination and committment or holding to bail by a Judge or Justice of the Peace.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-6\">This preliminary proceeding is absolutely necessary to enable the Attorney-General to file the information, but it is no part of the offense charged. In this case the information alleges that there was this preliminary examination. There is no direct proof that there was an examination or waiver of it, but there is a bail bond signed by the defendant and his sureties, in which he undertook to appear to answer'the charge set forth in the bond. That bond has been put in evidence without objection. It does not refer to any examination or any. of the preliminary steps. The question is, what is our duty, having that before us alone? Is there any reason why we should depart from the rule which is well established, that the aption of a public officer is presumed to have been within the scope of his authority until the contrary appears? If there was no preliminary examination, or no waiver of such examination, the defendant might have proved it, but this was not done. The Justice of the Peace had no right to take that bail bond without a preliminary examination or a waiver of it. Are we to infer that he took it outside of his jurisdiction, without a preliminary examination? We must infer that whatever was necessary as a preliminary to taking that bond, was done; the taking the bond being the act of a public officer,we will not presume that he violated his oath and took it without a preliminary examination. The proper method of raising the question whether there was a preliminary examination would be by a plea in abatement or plea to the jurisdiction, setting forth that there was no such preliminary examination\" or waiver of it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>and therefore the Attorney-General\u2019 had no right to file the information, or perhaps by motion to quash, before the trial, supported by affidavit. We do not think that the pending motion is the proper way to raise this question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-5\">The information alleges that there was a preliminary examination, but our courts have held that an immaterial allegation need not.be proved as a distinct fact. For these reasons we are of the opinion that neither the first nor the second objection of the defendant can be sustained at this time, and we overrule them both.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-6\">(Whereupon the Court announced its verdict to be that it found the defendant guilty.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-7\"><em>Mr. </em>Reinhardt:\u2014I wish to give notice of an appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-8\">Spruance, J.:\u2014We will defer the sentence until next Wednesday, April 14, 1909, and that will give you the opportunity to prepare your bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-9\">(On Wednesday, April 14, 1909, <em>Mr. Reinhardt </em>of counsel for defendant, moved for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, for the following reasons, among others, to-wit):</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-10\">1. The verdict rendered in the trial of said cause is a nullity, and no valid judgment can be rendered thereon, since said defendant was never arraigned and was never called upon to plead in said cause, and never did enter a plea therein, either before or during the progress of the trial of said cause or at any other time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-11\">2.

It does appear from the record in said caus\u00e9 that there was no issue joined in said cause, either by arraignment and plea or by the waiver of arraignment and plea, and therefore said trial was invalid, and said verdict rendered therein was a nullity, and no valid judgment can be rendered thereon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-13\">Spruance, J.As to the fact whether there was or was not any plea entered, is that admitted by the State?</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number><em>Mr. </em>Whiley:\u2014Nothing is admitted by the State.

From your recollection, can you state whether or not there was any plea of any kind entered by the defendant, Barr, in the case which the Court has tried?</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-10\">A. I am quite sure there was not, and if I had heard such a thing I would have entered it on the book.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-11\"><em>Mr. </em>Reinhardt:\u2014I have been counsel for Mr. Barr'from the time of the filing of the information, and I can state that neither my client nor myself for him has ever entered any plea on his behalf.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-12\"><em>Mr. </em>Layton:\u2014I can state that in the absence of Mr. Reinhardt, neither singly nor together, have we ever entered any plea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-13\">Sfruance, J..\u2014Our minds are very clear upon this subject. It is argued on behalf of the State that we ought not to entertain this motion \u00e1t this time, because the defendant, after the verdict was rendered against him, gave notice of an appeal. So he did, but he has not taken this appeal yet and judgment was suspended, we say very properly, because we did not, under the circumstances, think it was the proper thing to send a man to jail before he could have an opportunity to enter his appeal, and therefore we suspended this sentence until to-day, of which the State had full notice, and we expected the State to be represented here, if necessary, by the Attorney-General.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-14\">No appeal has been taken. The first step in that direction has not been taken. That was to be done to-day. Now they come into Court and bring to our attention the fact that there was no plea in this case of any sort, either before or during the trial, nor since the trial for that matter, and we have heard the statement of counsel for the defendant that he did not discover-that until after the trial was over.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>Mr. </em>Reinhardt:\u2014I found it out at the noon recess of the first day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-5\">Spruance, J.:\u2014We have the admission of the Attorney-General that there was no plea at any time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-6\"><em>Mr. </em>Whiley:\u2014The admission of the Attorney-General was that there was no formal plea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-7\">Spruance, J.:\u2014We understand the Attorney-General to admit that neither before, nor during, nor since this trial, was there any plea of any kind either by this defendant or by his counsel. And we have the testimony of the Deputy Clerk of the Peace that he has made a careful examination of the record and he finds no record of any plea of any kind. We have, in addition to that, the statement that to the best of his recollection there was never any plea of any kind, and he further supplements it by the statement that he believes he would remember if there had been any plea, and the fact that there never was any plea we take, both by admission and by proof, to be established.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-8\">We are of the opinion that that was absolutely essential, that there could be no valid trial except upon an issue joined, and there was no issue joined in the way the law requires. That being so, we feel that we would not be warranted in entering final judgment against this defendant, and we are of the opinion that a new trial should be granted, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-9\">The defendant was again placed on trial at the October Term, 1909, in and for Sussex County, before Pennewill, Chief Justice, and Woolley and Hastings, Associate Judges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-10\">The evidence adduced at said trial was substantially the same as at the first trial, except that a new witness was produced by the State, viz., William J. Wilson, who was unimpeached, and testified that he heard the conversation between the defendant and the prosecuting witnesses, Jonathan P. Hall and Benjamin B Morris, in Georgetown, near the Eagle Hotel,about tweleve o\u2019clock, on election day, November third, 1908, as follows: \u201cI went over where Barr was talking with them, and I stopped right behind him, and I heard him say to Hall\u2014I don\u2019t know whether he was talking to Morris or not\u2014but he said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u2018 you go vote, and I will give you twenty dollars. \u2019 Hall and Morris then went off; and Mr. Barr being a neighbor of mine, I thought they would get him in trouble, and I touched him on the shoulder and said \u2018come here,\u2019 and he turned around and walked about three steps. I said \u2018you are going to get yourself in trouble; you come and leave them boys alone.\u2019 He said \u2018 I am 21 years old,\u2019 and he said something else, but I cannot remember what the other words were at this time. That is all I know about it, and I wish I did not know that.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-5\">(When the testimony on both sides was completed, the Court held the matter under advisement over night, and upon the reconvening of the Court.on the following morning, rendered the following judgment) :</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b362-6\">Pennewill, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"Ajz\">After a most careful consideration of the evidence in this case, we are unanimously of the opinion that the defendant should be convicted. And we are also unanimously of the opinion, and have so determined, that under all the facts and circumstances of the case as disclosed by the evidence, the payment of a fine of six hundred dollars, which we consider substantial, together with the costs of prosecution, which are heavy, would be a proper and adequate punishment and meet the demands of justice in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">We adjudge the defendant guilty and are prepared to impose the sentence indicated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
