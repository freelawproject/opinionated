Solomon <em>vs. </em>Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad Company, a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Delaware.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b29-5\">\n<em>Personal Injuries\u2014Railroad Company-\u2014-Street Railway\u2014-Duty of Passenger-\u2014Obstruction in Street made by Railroad Company\u2014Negligence\u2014Independent Contractor\u2014Motion for a Nonsuit.</em>\n</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b29-6\">1. The right given to a railroad company to construct an elevated road and to bridge over a public street of the city, carries with it the right to place in said street such temporary posts or pillars as are necessary and proper for the construction of such elevated road and bridge, not needlessly interfering with the use of said street as a public highway and not dangerous to the public travel thereon by street railway or otherwise.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b29-7\">2. If the post or pillar which caused the injury to the plaintiff was dangerously and unnecessarily near to the track of the street railway, the defendant would be responsible for injuries occasioned thereby, without the fault of the injured person, whether the same was erected by the defendant or its servants or agents, or by some other person or persons, provided in the latter case that the defendant suffered the same to remain an unreasonable tim',e after it had due notice or knowledge of the dangerous character of the erection.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b29-8\">3. Where a corporation is duly authorized to build a bridge over a city street, and, as incident thereto, has the right to place temporary structures in said street, such right must be exercised with such care and diligence as not to endanger unnecessarily the lives and property of the public while using such street as a public highway, and the failure to exercise such care and diligence is negligence.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b29-9\">4. Where there is an obstruction in a public street,whether lawfully or unlawfully, the traveler is bound to use reasonable care and diligence to avoid injury from such obstruction and his faiulre to do so is negligence. What constitute such reasonable care and diligence will depend upon the facts of each particular case.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b29-10\">5. If the danger is open and apparent, such as the plaintiff knows, or might know by the reasonable use of his senses, and he fails to act as a reasonably prudent man would or should act under such circumstances, he is guilty of negligence. On the other hand, if the danger was not known to the plaintiff, and he could not have discovered it by the exercise of reasonable care, a less degree of care and diligence is required of him.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b29-11\">6. The presumption that a public street is safe for ordinary travel, applies only to those who have no knowledge or reasonable means of knowledge that it is unsafe.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b29-12\">7. It is negligence for a passenger upon a moving street car unncessarily to expose his person, or any part thereof, beyond the exterior line of such car, or beyond the outer edge of the running-board.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b29-13\">8. The running-board of a street car, in so far as it concerns passengers, is intended for the purpose of furnishing a means of ingress and egress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>to and from the car; and if a passenger unnecessarily walks upon such running-board while the car is in motion, and while so doing is struck and injured by a post or pillar standing far enough fropi the track to allow the car to freely pass it, such passenger is guilty of negligence.</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b30-5\"><em>(January </em>24, 1906.)</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b30-6\">Lore, C.

That as Ryan and Kelly were the contractors who were in charge of the elevation of the defendant company\u2019s tracks, said contractors, and not the defendant, were responsible for any accident or injury to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-9\"><em>Second. </em>That there was contributory negligence (or assumption of risk) on the part of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-10\">The Court, after hearing argument, refused the nonsuit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s Prayers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-12\">1. That roads are made for public convenience, and when one is established as a public road, if there be any unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>obstruction of it whatever, it is a nuisance, indictable as such; and if such obstruction causes special damage to a particular person, he may have his private action for the injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-5\"><em>Johnson vs. Stayton, </em>5 <em>Harr., </em>449.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-6\">2. That if the jury believe from the evidence in this case that Third Street, at the time this accident happened, was a public street of the City of Wilmington, and that the defendant erected or caused to be erected in the bed of that street, pillars, \u25a0without having legal authority to so use the bed of that street, then such use of that street would amount to an unlawful obstruction of the same and would be a nuisance, and for any special damages resulting therefrom to the plaintiff, he would be entitled to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-7\"><em>Elliott on Roads and Streets, Secs. </em>645, 651; 16 <em>A. &amp; E.

The ground of this action is negligence, and not nuisance. Where the construction of a public highway is not in itself unlaw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ful, not a public nuisance, then the ground of liability is not the commission of a public nuisance, but the failure to use reasonable care and skill in the exercise of the lawful right of occupying the street.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-4\"><em>Thompson on Neg., Vol. </em>1, <em>Sec. </em>1188.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-5\">5.

If there be danger open and apparent in the street, of which the plaintiff knows, and the plaintiff, with his eyes open, using not ordinary care, is injured thereby, he has no right to recover, for he contributed to his own injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-8\">When a man is guilty of an act which causes his injury, though another be first liable of causing the danger, and by reason of want of ordinary care on his part takes the risk; being fully warned',.\u2014he is guilty of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-9\"><em>Cook vs. Wil.

Whether the said post or pillar was erected or placed in said street by the defendant company, or (which is the same thing) by its servants or agents or any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">2. \u2022 Whether the said post or pillar, if erected by some person or persons other than the defendant, its servants or agents, was, after due notice or knowledge of that fact, suffered and permitted by the defendant to remian where it had been thus erected.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">3. Whether the said post or pillar was erected or placed dangerously and unnecessarily near to the said street railway track.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>These questions are to be determined by you from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">If said post or pillar was dangerously and unnecessarily near to the track of said street railway, the defendant would be responsible for injuries occasioned thereby, without the fault of the injured person, whether the same was erected by the defendant or its servants or agents, or by some other person or persons, provided in the latter case that the defendant suffered the same to remain an unreasonable time after it had due notice or knowledge of the dangerous character of the erection.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Where a corporation is duly authorized to build a bridge over a city street, and as incident thereto, has the right to place temporary structures in said street, such right must be exercised with such care and diligence as not to endanger unnecessarily the lives and property of the public while using such street as a public highway, and the failure to exercise such care and diligence is negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The plaintiff cannot recover unless it has been proved to your satisfaction by a preponderance of the evidence that the injuries to the plaintiff were caused by the negligence of the defendant company. Such negligence is not to be presumed, but must be proved to your satisfaction to entitle the plaintiff to recover, and the burden of proving such negligence is upon the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">If you shall be satisfied from the evidence that the defendant was guilty of negligence as charged, the plaintiff cannot recover in this action if he himself was guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident in which he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">Such negligence of the plaintiff is not to be presumed, and the burden of proving it is upon the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">Where there is an obstruction in a public street, whether lawful or unlawful, the traveler is bound to use reasonable care and diligence to avoid injury from such obstruction, and his failure to do so is negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">What constitutes such reasonable care and diligence will depend upon the facts of each particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">If the danger is open and apparent, such as the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>knows, or might know by the reasonable use of his senses, and he fails to act as a reasonably prudent man would or should do under such circumstances, he is guilty of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">On the other hand, if the danger was not known to the plaintiff and he could not have discovered it by the exercise of reasonable care, a less degree of care and diligence was required of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The presumption that a public street is safe for ordinary travel applies only to those who have no knowledge or reasonable means of knowledge that it is unsafe.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">It is negligence for a passenger upon a moving street car unnecessarily, to expose his person, or any part thereof, beyond the exterior line of such car, or beyond the outer edge of the running-board.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">The running-board of a street car, so far as concerns passengers, is intended for the purpose of furnishing a means of ingress and egress to and from the car; and if a passenger unnecessarily walks upon such running-board while the car is in motion, and while so doing is struck and injured by a post or pillar standing far enough from the track to allow the car to freely pass it, such passenger is guilty of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">We decline to instruct you to return a verdict for the defendant as requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">If your verdict shall be for the plaintiff it should be for such sum as will reasonably compensate him for his injuries, including his loss of time, his pain and suffering in the past and such as he may hereafter endure as the result of his injuries, and for his permanent injuries, and the impairment of his ability to perform the duties of his usual occupation, and such reasonable expenses as he may have incurred in endeavoring to be cured of his injuries</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">The jury disagreed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
