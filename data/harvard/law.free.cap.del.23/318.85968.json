The-Court, after hearing argument of counsel upon said motion, directed a nonsuit, which the plaintiff, declined to accept; thereupon the Court directed the jury to render a verdict for defendant.

From the facts established in the case, the collision of the \u201cUlrica\u201d steaming under the power of her engines head-on against a heavy, strongly built barge, which was tied up at a wharf a slight distance beyond the wharf at which the \u201cUlrica\u201d intended to land (the \u201cUlrica\u201d at the time of the collision traveling at a speed which the jury might well find was from four to five miles per hour); That th\u00e9 plaintiff was a passenger on the \u201cUlrica\u201d in the exercise of due care; That the collision was so violent that it knocked down a great many of the passengers of the \u201cUlrica,\u201d some of whom, at the time of being knocked down, were standing and some of whom were sitting; That the collision damaged some of the baggage or freight aboard the \u201cUlrica,\u201d left a dent or mark on the barge, and caused the mate of the \u201c Ulrica\u201d a concern to examine the boat to see if she were damaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>by the impact; That the crash was so great as to hurl the plaintiff and his mother \u201cviolently\u201d to-the floor, bruising the mother, and very seriously injuring the plaintiff,\u2014all establish most clearly that it cannot be held that the violence of the collision was no more than the ordinary gentle, orderly touching of a steamboat when landing at-a wharf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-4\">The fact stands out in this case that the accident was caused, not from the boat striking or touching the wharf with such a degree of force as is ordinarily necessary in making a landing, but from a head-on collision with a barge which from \u201csome hook or crook\u201d she \u201cfetched up into.\u201d It is common knowledge that steamboats do not land \u201chead-on\u201d like a ferry-boat, but land side-ways to the wharf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-5\">The allegations of the declaration were not demurred to&gt; and every essential fact, which is necessary to establish the case of the plaintiff, as alleged in the declaration was proven at the trial, and in the absence of any defence, those facts, for the purpose of this case, must be taken to be true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-6\">(Counsel for the defendant made an oral argument in opposition to the above contentions.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-7\">After considering the above arguments of counsel, the Court set aside the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-8\">At the conclusion of the testimony of a witness for plaintiff, at the second trial, respecting the bent condition of the smokestack of the steamer \u201cUlrica\u201d and as to certain repairs that were made to the same under the superintendence of said witness, after the accident, the Court said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-9\">Boyce, J.:\u2014It seems to the Court, after hearing all the evidence of this witness, that it is so mixed up with immaterial and irrelevant matters in connection with the repairs of the smokestack, that it should go out. The witness says he made the first examination of the smokestack in July, which was before the accident happened. The alleged collision had not then occurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-10\"><em>Mr. </em>Higgins:\u2014I should argue, if your Honors please, very strongly against that disposition of this evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Boyce, J.:\u2014The witness does not know what caused the bent condition of the stack. He does not know whether it was caused by the collision,; or that it was not bent before the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-5\"><em>Mr. </em>Higgins:\u2014That is somebody else\u2019s testimony. Unobjected testimony has gone in, and cross examination upon it, and it is toolate, I respectfully submit, for it to be stricken out. I think it is both material and important to complete the story as to this accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">Boyce, J.:\u2014True it is that much of the witness\u2019s testimony which we now deem irrelevant and immaterial was given without objection but the Court may very properly of its own motion, strike such testimony out, whenever it shall deem it its duty to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-7\"><em>Mr. </em>Higgins:\u2014Will the Court hear me as to its being irrelevant, before you strike it out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-8\">Boyce, J.:\u2014Yes. If this testimony is permitted to remain in, it would doubtless open the door for other irrelevant testimony in reply. The object of this testimony was to further show the bent condition of, the smokestack immediately after the alleged collision. That the stack was bent then has already been shown by two other witnesses. The testimony of the witness now on the stand is simply supplemental of testimony already in, but it is mingled throughout with matters both irrelevant and immaterial, and in such a manner that we think it should be stricken out, and we so order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-9\"><em>Philip Reybold, </em>a witness for the defendant, who qualified as a licensed master and pilot, showing that he had had experience in handling steamboats on the Christiana River and elsewhere, and was acquainted with the steamer \u201cUlrica,\u201d was asked by <em>Mr. Hayes </em>the following questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-10\">Q.

It is admitted that the defendant company was a common carrier, engaged in the business of conveying passengers on its steamboat, the \u201cUlrica,\u201d and that the plaintiff was rightfully a passenger on the steamboat \u201c Ulrica\u201d at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-9\">2. \u201cCommon carriers of passengers are responsible for any negligence resulting in injury to them, and are required in the preparation, conduct and management of their means of conveyance, to exercise every degree of care, diligence and skill, which a reasonable man would use under such circumstances. This obligation is imposed on them as a public duty, and by their contract, to carry safely, as far as human care and foresight will reasonably admit. A steamboat company, using as it does the powerful and dangerous agency of steam, is bound to provide skillful and careful servants, competent in every respect for the posts they are appointed to fill in their service; and is responsible not only for their possession of such care and skill, but also for the continued application of these qualities at all times.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-10\"><em>McAllister vs. Peoples Ry., </em>4 <em>Penn. </em>272-276; <em>Flinn vs. P., W. &amp; B.

If you find that the servants of the defendant company permitted the steamboat \u201cUlrica,\u201d upon which the plaintiff was a passenger, to run into and strike a boat or barge, which was, at the time of being struck, tied up to a wharf in the Christiana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>River, it not being contended in this case that there was any <em>vis major </em>causing a collision, which a proper display of nautical skill might not have prevented, then we are not called upon to inquire wherein the steamboat \u201cUlrica\u201d was not managed with proper nautical skill. This inquiry is superfluous where the collision was caused by a vessel having the power to move or stop at pleasure in a channel of sufficient breadth without any superior force compelling her to the place of collision. The fact that, in these circumstances, the steamboat did collide with the barge is conclusive evidence that she was not properly managed and that the defendant company was negligent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\"><em>The Granite State, </em>3 <em>Wall. </em>310; <em>The Bridgeport, </em>14 <em>Wall. </em>116; <em>Cummins vs. Spruance, </em>4 <em>Harr. </em>315.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-6\">4.

They should take into consideration the probable and possible lessened ability of the plaintiff to earn a livelihood resulting from the said injury and including in their verdict damages for such sum as the plaintiff but for such injuries would probably have earned in his business during life, taking into consideration his age, his ability, disposition to labor and habits of living and expenditure.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The jury must be guided by their own good sense in awarding damages, in the case of an injury to an infant, for the reason that the pecuniary injuries for which recovery is had are always difficult of precise proof, uncertain and problematical, and what should be a proper compensation must always, upon such proof as can be made, be left to the sound judgment of the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-5\"><em>Birkett vs. Knickerbocker Ice Co., </em>110 <em>N.

The law exacts great care, diligence and skill from those to whose charge as common carriers passengers are committed.

We decline to instruct you to find for the defendant as requested. We submit the case to you for your determination whether, under all the evidence produced before you, the injuries complained of were, or were not, the result of the negligence of the defendant company.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The declaration contains five counts. The first three counts are substantially the same. The first count in part is as follows: The plaintiff avers that heretofore, to-wit, on the 15th day of August, A. D. 1907, at New Castle County aforesaid, the said defendant so negligently and carelessly ran and operated its said steamboat Ulrica, upon which the said plaintiff was a passenger for hire, that, in consequence thereof, the said boat collided with or struck a barge, lying in the said Christiana River, thereby causing the said plaintiff, who was then and there in the exercise of due care and caution on his part, to be violently thrown and hurled from the lap or arms of his mother, Ella C. Duggan, who was then and there holding the said plaintiff, to and upon the floor or deck of the said boat, together with his said mother, Ella C. Duggan; that by means of the premises, the said plaintiff was struck and injured in his right arm and fore-arm, whereby the said plaintiff suffered complete paralysis of the muscles of the said arm and fore-arm, so that the plaintiff is wholly unable to use the said arm or fore-arm, and other parts of the body of the said plaintiff were greatly bruised, lacerated and injured, to-wit, at New Castle County aforesaid; and also by means of the premises, the said plaintiff became and was 'sick, sore, lame, disordered and injured, and so remained and continued for a long space of time, to-wit, hitherto, during all of which time the said plaintiff suffered and underwent great pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The fourth and fifth counts are substantially the same. The fourth count avers in part that \u201cwhile the said steamboat was approaching the said landing or wharf, and when about to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>stop thereat, the said defendant so negligently and carelessly and recklessly ran and operated the said boat, that it then and there struck another boat, then and there lying near the said landing or wharf; that the said steamboat owned and operated by the said defendant as aforesaid, and upon which the said plaintiff was a passenger as aforesaid, was suddenly and violently stopped, whereby the said plaintiff, who was then and there, at the special instance and request of the said defendant, riding as a passenger on the said defendant\u2019s boat, and in the exercise of due care and caution on his part was violently thrown and hurled, with his mother, Ella C. Duggan, who was then and there holding the plaintiff upon her lap, upon the floor or deck of the said boat, whereby, the fingers of the said Ella C. Duggan, who had her left hand caught in the plaintiff\u2019s armpit on his right side at the time when the said plaintiff and the said Ella C. Duggan were thrown as aforesaid, were caused to compress with great force and violence certain of the nerves of the plaintiff\u2019s right arm, and whereby, the nerves of the plaintiff\u2019s arm were greatly and permanently injured, bruised, disordered and shattered, and the right arm of the said plaintiff became paralyzed\u201d * * * \u201cand was then and there permanently injured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The defendant company contends that it exercised reasonable and proper care and caution in the movement and-management of its steamboat in approaching its wharf, in this City and at the time of the accident. You have heard the testimony. We shall not attempt any review of it. You have it all before you, and you are the exclusive judges of its weight and value.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Whether a particular accident was the result of negligence, and whose negligence, if any, is a question of fact for the determination of the jury from all the evidence. Negligence is never presumed. It must be proved. It is the want of ordinary care, \u2014such care as a reasonably prudent and careful person would exercise under similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Reasonable care when applied to the control and management of a steamboat in motion, imports all the care which the particular circumstances of the place and occasion reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>require, and this will be increased or diminished according as the liability of danger and accident, and injury to others, is increased or diminished in the movement and management of such a boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The burden of proving negligence rests upon the plaintiff. And it must be proved to the satisfaction of the jury by a preponderance of the evidence\u2014that is, by the greater weight and value of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">It is, therefore, incumbent upon the plaintiff to satisfy you from the evidence adduced that the accident complained of was caused by the negligent conduct and management, on the part of the defendant company, as alleged, to entitle him to a recovery in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">This Court has held that \u201cCommon carriers of passengers are responsible for any negligence resulting in injury to them, and are required in the preparation, conduct and management of their means of conveyance, to exercise every degree of care, diligence and skill, which a reasonable man would use under such circumstances. This obligation is imposed on them as a public duty, and by their contract, to carry safely, as far as human care and foresight will reasonably admit.\u201d A steamboat company is bound to provide skillful and careful servants, competent in every respect for the posts they are appointed to fill in their service; and is responsible not only for their possession of such care and skill, but also for the continued application of these qualities at all times.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">A steamboat company is not, however, an insurer of the safety of its passengers, but it is required to exercise the highest degree of care and diligence that is reasonably practicable in-securing their safety, by keeping its boat under the control and management of skilled and competent servants. There is, at the same time, a duty resting upon the passenger to act with prudence, and to use the means provided for his safe transportation; with reasonable circumspection and care, and if his negligent act contributes to bring about the injury of which he complains, he cannot recover. (4 <em>Penn. </em>276).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">That the defendant\u2019s steamboat, on which, it is alleged, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>infant plaintiff was a passenger with his mother, ran against and struck a barge tied near the defendant\u2019s wharf when approaching the wharf, is not controverted. And it is for you to determine from the evidence whether the injuries complained of were the result of the collision and, if so, whether the collision was due to negligence, on the part of the defendant company, in the movement and management of its steamboat at the time of the accident without the fault or negligence of the infant\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Where there is conflict in the testimony, you should reconcile it if you can. If you cannot, you should give credit to and be governed by the testimony, which, in your judgment, is most worthy of belief, taking into consideration the intelligence, apparent truthfulness, bias and impartiality of the witnesses. The weight and value of the evidence so determined by you is to be your guide in reaching your verdict. And governed by this instruction, you should decide this case in whose favor there is a preponderance of the evidence. (4 <em>Penn. </em>278).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">If you find that the accident was not the result of the defendant\u2019s negligence, your verdict should be for the defendant. If-you find that the accident was the result of the negligence of the defendant, your verdict should be for the plaintiff and for such a sum as will, in your judgment, reasonably compensate him for all his injuries, including his pain and suffering in the past and such as may c@me to him in the future from the accident, and also for such permanent injuries as may impair his ability to earn a living and perform the ordinary functions and duties of life. But in this matter you are to be governed not by mere speculation or conjecture, but by the evidence before you.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Verdict for plaintiff for $3,350.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
