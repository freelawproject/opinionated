This was an action of assumpsit to recover seventy-five dollars for professional services rendered by plaintiff as attorney for James Dilworth in his lifetime. A bill of particulars was filed. Defendants, at the trial, admitted the death of James Dilworth and the granting of letters testamentary upon his estate to the parties named in the action as defendants. Also that the plaintiff was, at the time of rendering the services alleged, and still is, an attorney duly admitted and licensed to practice in the courts of Delaware.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">The plaintiff produced his book of original entries showing his account against James Dilworth, deceased, upon which his action was based. The account was offered in evidence, but was objected to by counsel for defendants as inadmissible, it being a transaction with the deceased.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b63-7\">Boyce, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJD\">delivering the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">By <em>Section </em>11, <em>Chapter </em>107, <em>Rev. Code </em>(1893) page 799, it is provided that \u201ca book of original entries, regularly and fairly kept, shall, together with the oath, or affirmation, of the plaintiff, be admitted in evidence to charge the defendant with the sums therein contained for goods sold and delivered, and other matters properly chargeable in an account.\u201d This action is against the executors of a deceased person against whom the alleged book entries were made. By <em>Section </em>1, <em>Chapter </em>537, <em>Volume </em>16, <em>Laws of Delaware, Chapter </em>107, <em>Rev. Code </em>(1893) <em>page </em>798, it is provided \u201cthat in actions or proceedings by or against, executors, administrators or guardians in which judgment or decree may be rendered for or against them, neither party shall be allowed to testify against the other as to any transaction with or statement by the testator, intestate or ward unless called to testify thereto by the opposite party.\u201d We do not think the plaintiff is compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>tent to testify \u201cas to any transaction with or statement by the testator,\u201d in this action. We sustain the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">At the close of the case, Boyce, J., in his charge, reviewed the facts in the case and the contentions of counsel, and submitted the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Verdict for defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
