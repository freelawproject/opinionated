Many of these duties are not absolute in their nature, but are rather entrusted to the judgment and discretion of the municipal authorities. Duties of this character are commonly referred to in the cases as legislative and judicial or discretionary duties. Under this head are included'all those duties that involve deliberation, judgment, and discretion in their exercise, whether the result attained by that exercise is the accomplishment of purposes public and governmental or private and municipal. As to such duties the corporation is not bound in the first instance to act at all, nor is it, if it proceeds to act, liable for negligence in their performance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-12\">3: The Act creating the Board of Park Commissioners provides that the Board shall have authority to open public parks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>for the promotion of the health and recreation of the people of Wilmington and its vicinity. The preservation of the public health is the duty of the State and the Board of Park Commissioners act onjy for the State. The duty is therefore governmental.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-5\">4: Liability of a superior or employer for the acts of his servant or agent rests upon the right of the former to select his own servant or agent; to discharge him if he proves to be not competent, or skillful, or well behaved; to determine his duties; and to direct and control him while engaged in the performance of them. This broad right is the whole foundation of the doctrine of <em>respondeat </em>superior. If such right does not exist in any particular case, the defendant cannot properly be regarded as the superior of the person who caused the damage, and this doctrine, therefore, can have no application to it. A municipal corporation as a superior or employer occupies a unique position. Though an agent or official may derive his appointment from it, and be engaged in the performance of its duties, he may nevertheless not be its agent within the above rules. The ultimate question in every case appears to be: What was the nature of the duty in the performance of which the negligent agent or official was engaged at the time of the injury or damage ? Was it a public, governmental duty imposed by the Legislature upon such official when selected by the corporation? If it was, the universal rule is that the relation of superior and agent does not exist and that consequently the <em>maxium,\u2014respondeat </em>superi- or does not apply. The general principle is well settled that where a corporation elects or appoints an officer in obedience to. an act of the Legislature, who is to perform some public service in which the corporation itself has no privat\u00e9 interest, and from which it derives no special advantage in its corporate capacity, such officer is not to be regarded as an agent of the corporation for whose negligence or want of skill it can be held responsible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\">. In every such cas\u00e9 the officer is a purely public official, whose functions are the performance of governmental duties, which are imposed and defined by the Legislature and not by the corporation. The power of the latter in the premises is exhausted when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>it has appointed or elected the officer. His official tenure and the manner of performing his official duties are independent of the will of the corporation and are determined by the provisions of the act of the Legislature under which he was appointed or elected. It necessarily follows from this that there is no ground upon which the corporation can fairly be considered as the superi- or of such officer, and so liable for his <em>tortuous </em>acts. This rule certainly has application to the case at bar. The Board of Park Commissioners is an independent Board. It has absolute jepntrol over the parks and no other City Department; not even the Council, the Legislative body of the City, can interfere with or control it. The Water Commissioners cannot lay pipes in the. parks without the consent of the Board of Park Commissioners, nor can any other City Department perform any work relating to municipal improvement in the parks without the consent of the Board of Park Commissioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-4\">The following cases all support one or more of the propositions above set forth:</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">4 <em>Dillin Mun.

Upon said Board as an agency of the City, rests the duty to maintain and care for said parks, and with such duty arises a corresponding liability for a failure or neglect in its performance.</em>\n</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-7\">In order that the State may perform its functions, it is necessary for it to be. represented by agencies of government, but where these agencies merely <em>perform governmental functions </em>of the <em>State </em>and acquire no individual existence, to hold them responsible for negligence\" would manifestly be the same as hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>ing the <em>sovereign power </em>answerable. Such unincorporate agencies occupy the same position as the State itself, and are protected by the principle which gives freedom of responsibility to the State; but when any State agency becomes a corporation, it thereby acquires an individuality distinct from the soverign power, and the principle stated does not prevent the incorporate body from being held liable for its own negligence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\">Every incorporate municipality therefore is of a dual character; on the one hand, it is an agency of the State performing governmental and political duties, and on the other it has a distinct individuality with personal privileges and rights, which give rise to personal requirements, duties and responsibilities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">There is no question that a municipal corporation is not liable for the exercise of govermental powers and duties, such as keeping the peace, enforcing laws and ordinances, preserving the public health, preventing fires, caring for the poor, and carrying on a system of education.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-7\">But where the State imposes a ministerial duty on a distinct municipality or where such duty arises from the common relations of life, it must be carefully discharged, and if there is a failure to exercise reasonable care, the corporation will be liable for the damage occasioned thereby. The most prominent illustration of this duty is the obligation which rests upon municipalities to keep their highways in reasonably safe condition for use and to keep drains and sewers in a similar condition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-8\"><em>Jones on Negligence of Municipal Corporations, Sec. </em>19, 42-43.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-9\">In Massachusetts and the States which have followed its lehd, the decisions hold that for any negligence in the performance of these municipal duties, the city is not liabl'e in the absence of express statutes; an examination of the early decisions in these States will show that the entire doctrine, is built upon the case of <em>Russel vs. Men of Devon. </em>2 <em>T. Rep. </em>667. For the purpose of understanding the theory on which these cases are decided and to show that these cases and the cases which follow them have no authority in this State and other' States, which take the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>view of the municipal liability for negligence as prevails in Delaware, it is necessary to consider briefly the growth, of the doctrine in England and in this country which is generally designated as the Massachusetts Doctrine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-4\">In the case of <em>Thomas vs. Sorrel, Vaughan </em>330-340, which was decided in the latter half of the 17th century, the law is announced as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-5\">\u201cAnd note, if a man have particular damage by a foundrous way, he is generally without remedy, though the nuisance is to be punished by the King. The reason is because the foundrous way, a decayed bridge or the like, are given over to be repaired by some Township, Vill, Hamlet or a County,'which are not corporate, therefore no action lies against them for a particular damage; but if a particular person or body corporate be to repair a certain highway or bridge, and a man is endamaged by the foundrousness of the way or the decay of the bridge, he may have his action against the person-or body corporate.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-6\">This .case clearly set out the common law liability in England of municipal corporations for negligence and the reason why unincorporated bodies ofthe State such as. counties are not liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-7\">The case of <em>Russel vs. Men of Devon </em>above referred to was an action of an individual against the inhabitants of a county for damages received from neglect to keep a bridge in repair. The Court decided that the action was not maintainable, on the ground that it was not brought against anyone capable of being sued, the county being an unincorporated subdivision of the State; and therefore said decision simply re-established the rule recognized by Chief Justice Vaughan above quoted, but is in no sense an authority for the doctrine that an incorporated municipality or governmental agency would not be liable for damages. In England the subsequent decisions fully establish the principle that an action can be maintained against a public corporation for damages suffered by reason of neglect of such corporation to carefully discharge its duties such as keeping highways in safe condition, although no such action is given by statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>Kent vs. Worthington Local Board L. R. </em>10 <em>Q. B. D. </em>121; <em>Bourough of Bath-hurst vs. MacPherson, L. R. App. Cas. </em>256; <em>Hartnell vs. Ryde Commissioners, </em>4 <em>B. S. </em>361.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\">In the case of <em>Riddle vs. Prop, of Lock, </em>7 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>169, the Court says: \u201cAlthoughmunicipal corporations are liable to information for neglect of a public duty, yet is is settled in thfe case of <em>Russel vs. Men of Devon </em>that no private action can be maintained against them for a breach of their corporate duty, unless action be given by statute. \u201cAnd practically similar language is used in the case of <em>Mower vs. Leicester, </em>9 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>247.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-6\">It is thus seen that the Massachusetts cases and the doctrine growing out of them are not even properly based upon the English cases and proceed upon such ground that they cannot be regarded as any authority in this State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-7\">The manifest injustice and hardship of the situation arising from these decisions led Massachusetts and the other State following its lead to undertake to rectify the situation by passing statutes expressly making municipal corporations liable for damages resulting from neglect of the municipality with respect to sewers and streets. These statutes are collected and commented on by <em>Dillon on Municipal Corporations, Volume </em>2, <em>Section </em>1000, <em>etc.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-8\">Owing to the fact that at the time these statutes were passed public parks were of little importance, they were not included within the terms of the statutes. Therefore the States which have passed these statutes hold that a municipal corporation is not liable for injuries arising from neglect of the municipal corporation with respect to parks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-9\">It will be found that practically all the cases which can be cited in support of the demurrer of the defendant in this case arise in States where the liability of a municipal corporation is fixed by statute and do not arise,as in this State, from the recognized common law liability of municipal corporations, and therefore are entirely without authority in this State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-10\">The existence of the common law implied liability for negligence of a municipal corporation in discharge of its ministerial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>duties is now recognized as the true rule by a large majority of the States and by the Courts of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-4\"><em>Jones on Negligence of Municipal Corporations, Sec. </em>53.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">In this State no authorities need be cited to show that the City is liable for damages arising from the neglect of the City to keep its streets and highways in repair, as such liability is fixed by an unvarying line of decisions, and this arises from the common law implied liability, that where a power is given and a duty imposed a corresponding liability arises for the exercise of that power and the discharge of that duty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\"><em>Magarity vs. City of Wilmington, </em>5 <em>Houst. </em>530; <em>Benson vs. Mayor and Council, </em>9 <em>Houst. </em>359; <em>Seward vs. Mayor and Council, 2 Marvel </em>189; <em>Colburn vs. City of Wilmington, </em>4 <em>Pennewill </em>443.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-7\">Though no case has been decided in this State which determines the liability of the City for neglect in the care or maintenance of a park, yet the liability of the City for injuries resulting from defects in the streets, arises under the administration of the streets by the Street and Sewer Department, which is a distinct Board or agency created by the Legislature by <em>Act passed April </em>20, 1887, <em>Laws of Delaware, Volume </em>18j <em>page </em>352, <em>etc., </em>which is given the power over the streets theretofore possessed by the City.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-8\">The Board of Park Commissioners was created by the <em>Act passed at Dover, March </em>13, 1883, <em>Laws of Delaware, vol. </em>17; <em>page </em>404, wherein it appears that the powers of the City over the parks exercised through the said Board of Park Commissioners are practically the same as the powers of the City over the streets exercised through the Board of the Street and Sewer Department, and therefore the liabilities which arise from the exercise of this power, are not only analogous, but practically identical.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-9\">The Legislature in the Act creating the Board of Park Commissioners did not impose a mandatory or arbitrary burden upon the City of Wilmington as an agency or a division of the State in the exercise of its governmental functions, but conferred a privilege upon the City as a municipal corporation which it was at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>liberty to exercise or not.
