Gaster, who was civilly committed under the South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator Act, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition, properly construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000) petition.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Gaster has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b873-18\"> Although Gaster originally filed the petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, because he challenged the constitutionality of a state civil commitment, the magistrate judge properly characterized it as a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
