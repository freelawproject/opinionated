We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm substantially <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Griffin v. Virginia, </em>No. CA-02-930-7 (W.D.Va. Dec. 17, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b890-19\"> We affirm Griffin's challenges to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim that prison officials opened his incoming legal mail outside of his presence on the ground that the prison\u2019s emergency mailroom procedure was reasonably related to legitimate penological interests. <em>See Turner v.
