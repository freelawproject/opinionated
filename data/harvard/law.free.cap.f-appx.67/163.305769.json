EdmundsonSullivan raises several claims of error regarding matters that either were not raised in the district court or involve defendants that are not parties to the ease on appeal. Matters raised for the first time on appeal generally will not be considered. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993). Exceptions to this rule are made only in those limited circumstances that would result in unrecognized plain error or a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>Neither of these factors is present in Edmundson-Sullivan\u2019s claims. Because Edmundson-Sullivan presents no other cognizable claims for review, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
