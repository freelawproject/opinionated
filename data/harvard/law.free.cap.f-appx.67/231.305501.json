Terry\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), representing that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the district court abused its discretion by revoking Terry\u2019s supervised release and imposing a nine-month sentence. Terry has filed a pro se supplemental brief arguing that his underlying conviction was not valid, and therefore the subject nine-month revocation sentence is also invalid. Finding no meritorious issues and no error by the district court, we affirm the revocation order and the nine-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-21\">In light of Terry\u2019s admission that he committed the alleged violations of his supervision, we find no abuse of discretion by the district court in revoking Terry\u2019s supervised release and imposing a nine-month sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2003); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-22\">Terry seeks to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support his underlying conviction for wire fraud. \u201c[A] supervised release revocation proceeding is not the proper forum in which to attack the convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tion giving rise to the revocation.\u201d <em>United States v. Hofierka, </em>88 F.3d 357, 363 (11th Cir.1996); <em>see United States v. Thomas, </em>934 F.2d 840, 846 (7th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have independently reviewed the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly we affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking Terry\u2019s supervised release and imposing a nine-month sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be fi-ivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
