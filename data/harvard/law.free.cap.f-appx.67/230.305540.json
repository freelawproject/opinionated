On appeal, he challenges the four-level enhancement he received for using the firearm in connection with another felony offense, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2002), a fact not charged in the indictment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Hardy contends that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>580 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), any fact that increases the sentencing guideline range must be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. However, <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated when the sentencing court makes factual findings that increase the guideline range but the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). In this case, the statutory maximum was ten years. We note that, although Hardy raised the legal issue at sentencing, he did not contest the fact that he used the gun to shoot another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Because the issue raised here lacks merit, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
