In January 2003, the district court entered an amended judgment for correction of sentence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 36 to include an omitted reference to an order of forfeiture. Thomas now appeals the amended criminal judgment, claiming that the district court exceeded the scope of Rule 36 in amending the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">Rule 36 provides that \u201c[a]fter giving any notice it considers appropriate, the court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d We have reviewed the transcript of the sentencing hearing and the order of forfeiture that was executed by the district court at the hearing, and find that the court properly amended the judgment to accurately reflect its intention at sentencing to include the forfeiture in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the amended criminal judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
