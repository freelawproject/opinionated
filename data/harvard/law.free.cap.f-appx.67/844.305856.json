An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>The district court granted a certificate of appealability with respect to May\u2019s claim that the North Carolina short-form indictment for murder violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Upon our review, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying relief for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See May v. Miller, </em>No. CA-02-374-5-BO (E.D.N.C. Jan. 22, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">May also claims that his constitutional rights were violated when the trial court denied a request for a jury instruction as to an alleged agreement between the State and a defense witness, and that evidence of this agreement was suppressed and misrepresented by the State to the jury and defense counsel. As to this claim, we have independently reviewed the record and find that May has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss as to this claim. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
