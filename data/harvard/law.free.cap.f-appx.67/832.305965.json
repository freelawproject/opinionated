Porter asserts the district court erred in giving a jury instruction regarding \u201cdeliberate ignorance\u201d and in denying his motions for acquittal, to interview jurors, for a bill of particulars, and mistrial. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">First, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to give a \u201cdeliberate ignorance\u201d instruction. <em>See United States v. Abbas, </em>74 F.3d 506, 513 (4th Cir.1996) (providing standard of review). Porter argues the United States\u2019 evidence, if believed, indicated Porter had actual knowledge the property in question was stolen. However, we have consistently held that such an instruction is proper when there is evidence of both actual knowledge and deliberate ignorance, <em>see id., </em>and we conclude there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support either theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">Second, Porter\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal is misplaced. Porter argues the testimony of two cooperating co-conspirators was so contradictory as to render their entire testimonies incredible. However, when reviewing the denial of a motion for acquittal, this Court considers only whether there is substantial evidence which, taken in the light most favorable to the United States, would permit a jury to find that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. MacCloskey, </em>682 F.2d 468, 473 (4th Cir.1982); <em>see also Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). We do not assess the credibility of the witnesses and assume the jury resolved all contradictions in the witnesses\u2019 testimony in favor of the government. <em>United States v. Sun, </em>278 F.3d 302, 313 (4th Cir.2002). Further, the witnesses provided corroborating testimony regarding the elements underlying both counts of conviction. As a result, Porter\u2019s motion for acquittal was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">With respect to Porter\u2019s third and fourth claims, we find no abuse of discretion in either the district court\u2019s denial of Porter\u2019s motion to interview the jury, <em>see United States v. Gravely, </em>840 F.2d 1156, 1159 (4th Cir.1988) (providing standard), or Porter\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars, <em>see United States v. Jackson, </em>757 F.2d 1486, 1491 (4th Cir.1985) (providing standard). Porter\u2019s motion to interview the jury failed to provide persuasive, credible evidence of an improper outside influence on the jury\u2019s deliberations. <em>See Tanner v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 107, 125, 107 S.Ct. 2739, 97 L.Ed.2d 90 (1987). Further, a bill of particulars was not necessary, as the prosecution\u2019s investigative file was open to Porter for inspection, and Porter\u2019s motion essentially sought a detailed disclosure of the government\u2019s evidence in advance of trial. <em>See United States v. Automated </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number><em>Med. Labs., Inc., </em>770 F.2d 399, 405 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Finally, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Porter\u2019s motion for mistrial based on a testifying witness\u2019s purported comment on Porter\u2019s post-arrest silence. <em>See United States v. Dorlouis, </em>107 F.3d 248, 257 (4th Cir.1997) (providing standard). We conclude the testimony in question was an isolated, spontaneous comment that the United States did not incorporate as part of its case against Porter. In addition, the district court provided an appropriate curative instruction. <em>See Williams v. Zahradnick, </em>632 F.2d 353, 361-62 (4th Cir.1980). As a result, the district court properly denied Porter\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Porter\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the fact and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
