United </em>States, 538 U.S. 522[, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88] (2003).\u201d Todd Andrew Herbert seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). In dismissing Herbert\u2019s claim under <em>United States v. Rhynes, </em>196 F.3d 207, 238-40 (4th Cir.1999), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>218 F.3d 310 (4th Cir.2000), raised in his motion to amend the \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court relied on this court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States v. Torres, </em>211 F.3d 836, 837 (4th Cir.) <em>(rev\u2019d, Clay v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003)), by finding the claim untimely filed. Because <em>Torres </em>was overruled by <em>Clay, </em>it is now clear that Herbert\u2019s conviction was not final until after the ninety-day period of time for petitioning for a writ of certiorari had expired. <em>See Clay, </em>123 S.Ct. at 1079. Herbert\u2019s motion to amend his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>\u00a7 2255 motion was filed within one year of his conviction becoming final. Accordingly, it was timely filed, and the district court erred to the extent that it dismissed Herbert\u2019s <em>Rhynes </em>claim as untimely. As to the remaining claims disposed by the district, we find no error. However, because Herbert failed to make the appropriate showing, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">An appeal may not be taken to this court from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court on the merits absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(2) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue as to claims dismissed by a district court solely on procedural grounds unless the movant can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition [or motion] states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">As to those claims dismissed by the district court on the merits, we find Herbert fails to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d As to the <em>Rhynes </em>claim, which was dismissed solely on procedural grounds, Herbert fails to show that counsel was ineffective for failing to argue on appeal that the district court erred by providing the jury with a general verdict form.\u201d [T]he case law is clear that an attorney\u2019s assistance is not rendered ineffective because he failed to anticipate a new rule of law.\u201d <em>Kornahrens v. Evatt, </em>66 F.3d 1350, 1360 (4th Cir.1995). Thus, Herbert cannot state a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
