The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Al-Shabazz that failure to file timely objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Al-Shabazz failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-6 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Al-Shabazz has waived appellate review by failing to file objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
