Gullett was convicted following a jury trial of one count of maliciously damaging and destroying and attempting to damage and destroy by means of an explosive a building used in interstate commerce that resulted in death in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i) (2000). Gullett was sentenced to thirty-eight years in prison and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>five years of supervised release. Gullett filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion to vacate his sentence. The magistrate judge recommended dismissal of Gullett\u2019s claims. Following an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether there had been improper contact during trial between a juror and the prosecution and a prosecution witness, the district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">An order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Gullett has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
