The order affirmed, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s order denying Daniels\u2019s applications for asylum and with-holding of removal. For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-23\">Daniels first claims that the Board erred in affirming the decision of the immigration judge without opinion, after review by a single Board member, in accordance with the procedure set out in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003). We have reviewed Daniels\u2019s challenges to the Board\u2019s use of this streamlined procedure and find them to be without merit. <em>See Georgis v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 962, 2003 WL 21150848, *3 (7th Cir. May 20, 2003); <em>Mendoza v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1288-89 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1333-34 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>Cir.2003); <em>Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 375-79 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Next, Daniels challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that his asylum application was untimely and that he failed to demonstrate a change in circumstances or extraordinary circumstances excusing the late filing. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4), (5) (2003). We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft, </em>318 F.3d 1226, 1229-30 (10th Cir.2003); Moli<em>na-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Fahim v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2002); <em>Ismailov v. Reno, </em>263 F.3d 851, 854-55 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Finally, while we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) to consider Daniels\u2019s claim for withholding of removal, we find that he has waived his right to raise this claim before this court by failing to raise it in his brief on appeal before the Board. <em>See Farrokhi v. INS, </em>900 F.2d 697, 700 (4th Cir.1990) (\u201c[A]n alien who has failed to raise claims during an appeal to the [Board] has waived his right to raise those claims before a federal court on appeal of the [Board]\u2019s decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Accordingly, we deny Daniels\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
