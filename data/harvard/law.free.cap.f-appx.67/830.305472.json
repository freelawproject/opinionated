Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">The only issue in these consolidated appeals is whether the district court erred in admitting into evidence a handgun that witnesses described as consistent with the gun used in the crime. Our review is for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. </em>Queen, 132 F.3d 991, 995 (4th Cir.1997). We find that the court did not abuse its discretion and therefore affirm the convictions and sentences of each of the appellants. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
