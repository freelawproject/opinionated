Wynn, a Virginia prisoner, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to deny relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000). An appeal may not be taken from a final order in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court absent a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find both that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Wynn has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we grant Wynn\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, but we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and-legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-19\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
