The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Zamudio-Martinez to 57 months of imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release. He appeals his sentence, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-16\">For reversal, Zamudio-Martinez first argues that the district court lacked authority to sentence him under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) because the indictment charged only a violation of section 1326(a). The argument is unavailing, however, because section 1326(b) does not define a crime separate from section 1326(a). <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-18\">Zamudio-Martinez also argues that the district court should not have assessed 2 criminal history points for committing the instant offense while he was serving a term of probation, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d), because he never signed a probation contract and thus was not under a probation sentence at the time of his illegal reentry. We disagree. The district court did not err in rejecting Zamudio-Martinez\u2019s legally unsupported contention that his failure to enter into a probation contract, as required by the terms of the state-court order imposing the sentence of probation, somehow negated his probationary status. <em>See United States v. Blanton, </em>281 F.3d 771, 775 (8th Cir.2002) (district court\u2019s findings of fact reviewed for clear error; interpretation and application of Guidelines reviewed de novo).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-19\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-20\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1042-17\">.
