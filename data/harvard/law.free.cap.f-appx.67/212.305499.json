Benjamin asserts that the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal because his 1995 predicate conviction for resisting arrest was obtained without the benefit of counsel. We have reviewed the briefs and joint appendix, and we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm Benjamin\u2019s sentence for the reasons stated by the district court. (J.A. at 101-03). We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
