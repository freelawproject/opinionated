He was sentenced to death on the capital murder count and to prison terms on the other counts. The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed Walker\u2019s conviction and death sentence on direct appeal and denied Walker\u2019s petition for state habeas relief. The district court dismissed Walker\u2019s federal habeas petition and declined to grant a Certificate of Appealability (COA).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Walker now seeks a COA to bring an appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal. Specifically, he asserts that he has made the required substantial showing that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated at the guilt phase of his trial when his counsel failed to challenge his single trial for two murders, that his due process rights were violated when the Commonwealth failed to timely disclose <em>Brady </em>materials, and that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated at the sentencing phase of his trial when his counsel failed to investigate and present compelling mitigating evidence. Because reasonable jurists could debate the district court\u2019s assessment of the first two of these claims (the right to counsel at the guilt phase of trial claim and the <em>Brady </em>claim) we grant a COA as to these claims; however, upon review of their merits, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal. Because reasonable jurists could not debate the district court\u2019s assessment of the right to counsel at the sentencing phase of his trial claim, we deny a COA as to this claim and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Stanley Beale lived with Catherine Taylor and their children, Monique, Bianca, and Sidney, in the University Terrace Apartments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 22, 1996, Taylor was in the bedroom with Sidney, an infant, when she heard \u201ca boom like noise\u201d coming from the living room. As she entered the living room to investigate, she saw a man, whom she identified as Walker, kick in the locked front door. Walker was holding a gun and began yelling, \u2018Where is he?\u201d Walker then asked Beale, who was standing in the doorway of the kitchen, \u201cWhat you keep coming up to my door, what you look for me for?\u201d Beale responded that he did not know Walker and did not know where he lived. Bianca, who was 13 years old at the time, began to shout at Walker, telling him that her father did not know him. When Walker began shooting at Beale, Taylor took Bianca and Monique into the bathroom to hide. Beale was shot three times and died. Bianca testified that she knew Walker as \u201cTodd\u201d and that she identified Walker in a photospread as the person who killed her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">On the night of Beale\u2019s murder, Tameria Patterson, a fourteen-year-old girl, was visiting a friend who lived in the University Terrace Apartments. Patterson testified that she saw a man she knew as \u201cTodd\u201d enter her friend\u2019s apartment that night and say, \u201cI shot him.\u201d Patterson identified Walker in a photospread as the person who had entered the apartment and made the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Approximately seven months later, on the night of June 18, 1997, Clarence Threat and Andrea Noble were sleeping in their bedroom. They were awakened by a \u201cpop\u201d coming from the screen door, which was followed by a knock at the door. Noble went to the door and looked outside through a small window in the door, but did not see anyone. Twice more she heard someone knocking but did not see anyone when she looked out the window. Sometime after the third knock, the door was \u201ckicked open.\u201d Noble went to the living room to find a person she knew as \u201cPaul\u201d standing there with a gun. \u201cPaul\u201d pointed the gun at Noble, who backed into the bedroom. When they reached the bedroom, \u201cPaul\u201d hit Noble with the back of the gun and then shot Threat in the leg. \u201cPaul\u201d and Threat \u201cexchanged words\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>then \u201cPaul\u201d shot Threat six more times. Threat died from a gunshot wound to the chest. \u201cPaul\u201d warned Noble that if she told anyone \u201che would come back and kill [her] and [her] kids.\u201d At trial, Noble identified Walker as the person she knew as \u201cPaul.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Walker was indicted on one count of capital murder for the killings of Beale and Threat within a three-year period in violation of Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-31.1(8) (Michie 1996), on four counts of the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony in violation of Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-53.1 (Michie 1996), and on two counts of burglary in violation of Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-90 (Michie 1996). On August 31 and September 1, 1998, Walker was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond and found guilty of all charges. He was sentenced to death for the capital murder conviction, life imprisonment for each of the burglaries, and a total of 18 years imprisonment for the firearms offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">On June 11, 1999, the Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed Walker\u2019s conviction and death sentence. <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 54, 515 S.E.2d 565 (1999). The Supreme Court of the United States denied Walker\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari on January 18, 2000. <em>Walker v. Virginia, </em>528 U.S. 1125, 120 S.Ct. 955, 145 L.Ed.2d 829 (2000). On March 23, 2001, the Supreme Court of Virginia dismissed Walker\u2019s state petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The Supreme Court of the United States denied Walker\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari on October 29, 2001. <em>Walker v. True, </em>534 U.S. 1003, 122 S.Ct. 481, 151 L.Ed.2d 395 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">On February 1, 2002, Walker filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The district court dismissed Walker\u2019s petition on July 26, 2002. On September 4, 2002, the district court denied Walker\u2019s Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment and declined to grant a Certificate of Appealability (COA). Walker now seeks to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">To appeal the denial of habeas relief in the district court, a prisoner must first obtain a COA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (West Supp.2002). The first opportunity to obtain a COA is in the district court. When \u201can applicant files a notice of appeal, the district judge who rendered the judgment must either issue a certificate of appealability or state why a certificate should not issue.\u201d Fed. R.App. Pro. 22(b)(1). In the present case, the district court denied Walker a COA. Because the requirement for a COA is jurisdictional, we may not consider the merits of Walker\u2019s claims unless Walker has made the threshold showing required to obtain a COA. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (\u201cThis threshold inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims. In fact, the statute forbids it.\u201d). Thus our COA determination requires an overview of Walker\u2019s claims and a general assessment of their merits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>To obtain a COA, a petitioner must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). \u201cUnder the controlling standard, a petitioner must \u2018sho[w] that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were \u201cadequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>123 S.Ct. at 1039 (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000), which in turn was quoting <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 893 n. 4, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983)). \u201cA prisoner seeking a COA must prove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith on his or her part. We do not require petitioner to prove, before the issuance of a COA, that some jurists would grant the petition for habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1040 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u2018We look to the District Court\u2019s application of AEDPA to petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims and ask whether that resolution was debatable amongst jurists of reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1039. \u201cWhere a district court has rejected [a petitioner\u2019s] constitutional claims on the merits, ... [t]he petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong\u201d to obtain a COA. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484. Further, \u201c[w]hen the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">In his application for a COA, Walker raises three issues that were addressed by the district court. First, Walker argues that the state court\u2019s conclusion that his trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to challenge his single trial for two murders was an objectively unreasonable application of federal law. He argues that the district court used an erroneous legal standard when it denied this claim. A COA is issued on this claim because Judge Gregory finds that reasonable jurists could debate whether the district court should have resolved this claim differently.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We address the merits of the claim below.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Second, Walker asserts that the Commonwealth failed to disclose exculpatory materials in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Walker challenges the state court\u2019s decision that a portion of his <em>Brady </em>claim is procedurally defaulted and that the remainder is without merit. He argues that the district court erred by concluding that he had not shown cause for the default and by concluding that the state court\u2019s resolution of the remainder of his <em>Brady </em>claim was not an unreasonable application of federal law. A COA is also issued on this claim because Judge Gregory finds that reasonable jurists could debate whether the district court should have resolved this claim differently. We address the merits of the claim below.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Third, Walker argues that the state court\u2019s conclusion that his trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance during sentencing by failing to investigate and present compelling mitigating evidence was an objectively unreasonable application of federal law. Specifically, Walker claims that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to timely discover and effectively present school records and mental health history, failed to investigate and provide records to Dr. J. Randy Thomas of the Medical College of Virginia\u2019s Forensic Evaluation Program, Walker\u2019s court-appointed mental health expert, and failed to discover Walker\u2019s brain dysfunction. The state court, applying the two-part test for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2062, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (\u201c[T]he defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient ... [and] that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d), concluded that Walker\u2019s claim failed to satisfy the performance prong. The state court determined that counsel\u2019s delay in acquiring Walker\u2019s school records resulted from Walker\u2019s and his mother\u2019s recalcitrance, and Walker presented no evidence to the district court to rebut this conclusion. The state court also rejected Walker\u2019s claim that his counsel was ineffective by failing to further investigate Walker\u2019s organic brain damage and concluded that counsel\u2019s decision to use Walker\u2019s school records to demonstrate that Walker would respond well in a structured environment, rather than arguing that Walker suffered from an organic mental deficiency, was a reasonable trial strategy. The district court determined that the state court\u2019s decision was not an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland </em>because, as there is only one reference to possible organic brain damage in Walker\u2019s school records, Walker\u2019s counsel was justified in pursuing and preparing an alternative theory better supported by the evidence. Moreover, both the state court and district court determined that counsel\u2019s choice not to forward Walker\u2019s school records to the court-appointed mental health expert was reasonable because after he had diagnosed Walker as a sociopath, the mental health expert was removed from the defense witness list. Our threshold review of Walker\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase of his trial reveals that reasonable jurists could not debate the district court\u2019s resolution of this claim. We therefore deny a COA on this claim. We address below the two claims on which we have granted a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Walker was convicted of \u201c[t]he willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing of more than one person within a three-year period.\u201d Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-31.1(8). He was tried in a single trial before a single jury. Walker asserts that his conviction is invalid because his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 18.2-31.1(8), move for separate trials on the two murders, or request a jury instruction that evidence of one murder could not be considered in determining Walker\u2019s guilt in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">As stated above, to show ineffective assistance of counsel \u201cthe defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient ... [and] that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687. The state court held that Walker\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the guilt phase satisfied neither the performance prong nor the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. Because the state court adjudicated this claim on the merits, we may not grant habeas relief unless the state court\u2019s adju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>dication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) (West Supp.2002). Walker asserts that he is entitled to federal habeas relief because the state court\u2019s decision was an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland. </em>(Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14.) \u201c \u2018[U]nder the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this Court\u2019s decision but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1174, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (citing <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)); <em>see also Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1850, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002). \u201cThe \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 clause requires the state court decision to be more than incorrect or erroneous.\u201d <em>Lockyer, </em>123 S.Ct. at 1174; <em>see also Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 411 (\u201c[A] federal habeas court may not issue the writ [under the unreasonable application clause] simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.\u201d). Instead, \u201c[t]he state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law must be objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Lockyer, </em>123 S.Ct. at 1174 (citation omitted). Walker, therefore, \u201cmust do more than show that he would have satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>test if his claim were being analyzed in the first instance.\u201d <em>Bell, </em>122 S.Ct. at 1852. Rather, he must demonstrate that the state court applied <em>Strickland </em>in \u201can objectively unreasonable manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This he cannot do. Because, as discussed below, the state court\u2019s conclusion that Walker could not satisfy the prejudice prong was not unreasonable, we need not address the state court\u2019s determination under the performance prong of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">To establish prejudice, a defendant \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It was not objectively unreasonable for the state court to conclude that there was no reasonable probability that a challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 18.2-31.1(8) would have produced a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">In <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>263 Va. 13, 557 S.E.2d 223, 226 (2002), the Supreme Court of Virginia rejected a claim that a single trial under \u00a7 18.2-31.1(8) constitutes a misjoinder of different offenses. The court explained that murders charged under \u00a7 18.2-31.1(8) are connected by the \u201cfact that the capital murder and the predicate murder or murders occur within a three-year period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226. This \u201cconnection [is] similar to the link the General Assembly has established between capital murders and predicate offenses in other subsections of Code \u00a7 18.2-31.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For example, Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-31(5) (Michie 1996) provides that \u201c[t]he willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing of any person in the commission of, or subsequent to, rape or attempted rape\u201d constitutes a capital murder offense. The Supreme Court of Virginia thus concluded in <em>Smith </em>that \u201cthe Commonwealth may join two or more counts or charges of murder in a prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-31.1(8) despite the prejudice that may result thereafter ... [if] the murders shall have occurred within a three year period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227. Because the Supreme Court has never addressed whether it is a misjoinder to have a single trial for a capital offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>involving the commission of two murders within a set period of time, the <em>Smith </em>decision does not contradict clearly established federal law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Walker, therefore, has failed to show that there is a reasonable probability that his challenge to \u00a7 18.2-31.1(8) would have been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">It was also not objectively unreasonable for the state court to conclude that there was no reasonable probability that moving for separate trials or requesting an additional jury instruction would have produced a different result. Even assuming that the trial court would have granted either motion, Walker has failed to establish prejudice. The risk created by joinder is that a jury may confuse the evidence and return a conviction against a defendant on a charge on which it would have acquitted if the evidence had been properly segregated. <em>See Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 539, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993) (explaining that the risk of joining defendants is that the jury will consider evidence against a defendant that would not be admissible if a defendant were tried alone). To show prejudice, Walker must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that the jury confused evidence of the predicate murder and evidence of the capital murder. It is not enough to show that he might have had a better chance for acquittal if the guilt phase of his trial had been bifurcated. <em>See id. </em>at 540 (\u201c[I]t is well settled that defendants are not entitled to severance merely because they may have a better chance of acquittal in separate trials\u201d). Of course, some of the risk posed by joinder can be cured with proper instructions to the jury. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the risk of the jury confusing the evidence was minimal. As the district court noted, \u201cthe joint trial was not unduly lengthy or complex and the evidence with respect to each murder was distinct and easily compartmentalized.\u201d (J.A. at 965.) The transcript shows that in presenting its case against Walker, the Commonwealth kept its evidence regarding each murder separate. First it presented its case regarding the Beale murder and then put on its evidence about the Threat murder. Paul Tuttle, the only witness to testify about both murders, testified first about the Beale murder, was excused, and then recalled during the Threat portion of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Moreover, the jury instructions made it clear that each murder was a separate element that had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-9\">If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the above elements of the offense as charged, then you shall find the defendant guilty of capital murder.... If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant killed Clarence Threat, and that the killing was willful, deliberate and premeditated, but fail to find that the defendant killed Stanley Roger Beale, then you shall find the defendant guilty of first degree murder.... If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant killed Stanley Roger Beale, and that the kill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>ing was willful, deliberate and premeditated, but fail to find that the defendant killed Clarence Threat, then you shall find the defendant guilty of first degree murder.... Ladies and gentleman of the jury, it\u2019s simple. If you believe he killed both in a three year period that would meet the elements of capital murder. But, you might believe he killed one and not the other and that would be first degree murder. That would be a finding of not guilty as to one he is not guilty of.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">(J.A. at 157-58.) Because the evidence for each murder was easily distinguishable and the jury was instructed to consider each murder separately, it was reasonable for the state court to conclude that under <em>Strickland, </em>Walker suffered no prejudice from his counsel\u2019s failure to move for separate trials or request an additional jury instruction. Accordingly, the state court\u2019s denial of relief on Walker\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the guilt phase was not an unreasonable application of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Walker argues that the Commonwealth failed to disclose exculpatory evidence that would have impeached the trial testimony of three of its key witnesses: Bianca Taylor, Tameria Patterson, and Chris Miller. The state court concluded that Walker\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim regarding Bianca was procedurally barred and found Walker\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claims regarding Patterson and Miller without merit. (J.A. at 348-49.) We will discuss the state court\u2019s application of the procedural bar and determination on the merits in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Bianca testified at trial that she saw the shooter enter the house, yell at her father, and then shoot her father. Walker contends that the Commonwealth suppressed the following evidence that indicates that Bianca did not see the shooter: the Supplementary Offense Report of Officer Ernst (J.A. at 537), Supplementary Offense Report of Detective Mullins (J.A. at 489), handwritten notes of Detective Mullins (J.A. at 485), and statements made by Bianca and Catherine Taylor to Detective James Hickman (J.A at 543A). The state court, applying the rule in <em>Slayton v. Parrigan, </em>215 Va. 27, 205 S.E.2d 680 (1974), concluded that because this issue \u201ccould have been raised and adjudicated at [Walker\u2019s] trial and upon his appeal,\u201d Walker \u201cha[s] no standing to attack his final judgment of conviction by habeas corpus.\u201d 205 S.E.2d at 682. The district court refused to address the merits of this claim, concluding that this state procedural rule was independent and adequate and that Walker had failed to show cause and prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">A federal court conducting habeas review is \u201cprecluded from reviewing the merits of a claim that was procedurally defaulted under an \u2018independent and adequate\u2019 state procedural rule, \u2018unless the [applicant] can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fisher v.

A state rule is \u201cadequate\u201d if it is regularly or consistently applied by the state court, <em>see Johnson v. Mississippi, </em>486 U.S. 578, 587, 108 S.Ct. 1981, 100 L.Ed.2d 575 (1988), and \u201cindependent\u201d if it does not \u201cdepend[ ] on a federal constitutional ruling,\u201d <em>Ake v.

Angelone, </em>168 F.3d 835, 844 (4th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing cases). Walker does not dispute that the state court applied an adequate and independent procedural rule but rather asserts that he can demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the default.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">\u201cCause excuses the failure to raise a claim during a state proceeding if \u2018the factual or legal basis for [the] claim was not reasonably available.\u2019\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>163 F.3d 835, 845 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>McCleskey v. Zant, </em>499 U.S. 467, 494, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991)). Walker contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s interference, specifically its suppression of the documents listed above until eight months after direct appeal, prevented his counsel from raising the <em>Brady </em>claim regarding Bianca prior to state habeas. He correctly points out that \u201ca defendant cannot conduct a \u2018reasonable and diligent investigation\u2019 [as] mandated by <em>McCleskey </em>to preclude a finding of procedural default when the evidence is in the hands of the State.\u201d <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 287-88, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). If Walker, however, was aware or should have been aware that documents had been suppressed when he appealed his conviction, suppression of the documents would not constitute cause for failure to bring a <em>Brady </em>claim. <em>Id. </em>at 287 (holding that suppression of documents can constitute cause and distinguishing cases in which \u201cthe petitioner was previously aware of the factual basis for his claim but failed to raise it earlier\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">In applying the <em>Slayton </em>procedural bar, the state court found that at the time Walker filed for direct review, Walker\u2019s counsel was aware of the factual basis of Walker\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim, specifically, the Commonwealth\u2019s suppression of the evidence that allegedly could have impeached Bianca\u2019s testimony. This factual finding is presumed to be correct and petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Walker fails to satisfy this burden. Indeed, as Walker admitted in the first habeas petition he presented to the district court, shortly before trial the defense received a Presentence Report referencing two undisclosed police reports containing the same information as the documents listed above. This Presentence Report, by referencing these undisclosed documents, evidenced the Commonwealth\u2019s suppression of the alleged <em>Brady </em>material.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The factual basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>for the assertion of Walker\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim, therefore, was available not only before direct appeal, but before sentencing. Because Walker has failed to rebut the state court\u2019s finding that he could have brought his claim on direct review, he cannot demonstrate that the alleged with-holding by the Commonwealth constitutes cause to excuse his failure to raise the claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">We now turn to the remainder of Walker\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim regarding the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged withholding of evidence that would have impeached Patterson and Miller. Patterson testified at trial that someone she knew as \u201cTodd\u201d entered the residence of Karen and Charles Randolph and Jennifer Stewart, an apartment at 1309 W. Graham Road, on the night of Beale\u2019s murder and exclaimed, \u201cI shot him.\u201d (J.A. at 50-52.) Miller testified that he observed an unidentified person leave Beale\u2019s apartment after the shooting and enter the Randolph apartment. Walker contends that the Commonwealth suppressed the following records that would have impeached the testimony of Miller and Patterson: (1) a handwritten note by Detective Mullins recording Karen Randolph\u2019s statement that \u201cTy didn\u2019t come into her apt. [1309 W. Graham Road] after the shooting\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (J.A. at 486); (2) a statement to Detective Mullins by 1309 W. Graham Road resident Jennifer Stewart that she \u201cdidn\u2019t see him [Todd] Friday evening\u201d (J.A. at 486); (3) the Commonwealth\u2019s witness synopsis sheet stating that Miller said he saw a black male \u201cwalk from scene putting something in his pocket. Didn\u2019t see face can\u2019t ID ... Walked to front of 1309 W. Graham Rd. didn\u2019t go in. Got into a red Ford Escort and drove to Brook Rd.\u201d (J.A. at 483); (4) the Supplementary Offense Report of Detective Mullins summarizing Miller\u2019s account of what he witnessed, with no mention of the perpetrator entering 1309 W. Graham Road (J.A. at 488-89); and (5) the Supplementary Offense Report of Officer Ernst summarizing Miller\u2019s account of what he witnessed, with no mention of the perpetrator entering 1309 W. Graham Road (J.A. at 537).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">The state court concluded that this portion of Walker\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim was without merit. Specifically, the state court concluded that \u201cno material, exculpatory evidence was withheld.\u201d (J.A. at 348.) The state court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_5\">[n]either Stewart nor Randolph testified at trial; a review of the investigating officer\u2019s complete notes indicates that Christopher Miller would not have been impeached since he told the officer that he saw a person walk from the Taylor apartment and enter the Randolph apartment. Randolph would have placed Walker at the murder scene regardless of whether she would have testified that he did or did not enter her apartment, thereby destroying the exculpatory quality of the evidence alleged by petitioner to have been withheld.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">(J.A. at 349.)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">Under the <em>Brady </em>rule, the prosecution is required \u201cto disclose evidence favorable to the accused that, if suppressed, would deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 675, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). \u201c[Favorable evidence is material, and constitutional error results from its suppression by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>the government, \u2018if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 433-34, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (quoting <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 682). While a court initially considers the materiality of undisclosed evidence item by item, it must ultimately consider the cumulative effect of all suppressed evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 435 &amp; 436 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">First, Randolph\u2019s statements to Detective Mullins that \u201cTy didn\u2019t come into her [1309 W. Graham Road apartment] after the shooting\u201d (J.A. at 486) cannot be characterized as impeachment evidence because Randolph did not testify. Moreover, even if it were potentially exculpatory evidence, it would not fall under the <em>Brady </em>rule because Walker\u2019s defense counsel was aware before trial of the fact that Randolph did not see Ty enter her apartment after the shooting. Information known by the defense falls outside of the <em>Brady </em>rule. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976) (explaining that <em>Brady </em>applies in situations in which information is known to the prosecution but unknown to the defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Second, Stewart\u2019s statement to Detective Mullins that she \u201cdidn\u2019t see [Todd] Friday evening\u201d at 1309 W. Graham Road (J.A. at 486) also cannot be characterized as impeachment evidence because Stewart did not testify. Moreover, Stewart\u2019s statement is not favorable to Walker because it does not contradict Patterson\u2019s claim that she saw Walker enter the apartment. Patterson testified that she had been upstairs with Stewart and that she saw Walker as she was coming down the stairs. Patterson did not say whether Stewart was coming down the stairs with her and thus gave no indication that Stewart was also in a position to see Walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">Finally, Walker claims that the following three documents contradict Miller\u2019s testimony that the person Miller saw leave Beale\u2019s apartment entered the Randolph apartment before driving away: the Commonwealth\u2019s witness synopsis sheet (J.A. at 483), the Supplementary Offense Report of Detective Mullins (J.A. at 488-89), and Supplementary Offense Report of Officer Ernst (J.A. at 537). The witness synopsis sheet was created by the prosecution to summarize statements by the witnesses. The statement recorded on the witness synopsis sheet, that the person Miller observed the night of the shooting \u201cdidn\u2019t go in\u201d 1309 W. Graham Road (J.A. at 483), contradicts Miller\u2019s testimony that the person he saw leave Beale\u2019s apartment entered the Randolph apartment before driving away. Even if <em>Brady </em>requires a prosecutor to disclose work product,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> there is no indication that Miller adopted or approved this statement. <em>Cf. Goldberg v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 94, 98 &amp; n. 3, 96 S.Ct. 1338, 47 L.Ed.2d 603 (1976) (explaining that a prosecutor\u2019s work product must be produced under the Jencks Act if it contains a statement relating to the testimony of a government witness that has been \u201csigned or otherwise adopted or approved\u201d by the government witness). Indeed, it is not even clear whether the prosecution recorded these statements during an interview of Miller or was merely attempting to summarize another report, such as Detective Mullins\u2019s Supplementary Offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Report. Detective Mullins\u2019s report, created on December 16, 1996, contains no statement by Miller regarding whether the person he saw entered Randolph\u2019s apartment before driving away. Detective Ernst\u2019s description of his meeting with Miller on the day of the murder also does not indicate whether the person Miller saw entered the Randolph\u2019s apartment. Miller\u2019s statements reflected in the Supplementary Offense Reports, therefore, do not contradict his testimony at trial. Moreover, even if we assume that the Supplementary Offense Reports and the witness synopsis sheet fall under the <em>Brady </em>rule and would have had some impeachment effect, the prosecution would have been able to rehabilitate Miller with Officer Mullins\u2019s contemporaneous notes of his interview of Miller on the day of the murder, which reflect that Miller made the following statements: \u201cCar parked on grass 1309 W. Graham Rd. he went inside 1309 before he left.\u201d (J.A. at 860.) It was therefore not an unreasonable application of federal law for the state court to conclude that the material allegedly withheld in violation of <em>Brady </em>was either not impeachment evidence or the cumulative effect of any material that was impeachment evidence did not make a different result reasonably probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Walker also seeks to assert that his execution would violate the Eighth Amendment under <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 2252, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002) (holding that executing a mentally retarded individual violates the Eight Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishments), a claim he did not make in the district court and has not presented in state court. Because Walker\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>claim is \u201ca brand-new, free-standing allegation of constitutional error in the underlying criminal judgment,\u201d <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, No. 02-6304, 2003 WL 1949822 (4th Cir. Apr. 25, 2003) (explaining how to identify a successive application), we construe Walker\u2019s assertion of this claim as a motion for authorization to file a successive habeas corpus application under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244(b) (West Supp.2002). <em>See Fischer v. United States, </em>285 F.3d 596, 600 (7th Cir.2002) (\u201cIf the original [habeas] petition did not contain [a new rule of constitutional law as a] ground for relief, then that ground has been waived on appeal, ... and a prisoner\u2019s habeas options are thereafter limited by the special rules that apply to second or successive collateral attacks.\u201d). <em>But see Hill v. Anderson, </em>300 F.3d 679, 682 (6th Cir.2002) (combining petitioner\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>claim, raised for the first time on appeal, with habeas petition at issue in appeal). A successive habeas petition is allowed under \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A) if \u201cthe claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d Walker\u2019s claim satisfies these requirements because the Court in <em>Atkins </em>announced a new rule of constitutional law that applies retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>See Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 330, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) (concluding that a holding that \u201cthe Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution of mentally retarded persons ... would fall under the first exception to <em>[Teague\u2019s] </em>general rule of non-retroactivity and would be applicable to defendants on collateral review\u201d); <em>accord Hill, </em>300 F.3d at 681. We, therefore, grant Walker\u2019s motion and authorize the district court to consider Walker\u2019s successive habeas petition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The district court, of course, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>considering Walker\u2019s petition, is free to dismiss it without prejudice to afford the Commonwealth of Virginia the first opportunity to assess Walker\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>claim. <em>See, e.g., Bell v. Cockrell, </em>310 F.3d 330, 332-33 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201c[I]nferior federal courts have no useful role to play until and unless following <em>Atkins, </em>a death sentence is reaffirmed or again imposed on [the petitioner] by the state courts.... [T]he state must be given the first opportunity to apply the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in order to insure consistency among state institutions and procedures and to adjust its prosecutorial strategy to the hitherto unforeseen new rule.\u201d); <em>Hill, </em>300 F.3d at 682 (\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision to return Atkins\u2019s case to state courts suggests that we should return [petitioner\u2019s] Eighth Amendment retardation claim to the state for further proceedings.... [The state] should have the opportunity to develop its own procedures for determining whether a particular claimant is retarded and ineligible for death.\u201d). Following state review of Walker\u2019s <em>Atkins </em>claim, Walker would be free to refile his second petition should the need arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">In summary, we grant a COA as to Walker\u2019s claim that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated at the guilt phase of his trial and his claim that his due process rights were violated when the Commonwealth failed to timely disclose <em>Brady </em>materials. Because we conclude that the resolution of these issues by the Supreme Court of Virginia does not constitute an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of these claims. We deny a COA and dismiss Walker\u2019s appeal with regard to his claim that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated at the sentencing phase of his trial because reasonable jurists could not debate the district court\u2019s resolution of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-6\">. These facts are derived from the statement of facts in the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s published opinion affirming Walker's conviction on direct appeal. See <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 54, 515 S.E.2d 565, 568-69 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-8\">. We note that our consideration of Walker\u2019s COA application after the issues of this case have already been fully briefed and argued is procedurally misaligned with the appropriate standard for COA applications. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Swisher v. True, </em>325 F.3d 225, -, slip op. at 8 (4th Cir.2003). Nonetheless, because we address Walker\u2019s request under the standards set forth in <em>Slack </em>and <em>Miller-El, </em>our COA determination is not based on a full consideration of Walker\u2019s claims. Rather, we must grant a COA if, after a threshold inquiry, reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of Walker\u2019s claims debatable or wrong, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>\"even though every jurist of reason might agree, after the COA has been granted and the case has received full consideration, that petitioner will not prevail.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>123 S.Ct. at 1040.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b814-8\">.

Under the precedent of the Supreme Court, a misjoinder \u2018\u2018rise[s] to the level of a constitutional violation only if it results in prejudice so great as to deny a defendant his Fifth Amendment right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Lane, </em>474 U.S. 438, 446 n. 8, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986) (\"Improper joinder does not, in itself, violate the Constitution.\u201d). As described in the text, Walker has failed to show that the single trial caused him any prejudice, and thus even if his single trial under \u00a7 18.2-31.1(8) constituted a misjoinder, he could not show that it was a violation of the Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b819-6\">. Walker also does not argue that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will occur if we do not consider his claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\">. In <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999), the Court explained that mere suspicion is not enough \"to impose a duty on counsel to advance a claim for which they have no evidentiary support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286. Because the Presentence Report provided direct evidence that the Commonwealth had failed to disclose the alleged <em>Brady </em>material, Walker\u2019s reliance on <em>Strickler </em>for the premise that his appellate counsel had no basis to raise a <em>Brady </em>claim is therefore misplaced. Walker\u2019s counsel received evidence before trial that should have at least raised suspicion that the Commonwealth had the evidence Walker now claims was suppressed in violation of <em>Brady. </em>Specifically, the Report of Autopsy, stated that \u201d[t]his 36 year old male [Stanley Beale] was shot multiple times by an unknown assailant. ... [Witnesses] heard the shots but <em>did not witness the shooting.\u201d </em>(J.A. at 541 (emphasis added).) However, we need not decide whether the Report of Autopsy was sufficient to support the <em>Brady </em>claim Walker now asserts because the Presentence Report, containing direct evidence of the alleged <em>Brady </em>violation, undoubtedly was.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b820-6\">.
