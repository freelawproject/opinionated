Kepley\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising three issues on appeal but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Kepley was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has failed to do so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Counsel first questions whether the indictment was sufficient. Our review of the indictment reveals that it contained a definite statement of the offenses charged. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>152 F.3d 294, 299 (4th Cir.1998) (providing standard); <em>see also United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 857 (4th Cir.1996) (discussing elements of conspiracy); <em>United States v. Langley, </em>62 F.3d 602, 606 (4th Cir.1995) (en banc) (discussing elements of \u00a7 922(g)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Next, counsel raises as potential issues the adequacy of the plea coEoquy and the voluntariness of Kepley\u2019s plea. We have reviewed the transcript of the hearing conducted before the district court and are satisfied that Kepley entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily and that he was afforded the protections of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116-17 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, this claim merits no rehef.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">FinaEy, counsel asserts that Kepley received inefficient assistance of counsel. Claims of ineffective assistance are not cognizable on direct appeal unless counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness plainly appears on the face of the record. <em>Id. </em>at 120-21. We have reviewed the record for error and have found no clear ineffective assistance by Kepley\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Kepley\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his chent, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel beEeves that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the cEent.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
