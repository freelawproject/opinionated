We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-19\">Aubin\u2019s counsel filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In the <em>Anders </em>brief, Aubin\u2019s counsel briefed four issues, all of which counsel ultimately concluded were not meritorious: (1) whether the searches of the Lincoln and Flake Street residences were improper; (2) whether the district court erred in denying an acceptance of responsibility adjustment; (3) whether Aubin was a career offender; and (4) whether Aubin should have received an enhancement for possession of a firearm. Aubin was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-20\">First, counsel raises the issue of whether the searches of two residences were valid. A knowing and voluntary guilty plea constitutes an admission of the material elements of the crime, <em>see McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969), and waives non-jurisdictional errors, including claims of unlawful search and seizure based on the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973). Aubin has therefore waived his right to challenge the searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-21\">Because Aubin failed to object to the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report in the district court, we review his sentencing challenges for plain error. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>88 F.3d 1350, 1355 (4th Cir.1996). Under this standard, we exercise our discretion only to correct errors that are plain, material, or affecting substantial rights, and that seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>reviewed Aubin\u2019s sentence under the sentencing guidelines and find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Aubin\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time and require that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
