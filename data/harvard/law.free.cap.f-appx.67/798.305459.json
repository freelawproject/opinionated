Butler, </em>No. 97-7299, 1999 WL 25555, 1999 U.S.App. LEXIS 856 (4th Cir. Jan. 22, 1999). The United States contends that the district court violated our mandate in sentencing Butler to less than the twenty year statutory maximum for his drug conspiracy conviction, and that the district court erred by concluding that all three exceptions to the mandate rule applied. We agree, and vacate the district court\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">In 1992, Butler was convicted of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, under an indictment for conspiracy to possess cocaine (not cocaine base) with intent to distribute. During the sentencing hearing, Butler objected to the amount of cocaine base attributed to him as relevant conduct under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 1B1.3. The district court found that there was ample evidence of distribution in excess of 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base, and sentenced Butler to 420 months imprisonment. Butler appealed, and we affirmed. <em>United States v. Butler, </em>16 F.3d 412 (4th Cir.1994) (unpublished opinion) <em>(\u201cButler I\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">In 1997, Butler filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, contending that the sentence imposed exceeded the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction. The district court denied the motion, but upon appeal we vacated the district court\u2019s order in part, and remanded to the district court to re-sentence Butler to the statutory maximum of twenty years imprisonment. <em>United States v. Butler, </em>No. 97-7299,1999 WL 25555,1999 U.S.App. LEXIS 856 (4th Cir. Jan. 22, 1999) <em>(\u201cButler IF).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">In 2001, the district court held a resentencing hearing at which it heard additional evidence presented by Butler, and sought additional briefing from the parties on several legal issues. On July 30, 2002, the district court held a second resentencing hearing at which it sentenced Butler to 87 months imprisonment. The district court concluded that the mandate from this court in <em>Butler II </em>did not foreclose it from conducting a de novo resentencing of Butler, and, apparently in the alternative, that all three exceptions to the mandate rule applied. The United States now appeals, contending that the district court erred on each point.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-16\">The mandate rule is a \u201cspecific application of the law of the case doctrine,\u201d and requires that a lower court \u201ccarry the mandate of the upper court into execution and ... not consider the questions which the mandate laid at rest.\u201d <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number><em>v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1993). This rule \u201ccompels compliance on remand with the dictates of a superior court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And \u201cexcept in rare circumstances\u201d the district court must \u201cimplement both the letter and spirit of the ... mandate, taking into account our opinion and the circumstances it embraces.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The mandate rule binds the lower court except in \u201cthe following extraordinary circumstances: (1) a showing that controlling legal authority has changed dramatically; (2) that significant new evidence, not earlier obtainable in the exercise of due diligence, has come to light; or (3) that a blatant error in the prior decision will, if uncorrected, result in a serious injustice.\u201d <em>United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 662 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">In Butler\u2019s appeal of the denial of his motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, we vacated his sentence and remanded for the district court to resentence him, instructing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-6\">Based on 389 grams of powder cocaine, the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is twenty years. Although the guidelines range exceeds the statutory maximum, the statutory maximum takes precedence over the guidelines range. Under the Guidelines, when the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is less than the minimum of the guidelines range, as here, the maximum statutory sentence shall be the guidelines sentence. Accordingly, <em>Butler\u2019s guidelines sentence is twenty years, and he must be resentenced accordingly.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-7\"><em>Butler II, </em>1999 WL 25555, *2, 1999 U.S.App. LEXIS 856 at *6 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). We also proceeded to grant a certificate of appealability and vacate the sentence based on ineffective assistance of counsel, for counsel\u2019s failure to raise this issue on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at **2-3, *6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">In <em>United States v. Bell, </em>the mandate issued by this court \u201ccontained precise and unambiguous instructions, and directed the [district] court to do only one thing on remand \u2014 impose a sentence within the specified guideline range of 87-108 months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67. We held that the district court\u2019s failure to obey this precise instruction constituted a violation of the mandate rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">As in <em>Bell, </em>our mandate in <em>Butler II </em>contained \u201cprecise and unambiguous instructions.\u201d <em>Bell, </em>5 F.3d at 67. The district court was directed \u201cto do only one thing on remand,\u201d impose a sentence of twenty years imprisonment on Butler. <em>Id. </em>The district court, instead, after taking further evidence and receiving additional briefs, sentenced Butler to 87 months imprisonment. This action by the district court was in violation of our mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">Butler cites a parenthetical dictum in <em>United States v. Broughton-Jones, </em>71 F.3d 1143 (4th Cir.1995), for the proposition that \u201cunless specifically limited by [the] court of appeals\u2019 mandate, resentencing on remand is de novo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1149 n. 4, <em>citing United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 67 (4th Cir.1993). Even if this dictum correctly stated the law of this circuit, it would be irrelevant here, because our mandate was precise and unambiguous, and instructed the district court to correct one specific error only. Given this mandate, this case is controlled by <em>Bell </em>and <em>United States v. Apple, </em>962 F.2d 335, 337 (4th Cir.1992) (\u201cThe district court <em>properly </em>felt constrained ... by our remand instructions ... to limit its reconsideration of the sentences to that alone which we indicated might have been incorrect.\u201d) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the district court erred by conducting a de novo resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">A district court is permitted to disregard the mandate where any one of three \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d exists. <em>Aramony, </em>166 F.3d at 662. The district court concluded that all three exceptions to the mandate rule were present. In this conclusion, too, the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">First, the district court concluded that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), decided between the time of this court\u2019s remand for resentencing and the resentencing hearing, dramatically changed the controlling legal authority. But an <em>Apprendi </em>error occurs only where a sentence above the statutory maximum for the offense is imposed. <em>See United States v. Angle, </em>254 F.3d 514, 518 (4th Cir.2001). Here, as our remand required the district court to sentence at the statutory maximum, not above it, <em>Apprendi </em>was not implicated at all by Butler\u2019s resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Butler attempts to construct a dramatic change in the controlling legal authority by linking <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150 (4th Cir.2001), with <em>McMillan v. Pennsylvania, </em>477 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986): \u201cBecause of [Apprendi\u2019s and Promise\u2019s] change in the legal landscape,\u201d he argues, \u201cuncharged conduct threatened to increase Mr. Butler\u2019s offense dramatically, potentially in violation of <em>McMillan v. Pennsylvania.\u201d </em>Appellee\u2019s Brief, at 15.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> But the flaw in this argument is that <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Promise </em>did not change the relevant legal landscape. Uncharged conduct (in this case, conspiracy to distribute cocaine base) \u201cthreatened to increase\u201d dramatically Butler\u2019s sentence <em>regardless </em>of whether this uncharged conduct is classified as an element of the crime or as a sentencing factor. Hence, <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Promise, </em>even considered together with <em>McMillan, </em>did not change at all the controlling legal authority relevant to Butler\u2019s resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">Second, the district court concluded that the \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d of \u201csignificant new evidence\u201d warranted a departure from the mandate rule. The \u201csignificant new evidence,\u201d however, consisted of nothing more than statements taken from a few prosecution witnesses and co-conspirators that differed, mostly in inconsequential fashion, from portions of testimony by others at Butler\u2019s sentencing hearing. To give an illustration, Butler submitted, at the resentencing hearing, an affidavit from Sean Ashe, an unindicted co-conspirator, asserting that two particular drug couriers did not work for Butler. In contrast, at the initial sentencing hearing, Agent Beam (an official who conducted much of the investigation of Butler) testified, based on information gleaned from participants in the conspiracy, that these two couriers did work for Butler. It is not reasonable to think that a fact-finder would be compelled to disregard Agent Beam\u2019s testimony based on this affidavit alone; nor would disregard of the evidence relating to these two couriers have any effect on the other evidence that showed Butler\u2019s involvement with well over 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">As another example, Butler presented evidence from an interview of Mr. Desmond Henry, one of Butler\u2019s co-defendants, taken after Butler\u2019s sentencing. In this interview, Henry stated that he, Butler, and all the other drug dealers were \u201cin it for themselves\u201d and did not work in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>organized ring, J.A. 385, that several rocks of cocaine found on Ms. Hattie Aaron belonged to him, not Butler, and that the two drug couriers mentioned above from Ashe\u2019s affidavit worked for him, not Butler. Again, it would be quite unreasonable to conclude that a factfinder would be compelled to credit Henry\u2019s statements over the statements of other knowledgeable participants in the conspiracy, such as Michael Green, Paulette Jackson, and Hattie Aaron, presented at the initial sentencing hearing. The discovery of such inconsistencies between the statements of members of a conspiracy is, after all, a breathtakingly <em>ordinary </em>circumstance, not an \u201cextraordinary\u201d one. And also, at least as to the statements regarding the ownership of the rocks of cocaine and the employment of the two drug couriers in question, even crediting these statements would have no significant impact on the other evidence showing Butler\u2019s involvement with a large amount of cocaine base. This evidence, then, and the like evidence presented by Butler, does not rise to the level of \u201csignificant,\u201d nor does its discovery and presentation constitute an \u201cextraordinary circumstance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">As to the third exception to the mandate rule, the district court did not identify any blatant error in any prior proceeding, much less one that would result in a \u201csubstantial injustice\u201d if it were left uncorrected. In fact, no error has been identified in any prior proceeding other than the initial imposition of a sentence above the statutory maximum (which was to be corrected pursuant to the mandate of this court). Thus, the district court erred on this score as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">As no exception to the mandate rule was applicable in this case, the district court was bound to carry out the mandate of this court to sentence Butler to twenty years. By failing to do so, the district court committed reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">For the reasons stated, the sentence imposed by the district court is vacated, and the case is remanded with the instruction that the district court impose a sentence of twenty years of imprisonment on Butler.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b853-8\"> <em>McMillan </em>suggests that where a sentencing factor acts as \"a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense,\u201d the existence of the factor would have to be proven beyond all reasonable doubt, rather than by a lower standard such as preponderance of the evidence. <em>McMillan, </em>477 U.S. at 88.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
