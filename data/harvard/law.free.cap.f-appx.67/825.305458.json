The order affirmed, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s decision ordering Takele\u2019s removal to Ethiopia and denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-24\">The decision to grant or deny asylum relief is conclusive \u201cunless manifestly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>trary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000). We conclude that the record supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Takele failed to establish his eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) (2002); <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541 (4th Cir.1999). As the decision in this case is not manifestly contrary to law, we cannot grant the relief that Takele seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
