Mason preserved his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to an investigatory stop. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), \u201can officer may, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, conduct a brief, investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000). To conduct a <em>Terry </em>stop, there must be \u201cat least a minimal level of objective justification for making the stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Reasonable suspicion requires more than a hunch but less than probable cause and may be based on the collective knowledge of officers involved in an investigation. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, 232, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985). In evaluating police conduct in a <em>Terry </em>stop, courts must consider the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 8, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989). A suspect\u2019s presence in an area known for criminal activity is not, by itself, enough to support a <em>Terry </em>stop. However, presence in such an area is relevant in a <em>Terry </em>analysis, as are flight upon noticing the police and nervous, evasive behavior. <em>Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. at 124, 120 S.Ct. 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">We review legal conclusions in a district court\u2019s suppression determination de novo and review the underlying facts under the clearly erroneous standard, giving \u201cdue weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>United States v. Sprinkle, </em>106 F.3d 613, 616-17 (4th Cir. 1997). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">We conclude that the facts found by the district court were not clearly erroneous. Based on those facts, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we hold that the district court did not err in ruling that the officers had reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. We affirm Mason\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
