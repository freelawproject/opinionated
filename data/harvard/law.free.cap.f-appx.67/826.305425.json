We have thoroughly reviewed the record in light of the IJ\u2019s findings and conclude that Lar oja\u2019s assertions are without merit. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4) (2000); <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 323 (4th Cir.2002); <em>Matter of S-A-, </em>Int. Dec. 3433 (BIA 2000); <em>Matter of A-S-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1106 (BIA 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-24\">Laroja also contends that the Board abused its discretion in affirming the IJ\u2019s findings without opinion and failed to properly evaluate his appeal. As these claims are merely mentioned in Lar oja\u2019s brief and are entirely undeveloped, we find that they have been abandoned. <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-25\">We accordingly deny Laroja\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>terials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
