First, we reject Singh\u2019s claim that this case does not satisfy the criteria for use of the Board\u2019s summary affirmance procedure. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(H) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-22\">Next, we reject Singh\u2019s contention that he qualified for asylum and withholding of removal. Singh does not qualify for relief because the IJ made a negative credibility determination that is amply supported by the record and is entitled to deference. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4) (2000); <em>see Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 323 (4th Cir.2002); <em>Matter of S-A-, </em>Int. Dec. 3433 (BIA2000); <em>Matter of </em>A-S-, 211. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 1106 (BIA 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-23\">We also find Singh\u2019s assertion that the IJ erred in finding his asylum application frivolous to be meritless. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(6) (2000). Finally, we reject Singh\u2019s assertion that the IJ did not discuss the status of his labor certification and application for adjustment of status. <em>See </em>A.R. 37 n. 2; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a)(3) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-24\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b898-25\"> Petitioner Champa Saini is Singh\u2019s wife and her claim is dependent on his pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
