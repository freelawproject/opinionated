Womack appeals the district court\u2019s orders dismissing her civil action. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Even assuming that Womack intended to name a federal official as a defendant, and assuming that such defendant was properly served, the district court correctly dismissed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (\u201cthe Secretary\u201d) from this case. Womack was unsuccessful in a prior case brought against the Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d) under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2000) that challenged the denial of disability benefits. <em>See Womack v. Barnhart, </em>53 Fed.Appx. 678 (4th Cir.2002). Accordingly, she is precluded by the doctrine of res judicata from bringing another such action against a federal official. <em>See Meekins v. United Transp. Union, </em>946 F.2d 1054, 1057 (4th Cir.1991); <em>see also McGowen v. Harris, </em>666 F.2d 60, 65 (4th Cir.1981). Moreover, Womack\u2019s claim against the Department of Medical Assistance Services (\u201cDMAS\u201d) was correctly dismissed because claims arising under \u00a7 405(g) must be brought against the Commissioner, not an arm of the state such as DMAS, which is protected by Eleventh Amendment immunity. Accordingly, we affirm substantially for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Womack v. Commissioner, Dep\u2019t of Med. Assts Seros., </em>No. CA-02-47-4 (W.D.Va. Mar. 7, 2003, Jan. 14, 2003, &amp; Oct. 22, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
