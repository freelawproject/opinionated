The district court sentenced Smith to 96 months imprisonment for Counts 1, 2 and 4, and 60 months, to be served consecutively, for Count 3. The court also fined Smith $8400 ($2100 per offense), and imposed a special assessment of $400 ($100 per offense). On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issue: whether the sentencing court erred by ordering Smith to pay a fine without considering the burden the fine would impose on his three dependent children. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part, and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">We vacate and remand for the district court to consider the burden that the $8400 fine will have on Smith\u2019s three dependent children as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(a)(2) (2000). <em>See United States v. Costner, </em>50 F.3d 1267, 1277 (4th Cir.1995). A district court must make factual findings with respect to applicable \u00a7 3572 factors, to ensure that there is a basis for appellate review. <em>United States v. Walker, </em>39 F.3d 489, 492 (4th Cir.1994). We also direct the district court\u2019s attention to the clerical error in its criminal judgment stating that Smith\u2019s total offense level was 26. A review of the entire record reveals that Smith\u2019s total offense level was 21; the error may be corrected under Fed. R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">We have examined the entire record in this case, in accordance with the require-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>merits of <em>Anders, </em>and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
