S. B., 298, the claim was on account of cotton belonging to a British subject, which he had purchased under permits from the President of the United States and Secretary of the Treasury, and which was destroyed by the Federal army during the civil war, and the claim was held to be assignable; and in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Heard, </em>140 U. S. B., 529, the claim was for insurance premiums paid on vessels which had been destroyed by the Alabama and other Confederate cruisers sailing from British ports, and the claim was held to be assignable; but the claims in these three cases were governed by principles of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ternational law, and are differentiated from the claim in controversy, as will be seen by careful reading of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-6\">In <em>Emerson\u2019s Heirs </em>v. <em>Hall, ubi supra, </em>the court in commenting\u2019 upon <em>Gomegys </em>v. <em>Yasse, </em>said, \u201cBy the law of nations Spain was bound to indemnify the owners of foreign vessels, which had been illegally captured and condemned under her authority;\u201d and the cases of <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>and <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Heard, ubi supra, </em>are based upon <em>Gomegys </em>v. <em>Yasse. </em>In <em>Milnor </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>16 Pet., 221, the claim was for extra services rendered by the gauger at the port of Philadelphia, under the act of Congress of 1836, for which no fees were prescribed, and the claim was held to be assignable; but, as shown in that case, the services performed by the gauger were at the instance of the government, and were necessary to execute the act of 1836; and in <em>Erwin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>91 U. S. K., 392, the claim was for cotton which had been captured by the Federal authorities during the civil war, and which had been sold and the proceeds paid into the treasury of the United States, and the claim was held .to be assignable; but that claim arose under the Captured and Abandoned Property Act of 1863, which gave the right and prescribed the remedy to be reimbursed for such property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-7\">These are the only cases that have come under our observation which seemed to justify appellees\u2019 contention that the claim in controversy was assignable; but, as stated, the claims in the first three of these cases were governed by principles of international law, and the claims in the last two of these cases were based on existing statutes, and all of them were legal claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-8\">A claim for property, which was enemy\u2019s property, in enemy\u2019s territory, and was taken by military authorities in the exercise of the lawful right of a belligerent, is not a claim possessing an attribute of property, but it is like a pension claim, personal, and dependent upon the individual loyalty of the individual sufferer and the clemency of Congress. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>was the claim in controversy, it did not possess an attribute of property. Its consideration by the court of claims was on account of the personal status of Haller Nutt, the owner, as being loyal to the United States throughout the civil war; and when finally allowed by Congress, it was done as a mere gratuity, on account of his loyalty, and not as a property right.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b234-6\"><em>Brown &amp; Martin, </em>for appellants, in each of the cases, Calvin K.

In each 'the only question is whether or not the chancellor properly overruled appellant\u2019s demurrer to the separate bills filed by appellees. Each bill is to require the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a., the appellant, to pay complainants below, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>pellees here, a distributive share under the will of Haller Nutt, deceased. The first (No. 11,143) is based on the will of Mrs. Caroline Marble, sole heir of. Carrie Nutt Forsythe, a deceased intestate daughter of Haller Nutt, which will of Mrs. Marble gave to appellees Elizabeth H. and Mary A. Forsythe \u201call the property, real and personal, of which I shall be at the time of my decease possessed, or to which I may be in any way entitled, and wherever the same may be situated.\u201d The second (No. 11,144) is based on a bequest in the will of Mary Ella Nutt, a daughter of Haller Nutt, of \u201call that I die possessed of to my sisters, Julia W. Nutt and Lillie Nutt Ward, also all interest in the claim against the United States government,\u201d etc. The third (No. 11,145) is based on the will of Haller Nutt, Jr., a son of Haller Nutt, which will gives his brother, S. P. Nutt, appellee, one-half of his share \u201cof that certain claim No. 1,851 styled <em>Julia A. Nutt, Executrix of Haller </em>Nutt, deceased, v. <em>the United </em>States, in the Court of Claims,\u2019 \u201d and the other half the will gives to Annie Coleman, appellee. All three of these cases are here from a decree overruling demurrers to the bills. There is but one question in all the cases which we think worthy of any serious consideration, and that will develop from those facts stated in the bills and the agreement of counsel as to what, in addition, may be considered in arriving at a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Haller Nutt, the common ancestor of the parties, was a citizen and resident of Natchez, Miss., but had very large possessions in the state of Louisiana, and was, for these parts, and at the time of the origin of the claim which is the cause of all these controversies, a man of very great wealth. During the war between the states he was known to 'be unmistakably not only an opponent of secession and of the Southern Confederacy, but absolutely devoted to the Union and the cause of the Federal government. He was so devoted, and to such an extent, that he welcomed the invasion of the Union armies. This was well known to Gen. Grant and all of his subordinate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>officers. In the operations of that commander against Vicksburg, the properties of Mr. Nutt in Louisiana were occupied by tbe United States army, but put under safeguards. These safeguards were, because of his well-known loyalty, ordered by Gen. Grant, Gen. Sheridan, Gen. McPherson, and Gen. Gresham. According to Brig. Gen. McKee, who commanded the first of the Union forces to enter Natchez, Mr. Nutt \u201cwas the first man to step forward and welcome\u201d them. By the reports of committees of the United States Senate appointed to investigate this very claim, propounded first in 1866, by Julia A. Nutt, widow of Haller Nutt, and then executrix of his will, it is shown that the Federal army was compelled, by necessity, to disregard the safeguards, and appropriate supplies of enormous value. It is shown that, if damage by destruction of property could be considered, such as houses, gins, 750 bales of cotton, etc., the loss was $1,000,000 or more. But, excluding these, and considering only quartermaster and commissary supplies, it is shown that the claim largely exceeded $100,000. In all, there have been four payments on this since it was first presented from 1866 to date \u2014 the three first to the estate of Haller Nutt, and distributed as assets; and the last, $89,-999.89, recently paid to the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of that estate, and which is the subject of the present litigation. It is important to note the language of the act making the appropriation of this last-named sum. It appears in an omnibus appropriation bill to several hundred claimants, some to individuals named, some to \u201cheirs,\u201d some to \u201cnext of kin,\u201d etc., and is in these words: \u201cTo James O. Williams, administrator of Haller Nutt, deceased, of Adams county, $89,999.89\u201d \u2014figures written. Williams died, and John K. Nutt is now the administrator, and the children of Haller and Julia A. Nutt, through the administrator, contend that because they happen to be now alive they should have the whole sum to the exclusion of the legatees of the three children who happened to die before this last payment was made. We do not think so. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The claim was in prosecution for thirty years, recognized as just by the great military leaders, by the quartermaster general, and great statesmen on congressional committees, and certain it is, in the line of the reasoning in <em>Williams v. Heard, </em>140 U. S., 529, 11 Sup. Ct., 885; 35 L. ed., 550; and <em>Price </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>173 U. S., 427-429; 19 Sup. Ct., 434; 43 L. ed., 749, that the government was under the highest moral obligation to pay it, and this is recognized. If the matter were between individuals, the right of recovery would have been clear. This is not a case where the appropriation was to \u201cheirs,\u201d as. in <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>13 Pet., 409; 10 L. ed., 223, or to \u201cnext of kin,\u201d as in <em>Blagge </em>v. <em>Balch, </em>162 U. S., 439; 16 Sup. Ct., 853; 40 L. ed., 1039; nor is it a case where no appropriation has yet been made, as in the case of <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>28 Ct. Cls., 512. Here the appropriation has been made, and made specifically to the administrator with the will annexed, and must be intended to be designed as estate assets for distribution to creditors, and, when they are paid, to heirs living and representative of heirs dead, according to the laws of distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
