J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0c\">Defendant Rickey Lee Mayberry battered the victim with a standard weighted workout glove containing sand in the palm area. A jury found him guilty of battery with serious bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 243, subd. (d); count one)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and possession of a dangerous weapon. (\u00a7 12020, subd. (a)(1); count two.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Defendant\u2019s principal claim on appeal is that the workout glove is not within the list of weapons prohibited by the last clause of section 12020, subdivision (a)(1), which derives from the Dangerous Weapons Control Law of 1923. (Stats. 1923, ch. 339, \u00a7 1, p. 696.) We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">The subdivision prohibits the possession of \u201cany instrument or weapon of the kind <em>commonly known </em>as a blackjack, slungshot, billy, sandclub, sap, or sandbag.\u201d (\u00a7 12020, subd. (a)(1), italics added.) The trial court instructed the jury that defendant was guilty of the offense if he \u201cpossessed a weighted glove[,] . . . knew that he possessed the weighted glove [and] possessed the object as a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">In the published portion of the opinion we conclude that a workout glove is not \u201ccommonly known\u201d as a \u201csandclub ... or sandbag,\u201d regardless that it contained sand or was used by defendant to hit a victim in the face causing serious injuries, because it did not share any of their descriptive characteristics. \u201c[T]he prosecution [failed to] prove that the item had the necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>characteristic to fall within the statutory description.\u201d <em>(People v. King </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 617, 627 [42 Cal.Rptr.3d 743, 133 P.3d 636].)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The offense appropriate to defendant\u2019s conduct in this case is a battery, for which the jury also found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We shall reverse defendant\u2019s conviction on count two, award him an additional 62 days of presentence custody credits, and affirm the judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Defendant hit Steve Bingham in the face with his left hand, causing Bingham to suffer serious bodily injuries. At the time, defendant was wearing \u201ca black weighted glove\u201d on his left hand. The glove belonged to Jeffrey Clark, who testified it was a \u201cstandard workout glove[]\u201d he purchased at Longs Drugs. It was made of neoprene, with \u201ca little weight to it.\u201d It was weighted with sand in the palm and/or \u201cfist area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">In count two of the information, defendant was charged with \u201cpossessing] an instrument and weapon of the kind commonly known as a weighted glove.\u201d The jury was instructed in pertinent part: \u201c[Djefendant is charged in [cjount [t]wo with unlawfully possessing a weapon, specifically, a weighted glove, [f] To prove that the defendant is guilty of this crime, the People must prove that; [][] One, the defendant possessed a weighted glove; [][] Two, the defendant knew that he possessed the weighted glove; ffl And, three, the defendant possessed the object as a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">During closing argument, the People told the jury that the glove worn by defendant was \u201cno different than what the Penal Code describes as a sandbag, [f] Getting hit with a glove filled with sand is equal to if not exactly the same as getting hit in the face by someone with a bag of sand. Just because the sand is contained in a glove doesn\u2019t make it any different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">The jury found defendant guilty of illegally possessing a weapon \u201cas charged in [cjount [tjwo of the [ijnformation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The last clause of section 12020, subdivision (a)(1), prohibits the \u201cpossession of] . . . any instrument or weapon of the kind commonly known as a blackjack, slungshot, billy, sandclub, sap, or sandbag.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Defendant contends there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction for violating section 12020, subdivision (a)(1), because a weighted glove \u201cis not one of the items enumerated in\u201d that subdivision. The People concede the point and we accept the concession for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">At issue are the criteria by which the characteristics that define an item subject to section 12020, subdivision (a)(1), are to be measured. This may be resolved as a matter of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The trial court instructed the jury that the workout glove was within section 12020, subdivision (a)(1), and that defendant violated the section if he knew the item was a workout glove and that he possessed the glove as a weapon. The trial court apparently assumed that any object containing sand and used to batter a person is a \u201csandclub ... or sandbag.\u201d That stretches the terms beyond recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">The prosecutor argued below that the means by which the workout glove was used to batter the victim transformed it into a sandclub or sandbag. \u201cGetting hit with a glove filled with sand is equal to if not exactly the same as getting hit in the face by someone with a bag of sand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The prosecutor confused a functional with a descriptive definition. Section 12020, subdivision (a)(1), does not define the prohibited items by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>means of their use. It defines them as they are \u201ccommonly known,\u201d such that it is the descriptive characteristics of the item that make it dangerous. It is the purpose of the law to bar the possession or carrying of an instrument that is customarily viewed as a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The last clause of section 12020, subdivision (a)(1), including the terms \u201csandclub ... or sandbag\u201d derive from the Dangerous Weapons Control Law of 1923. (Stats. 1923, ch. 339, \u00a7 1, p. 696.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThe Legislature obviously sought to condemn weapons common to the criminal\u2019s arsenal; it meant as well \u2018to outlaw instruments which are ordinarily used for criminal and unlawful purposes.\u2019 . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Grubb </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 614, 620 [47 Cal.Rptr. 772, 408 P.2d 100], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Mulherin </em>(1934) 140 Cal.App. 212 at pages 214-215 [35 P.2d 174], the court observed that \u201c[a]ll the instruments mentioned [in the 1923 statute], with the exception of metal knuckles, belong to a certain species of weapon having so many characteristics in common that their slight differences are unimportant. They are all. . . short, easily concealed upon the person and so weighted as to constitute effective and silent weapons of attack. Any one of them, in our opinion, would be properly described by the general term, \u2018sap\u2019, and we believe that a sand-bag, such as a piece of hose loaded with sand, is occasionally correctly described as a black-jack.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines a \u201csap\u201d as \u201c[a] club, a blackjack, a hose containing rocks in the middle, or any other object generally used as a bludgeon\u201d and a sandclub or sandbag as \u201c[a] tube of strong, flexible material filled with sand, by which a heavy blow may be struck which leaves little or no mark on the skin. ... It is included in the general term <em>sap.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Black\u2019s Law Dict. (8th ed. 2004) p. 1369 [sap]; <em>id. </em>(4th ed. 1968) p. 1507 [sandclub or sandbag].)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">A standard workout glove containing a small amount of sand, even when used as a weapon, is not an \u201cinstrument or weapon of the kind <em>commonly known as </em>a blackjack, slungshot, billy, sandclub, sap, or sandbag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>(\u00a7 12020, subd. (a)(1), italics added.) That an object, like a sandclub or sandbag, contains sand and is used as a bludgeon, is insufficient to bring it within section 12020, subdivision (a)(1), for the sand is there to fulfill an ordinary and innocent function. Section 12020, subdivision (a)(1) does not prohibit the possession of any instrument or weapon that bears some irrelevant characteristic of the weapon listed.  Crimes by analogy, that include items within the statutory policy but without the statutory language are prohibited by the criminal law. \u201cIn California all crimes are statutory and there are no common law crimes. Only the Legislature and not the courts may make conduct criminal.\u201d <em>(In re Brown </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 612, 624 [108 Cal.Rptr. 465, 510 P.2d 1017].)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">However, the use of a prohibited item may bear on the defendant\u2019s scienter. That is, the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s possession or use of an item can defease a defendant\u2019s criminal liability for possession of an item that is a \u201cprohibited weapon\u201d but cannot alter its descriptive characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The prosecutor below argued that the mere means of use of an item may transform it into a proscribed item. That is not correct. It is the descriptive characteristics of the item which define it. It is true that an item that was not originally a dangerous weapon within the items listed in section 12020, subdivision (a)(1), may be made into one by suitable alterations. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Grubb </em>a jury convicted the defendant of carrying a \u201cbilly,\u201d in the form of a broken (shortened) baseball bat, taped at the smaller end, because \u201c[p]ossibly the . . . bat has been so altered from its original condition that it falls into the . . . category\u201d of \u201cinstruments dangerous in their ordinary use . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Grubb, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 621, fn. 8.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, the workout glove was not altered, and likely could not have been, to make it a sandbag, \u201c[a] tube of strong, flexible material filled with sand, by which a heavy blow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>may be struck which leaves little or no mark on the skin,\u201d as described in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1968) page 1507.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Following the enactment of the Dangerous Weapons Control Law of 1923, \u201cdisguised weapons\u201d were added that had alternative, innocent uses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To rule out an innocent possession the Supreme Court has required that the prosecution prove that the defendant had actual knowledge of the characteristic that made possession of the item unlawful. (See <em>People v. King, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 626 [\u201cIt is highly unlikely that the Legislature intended that a person possessing an item listed in section 12020(a)(1) for its lawful, utilitarian purpose, but unaware of the characteristic that makes possession of the item illegal, would nevertheless be guilty of violating section 12020(a)(1).\u201d]) However, the defendant\u2019s knowledge does not change the descriptive nature of the proscribed object but serves only to defease the criminal nature of its possession. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cFirst, the prosecution must prove that the item had the necessary characteristic to fall within the statutory description.\u201d <em>(People v. King, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th at p. 627.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Applying these rules in this case \u201cit is clear [because the trial court used the wrong legal measure] that there is a total absence of any evidence to sustain defendant\u2019s conviction\u201d for possession of a prohibited weapon and therefore, his conviction on that count must be reversed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Golden </em>(1946) 76 Cal.App.2d 769, 770-771 [174 P.2d 32] [reversing defendant\u2019s conviction based on possession of a \u201cmonkey fist\u201d for lack of sufficient evidence because \u201ca \u2018monkey fist\u2019 [is not] commonly known as a black-jack, slungshot, billy, sand-club, sandbag or metal knuckle\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The judgment is modified to reverse count two and reflect that defendant has 265 days of presentence custody credits, consisting of 177 days of actual credit and 88 days of conduct credit. As modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The trial court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment to reflect this change to defendant\u2019s presentence credit. The trial court is further directed to forward a copy of the amended abstract of judgment to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Morrison, J., and Robie, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-12\"> All further section references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b155-13\"> Defendant waived trial by jury on a prior strike allegation (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds.

Defendant was sentenced to an aggregate term of six years in state prison, consisting of the middle term of three years doubled on count one, and the middle term of two years doubled on count two, stayed pursuant to section 654.

The last few inches of the handle had been broken from the bat; the instrument was 20 inches long, taped at the smaller or handle end, and heavier at the unaltered end.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Grubb, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 616.) The court \u201cadopt[ed]\u201d a test for \u201cbilly,\u201d similar to that in <em>People v.

Accordingly the statute would encompass the possession of a table leg, in one sense an obviously useful item, when it is detached from the table and carried at night in a \u2018tough\u2019 neighborhood to the scene of a riot. On the other hand the section would not penalize the Little Leaguer at bat in a baseball game.\u201d <em>(People v. Grubb, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 621.) However, in <em>Grubb, </em>a jury convicted the defendant of carrying a \u201cbilly,\u201d in the form of a broken baseball bat, wrapped at one end. In that form it was not a baseball bat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\"><em> </em>See, for example, the items listed in footnote 6 of <em>People v.

It said, in reference to <em>Grubb </em>that \u201cthe surrounding circumstances of possession\u2014including defendant\u2019s intended use\u2014were relevant to the issue of whether the bat was a prohibited weapon.\u201d <em>(People v.

However, that properly refers to the defendant\u2019s scienter, not the defining characteristics of the object.
