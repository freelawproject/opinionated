Appellant contends the juvenile court erred in issuing those orders by failing to first discharge two mandatory statutory duties; (1) to determine his suitability for the deferred entry of judgment program, and (2) to determine whether the offense sustained against him was a felony or misdemeanor. For reasons discussed below, we reject appellant\u2019s first contention, but set the dispositional order aside and remand the matter to the juvenile court for the court to determine, in the exercise of its discretion, whether the sustained offense was a felony or misdemeanor, and to sentence accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">On December 5, 2006, a juvenile wardship petition was filed under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602, subdivision (a) alleging that appellant had committed felony vehicle theft (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851, subd. (a); count 1), felony possession of stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496; count 2), and misdemeanor hit-and-run driving (Veh. Code, \u00a7 20002, subd. (a); count 3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the same day, the prosecutor filed a notice that appellant was eligible for the deferred entry of judgment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">A contested jurisdictional hearing was held March 12 and 13, 2007. There, Eunice Vandermeer testified that, on May 13, 2006, she discovered her 1999 Dodge Stratus missing from the front of her home. She had not given anyone permission to borrow the vehicle. Vandermeer\u2019s vehicle was later returned to her home, but had sustained damage to its front end.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Chris Borek testified that in the late evening of May 13 or the early morning of May 14, 2006, he heard a loud crash outside his home. Borek went outside with his girlfriend, Rachelle Qutob, and saw appellant standing alone next to a Dodge Stratus that had crashed into his house. Borek knew appellant lived next door to his aunt, and considered him a friend. Borek told appellant, \u201cYou just hit my house and threw my brother off the couch.\u201d Appellant apologized, and agreed that Borek would send appellant\u2019s father a bill for the damage. Borek watched as appellant drove away in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Qutob\u2019s testimony largely corroborated that of Borek\u2019s. Qutob, like Borek, knew appellant as the neighbor of Borek\u2019s aunt, and also recognized him from school. In addition, Qutob testified that, soon after appellant drove off in the Dodge Stratus that had collided with Borek\u2019s home, Qutob and her mother followed the vehicle in their own vehicle and, in doing so, saw appellant park. it a short distance away on Carlton Street. On cross-examination, Qutob acknowledged failing to inform the police that she and her mother had followed appellant, and a defense investigator, Janita Thurman, testified that Qutob also failed to tell her of that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">On May 14, 2006, Officer Albert Schmeck, responding to a police call, visited the accident scene and took statements from Borek and Qutob. Officer Schmeck saw the damage to Borek\u2019s home. Based on the information provided by Borek and Qutob, Officer Schmeck later found the Dodge Stratus with a damaged front end parked about one mile away on Carlton Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">At the conclusion of the contested jurisdictional hearing, the juvenile court found true the allegation in count one that appellant had committed vehicle theft pursuant to Vehicle Code, section 10851, subdivision (a), and made no findings on the remaining counts. At a dispositional hearing held May 22, 2007, the juvenile court declared appellant a ward of the court and placed him on probation in the custody of his father. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Appellant raises two contentions on appeal. First, appellant contends the juvenile court erred by failing to determine whether he was a suitable candidate for the deferred entry of judgment program (DEI) under section 790 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>et seq. Second, appellant contends, and the People agree, the juvenile court erred by failing to make an express finding on the record whether the sustained offense for violation of Vehicle Code section 10851 was a felony or a misdemeanor. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">I. <em>Failure to Rule on Appellant\u2019s Suitability for Deferred Entry of Judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The prosecutor in this case determined appellant was eligible for DEJ, and provided written notice of his eligibility to both appellant and the juvenile court. A hearing on appellant\u2019s suitability for DEJ was scheduled for December 20, 2006. Appellant failed to appear at that hearing, apparently having not been personally served with notice of it, and the matter was continued to January 9, 2007. At the January 9 hearing, and at all subsequent hearings in the matter, the record reveals no mention by anyone\u2014not the juvenile court, appellant, his attorney, nor the prosecutor\u2014of the DEJ determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Appellant\u2019s attorney indicated at the February 5 hearing, however, that appellant was denying the allegations in the section 602 petition, and requested that the juvenile court schedule a contested jurisdictional hearing. As set forth above, a contested jurisdictional hearing was thus held, after which the juvenile court found true the allegation that appellant had committed vehicle theft, adjudged him a ward of the court, and placed him on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">According to appellant, the juvenile court\u2019s failure to address the DEJ issue at any of the scheduled hearings was error. Appellant reasons that the juvenile court failed to discharge a mandatory statutory duty to exercise its discretion to determine his suitability for DEJ. He thus asks us to set aside the court\u2019s jurisdictional and dispositional orders and remand for further proceedings in compliance with the DEJ provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">The People, to the contrary, contend the juvenile court had no mandatory statutory duty to determine appellant\u2019s DEJ suitability because appellant declined to admit the allegations against him contained in the section 602 petition. To address the merits of the parties\u2019 contentions, we thus must examine the relevant statutory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Our colleagues in the Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, Division One, have provided the following helpful overview of the DEJ: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>\u201cThe DEJ provisions of section 790 et seq. were enacted as part of Proposition 21, The Gang Violence and Juvenile Crime Prevention Act of 1998, in March 2000. The sections provide that in lieu of jurisdictional and dispositional hearings, a minor may admit the allegations contained in a section 602 petition and waive time for the pronouncement of judgment. Entry of judgment is deferred. After the successful completion of a term of probation, on the motion of the prosecution and with a positive recommendation from the probation department, the court is required to dismiss the charges. The arrest upon which judgment was deferred is deemed never to have occurred, and any records of the juvenile court proceeding are sealed. (\u00a7\u00a7 791, subd. (a)(3), 793, subd. (c).)\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Martha C. v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 556, 558 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 544].)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>More specifically, section 790, subdivisions (a) and (b) provide that where, as here, a minor is alleged in a section 602 petition to have committed a felony offense, the prosecutor must review the file to determine whether the minor meets the qualifications for DEJ. (\u00a7 790, subds. (a), (b).) The minor is eligible for DEJ if all of the following circumstances apply: \u201c(1) The minor has not previously been declared to be a ward of the court for the commission of a felony offense, [f] (2) The offense charged is not one of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (b) of Section 707. [f] (3) The minor has not previously been committed to the custody of the Youth Authority. [][] (4) The minor\u2019s record does not indicate that probation has ever been revoked without being completed. H] (5) The minor is at least 14 years of age at the time of the hearing. [|] (6) The minor is eligible for probation pursuant to Section 1203.06 of the Penal Code.\u201d (\u00a7 790, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Undisputedly, here, the prosecutor determined appellant was eligible for DEJ and, consistent with his further statutory duties under section 790, subdivision (b), provided written notice to appellant and the juvenile court of that fact. Once, however, a determination is made that a minor is eligible for DEJ, there must also be a determination that he is <em>suitable </em>for DEJ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>(\u00a7 791, subd. (b).) Otherwise stated, once eligibility is established, \u201cthe statutory language empowers but does not compel the juvenile court to grant [DEJ] . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Sergio R. </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 597, 605 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 160]; see also <em>Martha C. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th at p. 560 [\u201cWhile . . . eligibility is a necessary condition for DEJ, it is not alone a sufficient basis. Under proper circumstances the court may refuse DEJ even to minors eligible under section 790, subdivision (a).\u201d].) The juvenile court thus independently determines the minor\u2019s suitability for DEJ based on certain factors, including the minor\u2019s age, maturity, educational background, family relationships, motivation, any treatment history, and any other relevant factors regarding the benefit the minor would derive from education, treatment, and rehabilitation efforts. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.800; see also \u00a7 791, subd. (b); <em>In re Sergio R., supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at p. 607; <em>Martha C. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th at p. 562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In arguing that, here, the juvenile court was excused from determining whether appellant was suitable for DEJ based on the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 5.800, despite the prosecutor\u2019s determination of his eligibility, the People rely on section 791, subdivision (b). That provision provides, \u201cIf the minor consents and waives his or her right to a speedy jurisdictional hearing, the court may refer the case to the probation department or the court may summarily grant deferred entry of judgment <em>if the minor admits the charges in the petition and waives time for the pronouncement of judgment.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) According to the People, under this provision, where, as here, the minor declines to admit the allegations against him and calls for a contested jurisdictional hearing, the minor no longer qualifies for DEJ consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Appellant disagrees with the People\u2019s interpretation of section 791, subdivision (b). Directing us to <em>In re Luis B. </em>(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1117, 1123 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 581] <em>(Luis B.), </em>appellant argues that, under that statutory provision, once the prosecutor determines a minor is eligible for DEJ, the juvenile court must hold a hearing to determine the minor\u2019s suitability, regardless of whether the minor affirmatively asks the court to do so. As appellant notes, the court in <em>Luis B. </em>held that \u201c[t]he court is not required to ultimately grant DEJ, but is required to at least follow specified procedures and exercise discretion to reach a final determination once the mandatory threshold eligibility determination is made. <em>([In re Sergio R., supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th] at p. 604).\u201d <em>(Luis B., supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th at p. 1123.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>In deciding the proper interpretation of section 791, subdivision (b), \u201cour function is to look at the statutory scheme in its entirety, giving it a construction that will promote, rather than frustrate, its sensible operation. (E.g., <em>Renee J. v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 735, 744 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 28 P.3d 876]; <em>In re Michael G. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 283, 296 [243 Cal.Rptr. 224, 747 P.2d 1152].)\u201d <em>(In re Kenneth J. </em>(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 973, 979 [70 Cal.Rptr.3d 352] <em>(Kenneth J.).) </em>And helpful to our inquiry, the Court of Appeal, First District, Division Two, has very recently performed just this function in a case remarkably similar to ours.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In <em>Kenneth J., </em>the minor, like appellant, denied the allegations against him contained in a section 602 petition and requested a contested jurisdictional hearing after the prosecutor found him eligible for DEJ. But thereafter, no hearing was held to assess the minor\u2019s suitability for DEJ. <em>(Kenneth J., supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th at pp. 980-981.) On appeal, the minor argued the juvenile court committed reversible error in failing to discharge its mandatory statutory duty under section 791, subdivision (b) to hold such hearing. <em>(Kenneth J., supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th at pp. 979-980.) Our colleagues rejected the minor\u2019s argument. In particular, in determining the scope of the juvenile court\u2019s mandatory duties under section 791, subdivision (b), the appellate court declined to consider the provision in isolation. Rather, the appellate court looked to the statute in its entirety, including subdivisions (a) <em>and </em>(b). <em>(Kenneth J., supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th at pp. 979-980.) Under section 791, subdivision (a), the court noted, the prosecutor\u2019s written notice to the minor concerning his or her eligibility for DEJ must include, in addition to a full description of the DEJ procedures, \u201c \u2018[a] clear statement that, in lieu of jurisdictional and dispositional hearings, the court may grant a [DEJ with respect to any offense charged in the petition,] <em>provided that the minor admits each allegation contained in the petition and waives time for pronouncement of </em>judgment....\u2019\u201d <em>(Kenneth J., supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th at p. 979.) The court then reasoned that, where the minor declines to admit each allegation in the petition, as subdivision (a) requires, no duty on behalf of the juvenile court arises under subdivision (b) to refer the case to the probation department or to summarily grant DEJ: \u201c[The minor\u2019s] approach erroneously assumes that a juvenile court can start the DEJ process in the teeth of the minor\u2019s opposition\u2014in effect, that the DEJ procedure can be forced on an unwilling minor. That is clearly illogical, as there is nothing in the statutory language of <em>section 791 or California Rules of Court, rule 5.800 </em>which suggests that a minor can be compelled to accept DEJ. Or to put it conversely, the language in the statute and <em>rule 5.800 </em>requires some measure of consent.\u201d <em>(Kenneth J., supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th at p. 979, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u201cIt is perhaps true the DEJ statutes make no express provision for a minor in Kenneth\u2019s position, one who is advised of his DEJ eligibility, who does not admit the charges in the petition or waive a jurisdictional hearing, and who does not show the least interest in probation, but who insists on a jurisdictional hearing in order to contest the charges. But the DEJ is clearly intended to provide an expedited mechanism for channeling certain first-time offenders away from the full panoply of a contested delinquency proceeding. That goal could not coexist with a minor who insists on exercising every procedural protection offered, and who then on appeal faults the juvenile court for not intervening and short circuiting those very protections. This would place a juvenile court in an impossible \u2018Heads he wins, tails I lose\u2019 situation\u2014not to mention apparently compelling a juvenile court to hold a hearing to consider DEJ for a minor who evinces no interest whatsoever in that option. We decline to adopt such a mischievous, if not self-defeating, construction.\u201d <em>(Kenneth J., supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th at pp. 979-980.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">We find our colleagues\u2019 reasoning compelling and, thus, follow it for purposes of this case. As such, we conclude the juvenile court committed no error in failing to hold a hearing to determine appellant\u2019s suitability for DEJ once it became clear appellant was not admitting the allegations against him, but rather was insisting on contesting them at a jurisdictional hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We thus turn to appellant\u2019s remaining contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">II. <em>Failure to Designate the Sustained Offense as a Felony or Misdemeanor</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The dispositional order is set aside, and the matter is remanded to the juvenile court for further proceedings in compliance with section 702 and California Rules of Court, rule 5.795(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">McGuiness, R J., and Siggins, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 11, 2008, SI62303.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-11\">Judge of the Alameda Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-12\"> Unless otherwise stated, all statutory citations herein are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-5\"> Section 790 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">\u201c(a) Notwithstanding Section 654 or 654.2, or any other provision of law, this article shall apply whenever a case is before the juvenile court for a determination of whether a minor is a person described in Section 602 because of the commission of a felony offense, if all of the following circumstances apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">\u201c(1) The minor has not previously been declared to be a ward of the court for the commission of a felony offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">\u201c(2) The offense charged is not one of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (b) of Section 707.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">\u201c(3) The minor has not previously been committed to the custody of the Youth Authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">\u201c(4) The minor\u2019s record does not indicate that probation has ever been revoked without being completed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">\u201c(5) The minor is at least 14 years of age at the time of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-12\">\u201c(6) The minor is eligible for probation pursuant to Section 1203.06 of the Penal Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-13\">\u201c(b) The prosecuting attorney shall review his or her file to determine whether or not paragraphs (1) to (6), inclusive, of subdivision (a) apply.

Here, the prosecuting attorney satisfied the initial statutory obligation to consider DEJ. <em>In re Luis B. </em>is factually distinguished by Kenneth\u2019s actions that were tantamount to a rejection of DEJ.\u201d <em>(Kenneth J., supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th at p. 980.) The same is true in our case. While the prosecutor indeed satisfied his initial duty to determine whether appellant was eligible for DEJ, appellant thereafter effectively rejected DEJ consideration when he denied the allegations against him and insisted on a contested jurisdictional hearing. As such, as explained above, any duty the juvenile court may have had to determine whether appellant was suitable for DEJ was excused.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 276.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
