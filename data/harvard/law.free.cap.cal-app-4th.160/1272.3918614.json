Actually, the warranty provided coverage, subject to sweeping exclusions, for the whole home for just one year, and for the electrical, plumbing, and mechanical systems for just two years; after that, the only coverage it provided was for \u201cload-bearing elements,\u201d and then only if the damage to them made the home \u201cunsafe, unsanitary, or otherwise unlivable.\u201d Some versions of the warranty purported to relieve the builder of any liability <em>except </em>under the warranty. Finally\u2014and crucially\u2014the warranty included arbitration provisions, purporting to require the purchaser to arbitrate disputes arising from or related to not only the warranty, but also the home, the sale of the home, and the arbitration provisions themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-11\">When plaintiffs filed suit against the alleged builders, alleging construction defects, the builders moved to compel arbitration. The trial court denied the motions, because it found that \u201cthis agreement\u201d was \u201cunconscionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-12\">The builders appeal. They contend that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-13\">1. Pursuant to the arbitration provisions, the question of whether the arbitration provisions are unconscionable must be decided by the arbitrator, not by the trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>2. Assuming the trial court was even allowed to consider whether the arbitration provisions are unconscionable, it had to consider them by themselves, not together with the overall warranty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-5\">3. The arbitration provisions, when considered by themselves, are not unconscionable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-6\">4. Even assuming some of the arbitration provisions are unconscionable, the trial court should have severed them and enforced the remaining arbitration provisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-7\">5. Even assuming the trial court could consider the overall warranty, the overall warranty is not unconscionable or otherwise unenforceable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-8\">We will hold that because plaintiffs are claiming, under the general rubric of unconscionability, that they never knowingly agreed to the arbitration provisions, the trial court, and not the arbitrator, had to resolve the unconscionability claim. We will further hold that the arbitration provisions were unconscionable because they were contained in a contract of adhesion, and they violated plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable expectations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-10\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-11\">In May 2005, Gabriel and Josephine Bruni and other individuals filed a complaint against James H. Didion, Sr. (Didion). Plaintiffs alleged that in 2001, they or their predecessors in interest purchased from Didion a total of 17 homes that Didion had built in \u201cHeritage,\u201d a development in Yucaipa. Plaintiffs later discovered that these homes were defective. The defects allegedly included \u201cdefective installation of windows, waterproofing, short roof underlayerment [and] excessive stucco cracking,\u201d which resulted in \u201cwater intrusion, water damage, and other . . . property damage.\u201d They asserted causes of action for breach of contract, breach of implied warranties, negligence, strict liability, and intentional and negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-12\">Also in May 2005, James and Pamela Alvarado and other individuals filed a similar complaint against Howard Roberts Development Co. (HRD) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>Didion (collectively defendants), alleging that Didion was HRD\u2019s joint venturer and alter ego. Plaintiffs alleged that in 2002 and 2003, they or their predecessors in interest purchased a total of 20 homes from defendants that defendants had built in \u201cThe Groves at Chapman Heights,\u201d a development in Yucaipa. Plaintiffs later discovered that these homes had various defects. They asserted causes of action for breach of contract, breach of implied warranties, negligence, strict liability, and intentional and negligent misrepresentation. In addition, they asserted statutory causes of action based on Business and Professions Code sections 7031 (unlicensed contractor), 17200 (unfair competition), and 17500 (false advertising) and Civil Code section 896 (building standards for new homes).</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">The same law firm represented both the Bruni plaintiffs and the Alvarado plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">In March 2006, defendants filed motions to compel arbitration in both actions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs opposed the motions on a number of grounds, including that the arbitration provisions were unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">In June 2006, the trial court denied the motions. It explained: \u201c[T]he protections provided to the builder under this agreement far exceed those benefits provided to the home purchaser. Circumstances of the explanation and execution of this agreement dictate a finding that a minimum le[vel] of integrity in the process was not reached here. See the case of Graham v. Scissor-Tail, Incorporated, a 1981 case, at 28 Cal.3d 807 [171 Cal.Rptr. 604, 623 P.2d 165]. The results of this agreement are too one-sided not to be found unconscionable. See Pardee Construction Company v. Superior Court, a 2002 case, at 100 Cal.App.4th, 1081 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 288],</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">\u201cFurthermore, the circumstances of its execution indicate that it is a contract of adhesion. The Court finds that the arbitration agreements are both procedurally and substantively unconscionable. For the record, the Court\u2019s decision is not based upon whether or not the plaintiffs read the agreement or understood it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">Defendants\u2019 counsel asked the trial court to specify the provision or provisions that were substantively unconscionable, but it declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">Defendants filed notices of appeal in both actions. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1294, subd. (a) [order denying a petition to compel arbitration is appeal-able]; <em>Mercury Ins. Group </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 332, 349 [79 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 308, 965 P.2d 1178].) We granted defendants\u2019 unopposed motion to consolidate the two appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">HRD, a home builder, provided a warranty program created and administered by Home Buyers Warranty Corporation (HBW), a Colorado corporation. To enroll a home in the warranty program, HRD sent HBW an enrollment fee and an application form, signed by both the home buyer and HRD. HBW then sent the home buyer a certificate of warranty coverage and a warranty booklet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">The provisions of the one-page application form were in approximately seven-point type. The form stated, \u201cBy signing below, you acknowledge that you have . . . read a sample copy of the Warranty Booklet and CONSENT TO THE TERMS OF THESE DOCUMENTS INCLUDING THE BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION contained therein. You further understand that when the warranty is issued on your new home it is an Express Limited Warranty and that all claims and liabilities are limited to and by the terms and conditions of the Express Limited Warranty as stated in the . . . [b]ooklet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">The warranty booklet, entitled \u201c2-10 Home Buyers Warranty\u201d (the Warranty), was 30 pages long. Most of its provisions were in approximately 10-point type. The Warranty was a contract between HRD and the home buyer. HRD\u2019s liability under the Warranty was limited to \u201cthe original sales price of your Home . . . .\u201d Some or all of HRD\u2019s potential liability was covered by risk retention insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">The Warranty provided three categories of coverage. First, under the \u201cworkmanship\u201d coverage, the home was warranted for one year to \u201cbe free from defects in material and workmanship as defined in the Construction Quality Standards . . . .\u201d The Construction Quality Standards took up 19 of the 30 pages of the Warranty. They specified performance standards for different aspects of the construction; however, in the course of doing so, they also set forth additional limitations and exclusions. For example, next to \u201cCracking of attached garage floor slab,\u201d they provided, \u201cNO COVERAGE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-11\">Second, under the \u201cSystems\u201d coverage, the home was warranted for two years to \u201cbe free from defects in the electrical, plumbing, and mechanical systems to the extent stated in the same Construction Quality Standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-12\">Finally, the home was warranted for 10 years \u201cagainst a Structural Defect.\u201d \u201cStructural Defect\u201d was defined as \u201cactual physical damage to the designated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>load-bearing elements of the Home caused by failure of such load-bearing elements which affects their load-bearing functions to the extent that your Home becomes unsafe, unsanitary, or otherwise unlivable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">The Warranty excluded any coverage for \u201c[d]amage to swimming pools ... ; driveways; boundary walls, retaining walls, and bulkheads (except where boundary walls, retaining walls and bulkheads are necessary for the structural stability of the Home); fences; landscaping . . . ; sprinkler systems; patios, decks, stoops, steps and porches, outbuildings [and] detached carports . . . .\u201d It also excluded any coverage for \u201c[n]oncompliance with plans and specifications\u201d or \u201cviolations of local or national building codes, ordinances or standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">The 2001 and 2002 versions of the Warranty further provided; \u201cTHIS IS AN EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY. All other express or implied warranties, including any oral or written statements or representations made by your Builder or any other person, and any implied warranty of habitability, merchantability or fitness, are hereby disclaimed by your [B]uilder and are hereby waived by you. In addition, you are waiving the right to seek damages or other legal or equitable remedies from your Builder . . . under any other common law or statutory theory of liability, including but not limited to negligence or strict liability. Your only remedy in the event of a defect in or to your Home ... is the coverage provided to you under this express limited warranty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">The 2003 version of the Warranty, however, provided: \u201cThe protection provided to you under this Warranty is not in limitation of, but is in addition to, any other rights provided to you under California law.\u201d (Boldface omitted.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">Finally, the Warranty included the following arbitration provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-9\">\u201cARBITRATION Any and all claims, disputes and controversies by or between the Homeowner [and] the Builder . . . arising from or related to this Warranty, to the subject Home, to any defect in or to the subject Home . . . , or the sale of the subject Home by the Builder, including[,] without limitation, any claim of breach of contract, negligent or intentional misrepresentation or nondisclosure in the inducement, execution or performance of any contract, including this arbitration agreement, and breach of any alleged duty of good faith and fair dealing, shall be submitted to arbitration by and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>pursuant to the rules of Construction Arbitration Services, Inc. . . . [, or by such other arbitration service as HBW shall, in its sole discretion^] select, and pursuant to the rules of that arbitration service . . . .][<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-5\">\u201cThis arbitration agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Builder\u2019s . . . agents . . . and any other person whom [sic] the homeowner contends is responsible for any defect in or to the subject Home .... The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-6\">\u201cThis arbitration agreement shall be deemed to be a self-executing arbitration agreement. Any disputes concerning the interpretation or the enforceability of this arbitration agreement, including[,] without limitation, its revocability or voidability for any cause, the scope of arbitrable issues, and any defense based upon waiver, estoppel or laches, shall be decided by the arbitrator. [][]... H]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-7\">\u201cThe parties expressly agree that this Warranty and this arbitration agreement involve and concern interstate commerce and are governed by the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, et seq.) . . . , to the exclusion of any different or inconsistent state or local law, ordinance or judicial rule ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-8\">\u201cIf any provision of this arbitration agreement shall be determined by the arbitrator or by any court to be unenforceable or to have been waived, the remaining provisions shall be deemed to be severable therefore and enforceable according to their terms.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">Construction Arbitration Services, Inc. (CAS), is the largest alternative dispute resolution service in the United States that specializes in residential construction disputes. It has a panel of approximately 1,200 professional arbitrators throughout the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">Under CAS rules, \u201c[t]he arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement, [f] . . . The arbitrator shall have the power to determine the existence or validity of a contract of which the arbitration clause forms a part. Such an arbitration clause shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitrator that the contract is null and void shall not, for that reason alone, render the arbitration clause invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>When plaintiffs purchased their homes, they met with an HRD salesperson to sign the necessary documents. The salesperson provided a \u201cbrief overview\u201d of the documents and told plaintiffs where to sign or initial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">The documents were preprinted and \u201cvoluminous.\u201d There was no negotiation. Plaintiffs understood that the documents were being presented to them on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis. While some of them had purchased a home before, plaintiffs generally were not familiar with real estate documents or with \u201clegalese.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">Plaintiffs were not told to read the Warranty before signing. The signing process was \u201cpretty quick,\u201d typically 30 to 45 minutes; there was not enough time to read the Warranty or any of the other documents. Usually, plaintiffs received a copy of the Warranty, along with the other documents, after they were finished signing. Some, however, claimed that they did not receive it until after they had moved in. A few did not receive it at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">Some plaintiffs were told that the warranty was \u201ca benefit,\u201d \u201can added bonus,\u201d \u201cextra protection,\u201d or \u201ca huge gift from the builder.\u201d Others were told that it \u201cwould cover any problems with the home.\u201d Plaintiffs were never told how the Warranty would affect their legal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">A. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">\u201cThe petitioner bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by the preponderance of the evidence, and a party opposing the petition bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense. [Citation.] In these summary proceedings, the trial court sits as a trier of fact, weighing all the affidavits, declarations, and other documentary evidence, as well as oral testimony received at the court\u2019s discretion, to reach a final determination. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 972 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 938 P.2d 903].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-12\">\u201c \u2018We will uphold the trial court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts if supported by substantial evidence. [Citation.] Where, however, there is no disputed extrinsic evidence considered by the trial court, we will review its arbitrability decision de novo.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Giuliano </em>v. <em>Inland Empire Personnel, Inc. </em>(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1284 [58 Cal.Rptr.3d 5], quoting <em>Nyulassy v. Lockheed Martin Corp. </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1267, 1277 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>296].) \u201cWhether an arbitration provision is unconscionable is ultimately a question of law. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Higgins </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1238, 1250 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 293].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">In this case, there was no dispute as to the historical facts, only as to the legal conclusions to be drawn from those facts; however, in one instance, it was possible to draw conflicting inferences from the otherwise uncontradicted evidence. Some\u2014but not all\u2014of the plaintiffs filed declarations in opposition to the motions, stating that they did not read the purchase documents, that there was no negotiation, etc. One could infer that the nontestifying plaintiffs\u2019 experiences were similar; on the other hand, from their very failure to testify, one could infer that their experiences were different. In this one instance, then, we presume that the trial court drew the inference most favorable to plaintiffs. Otherwise, we will apply a de novo standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">B. Prima Paint <em>and the Severability Doctrine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">\u201c[W]hen considering a motion to compel arbitration, the court must initially \u2018determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute in question.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018This determination involves two considerations: (1) whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties; and (2) whether the dispute in question falls within the scope of that arbitration agreement.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Banks v. Mitsubishi Motors Credit of America, Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 2005) 435 F.3d 538, 540 [156 Fed.Appx. 710], quoting <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Investacorp, Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 1996) 89 F.3d 252, 258; see also Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1281.2; <em>id., </em>subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">Ordinarily, the court cannot consider any claim that the contract as a whole is invalid. Under <em>Prima Paint v. Flood &amp; Conklin </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 395 [18 L.Ed.2d 1270, 87 S.Ct. 1801] <em>(Prima Paint), </em>when the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq.) (FAA) applies, \u201carbitration clauses as a matter of federal law are \u2018separable\u2019 from the contracts in which they are embedded . . . .\u201d <em>(Prima Paint, </em>at p. 402, fn. omitted.) As a result, an arbitration clause may be enforceable regardless of whether the contract surrounding it is enforceable. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-11\">For example, in <em>Prima Paint </em>itself, the party resisting arbitration claimed that it had been fraudulently induced to enter the contract. <em>(Prima Paint, supra, </em>388 U.S. at p. 398.) The court held that, if the party had been claiming \u201cfraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself,\u201d a court would have to adjudicate that claim before it could compel arbitration. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 403-404.) However, the party could be compelled to arbitrate a claim of \u201cfraud in the inducement of the contract generally.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-12\">Recently, in <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna </em>(2006) 546 U.S. 440 [163 L.Ed.2d 1038, 126 S.Ct. 1204] <em>(Buckeye), </em>the Supreme Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number><em>Prima Paint </em>applies to void as well as voidable contracts. <em>(Buckeye, </em>at pp. 446-447 [126 S.Ct. at pp. 1209-1210].) There, the parties resisting arbitration claimed that the contract was illegal because it was usurious and \u201cviolated various [state] lending and consumer-protection laws . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 443 [126 S.Ct. at p. 1207].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">The Supreme Court held that the FAA required the illegality claim to be submitted to the arbitrator: \u201cChallenges to the validity of arbitration agreements . . . can be divided into two types. One type challenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate. [Citation.] The other challenges the contract as a whole .... Respondents\u2019 claim is of this second type.\u201d <em>(Buckeye, supra, </em>546 U.S. at p. 444 [126 S.Ct. at p. 1208], fn. omitted.) Under <em>Prima Paint, </em>it concluded, \u201cunless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of the contract\u2019s validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first instance.\u201d <em>(Buckeye, </em>at pp. 445-446 [126 S.Ct. at p. 1209].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">The court observed: \u201cIt is true . . . that the <em>Prima Paint </em>rule permits a court to enforce an arbitration agreement in a contract that the arbitrator later finds to be void. But it is equally true that [the opposite] approach permits a court to deny effect to an arbitration provision in a contract that the court later finds to be perfectly enforceable. <em>Prima Paint </em>resolved this conundrum\u2014and resolved it in favor of the separate enforceability of arbitration provisions.\u201d <em>(Buckeye, supra, </em>546 U.S. at pp. 448-449 [126 S.Ct. at p. 1210].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">A court, however, still must consider one type of challenge to the overall contract: a claim that the party resisting arbitration never actually agreed to be bound. (See <em>Buckeye, supra, </em>546 U.S. at p. 444, fn. 1 [126 S.Ct. at p. 1208, fn. 1] [noting that \u201c[o]ur opinion today . . . does not speak to\u201d \u201cthe issue [of] whether any agreement between the alleged obligor and obligee was ever concluded\u201d].) \u201c \u2018[Arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. </em>(2002) 537 U.S. 79, 83 [154 L.Ed.2d 491, 123 S.Ct. 588], quoting <em>Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Co. </em>(1960) 363 U.S. 574, 582 [4 L.Ed.2d 1409, 80 S.Ct. 1347].) \u201cWhere ... a party\u2019s apparent assent to a written contract is <em>negated . . . , </em>there is simply no arbitration agreement to be enforced.\u201d <em>(Rosenthal v.

Plaintiffs respond that, at least for purposes of the motion to compel arbitration, their unconscionability claim was directed solely at the arbitration provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Defendants, however, also contend that, even assuming plaintiffs <em>are </em>challenging only the arbitration provisions, the trial court <em>still </em>should have compelled arbitration. They note that, under the arbitration provisions here, it was up to the arbitrator to decide whether the arbitration provisions themselves were valid. They argue that such \u201c[agreements to arbitrate issues of arbitrability are enforceable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">Because the parties are the masters of their collective fate, they can agree to arbitrate almost any dispute\u2014even a dispute over whether the underlying dispute is subject to arbitration. However, there is a presumption that they have <em>not </em>agreed to this. \u201cThe question whether the parties have submitted a particular dispute to arbitration, <em>i.e., </em>the <em>\u2018question of arbitrability, </em>\u2019 is \u2018an issue for judicial determination [ujnless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Howsam </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., supra, </em>537 U.S. at p. 83, quoting <em>AT&amp;T Technologies v.

(See <em>Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., supra, </em>537 U.S. at p. 84.) It seems clear that the parties can agree to have \u201carbitrability\u201d\u2014in the sense of the <em>scope </em>of the arbitration provisions\u2014 decided by the arbitrator. For example, in <em>Dream Theater, Inc. v. Dream Theater </em>(2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 547 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 322], there was no dispute that the parties had entered into a valid and binding arbitration agreement (see <em>id. </em>at p. 555); the parties resisting arbitration merely disputed the scope of that agreement. They argued that one of the other side\u2019s claims was not arbitrable because it arose under a different contract, which did not have an arbitration clause; they also argued that the other side had waived one of its claims. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 557.) The appellate court held that the parties had \u201cclearly and unmistakably agreed that the arbitrator will decide the <em>scope </em>of the arbitration agreement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 553, some italics omitted, capitalization omitted; see also <em>id. </em>at pp. 553-557; accord, <em>Rodriguez v.

Nokia Corp. </em>(Fed.Cir. 2006) 466 F.3d 1366, there does not seem to have been any dispute that the parties had entered into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>a valid and binding arbitration agreement. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 1368.) Rather, the parties resisting arbitration argued that the underlying dispute did not arise out of or relate to the particular contract that contained the arbitration clause. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1373; see also <em>id. </em>at pp. 1368-1369.) The appellate court held that the arbitration agreement \u201cclearly and unmistakably shows the parties\u2019 intent to delegate the issue of determining arbitrability to an arbitrator.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1373; see also <em>Mercedes Homes, Inc. v.

At first glance, this appears hopelessly circular: It presumes that the parties are bound by the arbitration clause, even though this is the very issue that has yet to be decided. However, the only way to avoid such circularity is to presume that the parties are <em>not </em>bound by the arbitration clause, even though it may yet be decided that they <em>are.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">Thus, an agreement to arbitrate the validity of an arbitration clause presents the same \u201cconundrum\u201d that was noted in <em>Buckeye, supra, </em>546 U.S. at page 449 [126 S.Ct. at page 1210]. According to <em>Buckeye, \u201cPrima Paint </em>resolved this conundrum\u2014and resolved it in favor of the separate enforceability of arbitration provisions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We therefore conclude that <em>Prima Paint, </em>and the cases following it, provide the solution to the conundrum here, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">Under these circumstances, a court must look to the <em>precise nature of the claim </em>that the party resisting arbitration is making. If it is claiming that it never agreed to the arbitration clause at all\u2014e.g., if it is claiming forgery or fraud in the factum\u2014then the court must consider that claim. On the other hand, if it is not denying that it agreed to the arbitration clause, but instead it is claiming some other defense to enforcement of the arbitration clause\u2014e.g., illegality or fraud in the inducement\u2014then the court must enforce the \u201carbitrability\u201d portion of the arbitration clause by compelling the parties to submit that defense to arbitration. This approach is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s direction that \u201c[cjourts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is \u2018clea[r] and unmistakabl[e]\u2019 evidence that they did so.

Palmer Ranch Ltd. Partnership </em>(11th Cir. 2005) 432 F.3d 1327. There, Terminix sought to compel arbitration of its dispute with Palmer Ranch. Palmer Ranch argued that the applicable arbitration clauses were illegal and unenforceable because they purported to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>limit its statutory rights and remedies, including its right to recover punitive damages, treble damages, attorney fees, and injunctive and declaratory relief. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1329.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">The appellate court noted that the arbitration clause incorporated American Arbitration Association rules and that these rules \u201cprovide[d] that \u2018[t]he arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Terminix Intern, v. Palmer Ranch Ltd. Partnership, supra, </em>432 F.3d at p. 1332.) Thus, the parties had \u201cclearly and unmistakably agreed that the arbitrator should decide whether the arbitration clause is valid.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court concluded: \u201cBecause the parties have agreed that the arbitrator should decide this ultimate question, there is no reason for us to decide the subsidiary, antecedent questions regarding the validity of the remedial restrictions that Palmer Ranch now challenges.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1333.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">Significantly, in <em>Terminix Intern, </em>v. <em>Palmer Ranch Ltd. Partnership, supra, </em>432 F.3d 1327, Palmer Ranch was <em>not </em>claiming that it had not knowingly agreed to the arbitration clause. Instead, it was asserting a claim of illegality, much like the one in <em>Buckeye. </em>Thus, <em>Terminix </em>is not inconsistent with our view that, if the parties have agreed to arbitrate issues regarding the validity of the arbitration clause, a party that is claiming illegality can be compelled to arbitrate that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">D. <em>Application to Plaintiffs\u2019 Unconscionability Claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-8\">We now apply these general principles to plaintiffs\u2019 unconscionability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\">1. <em>General unconscionability principles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-10\">\u201cUnconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element.

Some cases have invalidated adhesion contract terms as beyond the reasonable expectations of the weaker party without any discussion of whether the terms were unconscionable. (E.g., <em>Fischer v.

Hence, if the party resisting arbitration is claiming that the arbitration clause itself is unconscionable, a court must decide this claim. <em>(Discover Bank v.

However, provided the court concludes that the arbitration clause itself is not unconscionable, it must compel arbitration, leaving it up to the arbitrator to determine whether the contract as a whole is unconscionable. <em>(Nagrampa, </em>at pp. 1270-1277; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>First American Cash Advance of Georgia </em>(11th Cir. 2005) 400 F.3d 868, 877.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">The case before us is not ordinary, however, because the arbitration provisions here empower the arbitrator to determine arbitrability. Accordingly, as we discussed in part IIIC., <em>ante, </em>we must look to the precise nature of plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">We may assume, without deciding, that if plaintiffs were admitting that they knowingly agreed to the arbitration provisions, they could be required to arbitrate an unconscionability claim. For example, in <em>Stewart v. Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker, LLP </em>(S.D.N.Y. 2002) 201 F.Supp.2d 291, it was \u201cundisputed that [the] plaintiff, as a condition of commencing her former employment, [had] signed a broad arbitration agreement with defendant. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 292.) The plaintiff argued, however, that the arbitration clause was unconscionable \u201cbecause arbitration before the AAA, the forum selected by the clause, would be \u2018an uneven playing field,\u2019 the plaintiff \u2018must foot half the bill,\u2019 the forum is biased, the plaintiff has less time to file a claim, the opportunities for discovery are more limited, and any recovery inevitably would be smaller.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court held that \u201cthe issue of enforceability of the clause in the first instance is for the arbitrator, as the arbitration clause explicitly provides that the arbitrator has exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any dispute as to whether \u2018all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-9\">Here, however, plaintiffs are claiming that they never knowingly agreed to the arbitration provisions. As in most, if not all, adhesion contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>cases, they deny ever reading them. The general rule \u201c \u2018that one who signs an instrument may not avoid the impact of its terms on the ground that he failed to read the instrument before signing it\u2019 \u201d applies only in the absence of \u201c \u2018overreaching\u2019 \u201d <em>(Stewart </em>v. <em>Preston Pipeline Inc. </em>(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1565, 1588 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 901]) or \u201c \u2018 \u201cimposition\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Jefferson v.

Superior Court </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 723 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 35] (Fourth Dist., Div. Two), we distinguished <em>Pardee, </em>finding no evidence that a buyer could not have rejected the judicial reference provision and no evidence from which this could even have been inferred (e.g., that the homes were \u201c \u2018entry level,\u2019 \u201d or that \u201csimilarly priced housing stock in the region\u201d was unavailable). <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 728-729.) We also noted that \u201cthe Buyers were necessarily \u2018made aware of the existence of [the judicial reference] provision\u2019 because they had to initial the paragraph separately. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 729, quoting <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>St. Joseph Hospital </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 345, 361 [133 Cal.Rptr. 775].) We concluded, \u201cEven if we do assume an imbalance in bargaining power, and that [the builder], as the stronger party, presumably prepared the contracts with an eye to its own advantage, and even if we also assume that [the builder] would not have countenanced the striking of the judicial reference provisions, the Buyers have nevertheless only shown a low level of procedural unconscionability because . . . the elements of surprise or, a fortiori, misrepresentation [citation] were not present.\u201d <em>(Woodside Homes, </em>at p. 730.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">Similarly, in <em>Trend Homes, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 950 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 411], the court also distinguished <em>Pardee. </em>It noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>(1) the judicial reference provision was \u201cclearly written, entirely capitalized, and easily understood\u201d; (2) both parties had to separately initial the provision, suggesting not only that the buyers had actual notice of it, but also that they could have refused to agree to it; (3) there was no evidence that the builder would have refused to delete the provision; (4) \u201cthere was no evidence concerning the availability of similarly priced housing in the area\u201d; (5) there was no evidence that the buyers \u201clacked the education, experience, or sophistication necessary to understand the contracts\u201d; and (6) the buyers \u201cdid not state that they had insufficient time to read the provision, were pressured to sign it without reading it carefully, or were not afforded the opportunity to consult with anyone else, such as an attorney, before signing . . . .\u201d <em>(Trend Homes, </em>at pp. 958-959.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">Here, the trial court found that the arbitration provisions were part of a contract of adhesion. Although we are not bound by this finding, we agree with it. The reality of the transaction was that plaintiffs had to accept the arbitration provisions if they wanted to buy a house. The arbitration provisions were part of a preprinted form contract, presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Even assuming that plaintiffs could have negotiated over some terms of the purchase and sale agreement, such as the purchase price, it seems apparent that any attempt to negotiate over the terms of the Warranty would have been fruitless, particularly because it arose out of a three-way relationship between the home buyer; HRD; and HBW, the administrator, which provided it as a package deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">In addition, there is a strong showing of surprise. The arbitration provisions take up roughly one full page in a 30-page booklet. The entire booklet is in single-spaced, 10-point type. The arbitration provisions are not distinguished from the rest of the booklet by either bolding or capitalization. The booklet, in turn, was buried in a \u201cvoluminous\u201d stack of purchase and sale documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">Most important, plaintiffs were never asked to sign or initial the booklet, much less the arbitration provisions; they were merely asked to sign the one-page application. Admittedly, the application did indicate\u2014in capital letters\u2014that the booklet contained binding arbitration provisions; however, it did not provide any information regarding their scope or effect. It also recited that the home buyer had read a sample booklet, even though plaintiffs were not actually given a sample booklet until after they had signed the whole stack of documents\u2014sometimes not even until they had moved in. HRD\u2019s agents lessened any incentive plaintiffs might have had to read the booklet by describing the Warranty as a benefit or a bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-8\">We recognize that there was no evidence regarding the availability of similarly priced housing in the area. Nevertheless, the most recent view is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>that \u201cthe absence of reasonable market alternatives\u201d has no bearing on whether a contract is adhesive. <em>(Morris v. Redwood Empire Bancorp </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1320 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 797]; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 1319-1320, fn. 6 [\u201c[t]he current definition of adhesion used by our Supreme Court . . . does not include a requirement that there exist alternative sources of supply\u201d].) Rather, this factor is relevant to the distinct question of whether the contract\u2014adhesive or not\u2014is \u201coppressive,\u201d for purposes of procedural unconscionability. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">Interestingly, in <em>Burch v. Dist. Ct. </em>(2002) 118 Nev. 438 [49 P.3d 647], the Nevada Supreme Court was dealing with a \u201c2-10 Home Buyers Warranty\u201d essentially identical to the one here and an essentially identical application form. The court held that the warranty was a contract of adhesion: \u201c[T]he one-page \u2018application\u2019 and the [warranty] were pre-printed, standardized contract forms. The Burches, the weaker party, were not given an opportunity to negotiate the [warranty]\u2019s terms with [the builder] or its insurer . . . ; they were required to \u2018take it or leave it.\u2019 Therefore, the [warranty] agreement between the Burches and [the builder] is an adhesion contract.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">We similarly conclude that the arbitration provisions were contained in a contract of adhesion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">b. <em>Reasonable expectations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-8\">We turn, then, to whether the arbitration provisions violated plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable expectations. In doing so, we are mindful that our consideration is limited to the arbitration provisions themselves. Accordingly, we do not consider the other provisions of the Warranty, except insofar as they may bear on the scope or effect of the arbitration provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-9\">Defendants argue that the arbitration provisions were only to be expected, because \u201c[Residential purchase agreements frequently include arbitration agreements or some form of alternative dispute resolution provision.\u201d Here, however, the arbitration provisions were not contained within the main purchase and sale agreement; instead, they were contained in what was labeled as a warranty. Thus, plaintiffs would reasonably expect that the arbitration provisions would apply only to disputes over the Warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-10\">Instead, the actual scope of the arbitration provisions was unforeseeably broad. They purported to apply not only to disputes \u201carising from or related to this Warranty,\u201d but also to all disputes \u201carising from or related to . . . the subject Home, . . . any defect in or to the subject Home . . . , or the sale of the subject Home by the Builder . . . .\u201d This would not have been within plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>Moreover, at least in the 2001 and 2002 versions, the Warranty purported to relieve the builder of any liability, <em>except </em>under the Warranty. As a result, <em>any </em>claim against defendants became a claim \u201carising from or related to\u201d the Warranty itself and hence a claim within the scope of the arbitration provisions. For example, in the Alvarado action, plaintiffs assert a cause of action against defendants for acting as unlicensed contractors. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7031, subd. (b).) The Warranty, however, provided, \u201c[Y]ou are waiving the right to seek damages . . . from your Builder . . . under any other common law or statutory theory of liability . . . .\u201d For this reason, this cause of action falls within the scope of the arbitration provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Finally, the arbitration provisions also purported to apply to disputes over arbitrability. As the United States Supreme Court has noted, the question of who should decide arbitrability \u201cis rather arcane. A party often might not focus upon that question or upon the significance of having arbitrators decide the scope of their own powers. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 945.) Thus, this provision, too, was well beyond a layperson\u2019s reasonable expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">5. <em>Severability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">Defendants point out that the arbitration provisions include a severance clause. They argue that, even if some part of the arbitration provisions is held to be unconscionable, the remainder should be severed and enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">As we just indicated, however, the problem is that the scope of the arbitration provisions exceeded plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable expectations. Plaintiffs reasonably would have expected them, at most, to apply to disputes arising under the Warranty. The Bruni plaintiffs did not assert any cause of action based on the Warranty. In the Alvarado action, just one of plaintiffs\u2019 nine causes of action was for breach of the Warranty; requiring this subset of plaintiffs to arbitrate this subset of issues would be letting the arbitration tail wag the litigation dog. (Indeed, we suspect that, if this cause of action were the only basis for compelling arbitration, the Alvarado plaintiffs would dismiss it immediately.) Under these circumstances, the trial court would have abused its discretion if it had compelled arbitration. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1281.2, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\">Accordingly, even assuming severance would be warranted, it would not result in reversal of the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">The order appealed from is affirmed. Plaintiffs shall recover costs on appeal against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">McKinster, Acting P. J., and King, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">On March 24, 2008, the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 18, 2008, S162755. George, C. J., Werdegar, J., and Corrigan, J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1077-13\"> Our analysis is fundamentally consistent with the recent opinion of another panel of this court in <em>Baker v. Osborne Development Corp. </em>(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 884 [71 Cal.Rptr.3d 854] (petn. for review pending, petn. filed Mar. 4, 2008). However, in light of the petition for review filed in that case, rather than rely on it and risk having the principal support for our opinion become uncitable (see Cal. Rules of Court, rules 8.1105(e)(1), 8.1115(a)), we choose to analyze the issues independently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1078-11\"> The motion in the Bruni action was directed at 13 of the 25 plaintiffs, who owned eight of the 17 homes. The motions in the Alvarado action were directed at 30 of the 35 plaintiffs, who owned 17 of the 20 homes. All of the plaintiffs at whom the motions were directed had purchased their homes directly from HRD. Accordingly, no issue is presented with respect to whether the arbitration provisions were (or could be) binding on successors in interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1080-10\"> This wording change was due to the enactment of Civil Code section 895 et seq.
