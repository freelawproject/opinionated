The order appealed from involves the merits of the action, and affects a substantial right of the plaintiff, and is appealable (Mathews <em>v. </em>Jones, 1 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>429).</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-12\">II. The code, section 272, and rule 32 of this court require the referee in his decision and final report to state the facts found by him. The referee in this case has utterly omitted to comply with this requirement.\" Either party, as matter of right, was entitled to these findings (Wright <em>v. </em>Sanders, 28 <em>How. Pr., </em>395; Hulse <em>v. </em>Sherman, 13 <em>How. Pr., </em>411; Rogers <em>v. </em>Beard, 20 <em>How. Pr., </em>282; Peck <em>v. </em>Yorks, 14 <em>How. Pr., </em>416; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Leffler <em>v. </em>Field, 33 <em>How. </em>Pr., 390; Tilman <em>v. </em>Keane, 1 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S., </em>23; Snook <em>v. </em>Fries, 19 <em>Barb., </em>313). The issues of fact raised by the pleadings in this action, and which should have been passed upon the referee were: (1.) Were the moneys lent and advanced by Charles K. Covert to defendant, as stated in the complaint ? (2.) Was the note of Jacob A. Stamler lent to defendant by said Covert as alleged, and did defendant receive the proceeds of the discount thereof ? (3.) Did said Covert loan to defendant the note of Clara Crowell, as stated in complaint; was the same transfered by defendant, and was the same collected of said Covert. (4.) Were the goods and merchandise' sold and delivered, as stated in the complaint? (5.) Were the claims of said Covert assigned to plantiff, as stated in the complaint? (6.) Did the offset against said Covert in favor of defendant exist at the time of the assignment and transfer to plaintiff of Covert\u2019s claim against defendant. Each one of these is a very material issue, and it was a matter' of necessity for the referee to pass upon each of them before he could arrive at a proper determination. Yet it does not appear by the report whether he passed upon all or any of them. He may have found that the claims of said Covert never existed, or he may have found that said Covert never assigned his claim to plaintiff. Or, again, he may have found both of these issues in the affirmative, and yet have found that the offset in favor of defendant balanced the claim of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has a right to know the conclusions of the referee on all these issues, so that he may except to any of them which he may deem erroneons, and obtain redress for the error. As our supreme court, at general term, in Rogers v. Beard (20 <em>How. </em>Pr., 284), most justly says : \u201cIt is <em>essential </em>that the findings of the referee upon the facts be explicit, and cover <em>all </em>the material facts. Parties have a right to know the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>cise ground upon which an adverse decision is put, and it is very important to a proper review that the court be fully advised by the findings of the referee upon the precise grounds of his decision. This is also essential to secure the public confidence to this mode of trying causes.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-5\">III. The only remedy the ptaintiff has, is to have the report of the referee sent back to him for amendment, which relief the special term in this case refused. A referee on his own motion cannot, after having made his report, make any new or other findings to sustain or overthrow such report (Voorhis v. Voorhis, 50 <em>Barb., </em>119), and the court should therefore send the report back to him, with directions to state the findings of fact explicitly in his report, as has been the uniform practice of this court (see cases above).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-6\"><em>Ambrose Monell, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2I\">I. By section 373 of the Code of Procedure, all that is required of a referee in his report is \u201cto state the facts found and the conclusions of law separately.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-7\">II. Under no circumstances where he is \u201cto hear and determine,\u201d is he required to .state the evidence on which he bases his findings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-8\">III. The issues were \u201cwhether defendant was or was not indebted to Covert, and subsequently to the plaintiff as assignee,\u201d and the only finding of fact on such issue should be whether he was or was not so indebted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-9\">IY. The findings distinctly pass upon these issues, and the referee is required to find such facts only as are necessary to sustain his judgment (Nelson v. Ingersoll, 27 <em>How. Pr., </em>1; Sermont <em>v. </em>Baetjer, 49 <em>Barb., </em>363).</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-10\">Y. Should the report be thought not in conformity with the issues, it is submitted that even then that question cannot be raised on the <em>present appeal. </em>(1.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The only mode of reviewing a referee\u2019s decision after judgment is by appeal <em>(Laws of </em>1849, 680, \u00a7 323 ; Enos <em>v. </em>Thomas, 5 <em>How. Pr., </em>361, Supreme Court, 1850; Comstock <em>v. </em>Rathbone, 1 <em>Johns., </em>138).</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-4\">YI. It is farther submitted that the omission of the appellant to request the referee to pass upon any issue he desired to have passed upon, is a fatal objection to the present appeal (Grant <em>v. </em>Morse, 22 <em>N. Y., </em>323; Ashley v. Marshall, 29 <em>N. Y., </em>494; Brainerd <em>v. </em>Dunning, 30 <em>N. Y., </em>211).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b76-5\">By the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Ingraham, P. J. (orally).</author>\n<p id=\"A0q\">We do not think that the motion made in this case was the proper one. It is not the proper practice to set aside the report of a referee at chambers upon such a ground as this. The plaintiff should have moved to have the referee make a further report. There is no irregularity in this report, and the order denying a motion to set it aside for an irregularity, was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">If farther or more specific findings are necessary in such a case, the motion should be to send the case back to the referee for a further finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The order appealed from was right; and must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Present, Ingraham, P.
