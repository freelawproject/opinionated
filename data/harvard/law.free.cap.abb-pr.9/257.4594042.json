That said return does not state facts, but evidence, conclusions, and inferences from evidence so stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-14\">2. That said return is not positive or certain, but argumentative and evasive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-15\">3. That said return is inconsistent, contradictory, and false upon its face.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-16\">4. That said return contains irrelevant and immaterial matter, not responsive to the requirements of the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-17\">5. Said return does not answer the material averments and requirements of the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-18\">6. That said return is not verified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>7. That said return is not made by the Board of Police, the respondents named in the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\"><em>[Date, &amp;c.] </em>[Signature.]</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-6\"><em>John McKeon </em>and <em>John G. Devereux, </em>for the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3X\">I. The return is false, inconsistent, evasive, impertinent, and not responsive to the writ. 1. If part <em>first </em>is not false, all the rest is unnecessary. 2. The allegation in part second, that the relator refused to take office, is no return to the writ, because the first suit admits that on the 15th of April, 1857, the relator was acting as a policeman under the act of 1853; and section 32 provides not only that they shall hold office and do duty under the Metropolitan Police Act, but also as members of the police force, &amp;c., hereby constituted. The return does not deny that the relator was a member of the police force. A man may hold an office and not discharge its duties. 3. Part third is entirely inconsistent with the first and second. He could not <em>withdraw </em>if he had no valid appointment, or if he refused to take office. 4. The court will take notice that the ordinance referred to in part fourth is void. Taking office under that does not affect the relator\u2019s right to hold this office. 5. Heglect of or refusal to perform duty, is only a cause of removal. 6. Part eighth is only an averment of their own wrong, and is an act to be complained of by the relator. But it is false. 7. The ninth branch does not state what the police force is full of. The men are illegally appointed, unless the relator has been legally removed. This is no answer in any case of title. 8. The tenth return is utterly frivolous. If they can remove by leaving name off the pay-roll, section 7 is useless. 9. Part eleven is entirely irrelevant, and is not responsive to any thing contained in the writ. 10. Part twelve states only conclusions of law, and is not consistent with parts first, second, and third.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-7\">II. The objection that the writ states that the relator <em>is </em>a citizen, <em>is </em>able to read and write, and <em>is </em>in office, instead of stating that he <em>was </em>in office, &amp;c., on the 15th of April, 1857, is untenable. 1. Having answered the writ, the objection cannot now be taken. 2. It is sufficient if at the present time the relator possesses the qualifications, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-8\">III. The return should be verified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-9\">IV. In case of a return like the present, where the relator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>does not adopt it, the proper practice now adopted is to move to quash, and for a peremptory mandamus. (2 <em>Burr. Pr., </em>178, 179, and the mandamus cases there cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-5\">V. The motion to quash and for a peremptory madamus in each case should be granted with costs, the Board of Police having for a year and a half disregarded the judgment of this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-6\">VI. 'The board admit the rights of the relators by offering to restore them, if they will relinquish their pay due them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-7\"><em>James T. </em>Brady, <em>for </em>the relator.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkK\">I. A <em>mandamus </em>is the appropriate remedy in this proceeding. It is a writ of restitution, and is applied under well-established rules of law for a wrongful dispossession of an office like that in question, which has temporal rights attached to it. It is peculiarly appropriate in this case, because if the relator be held dispossessed under <em>color of </em>removal, he is disfranchised as to <em>all other offices </em>under the new police law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-8\">II. The court are not to inquire how difficult or inconvenient to the defendants, obedience to the writ may prove.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-9\">III. But there is no difficulty in the case as above suggested. There is no particular person holding the office which relator claims; that is a reason why a <em>quo warranto </em>could not be applied here, as there is no person to whom it can be addressed. The office of relator never has been vacated. The effect of the writ is to require that he be <em>recognized </em>by the board as a policeman. If the new <em>appointees </em>be continued in office, that will increase the force beyond its present active number, but there is no legal prohibition against such a result. But however that may be, the usurpers or supernumeraries should have no advantage over the original <em>legal </em>officers, and the Board of Police cannot \u201c take advantage of their own wrong,\u201d so as to use either their errors or injustices as reasons why the former should not be corrected or the latter redressed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-10\">IV. But it is said that the alternative writ is defective, and advantage of this may be taken, whatever appears in the return. This is true as to defects in substance, but not as to matters of form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-11\">V. The writ is good, in substance and form. It sets forth facts which, by the judgment of the Court of Appeals in the McCune ease, show that when the act of April 15, 1857 (the new police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>law), went into effect, the relator was <em>continued </em>in office as a policeman, and that no new <em>appointment </em>or <em>oath </em>was necessary, nor any <em>acceptance </em>nor any <em>submission </em>by him to the new board. It also alleges his citizenship, residence, capacity to read and write, &amp;c.; but these averments were wholly unnecessary, because his <em>continuance </em>in office was by reason <em>merely </em>of his being an officer under the act of 1853, and if afterwards it could be made to appear that he was not possessed of all the legal requisites to an appointment under the new law, he might possibly, by an appropriate proceeding, be removed; but, until removed, he would be an officer <em>defacto et de jure.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-5\">VI. The present motion necessarily involves a motion to quash the return. It is for a peremptory mandamus, notwithstanding such return, and if it be shown that the return is no answer to the alternative writ, the peremptory writ issues, of course. Such has been and is the practice in England, and in our own country. If our motion be in the nature of a demurrer, <em>ore </em>tenus, that does not impair the right to the relief we seek, if the return be bad. The relator may elect to demur, plead, or move for a peremptory writ, lie made his election, and served a full statement of the objections to the writ, as required by the order of Mr. Justice Sutherland, made May 31, 1859. The justice now presiding is possessed of the whole case, and can make any order in it which is legal and just.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-6\">VII. The return is fatally defective. 1. It is not ingenuous and fair. 2. It abounds in negatives pregnant, inconsistencies, repugnant averments, and the tender of wholly immaterial issues. 3. It is inconsistent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-7\">VIII. It is not correct, as argued by our opponents, that the return may contain inconsistent defences, as in \u201c actions\u201d at law, and under the statute allowing several pleas. This proceeding is not and never has been known as an action. The proceeding by mandamus is regulated in all its details by statutes applicable to it exclusively.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-8\">IX. Whether or not the relator\u2019s name appears on the present pay-rolls of the board, is of no consequence in this proceeding. The mandamus is only asked to restore the relator to office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-9\"><em>Wm. G. </em>Noyes, <em>W. M. Evarts, D.

They were policemen before, and with the name of patrolmen\u2014a merely fanciful change\u2014they were to be policemen still. They were, under existing laws, policemen for the city of New York; under the new act they were to be policemen for the city, and, nominally, for surrounding territory, although practically and almost exclusively for the city. Their executive head, instead of a \u201c Chief,\u201d was to be a <em>\u201c </em>General ;\u201d their Captains were to be \u201c Inspectors or Captains,\u201d and their Lieutenants were to be <em>\u201c </em>Sergeants.\u201d But all the leading powers, and duties, and organization, were substantially the same. In other words the new system, so called, was a modifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>cation, and not a repeal of the old; and the \u201c persons filling the offices,\u201d as the act expresses, \u201c under the old system, were compelled, under their new name, to discharge, as before, the duties of police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">It will thus he seen that it was not necessary for the complainant to aver that he had been \u201c duly appointed,\u201d but only to allege, as he does, that he was in fact a \u201c patrolman and one of the police,\u201d or, as he might have expressed it, using the language of the Legislature in the same section, <em>\u201c </em>a person filling the office\u201d at the date of the new law. That fact being established, the act itself, as we have seen, declares that his function shall \u201c continue,\u201d and that he \u201c shall hold office and do duty\u201d as a member of the police force thereby constituted\u2014subject, of course, as the next section declares, to removal in the manner prescribed, should he not possess, or, rather, should he on trial, after due notice, be found not to possess, the required qualifications. And the same section also shows, that it was no more necessary for the complainant (I use the term as more convenient than relator) to aver in the first instance that he had been \u201c illegally removed,\u201d than it was that he had been filling the office, and that he had been ejected\u2014the legality of the one and the illegality of the other, until controverted, are to be presumed. The thirty-third section declares that any member of the old police not possessed of the prescribed qualifications <em>shall be removed', </em>which implies that no member on that ground shall be treated as out, until put out by the board; and he must be put out, says the act, in the manner prescribed. \u201c Ro person shall be removed except upon written charges preferred against him by the Board of Police, and after an opportunity shall have been afforded him of being heard in his defence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">It would seem, from these considerations, to follow that several of the allegations in the writ of complaint are surplusage. If the commissioners intended to dispute the legality of the complainant\u2019s original appointment, it was for them to point out the alleged defect, and to set it up by way of affirmative defence on their part. So, also, if they intended to rely on any supposed disqualification, they should have averred in like manner a removal on written charges and due notice, giving the particulars, sufficiently, at least, to show jurisdiction. For the old policemen it was enough to aver that they were actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>filling the office at the date of the new\"law, and that the new law, by its terms, without any new oath, continued them in office; whereas the new commissioners, by their acts, without removing them, had treated them as if they were out of office, by refusing to pay the salaries to which by law they were entitled. All the rest was matter of defence, to be averred and proved by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">With this preliminary statement I shall now proceed to examine the answer or return of the commissioners, which the complainant\u2019s counsel, on various grounds assigned by them, have asked the court to quash or set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">[The opinion here recited the return, which is fully given above.]</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">This return, as will readily be seen, admits, by implication, that Beaty was a policeman <em>de facto. </em>He was, therefore, \u201c continued\u201d in office by force of the new law. Whether duly <em>appointed </em>by the old board, would seem to be a matter of no consequence. He was recognized by it and paid as a policeman; which is the whole meaning of the terms \u201c the police in the city of New York, officers and patrolmen, shall continue to do duty.\u201d \u201cThe police in the city,\u201d is an expression synonymous with that of \u201cpersons filling the office of policemen.\u201d And filling an office means, whether <em>de jure </em>or not, filling the office defaoto\u2014 that is, acting and being recognized, and being paid, without objection, as such by those who are not to be acted upon, and by those who have the power to control.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">If this view be correct, the first plea or branch of the return tenders an immaterial issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">As to the 2d, 3d, and 4th pleas, they amount in substance to one and the same thing\u2014they allege a withdrawal from, and an unequivocal refusal to act under, the police establishment as newly organized; in other words, that although for an instant continued in by the will of the Legislature, the complainant went out immediately, as he had a right to do, by his own will.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">This plea, when tested by evidence, will probably be found to \u25a0 rest on some verbal nicety; still, on its face, I see no ground for striking it out. If Beaty, on the passage of the obnoxious law\u2014 obnoxious to him\u2014saw fit, by any sufficiently significant and unequivocal act, to resign the office in which the Legislature proposed to continue him, it was clearly competent to him to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>so. It will hardly be contended, under our free institutions, that the Legislature can compel a man to be a policeman against his consent; or at least that any such legislative intention shall be presumed, unless most unequivocally expressed. And if the complainant regularly resigned (a very improbable supposition), he of course cannot be restored by mandamus\u2014he must, in that case, be reappointed by the commissioners, and not by the court. The judiciary, it is needless to say (whether by mandamus or otherwise), have no appointing power.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The 5th, 6th, and 7th pleas are mere surplusage. Neglect, disobedience, resistance, as substantive matters, are grounds for removal. If proved on written charges and due notice, they would warrant a sentence by the commissioners. But till then, the officer would not be out of office. As mere matters of evidence, although not conclusive, they may tend to show a refusal, resignation, or withdrawal, and in that way, support the three previous \u00a1deas; but mere evidence needs not to be and should not be pleaded. It has a tendency, besides, when so introduced, to confuse a case, and should, for that reason, be stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">As to the 8th and 9th pleas, they are substantially one, to wit.: that another person has been duly appointed and actually fills the relator\u2019s place.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">If the relator regularly resigned or was dismissed (two issues already made), this averment, as we have seen, would be immaterial. If he did not resign and was not removed, then his place was not vacant, and no other could be appointed in his stead. Two bodies, whether in political or natural philosophy, cannot occupy the same space at the same time. Besides, how could another person have been appointed \u201cin the place and stead\u201d of the relator, if the relator at the time, had no stead or place which he himself did or could occupy ?</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">These pleas, however, proceed upon the assumption that where an officer has been unlawfully turned out by the commission, he cannot be restored on mandamus by the court, if another, although unlawfully, has been put, or, rather, has been attempted to be put, in his place. In unitary offices, to be filled by a single individual, such, for instance, as the city inspector, \u25a0that may be the rule. A <em>quo warranto, </em>directed to the incum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>bent himself, would seem in such a case to be the appropriate remedy. But the word police is a noun of multitude. It implies in this city more than a thousand men. Against which ' one, which in particular, of this <em>quasi </em>army, is the writ of <em>quo </em>warranto, if issued, to be directed ? And which one in particular of this numerous force, can be said \u201c to hold in the place and stead of Thomas Beaty?\u201d When the force became full, up to the highest number allowed by law, including the members of the old police, who were continued by operation of the statute, all subsequent appointments, unless preceded by corresponding resignations or removals, were, of course, unauthorized and void. Such, at least, would seem to be the necessary legal conclusion. An appointment, therefore, of that character, in favor of a third person, being a nullity, would be no answer to a <em>mandamus </em>in favor of the rightful claimant. It neither filled Beaty\u2019s place nor the place of any other legally \u201c continued\u201d policeman. Beaty remained still in, although not recognized by his superiors. And if the place was <em>\u201c </em>full,\u201d it was full of Beaty, and of Beaty alone. So that the <em>mandamus </em>applied for, although in terms to restore him to the <em>office, </em>was really to restore him only to <em>recognition </em>and <em>fay. </em>What disposition, in that view of the matter, shall be made of the supernumeraries, it will be for the commissioners and Legislature to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">As to the 10th and 11th pleas, it is sufficient answer to the objection raised, that no arrears of pay are at present asked. When future instalments, if ever, become due to the relator, and he demands them of the treasurer of the board, it will be time enough for them to plead that they have no funds, and that the Legislature have made no appropriation, or that a discount should be taken from the legal pay to the extent of the emoluments received from another source. So far as entering into other employments is urged for any other purpose, it is mere evidence tending, unexplained, to make out a case of resignation, and as evidence is unnecessary and inadmissible in a pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">To the 12th plea, if true, there can be no legal objection. An officer <em>defacto, </em>as well as an officer <em>de jure, </em>may be tried, and, on conviction, removed. Removal does not imply that the officer was lawfully in, or even, necessarily, that he was actually in. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The commissioners, acting as they are presumed to do, \u201c on behalf of the public,\u201d might, to obviate all doubt, remove, I conceive, in a merely colorable case, without committing the public \"to any implied admission that the person removed had been in. (See Judge Stkong\u2019s opinion in the McCune case.) There is no inconsistency, therefore, in this plea. It is a legitimate plea also within the <em>decision </em>in McCune\u2019s case. Indeed, Mr. Justice Strong, in that case, decided that \u201cit would undoubtedly be a sufficient objection to the writ, if (meaning without any actual removal by sentence) it appeared clearly that there had been sufficient <em>cause </em>for the removal of the relator.\u201d The court would not be guilty of the folly of commanding the board to put the relator into office, if, beyond dispute, on the facts existing, he must necessarily and properly be turned out of it the next minute, or, at least, as soon as heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In the present plea the defendants not only set forth, if true, a clear <em>cause </em>for removal, but removal itself, after a regular trial. They allege that written charges were duly preferred of disobedience of superiors, that due notice was given, and that a due order of dismissal after trial was entered; and although the probabilities may be, that the notice given, in point of fact or law, was not sufficient, and that the order, on that ground, as decided in Gorman\u2019s case, was a nullity, yet for the purposes of the present motion, and until a regular trial can be had, the law requires me to assume the truth of the averment that due notice was given, there being, as yet, no allegation or proof of its falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">At the same time, without expressing any opinion on the fact, I may be permitted to say that nothing is to be ultimately gained on either side by the litigation of a fictitious case, or by interlocutory triumphs on mere questions of form. In the language of the printed points submitted by defendants\u2019 counsel, \u201c This is a controversy which ought not to be made dependent for its determination upon any technical considerations whatever.\u201d It is sufficiently embarrassed by intrinsic difficulties, and by what I conceive to be contradictory decisions, without superadding mere questions of form. I say contradictory decisions, because, in the first case discussed in the Court of Appeals, and in which the constitutionality of the new Police Act was settled (15 <em>If. Y. </em>A?., 532), it was held by a majority of the judges that the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>contemplated by that act, even as to the old police force, was a creation of new offices, and came within the provision declaring that \u201c all officers whose offices may be <em>hereafter created </em>by law (that is, after 1846), shall be elected by the people, <em>or appointed as the legislature may </em>direct.\u201d In other words, by the State, instead of the local authorities\u2014whether legislative or executive \u2014and that as to the old police force, the act was at one and the, same time a \u201c direction\u201d that <em>they </em>should be appointed to the newly-created office of \u201cpatrolmen\u201d by the Senate and Assembly, and a fulfilment of that direction by a simultaneous appointment as directed, in gross of the whole of the old force, under the general description of \u201cthe police in the city of New York\u201d then doing duty, instead of a special designation of each individual man by name. Whereas by the subsequent decision, made two years afterwards in the McCune case,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> by another majority of the same tribunal\u2014four of the former judges having in the interim gone out and four others been \u201c selected\u201d in their place\u2014 it was held out that the office of patrolmen under the new act, so far as the old force was concerned, was not a new office, and did not require a new appointment or a new oath or acceptance; in other words, to use the language of one of the majority, it was, \u201c in terms, a mere continuance in office,\u201d in an office existing before the adoption of the constitution, and not newly created by subsequent enactment. \u201c The officers designated were to <em>con-ti/nue </em>to do the same duties as before, and to hold, in effect, the same office, but under a different title.\u201d Row, as the legislature had no power to alter the mode of appointment to an existing office, the principles of the second decision, if applied to the facts involved in the first, must, it will be seen, necessarily have resulted in a determination adverse instead of favorable to the constitutionality of the new law. We have thus two adjudications for our guidance, of equal authority, giving, on the point involved, directly opposite interpretations to the statute whose provisions we are to apply. According to the one, the office of patrolmen under the new act, \u201c being a newly-created office, and other than a county, town, city, or village office\u201d (Judge Denio, at p. 556), it would only be necessary, in answer to the writ of mandamus, to show, which could be done by very slight circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>stances, an omission or non-acceptance of the tendered appointment. According to the other, being an old office, in which the-incumbent was <em>contmued </em>\u201c with substantially the same duties,\u201d under \u201c a mere change of name\u201d (Justice Strong), \u201c no personal acceptance was necessary,\u201d and consequently to deprive the incumbent of his existing rights and emoluments, either an unequivocal resignation by positive act with that intent must be shown, or a judicial sentence of removal after a regular trial and conviction according to law. In the case of McCune, the attempt was made to do both; and in both respects the attempt failed of success. The alleged removal of \u201c James McCune\u201d turned out to be a sentence pronounced by the commissioners against \u201c James M. Line;\u201d and thus, as Judge Strong expresses it, with \u201cno judgment against him, he had been actually ejected from office.\u201d And as to the alleged resignation, the commissioners, instead of showing any acts or expressions of McCune with that intent, proved the most unequivocal determination on his part (evinced as well by acts as words) to hold on to the old office, although under the advice of his old superiors he declined, like many others, to recognize its newly appointed, and very nearly, as the opinions show, unconstitutionally appointed chiefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">With these views of the difficulties of the whole subject, I deem it not out of place to suggest, as I have already done on former occasions, that instead of six hundred actions, or <em>quasi </em>actions, with all their forms and technicalities, \u201c the parties to the questions in difference,\u201d as the Code expressly and wisely permits, should \u201c agree upon a case containing the facts upon which the controversy depends, and present a submission o\u00ed the same in court, to be heard and determined at a general term, and judgment rendered thereon as if an action were depending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u2022 Should this suggestion not be adopted, an order will be entered, in the single proceeding now under review, quashing the return to the writ of mandamus, so far as it conflicts with the views above expressed, with liberty to the defendants to amend in five days after notice, and to the plaintiffs to reply or demur in five days thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">II. dSToverriber, 1859.\u2014In pursuance of this decision an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>was entered, from which the Board of Police now appealed to the general term.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><em>William Curt\u00eds </em>Noyes, <em>William M. </em>Evarts, <em>David Dudley </em>Field, and Brown, <em>Hall &amp; Vanderpoel, </em>for the appellants.\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"A9X\">I. The order is erroneous, because it departs altogether from the motion, and the notice of motion. The application was for a peremptory mandamus, which the court decided against. There the matter should have dropped. To proceed, and give the relator something for which he had not applied, and of which no notice had been given to the defendants, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u2022 II. The order was erroneous, also, for the reason that the relator\u2019s motion being denied, judgment should have been thereupon given against him. The motion for'a peremptory mandamus, notwithstanding the return, is of the nature of a demurrer to the return; and a decision against the relator is a dismissal of his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">III. If, however, the motion were to be regarded as a motion to strike out, the order was erroneous, for the reason, that even if the defences considered by this court bad, and stricken out, were not good defences, the defendant ought to be allowed to retain them upon the review, that they may present the question of their sufficiency to the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">IV. The defences stricken out were, however, all of them good defences. The first defence is good, because a policeman <em>defacto </em>and not <em>clejur\u00e9, </em>has no right to a mandamus. The fifth defence is good, because a neglect and refusal to perform any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>the duties of a policeman, is a good reason for not retaining him. This the Court of Appeals held in McCune\u2019s case. The same may be said of the sixth and seventh defences. The eighth defence is good, because the appointment of a person in the relator\u2019s place, gives that person a right to litigate the relator\u2019s title; and the proceeding by mandamus is inappropriate. The ninth defence is good, for a-like reason as the eighth. The tenth defence is good, because this is a mandamus as well for the pay as for the office. The eleventh defence is good, because the relator\u2019s engagement in other and inconsistent employment would disqualify him from holding, at the same time, an office in the police. He cannot have at the same time two inconsistent employments; and holding one is an abandonment of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">V. As the case was presented upon the motion, no question could arise respecting the different defences, whether they are consistent with each other or not; because the motion for a peremptory writ admits the truth of the facts alleged in the defences ; and if any one of them constituted a good answer to the mandamus, the motion must be denied. But if otherwise, yet the writ itself was fatally defective, and its defects can be objected to, after a return, and at any time before judgment. (The People <em>a. </em>Ransom, 2 <em>Comst., </em>490 ; Keen <em>a. </em>Low, 25 <em>Eng. L. &amp; E., </em>13 ; <em>East R., </em>89 ; <em>Tapping on </em>Mandamus, 309.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">VI. But if the writ had been free of all defects, the relator\u2019s motion, which is for a peremptory mandamus, notwithstanding the return, could not prevail, for many reasons; the first of which is, that none of the objections stated in the written notice served by the relator, can be taken on a motion for a peremptory writ. They could only be taken on a motion to strike out or quash. <em>(Crary Spec. Pro., </em>295 ; 2 <em>Burrill's </em>Pr., 179 ; Commercial Bank <em>a. </em>Canal Commissioners, 10 <em>Wend., </em>25 ; The People <em>ex rel. </em>Snow <em>a. </em>Cayuga C.

The motion for a peremptory writ, in tho present stage of the proceedings, is in the nature of a demurrer <em>ore tenus </em>to the return, and admits its truth. (The People <em>ex </em>rel. Bentley <em>a. </em>The Commissioners of Highways of Hudson, &amp;c., 7 <em>Wend., </em>474.) A special demurrer is never allowed in mandamus. (The People <em>ex rel. </em>Musgrove <em>a. </em>N. Y. C. P., 9 <em>Wend., </em>429.) And a general demurrer would not lie for inconsistency between different defences.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">VII. The motion for a peremptory writ cannot be made till after the relator has had the time to plead or demur, given by rule 51 of the court. The notice of hearing at a special term could not be given till this time had elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">VIII. The defendants have, by law, a right to set up as many defences as they suppose to exist. (2 <em>Rev. Stats., </em>352, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 9 ; The People <em>a. </em>Jones, 18 <em>Wend., </em>601.) Mandamus is an action. (The People <em>ex rel. </em>Bendon <em>a. </em>The County Judge of Rensselaer, <em>13 How. Pr. R., </em>399.) The only qualification to this is the right of the relator to move that the defendants be put to their election, when there is a real incompatibility between the defences. (Murray <em>a. </em>Smith, 1 <em>Johnson\u2019s cases, </em>105 ; Doyle <em>a. </em>Moulton, <em>Ib., </em>246 ; Le Conte <em>a. </em>Pendleton, <em>Coleman's cases, </em>77 ; Doyle <em>a. </em>Moulton, <em>Ib., </em>91 ; 2 <em>Johns., </em>437 ; 4 <em>Burr, </em>2041; <em>Tapping on Mand., </em>8, <em>note Y., </em>309, 352, and 7 ; 10 <em>Wend., </em>30, 32 ; <em>Tapping on Mand., </em>349.) The return should not omit any of the defences. The ancient strictness is not required. The courts are very much disinclined <em>even to quash </em>for inconsistency. (See the cases\u2014The King <em>a. </em>The Mayor of Cambridge, 2 <em>Term R., </em>461 ; The King <em>a. </em>The Mayor, &amp;c., of York, 5 <em>Ib., </em>70 ; The King <em>a. </em>The Archbishop of York, 6 <em>Ib., </em>495 ; Rex <em>a. </em>The Churchwardens of Taunton, &amp;c., <em>Cowp.

There can be no inconsistency where all the alleged <em>facts can </em>be true. That is the case here ; every allegation of a fact may, by possibility, be proved. There is, therefore, no contradiction in terms or in substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\"><em>Gilbert Dean, John McKeon, </em>and <em>John C.
