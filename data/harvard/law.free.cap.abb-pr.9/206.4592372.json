It is a short mode of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>averring the fact of actual ownership. That averment is sufficient on demurrer. If the declaration is deemed defective in form, the remedy is under section 160 of the Code. (Prindle <em>a. </em>Caruthers, 1 <em>E. P. Smith's </em>(15 <em>N.
