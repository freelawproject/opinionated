The power to be exercised, or the duty to be performed by the \u201cjustice of the supreme court,\u201d pursuant to the <em>foregoing provision, is </em>neither <em>ministerial </em>nor <em>administrative. </em>It is wholly <em>judicial. </em>(1.)

Ho notice of the application for th\u00e9 appointment of commissioners having been given to the railroad company whose rights were involved, the. order appointing commissioners was irregular and void. Every person whose rights are to be affected by a judicial determination, or the exercise of a judicial discretion, is entitled to be heard before the court or officer who is to pass upon his rights. This is a natural and funda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>mental right, and if, in authorizing any special proceedings, the legislature omits to protect this right, the court will supply the omission (Bouton v. Neilson, 3 <em>Johns., </em>474; Harper v. Carr, 7 <em>T. R., </em>286; Beach v. Furman, 9 <em>Johns., </em>229; Rathbun v. Miller, 6 <em>Id., </em>281; Commissioners of Highways of the Town of Kinderhook v. Claw, 15 <em>Johns., </em>537; Peters v. Newkirk, 6 <em>Cow., </em>103; Elmendorf v.

Osborn, 20 <em>Wend., </em>186). The cases of People <em>ex rel. </em>Herrick v. Smith, 21 <em>N. Y., </em>595, and Metropolitan Board of Health v. Heister, 37 <em>N. Y., </em>661, do not conflict with these views of the law. (1.) The Code expressly provides in those cases for proceeding <em>ex-parte. </em>(2.) The necessity of the cases required that no notice should be given. (3.) The legislature provides that the court shall <em>require </em>ample security for all damages which the defendant may sustain, before allowing the process.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-5\">HI. These positions are not answered by saying that the State does not provide for notice, because all these authorities hold that the right to notice is a \u201cfundamental principle,\u201d a principle of \u201cnatural justice,\u201d one that the courts will protect, if the legislature has omitted to do so. Hor is it an answer to say that because the statute gives but fifteen days to procure the appointment of commissioners, it is therefore inferrable the legislature \u2022 intended the proceedings to be <em>ex-parte. </em>The evident purpose of the legislature was to prevent an obstruction of a' public enterprise for an unreasonable time, and to compel parties complaining to be prompt and vigilant. Occupants of land are presumed to know where the engineers of the company have run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the line of the road, and to know their objection to it; and are given a week to put their objections in form, and serve the usual (eight days\u2019) notice upon the company. Delay is no objection to the other party; but to save the rights of both, it is provided that the applica1 tion may be made to a judge \u201c <em>out of court, </em>\u2019 \u2019 to avoid \" the delay of waiting for a term of the court. It is a general rule for the construction of a statute that it will not be deemed to be in derogation of the common law, unless its language is so explicit as to indicate that intention in the legislature. On the contrary, it will be construed to <em>aid, </em>not to <em>repeal, </em>the common law. Construing this statute according to this principle, the <em>mere silence </em>of the act preserves the common law right of notice. Neither is it an answer to say that, by <em>implication, </em>the company is entitled to notice of the time and place of meeting of the commissioners. The most important step in the proceeding is the selection of \u201cdisinterested personsand upon that' appointment the company had a right to be heard (Rathbone <em>v. </em>Miller, <em>supra). </em>It is of small consequence that a party has notice of an opportunity to be heard before a tribunal <em>selected </em>by his adversary, or even appointed by the court, without an opportunity of being heard as to their fitness or disinterestedness. Without imputing any want of consideration to the judge who appointed the commissioners, it is not too much to say, judging from the ordinary practice on <em>ex-parte </em>applications, that the petitioners had the selection of them. To say ' the least, the company had no opportunity to object to their appointment, or suggest others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-5\">IY. In making the order appointing commissioners, the judge was acting as a court, not as a subordinate or inferior tribunal. For a time the courts held that in all special proceedings authorized by statute, the court and its judges acted <em>quasi </em>commissioners, and not as a court, and that their proceedings could not be reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>or questioned by the ordinary methods fixed by the practice of the court. This doctrine was elaborately considered and overruled by the supreme court in the case of Striker <em>v. </em>Kelly (7 <em>Hill, </em>9), in which Beardsley, J., in an exhaustive opinion, concurred in by Nelsost, Ch. J., establishes the doctrine that these statutes, requiring certain acts to be performed by the supreme court and its judges, confer no new office upon the judges, and are not in conflict with the provision of the Constitution that \u201c neither the chancellor, nor justices of the supreme court, nor any circuit judge shall hold any other office or public trustbut that they merely extend and enlarge the powers and jurisdiction of the court and its officers (see <em>Grah. on Juris., </em>140; 2 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>196, \u00a7 1; 2 <em>Rev. </em>Laws, 409, 411,. \u00a7 178; Patchin <em>v. </em>Trustees of Brooklyn, 2 <em>Wend., </em>377, 384; 2 <em>Den., </em>323, 331-335; Matter of Canalstreet, 12 <em>N. Y. </em>[2 <em>Kern.], </em>406; Bangs <em>v. </em>Duckinfield, 18 <em>N. Y., </em>596; Matter of Cooper, 22 <em>Id., </em>83;. Matter of Dodd, 27 <em>Id., </em>632; King <em>v. </em>Mayor of N. Y., 36 <em>Id., </em>188). The expression used in some of the cases,\u2014for instance, New York Central R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Marvin (11 <em>N. Y. </em>[1 <em>Kern.], </em>276), that the statutes instituting special proceedings are designed to form a. complete system of practice,\u2014in no wise contravenes1 this doctrine. Properly understood, it is correct. So far as the statute establishes a practice, it must be pursued instead of the general practice of the court; but to construe it to mean that if a wrong is perpetrated by reason of the <em>silence </em>of the statute, the court can afford\" no remedy, because the statute provided none, is not tolerable. The legislature contemplated no wrong, and, <em>therefore, </em>provided no remedy. The court, by the enforcement of its ordinary rules, will prevent or redress injustice in its administration of the law, though the legislature may have failed to. foresee or provide for it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>S.

Smith should be dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-5\">I. (1.) Where a motion is made to vacate an order, obtained ex-parte, for irregularity in respect to the want of notice, and, on hearing the parties, the court declines to vacate the order, the defect, if any, is cured, and an appeal from the second order is not well taken (Culver <em>v. </em>Hollister, 17 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>405; Clumpha <em>v. </em>Whiting, 10 <em>Id., </em>448). (2.) This is not a proceeding in court. The petition is presented <em>only </em>to a <em>justice </em>of the supreme court, <em>out of court. </em>He acts as a ministerial officer, under. direction of the statute. It is a power that might have been conferred by the legislature upon the sheriff, or other officer of the county, as the sheriff in Livingston county is authorized to appoint, upon stated conditions, railroad commissioners for certain towns <em>(Laws </em>of 1868, p. 896, ch. 442; Metropolitan Board of Health v. Heister, 37 <em>N. Y., </em>672; United States <em>v. </em>Ferreira, 13 <em>How. U. S., </em>40). (3.) The statute particularly directs that the appointment of the commissioners shall not be a proceeding in court. Its language is equivalent to saying, \u201cThe petition shall not be presented to the supreme court, but, out of court, to one of the justices thereof.\u201d This statute, when it designs to put a special proceeding under it into court, plainly expresses that design. For instance: \u201c The .said company may present a petition, praying for the appointment of commissioners of appraisal, to <em>the supreme court, </em>at any general or special term thereof,\u201d. \u2022and in the same section requires that \u201cnotice of the \u2022time and place the same will be presented shall be .served upon all persons whose interests are to be affected by the proceedings\u201d (see <em>General Railroad Act, </em>1850, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 22). This has, therefore, never been a proceeding in court, and cannot be brought there on a motion, in disregard of the statute. A motion is an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>cident to an action or proceeding already in court, and in court by reason of a statute. The statute under which this matter arose, has been held to be an entire system in itself, and is to be strictly administered (New York Central R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Marvin, 11 <em>N. Y. </em>[1 <em>Kern.], </em>279; Dyckman <em>v. </em>Mayor, &amp;c. of N. Y., <em>5 Id. </em>[1 <em>Seld..], </em>439; People v. Kelley, 35 <em>Barb., </em>446). (4.) This proceeding having been, pursuant to statute, begun before a justice out of court, could not be transferred by him into court. The justice at special term, therefore, never acquired jurisdiction in this matter. The whole law of appeals applies to matters pending in court (People <em>v. </em>Brennan, 45 <em>Barb., </em>345). (5.) The legislature may invoke the aid of a judicial officer for the regulation of an administrative proceeding, without organizing a special proceeding in a court of justice (Matter of Dodd, <em>27 N. Y., </em>629). (6.) It is not necessary for the legislature, in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, either directly, or indirectly through public officers or agents, to invest the proceedings with the forms or substance of judicial process (People <em>v. </em>Smith, 21 <em>N. Y., </em>599). (7.) Even if the appointment of the commissioners were a judicial act, an order could not properly be made by a justice out of court, in this district, returnable at special term (Merritt <em>v. </em>Slocum, 6 <em>How. Pr., </em>350; Hasbrouck <em>v. </em>Ehrich, 7 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>76). If not properly an order of the court, the order is not appealable. (8.) This is not a special proceeding in court, and, therefore, not appealable under the act of 1854 <em>(Laws of </em>1854, ch. 270), relative to appeals in special proceedings, and no provision for such appeal is made by the general railroad act, which has been- defined'to be a complete system of itself (United States <em>v. </em>Ferreira, 13 <em>How. U. S., </em>40; New York Central R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Marvin, 11 <em>N. Y. </em>[1 <em>Kern.], 279). </em>(9.) The order appealed from determined that the company was not entitled to notice of the1 presentation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the petitions. At the Livingston special term, July <em>25, </em>1870, the same question between the same parties was decided adversely to the claim here made. This matter is, therefore, <em>res </em>adjudic\u00f3la, and the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-5\">Secondly. If the appeal in this matter be entertained, the order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-6\">I. (1.) It is provided by the rules of the supreme court <em>{Rule </em>39) that \u201can order to show cause (under section 403 of the Code of Procedure) shall only be granted when a special reason for a notice of less than eight days appears on the papers presented.\u201d It appears by the affidavit on which, in this matter, the order to show cause was made, not only that no special reason for a notice of less than eight days was averred, but that the affidavit was sworn to on June 4,1870, and when eight days still remained before the adjourned day of the special term at which the order to show cause was returnable. Therefore, if this matter was properly at the special term, the motion was properly denied for this reason. (3.). The papers on which a motion is made to vacate an order for the alleged irregularity of a want of notice should show that the moving party has been prejudiced. The authorities cited by the appellant, in each instance, show that the complaining party had been prejudiced in his rights by the want of notice, while, in the case at bar, no prejudice is averred or shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-7\">II. (1.) The company was not entitled to notice of the presentation of the petitions for the appointment of the commissioners (People <em>ex rel. </em>Herrick v. Smith, <em>21 N. Y., </em>598; Metropolitan Board of Health <em>v. </em>Heister, 37 <em>N. Y., </em>671). It is admitted that the statute is silent as to such notice (of the presentation of the petitions to the justice), though treating of the subject of notice in the same section <em>(General Railroad Act of </em>1850, \u00a7 33). (3.) The appellant, instead'of directly appealing to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>general term, made a motion at the Livingston special term, July 25,1870, to vacate the order appointing the commissioners, on the ground, among others, that the company was entitled to notice of the presentation of the petitions. His Honor Justice Smith, denied the motion with costs. (3.) The case of People <em>v. </em>Smith, above cited, related to the acquisition of private property for public use, and arose under <em>Laws </em>of 1830, ch. 56, p. 55). In that case the question of notice was the only one at issue, and the only one discussed. In this case, the complaint of the appellant is founded solely on the want of notice. In that case, the statute under which the issue arose, was silent on the subject of notice of a judicial proceeding to the parties complaining, though treating of notices in various steps of the proceedings. In this case, the statute is silent on the subject of notice to the company, though treating of the subject of notice in the very section of the statute (22) under which this proceeding arose. In that case, it was claimed that, though the statute was silent on the subject, notice was requisite on general principles of law ; and some of the same authorities were cited as are relied upon by the appellant, in this case, and are there overruled. In this case, the same claim is put forth. If the act complained of in this matter was a judicial determination, the act complained of, in that case, was more clearly so; but, in that case, the court says, \u201cif we should think it discreet that the landholder should have been furnished with notice, and allowed to participate, still the act furnishes the rule, and the court has no power to change it\u201d ; and adds, \u201cit is a subject of legislative discretion to deteimine what prudential regulations shall be established to secure a discreet and judicious exercise of the authority \u201d (to take private property for public use). (4.) The case of Metropolitan Board of Health <em>v. </em>Heister <em>(supra), </em>arose under <em>Laws of </em>1866, \u00a7 14, ch. 74. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>act provided for a preliminary determination of the board, without notice, that, upon what it might deem sufficient proof, it might declare certain matters and things a nuisance; but, before executing the order of removal or abatement, the board was required to serve the order upon the owner and give him a hearing; and the board might, thereafter, rescind, modify, or affirm its order or declaration. In that case, the court says, \u201cIn substance, the board, upon the evidence before it, determine that a <em>prima facie </em>case exists requiring its action.\u201d Subsequently notice was served upon Heister, whose business, that of a butcher, had been declared a nuisance, and he refused to appear, alleging that the board had acquired no jurisdiction; but the court, referring to the notice given Heister to appear with his proof says, \u201c This gave the same protection to all his rights, as if notice had been served upon him before any preliminary proceeding had been taken\u201d (p. 671). If such has been the fact in this case, there was a judicial determination without notice in that case and upon evidence, affecting property, and the court held that the property owner was not entitled to notice. (5.) The act of the justice, in appointing the commissioners, was not a judicial determination (United States <em>v. </em>Ferreira, 13 <em>How. U. S., </em>30; Matter of Dodd, 27 <em>N. Y.. </em>629; Metropolitan Board of Health v. Heister, 37 <em>N. Y., </em>671). In the case of Metropolitan Board of Health <em>v. </em>Heister, the court, in a very exhaustive opinion by Chief Judge Huxt, discusses the nature of such acts, declaring them ministerial merely, and aptly comparing them to the action of various classes of commissiohers. (6.) If the act of the justice was not a judicial act, then, in the absence of express provision of the statute, it would not be pretended that the appellant had a right to notice. If the act of the justice was a judicial act, then the right to notice could only be inferred from principles of the common law; but at com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>mon law, the company would have no right to any step in the proceeding towards the taking of land, <em>in inmtum. </em>The rights of the company, in this respect, are wholly statutory, and the statute is to be strictly construed against the company. The right to notice cannot be inferred (Doughty v. Hope, <em>1 N. Y. </em>[1 <em>Comst.], </em>79; Dyckman v. Mayor, &amp;c. of N. Y., 5 <em>N. Y. </em>[1 <em>Seld.], </em>439). The authorities and practice of the law furnish abundant instances of even <em>judicial </em>determination, affecting the rights of parties, without notice ; as orders of arrest, in civil actions, injunctions, stay of proceedings, orders extending time to answer, and these vacated ex-parte, and others that might be cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-5\">III. (1.) It is not necessary that the legislature should, in direct terms, constitute an inferior tribunal for the determination of questions arising under a statute. It is sufficient if a way of disposing of such questions is provided, in case they shall arise. In the statute under which this matter arose, the legislature has designated a justice of this court, out of court, as the officer to appoint commissioners to examine the route proposed by railroad companies, if necessity therefor should arise. It is held, in Matter of Dodd <em>(supra), </em>that it is entirely competent for the legislature to do this, and, in the case of People <em>v. </em>Smith <em>(supra), </em>that it depends upon the legislature to establish proper prudential regulations touching the appointment of such commissioners. In providing for the appointment of such commissioners, it has manifestly <em>not </em>seemed proper to the legislature to provide for notice of the presentation of the petitions\u2014\u201cto provide for a judicial contest\u201d upon the question of the landholder\u2019s right to an impartial hearing in the matter of his own freehold\u2014to subject his application for an opportunity to be heard, to the danger of defeat by contesting affidavits. His objections are to be tried before the commissioners, on evidence, and not before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the justice, by affidavits, on a motion. The appointing <em>of </em>the commissioners is merely the establishment of the tribunal\u2014a determination by the justice that a case has \u25a0 arisen upon which such a tribunal may properly act. It is true the commissioners may not act without notice to the company, but, on cause shown, the landholder\u2019s right to the tribunal is absolute. (3.) It was manifestly the intention of the legislature to commit the rights of the landholder, in this matter, to the supervising care of the justice, and to furnish him with a summary means of protecting them, beyond the limit of the actual public need, as defined by commissioners before whom, when appointed, all parties have a right to be heard. Yet the legislature, while permitting the company, in the first instance, to adopt any route it may select, and the landholder to contest that route only upon sworn objections, has, nevertheless, in the regulations provided for the appointment and action of the commissioners, erected many important safeguards for.the company. The justice must be satisfied, upon the sworn proof presented, that such objections <em>exist </em>as call for the appointment of commissioners. That the commissioners, if appointed, shall be disinterested. Th\u00e1t the landholder\u2019s objections shall be sustained by the civil engineer of the commissioners, on the one hand, and thus, on the other, that the company shall not be put upon an impracticable route. That the company shall have notice to appear before the commissioners and contest the landholder\u2019s objections. That the company shall be put to expense, on account of such hearing, only in case the proposed route shall be altered; and that the company shall be subjected to no greater delay than fifteen days for the presentation of the petitions, and thirty days for filing the determination of the commissioners. Yet, in establishing these safeguards for the company, .all in one section of the statute, among them the subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>notice twice occurring, the legislature did <em>not </em>provide for that notice, the want of which is here objected to (See <em>General Railroad </em>Act, \u00a7 22). (3.) The landholder, if aggrieved, is required by the statute (section 22) to present his objections, under oath, within fifteen days after the service upon him of the statutory notice by the company. If any party be entitled to notice, then all parties in any way interested are so entitled. Not considering the impossibility, in the absence of statutory directions therefor, of serving such notice upon \u201cthe public,\u201d upon non-residents, and upon persons who could not be found, it is manifest that the legislature, in thus restricting the landholder to fifteen days, did not intend that the brief time allotted should be consumed, and his remedy lost, in giving such notices. (4.) It would clearly be impossible to specify, with the reliable accuracy of a legal notice, the time and place at which, out of court, a justice could be found to whom the petitions for the appointment of commissioners would be presented.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b151-6\">Johnson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtX\">The motion to set aside the .order appointing three commissioners on the petition of the respondents, was made upon the ground that the order was irregular, having been made ex-parte, without any notice to the appellants. The appellants had located their railroad through the lands of the respondents, and filed their map and profile as required by the railroad act, and given notice to the respondents of the route so designated by the appellants over the respondents\u2019 lands. By the statute (section 22), \u201cAny party feeling himself aggrieved by the proposed location may, within fifteen days after receiving notice as aforesaid, apply to a justice of the supreme court out <em>of </em>court, by petition, duly verified, setting forth his objections to the route designated; and the said justice may, if he consider sufficient cause therefor to exist, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>appoint three disinterested persons, one of whom must be a practical engineer, to examine the proposed route, and, after hearing the parties, to affirm or alter the same, as may be consistent with the just rights of all parties and the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The statute does not require any notice to be given of the application for the appointment of the commissioners, and we think the legislature did not intend that notice should be given, nor to give the corporation the right to appear and litigate before the judge the question of such appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The statute provides for a hearing of all parties interested before the commissioners, before they can act, and this we think is all the notice or hearing the legislature intended to allow the corporation on the subject. The statute evidently was intended to give the landholder who felt aggrieved by the proposed location over his land, the absolute right to have commissioners of review appointed, and a hearing of the whole question of location before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">It requires him to act promptly, and make his application within fifteen days from the service of the notice upon him, and evidently does not contemplate any hearing of the adverse party on such application. \u00a1No objection can be raised to the validity of the statute on this ground, as it was not necessary to make provision for a judicial contest upon that question. It does provide for notice and a hearing before the rights or interests of the parties concerned can be affected (People <em>v. </em>Smith, 21 N. Y., 595).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Having come to the conclusion that no notice is provided for by statute, and that none was necessary, the question, whether the order appointing the commissioners is only reviewable upon a common law <em>certiorari,, </em>or whether it is the subject of an appeal on motion in the supreme court at special term, is of no consequence, and need not be decided here. The order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>wag regular, and the court at special term properly refuged to get it agide for irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The order appealed from ig, therefore, affirmed, with ten dollars cogtg of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Talcott, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Mtjllln\", P. J., digsented.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Order affirmed, with cogtg.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
