On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) limited his cross-examination of a witness concerning bias and interest in violation of his sixth amendment right to confront witnesses<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) denied his motion to suppress. We agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim and therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>The defendant\u2019s ten year old cousin, the victim, suffered a laceration to her hymen on August 21, 2003. According to the victim, the defendant touched her vagina, and she then felt something poke and scratch her. The defendant, who was seventeen years old and lived in the same home as the victim, denied touching her and instead suggested that she could have injured herself by masturbating while she was wearing false fingernails.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The defendant was arrested and charged with sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a child. At trial, the victim testified that the defendant had injured her, and the defendant testified that he had not done so. The victim\u2019s mother, to whom the victim first reported the injury, corroborated her testimony. Several other relatives of the victim and the defendant, however, testified that the victim and her mother had reputations for untruthfulness. The physician who examined the victim after her injury testified that it was possible but not reasonably probable that she could have injured herself. According to that physician, a ten year old girl ordinarily would not masturbate in such a way as to tear her hymen because to do so would be painful.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">After considering the evidence, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts. The court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict and sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of twenty-five years incarceration, execution suspended after twelve years, followed by thirty-five years probation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly limited the cross-examination of a prosecution witness concerning bias and interest in violation of his sixth amendment right to confront witnesses as to two matters. The first matter concerned an investigation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>victim\u2019s mother by the department of children and families (department).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Witnesses who testified on behalf of the defendant testified that the victim initially told her mother that she had injured herself, but the mother later blamed the defendant in order to deflect attention from her possible role in causing or failing to prevent the victim\u2019s injury. The second matter concerned the decision of the mother to contribute $4000 toward the defendant\u2019s bond one day after his arrest. The defendant argued that the contribution indicated that the mother initially believed that the victim had injured herself, but the mother later blamed the defendant because his father failed to fulfill his promise to reimburse her for contributing to the posting of the defendant\u2019s bond. The court precluded the defendant from cross-examining the mother as to both matters because it determined that they were collateral and irrelevant and would confuse the jury. We agree with the defendant that the court\u2019s rulings with regard to both matters were improper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>We begin by noting the scope of the rulings under review. During cross-examination, the defendant questioned the victim\u2019s mother about whether she had told any of her family members that the victim had initially told her that the victim had hurt herself. The state objected to this line of questioning. After a brief sidebar in which the defendant explained that the question was designed to impeach the mother\u2019s credibility, the court permitted the defendant to continue questioning the mother. When the defendant repeated a question that already had been asked and answered, the state objected again.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court dismissed the jury at this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>point and requested an offer of proof from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">The defendant made an offer of proof.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state again objected to the form and the content of the question and argued that it was triple hearsay and irrelevant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>The court ruled that cross-examination regarding the department\u2019s investigation and the mother\u2019s contribution to the defendant\u2019s bond were collateral and irrelevant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant objected again in order to preserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>the record for appellate review properly and then proceeded with the cross-examination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At the end of the trial, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>regarding both of the issues that were excluded from the testimony. The court, for the reasons it stated during trial, denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">We set forth the legal principles that guide our resolution of this issue. \u201cWe traditionally apply a two part analysis to determine whether a party has been deprived of effective cross-examination. First, we determine whether the defendant received the minimum opportunity for cross-examination of adverse witnesses required by the constitution. ... If so, we then consider whether the trial court\u2019s restriction of cross-examination amounted to an abuse of discretion under the rules of evidence. . . . [T]he sixth amendment to the [United States] constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to confront the witnesses against him. . . . The primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination .... This right, however, is not absolute and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. . . . The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>trial court, in its discretion, may impose limitations on the scope of cross-examination, as long as the defendant has been permitted sufficient cross-examination to satisfy constitutional requirements. . . . The confrontation clause does not . . . suspend the rules of evidence to give the defendant the right to engage in unrestricted cross-examination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>90 Conn. App. 132, 136-37, 876 A.2d 572 (2005), aff'd, 283 Conn. 207, 926 A.2d 633 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">\u201cThe first question, therefore, is whether the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the victim satisfied the constitutional standards required by the sixth amendment. . . . The constitutional standard is met when defense counsel is permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which [the] jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness. . . . [W]e consider the nature of the excluded inquiry, whether the field of inquiry was adequately covered by other questions that were allowed, and the overall quality of the cross-examination viewed in relation to the issues actually litigated at trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Put another way, our threshold inquiry is whether this constitutional standard has been met. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Laccone, </em>37 Conn. App. 21, 31, 654 A.2d 805 (1995), appeal dismissed, 235 Conn. 746, 669 A.2d 1213 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Next, \u201c[i]f we conclude that the court improperly restricted the defendant\u2019s opportunity to impeach a witness for motive, interest, bias or prejudice, we then proceed with a harmless error analysis. . . . Whether such error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hedge, </em>93 Conn. App. 693, 698-99, 890 A.2d 612, cert. denied, 277 Conn. 930, 896 A.2d 102 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Accordingly, we must first determine whether the court\u2019s ruling to exclude matters regarding the department\u2019s investigation of the victim\u2019s mother and the decision of the victim\u2019s mother to contribute $4000 toward the posting of the defendant\u2019s bond one day after his arrest violated the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation. We conclude that the ruling did result in a violation of the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">\u201cThe primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination .... and an important function of cross-examination is the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying. . . . Cross-examination to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted. ... In order to comport with the constitutional standards embodied in the confrontation clause, the trial court must allow a defendant to expose to the jury facts from which [the] jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arline, </em>223 Conn. 52, 60, 612 A.2d 755 (1992). \u201cAlthough it is axiomatic that the scope of cross-examination generally rests within the discretion of the trial court, [t]he denial of all meaningful cross-examination into a legitimate area of inquiry fails to comport with constitutional standards under the confrontation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>clause.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, 224 </em>Conn. 325, 331-32, 618 A.2d 32 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The constitutional standard has not been met in this case because the defendant was denied meaningful cross-examination of the victim\u2019s mother that would have elicited facts tending to show motive. \u201c[E]vidence tending to show motive, bias or interest of an important witness is never collateral or irrelevant. [Indeed, it] may be . . . the very key to an intelligent appraisal of the testimony of the [witness].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hedge, </em>supra, 93 Conn. App. 699; see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-5. Restricting the defendant from cross-examining the mother regarding her fear of the department, her contribution of $4000 toward the defendant\u2019s bond and the failure of the defendant\u2019s father to reimburse her for the contribution eliminated jury consideration of a possible motive for her to lie about the cause of her daughter\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">In addition to showing the motive of the witness, these issues may have illuminated the flaws in the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother and impeached her credibility. \u201cIt is fundamental that for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of his testimony, a witness may be cross-examined as to statements made out of court . . . which contradict those made upon direct examination. . . . This is based on the notion that talking one way on the [witness] stand, and another way previously, raises a doubt as to the truthfulness of both statements.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiavo, </em>93 Conn. App. 290, 306-307, 888 A.2d 1115, cert. denied, 277 Conn. 923, 895 A.2d 797 (2006). The mother was a key prosecution witness, and she was not only the minor victim\u2019s mother but also the first person the victim went to after the alleged assault. The defendant offered proof, outside the presence of the jury, of out-of-court statements made by the mother that were inconsistent with her statements made during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>direct examination. Specifically, the defendant claimed that the mother told family members that the victim had first told her that the victim had injured herself. In addition, the mother\u2019s fear of the department prevented her from telling the authorities these facts. Furthermore, the defendant claimed that the mother\u2019s contribution to his bond was inconsistent with her testimony that he sexually assaulted her daughter and consistent with her daughter\u2019s having injured herself. Because the defendant was not permitted to cross-examine the mother on those issues, the jury was unable to make a proper determination of her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The court\u2019s denial of the cross-examination of the victim\u2019s mother regarding both of these matters pertained not only to the witness\u2019 motive but also to her very credibility. Because cross-examination is so important to elucidate the flaws in a witness\u2019 testimony, the court improperly ruled that the two excluded matters were collateral and irrelevant. That ruling resulted in a violation of the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation because it damaged the overall quality of his cross-examination of the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">In accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Hedge, </em>supra, 93 Conn. App. 698-99, we next must consider whether the corut\u2019s improper ruling harmed the defendant. \u201cThe correct inquiry for identifying harmless constitutional error is to ask whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>89 Conn. App. 1, 14, 872 A.2d 477, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 921, 883 A.2d 1247 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">For a number of reasons we find that the court\u2019s rulings were harmful to the defendant. First, the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother was important in the prosecution\u2019s case because she was the first person to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>a report of the victim\u2019s injury. Second, although other witnesses, such as a police officer and a physician, testified as to the victim\u2019s report of injury, the mother had a much closer relationship with the victim. In light of that relationship, the testimony of the mother was particularly important and not merely cumulative. Finally, the strength of the state\u2019s case depended heavily on her credibility, but the court deprived the defendant of a significant opportunity to challenge her testimony by prohibiting questioning as to the department\u2019s investigation of her and her decision to contribute $4000 toward the posting of the defendant\u2019s bond. We therefore conclude that the court\u2019s improper preclusion of cross-examination of the mother was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Although our resolution of the defendant\u2019s first claim is dispositive of the appeal, we address the second claim because it is likely to arise again at his new trial. The defendant claims that the court improperly denied his motion to suppress statements that he made to police officers before the officers read him his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). The defendant made the statements at issue after the victim sustained her injury and went to a hospital with her mother. The physician who examined the victim notified the police that the victim could have been sexually assaulted, and an officer and a lieutenant then were dispatched to the hospital in order to investigate. The lieutenant subsequently requested that two other officers go to the defendant\u2019s home, but those officers did not know that the defendant was a suspect in a sexual assault. They asked him why they had been sent to his home, and he responded that the victim\u2019s mother had accused him of injuring the victim. The officers then waited for further instructions, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>defendant chose to wait with them outside his home. Approximately forty-five minutes later, the lieutenant arrived at the defendant\u2019s home and arrested him. The defendant argues that the court should have granted his motion to suppress the statements that he made to the officers who first arrived at his home because he was effectively in custody at that time. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">\u201cTwo threshold conditions must be satisfied in order to invoke the warnings constitutionally required by Miranda: (1) the defendant must have been in custody; and (2) the defendant must have been subjected to police interrogation. . . . [Although the circumstances of each case must certainly influence a determination of whether a suspect is in custody for proposes of receiving <em>Miranda </em>protection, the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest. ... A person is in custody only if, in view of all the surrounding circumstances, a reasonable person would have believed [that] he was not free to leave. . . . Thus, in determining whether <em>Miranda </em>rights are required, the only relevant inquiry is whether a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would believe that he or she was in police custody of the degree associated with a formal arrest. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">\u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving that he was in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes. . . . Two discrete inquiries are essential to determine custody: first, what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances, would a reasonable person have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave. . . . The first inquiry is factual, and we will not overturn the trial court\u2019s determination of the historical circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s interrogation unless it is clearly erroneous. . . . The second inquiry, however, calls for application of the controlling legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>standard to the historical facts. . . . The ultimate determination of whether a defendant was subjected to a custodial interrogation, therefore, presents a mixed question of law and fact, over which our review is de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stale </em>v. <em>Kirby, </em>280 Conn. 361, 393-94, 908 A.2d 506 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Examining the circumstances of the present case, we conclude that the defendant was not in police custody when he spoke to the officers who first arrived at his home. The defendant voluntarily answered those officers\u2019 questions, and they did not restrain his freedom of movement to the degree associated with a formal arrest. He chose to wait outside his home with them while they waited for further instructions from the lieutenant. It was not until forty-five minutes after the officers arrived at the defendant\u2019s home that the lieutenant arrived and arrested him. A reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would not have believed that he was in police custody until the lieutenant arrested him. Accordingly, the court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b831-12\"> The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall eiyoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\"> The record is unclear as to the nature of the department\u2019s investigation of the victim\u2019s mother, but it appears that the department conducted at least a limited inquiry of the living arrangements after the August 21,2003 incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b833-7\"> It bears noting that the court also failed to instruct the jury that the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother was limited by the constancy of accusation doctrine. The court instructed the jury on that doctrine only as to the testimony of a police officer who had interviewed the victim. Our Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[t]he constancy of accusation doctrine is well established in Connecticut .... Until <em>[State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 677 A.2d 917 (1996)], we permitted witnesses to testify about the details of a victim\u2019s accounts of [an] alleged sexual assault on the theory that, if the victim\u2019s stoiy were true, the evidence would show constancy in the charge even to the details, and the truth would the more clearly appear. ... In <em>[Troupe], </em>however, we restricted the doctrine so that a constancy of accusation witness could testily only to the fact and the timing of the victim\u2019s complaint. Even so limited, the evidence would be admissible solely for corroboration of the victim\u2019s testimony, and not for substantive purposes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>272 Conn. 515, 526, 864 A.2d 847 (2005); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-11 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">In the present appeal, the defendant explicitly declines to claim that the court improperly instructed the jury. The defendant instead focuses on the court\u2019s decision to preclude him from cross-examining the mother as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>department\u2019s investigation of her and her contribution to the posting of his bond. Those two matters for cross-examination concerned whether the victim reported to her mother a sexual assault by the defendant or instead reported that she had injured herself. Any testimony of the mother as to the details of the alleged assault is not relevant to our consideration of the limits that the court placed on her cross-examination. Furthermore, the state suggests that the testimony of the mother was admissible for substantive purposes under the excited utterance exception to the rule against hearsay. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 40-43, 770 A.2d 908 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b834-10\"> The following transcript excerpt from the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the victim\u2019s mother provides context for our discussion of his claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-11\">\u201cQ.

She was not present. Whatever reason she has for not speaking to [the department] . . . does not impeach her credibility or [the victim\u2019s]. And I just think it is so unreliable and it elicits such hearsay evidence because, essentially, what the jury is going to hear is what [the victim] told her. And that is hearsay. That is the foundation of the inquiry. [The victim] first told her that she hurt herself. And then [the victim] told her, made up a story, in her belief she made up the story about [the defendant]. And then the jury is going to hear that this witness apparently told some relative that she doesn\u2019t want to tell this to the [department] because she is afraid they are going to take her child away from her. It has no relevancy to the issue at hand. It is completely unreliable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-18\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Let me add . . . [t]his lady, the next morning, contributed $4000 in a pool with the family members, to bond out my client, who supposedly assaulted her daughter. Now, she had to have some misgivings about the truth of this allegation. Now, we all know and we all admire [the department] for the work that they do. They are very zealous in what they do, and we have a woman who is illiterate in both English and Spanish. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-19\">[S]he was threatened with the fact . . . that this wasn\u2019t an appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>living arrangement for all of these children. If that was her concern, and she makes that recitation, I ask her if the original recitation was the child hurt herself and then she changed it. She says no, I think I have a right to impeach her with the idea that these forces were in place coupled with the fact that she, I mean, she contributed $4000 ... to get the man out of jail, who supposedly assaulted her daughter. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-6\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Your Honor, her misgivings about the truth of [the victim\u2019s] allegation has nothing to do with this case. That is for the jury to decide. . . . She has simply related what [the victim] told her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">\u201cThe Court: That is the problem I am having. When she came into the room and you went out to the bathroom with her, didn\u2019t she first say, I hrurt; myself, and then later, [the defendant] hurt her? No. Did you tell any family members otherwise? No. I mean, that is the end of the line of questioning. I don\u2019t see where we are going with any further questioning on this. It is a question of what this girl said. And you have already had an ability to examine her. You asked her what this young girl said to her and what she might have said to other family members. And she said, no, I didn\u2019t say anything to any other family members. So, where are we going with it? If we are going to sit here and beat this to death, she has given you an answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: If the . . . primary witness here, the first which is the strength of the state\u2019s case because of the immediacy of the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-9\">\u201cThe Court: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: If there was something other than that, if it wasn\u2019t [the defendant] hurt me, it was: ma, I hurt myself, some discussions, whatever. And then it became [the defendant] hurt me. I think that the fact that it wasn\u2019t so immediate, the immediacy of the reporting, the accuracy of the first report, I should have an opportunity to inquire into it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-11\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Your Honor, while the jury is out, I object to any questions which are designed, as this one is, to determine whether she actually believed [the victim] or if she had any underlying reason to doubt [the victim] because it has no relevance whatsoever. She was not present when this happened. She wasn\u2019t there. She didn\u2019t see it. Whether she believes [the victim] or not, doesn\u2019t make a bit of difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-12\">\u201cThe Court: That is right. It is the ultimate trier who makes that determination, not whether she believes her or not. She is a fact witness. She is going to report what she is going to report, what the girl said to her; what she said to the police; what she said is fine. Did you say anything inconsistent with what you have testified here to? No, I did not. That is the end of it. What you are trying to do is characterize [the victim\u2019s] reporting to her by way of her characterizing it otherwise to other people. And that to me is just too far removed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Will the court allow the inquiry as to her posting bond ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-14\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: What is the relevance? That is what I would like to know. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-15\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: She never expected him to be arrested because she didn\u2019t believe it happened. I am just trying to make my explanation, Your Honor. She didn\u2019t call the police. She took the kid to the hospital. . . . [A]ccept my premise that she wasn\u2019t entirely sure that this kid, [who] she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>has trusted all forever, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, this occurs. Okay? And so she has misgivings about this. This takes\u2014well, I will do what I have to do as far as the medical care and then I will deal with this. She is not familiar with the system, the mechanism of the system takes over. Now\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-7\">\u201cThe Court: You are dealing with mandatory reporters, so mandatory reporters call the cops.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: So, the next thing you know, this kid gets arrested. The next morning, she is going to join with other family members in pooling? And that is a pretty significant amount of money to be, you know\u2014maybe a few days later there would be righteous indignation, it drops away or whatever, it is all family, maybe we could straighten this out. But the very next morning, she gives $4000 to help get the guy out who just molested her daughter? I think that is pretty significant ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-9\">\u201cThe Court: You are using that collateral issue to characterize the reporting of the child here. You ought to use that issue to indicate to the trier of fact that she has a problem with what the child reported to her. There may be many motivations for her joining with other family members in posting a bond, many motivations. And it is a collateral issue that, what you are trying to do, I think, is introduce that collateral issue to raise inferences in the minds of the trier that shouldn\u2019t be here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: With all due respect to the court, Your Honor, if the outcry witness, the mother of the victim has misgivings about the truth of this allegation, which I believe that by posting $4000 the next day indicates, I think that is something the jury should know and take into consideration as, all right, the kid said this, okay. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-13\">\u201cThe Court: That sounds like an Augustinian great leap of faith. That is how I would characterize what you have just said. Now, I may be wrong. What is your position on it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-16\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: I object ... it has no relevancy. It is just designed, as the other question was, to show the jury that this witness may very well have misgivings about her daughter\u2019s allegation. And that issue, that whole question has no relevancy here. It is the jury\u2019s role to determine the credibility of the victim. So, that whole lino of questions regarding what she thought of her daughter\u2019s allegation, I would object to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b837-18\"> The following is an excerpt from the transcript of the court\u2019s ruling on t\u00edrese issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-19\">\u201cThe Court: What she is going to report to you is factually what happened and what she did. Whether or not they believe the young woman\u2019s testimony here, whether or not they believe that the young woman said the following to her mother, to this witness, that is up to them. The ultimate credibility, the weight they give her testimony, is simply up to them. But I am not going to let you characterize her reporting on an issue relating to the posting of a bond the next day because I think it is a collateral issue that is intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>to really confuse the jury. And I don\u2019t really see that it has any relevance here. So, I am not going to allow you to do it. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: The recitation of events by this witness I have a right to challenge. I have a right to ask her what, if I believe them to be true, what motives she may have had to exaggerate the charges, exaggerate the allegations, exaggerate her recitation of events, conveniently leave out portions of the recitation of events because she is fearful some governmental agency might take some action. I don\u2019t think that is uncommon in the area of impeachment of inquiry as it relates to impeachment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: There is absolutely no foundation for the question . . . [a]nd . . . there have been no inconsistencies elicited. . . . There is no factual predicate for these questions, and they are prejudicial by their very nature. And they are misleading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-8\">\u201cThe Court: I would agree. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: All I need is a good faith basis for these, as an officer of the court, to ask these questions. I am not attempting to dream up something here that I haven\u2019t heard through my investigation of this case. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: ... I agree with counsel, right, he only has to show a good faith basis for asking these questions about a motive to fabricate or a motive to align herself with [the victim], when originally she may have doubted her. There is absolutely no showing of that from this witness. But I think if counsel wants to explore that, he better be prepared to call somebody from [the department] to testify about the family situation, what their motives were. And he can\u2019t do that because I have spoken to [the department] and, as a matter of fact, given the question that was already asked, I may very well call them and ask them about what was their determination regarding the family situation. It has already been implanted in their minds now that there might be some [department] involvement. These questions are so prejudicial and they just open up a whole Pandora\u2019s box where the state now has to call other witnesses and put on other testimony. And then the jury is lost ... in all of these collateral issues, which really have nothing to do with [the victim\u2019s] credibility. [The victim] was there. She is the only eyewitness, other than [the defendant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-11\">\u201cThe Court: This credibility you are attacking here, you are attacking the child\u2019s credibility ... or her credibility?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: The child\u2019s credibility and then coupled\u2014then the witness\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-13\">\u201cThe Court: I mean, she has testified about what the child said and did on the evening in question. She has testified about what she said and did on the evening in question. You are getting in . . . collateral issues that really don\u2019t belong in the case. What you are trying to do is try your case by some of these side possibilities, if you will, without any basis whatsoever, without laying the basis for those kinds of questions being asked. For instance, the posting of the bond, I mean, you know and I know there can be a myriad of reasons to help other family members post the bond in this instance. It doesn\u2019t mean anything. What you are trying to convey to the jury is, hey, the next morning she helps bond this guy out. She mustn\u2019t have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>believed her daughter. That is exactly what the questions is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And who wouldn\u2019t think that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-8\">\u201cThe Court: There are many reasons for it, and it is collateral.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: But it is one of the possible inferences\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-10\">\u201cThe Court: One of the possible motivations is not what is probable, likely and relevant. That is the key issue. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: ... I mean, given this same set of circumstances, and if it was our own child, I wouldn\u2019t care what level of loyalty, and I think most people wouldn\u2019t care what level of loyalty you may have for the extended family, you are not going to put your hard earned money up to bail some cousin out or nephew, or whatever he might be, after an assault like tiiis if you believe it is true. That just doesn\u2019t ring true, human experience. I respectfully disagree with the court. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-12\">\u201cThe Court: ... I really think that is an issue that is collateral to the issue at hand. And it is not relevant for consideration by the trier. Do you wish to be heard on anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-13\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: ... is the court also granting my motion regarding the questions about [the department] involvement? . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-14\">\u201cThe Court: Are we getting into that or are we just going to drop that line of questioning because I don\u2019t want to waste a lot of time on the same kind of a ruling. I don\u2019t know what the relevance of that is.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b839-15\"> For context, the following is the transcript excerpt of the defendant\u2019s record for the bond issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-16\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: It was my intention to ask this witness whether or not she contributed $4000 the next morning to bond my client out of jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-17\">\u201cThe Court: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-18\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: It is my understanding that the court is disallowing me from asking that. And the purpose of my question is to impeach [the] testimony [of the victim\u2019s mother] in which she said that [the victim] said that [the defendant] hurt her. I believe that the subsequent activity, helping to bond out the alleged assailant of her child, is inconsistent to the point of showing that what she said on the [witness] stand here is not true, that there was only one allegation, not an alternative in her mind that, first, that the child said she hurt herself and then she said that [the defendant] hurt [the victim]. I believe that if I were allowed to put that before the jury, they could draw the conclusion that . . . what she said on the [witness] stand is not true, that there were two different allegations here, two different assertions. That would be the purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-19\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And I will indicate for the record, we spent probably over an hour discussing the exhibit entry in chambers. The state\u2019s argument was that simply because she bonded out her nephew . . . would not logically mean that the victim had made any kind of statement in the bedroom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>[that] she had hurt herself. If it does anything, it would show perhaps that she did not believe her daughter\u2019s allegation, and the state\u2019s argument, quite simply, is that whatever she believes about her daughter\u2019s allegation is not relevant to this case. That is for the jury to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-8\">\u201cThe Court: What about that position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: My question doesn\u2019t go to her belief. My question goes to show that her responses to my questions were inaccurate because of her subsequent behavior. And I asked her, didn\u2019t she first say that she hurt herself and then [she] said [the defendant]. She said no. It is my contention that, showing that she was willing to contribute $4000 the next morning, undermines the credibility of her response to my questions. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with believability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-10\">\u201cThe Court: I think you are wrong. I think you are making a highly speculative leap there. And I think the purpose of your inquiry is to lead the trier of fact to draw an inference that, in fact, an alternative thing was said by the complainant in the case. It doesn\u2019t necessarily go directly to credibility of [the victim\u2019s mother]. I also think you are into speculation as to why she did what she did a day later. For those two reasons, I am not going to allow that in. I appreciate the fact that you made a record for whatever reason you think appropriate.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
