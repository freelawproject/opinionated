Glenn<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals from the judgment of foreclosure by sale rendered by the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, the GMAC Mortgage Corporation. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court (1) improperly denied his application for protection from foreclosure pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-31 f<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) denied him due process of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims. On December 29, 2005, the plaintiff filed this action against the defendant seeking to foreclose a mortgage on real property located at 20 Chelsea Court in Middletown. On February 10, 2006, the defendant, appearing pro se, filed an application seeking protection from foreclosure pursuant to \u00a7 49-3 If. On April 24, 2006, the <em>court, Booth, J., </em>sustained the plaintiffs objection to the defendant\u2019s application for foreclosure protection on the ground that two foreclosure actions had been commenced against him in 2003.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Also, on March 29, 2006, the plaintiff filed a motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure and on May 1, 2006, a motion for default for failure to plead, which the trial court clerk denied on May 4, 2006. On May 5, 2006, the defendant filed a motion to reconsider the application for protection, which the court, <em>Booth, J., </em>granted. Subsequently, on May 30, 2006, the court, <em>Aurigemma, J., </em>orally denied the application for protection, vacated the clerk\u2019s denial of the motion for default, rendered a default judgment against the defendant for his failure to file an answer and rendered judgment of foreclosure by sale. On July 10, 2006, the defendant filed this appeal from the court\u2019s denial of his application for protection from foreclosure and from the subsequent judgment of foreclosure by sale. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly construed \u00a7 49-31f (a) (2). Specifically, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>argues that he should not have been denied foreclosure protection on the ground that two previous foreclosure actions had been \u201ccommenced\u201d against him because these actions eventually were withdrawn. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Issues of statutory construction raise questions of law over which we exercise plenary review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>271 Conn. 785, 791, 860 A.2d 249 (2004). Accordingly, we begin our analysis of this claim with well established principles of statutory construction. \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>279 Conn. 207, 212, 901 A.2d 673 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Because the language of the statute is our foremost consideration in determining the meaning of an act, our interpretive task begins with the relevant statutory language. Id. Section 49-31f, entitled in part, \u201cApplication for protection from foreclosure action,\u201d provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) ... a homeowner who is underemployed or unemployed against whom a foreclosure action is brought may make application ... to the court having jurisdiction over the foreclosure action for protection from foreclosure if ... (2) such homeowner has not had a foreclosure action <em>commenced </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>against him in the preceding seven-year period . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Because the legislation does not define the term \u201ccommenced,\u201d it is appropriate for us to construe the term \u201ccommenced\u201d in a manner that is consistent with its commonly approved meaning. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>253 Conn. 611, 628, 755 A.2d 180 (2000). \u201cCommence\u201d is defined by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979) as meaning: \u201cTo initiate by performing the first act. To institute or start.\u201d Thus, the clear language of \u00a7 49-31f (a) (2) denies foreclosure protection to anyone who has had a foreclosure action filed against him or her within the prior seven year period regardless of the reason for its commencement and even if it was subsequently withdrawn. This inteipretation adheres to the \u201ccardinal rule of statutory construction . . . that where the words of a statute . . . are plain and unambiguous the intent of the [drafters] in enacting the statute ... is to be derived from the words used. . . . We are constrained to read a statute as written . . . and we may not read into clearly expressed legislation provisions which do not find expression in its words . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bank of New York </em>v. <em>National Funding, </em>97 Conn. App. 133, 140-41, 902 A.2d 1073, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 925, 908 A.2d 1087 (2006), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Reyad </em>v. <em>Bank of New York, </em>549 U.S. 1265, 127 S. Ct. 1493, 167 L. Ed. 2d 229 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Although we have found no appellate decisional law construing \u00a7 49-31f (a) (2), the result we reach is in accord with well reasoned trial court decisions on point. In <em>Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Ansonia-Milford, Docket No. CV-91-036469-S (March 1, 1993), the court opined: \u201cIt is not what the legislature might have said, but rather, the meaning of what it did say, that controls. . . . [T]he requirement [under \u00a7 49-3 If (a) (2)] that the homeowner has not had a foreclosure action commenced against him in the preceding seven year period <em>means any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>foreclosure </em>action.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Also, the court in <em>Torrington Savings Bank </em>v. Hanley, Superior Court, judicial district of Litchfield, Docket No. 0056764 (November 19, 1991) (7 C.S.C.R. 6), correctly concluded: \u201cThe defendant need not have lost her property in a foreclosure action; but, as long as a foreclosure action has begun against her, she is not eligible for protection . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Finally, in their treatise on Connecticut foreclosures, professor Denis Caron and Geoffrey K. Milne commented in regard to the use of the term \u201ccommenced\u201d in the statute: \u201cThe earlier ambiguity of the provision was eliminated by the passage of [Public Acts 1984, No.] 84-373, which substituted the term \u2018commenced\u2019 for \u2018brought.\u2019 In limiting qualification to a homeowner who had not had a foreclosure action \u2018brought\u2019 against him in the preceding seven-year period, the earlier version was unclear about whether it meant to disqualify only those who had actually suffered a completed foreclosure. Clearly, the new provision eliminates all doubt on this issue: The mere fact of the commencement of an action within seven years disqualifies the homeowner, even if the action was subsequently resolved in favor of the homeowner .... A homeowner who has not actually lost a property through foreclosure, but against whom an action has only begun, is not a viable candidate under the act, even though the action was never prosecuted.\u201d D. Caron &amp; G. Milne, Connecticut Foreclosures (4th Ed. 2004) \u00a7 15.03, p. 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">We conclude, therefore, that given the unambiguous language of \u00a7 49-31f (a) (2), if a foreclosure action has been commenced against a defendant within seven years of the date on which he or she seeks protection from foreclosure pursuant to \u00a7 49-3 If, the court has no authority to grant statutory relief no matter how sympathetic or otherwise deserving a defendant may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>appear to be.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the present case, it is undisputed that two prior foreclosure actions had been filed against the defendant within the statutory time period. Thus, because the court properly construed \u00a7 49-31f (a) (2), the defendant\u2019s first claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Next, the defendant claims that the court violated his due process rights in denying his application for foreclosure protection pursuant to \u00a7 49-3 If and rendering judgment of foreclosure against him. Specifically, the defendant argues that due process mandates that he should have been permitted an evidentiary hearing to demonstrate that despite the uncontested fact that two prior foreclosure actions had been filed against him, he still should have been entitled to foreclosure protection. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The following additional facts are necessaiy for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. At the May 30, 2006 hearing, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">\u201c[The Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel]: So, on the calendar today is a reconsideration of the [defendant\u2019s] application [for foreclosure protection], my objection and the [foreclosure] judgment motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. I reviewed the objection and the application, and the objection stated that in 2003 [the defendant] had had two foreclosures filed against him; is this correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: Yes, Your Honor. It\u2019s a matter of public record in this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">\u201cThe Court: Is this correct . . . ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u201c[The Defendant]: That\u2019s not my\u2014that\u2019s not my recollection. There were two items that were filed against us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">\u201c[The Defendant]: However, they were withdrawn by the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201cThe Court: The statute doesn\u2019t speak to that, sir. It just says two foreclosures, two mortgage foreclosures within seven years. So, that would negate your ability to get . . . your application for protection granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Well, I think that\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019re here . . . and one of the things we want to do is get, have a full opportunity to be heard. We wanted to show that we actually meet all of the statute\u2019s [requirements for foreclosure protection] . . . and that we wanted to be heard on that item.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">\u201cThe Court: Well ... if, in fact, you\u2019ve had two foreclosures commenced against you within the last seven years, which, apparently, is the case, then you can\u2019t\u2014 I can\u2019t grant the application for protection under the statute. So, there\u2019s really no need to hear anything because the legislature has enacted this special statute to help people who are underemployed, and, I guess, specifically, did not want to help people who had, within the last seven years, had other mortgage foreclosures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Well, among other things, let me just\u2014can I, can I hand you some exhibits first so that I can talk with you about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\">\u201cThe Court: No, sir. I\u2019m denying the application for protection because there\u2019s no point in hearing anything because you\u2019ve . . . had two foreclosures against you in the last seven years. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-12\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I\u2019ve got some other relevant facts to consider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Okay. Well, I\u2019ve denied it, sir, because you\u2019ve had two foreclosures commenced against you in the last seven years. So, whatever other facts I hear, the legislature says I can\u2019t grant it. So, I\u2019m denying it. . . . I\u2019ve tried to explain to you that this is something that the legislature has enacted, and they\u2019ve said that you can\u2019t use that if you\u2019ve had a mortgage foreclosure filed against you within the last seven years, and you\u2019ve had two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">\u201c[The Defendant]: But here\u2019s the thing, they were . . . completely withdrawn. They were withdrawn by the plaintiff themselves. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">\u201cThe Court: They were filed, I assume, because you were in default on your mortgage. . . . The legislature didn\u2019t say and the statute doesn\u2019t say foreclosure judgment, does it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">\u201c[The Plaintiffs Counsel]: It says commence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">\u201cThe Court: Commence. . . . The foreclosure was commenced . . . and you\u2019ve had two foreclosures commenced against you. The legislature is not willing to give that protection to people who have been in multiple default on their mortgage. I am denying the application, sir. We\u2019re going forward with the judgment. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">\u201c[Bobbie Minor Glenn]: So, even if it\u2019s in error, even if they commenced an action against you and it turns out to be an error, you\u2019re still held accountable for that; is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">The issue of whether the court violated the defendant\u2019s procedural due process rights is a question of law over which this court\u2019s review is plenary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>100 Conn. App. 407, 424, 919 A.2d 465 (2007). \u201cThe fundamental requisite of due process of law is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>opportunity to be heard. . . . The hearing must be at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Giaimo </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>257 Conn. 481, 512, 778 A.2d 33 (2001). \u201cInquiry into whether particular procedures are constitutionally mandated in a given instance requires adherence to the principle that due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. . . . There is no per se rule that an evidentiary hearing is required whenever a [property] interest may be affected. Due process ... is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>235 Conn. 487, 492, 668 A.2d 360 (1995).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court analyzes claims of procedural due process in accordance with the three part test set forth in <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334-35, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976). The Connecticut Supreme Court uses the same test. . . . That test requires a consideration of the private interest that will be affected by the official action, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards, and the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Santana </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>94 Conn. App. 445, 469-70, 894 A.2d 307 (2006), aff'd, 282 Conn. 19, 918 A.2d 267 (2007).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">On the basis of the court\u2019s proper construction of \u00a7 49-3 If (a) (2) and the application of the <em>Mathews </em>factors to the present case, we conclude that the court afforded the defendant a meaningful opportunity to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>heard and that there was no risk of an erroneous deprivation of due process by refusing him an evidentiary hearing on issues unrelated to whether a prior foreclosure had been commenced against him within the past seven years. The defendant did not contest that there had been two prior foreclosure proceedings filed against him within seven years of the present foreclosure action. Rather, he sought to offer reasons for the court to discount those prior foreclosure actions. Under these circumstances, an evidentiary hearing would not have elicited any additional operative facts that could have affected the result because the undisputed fact that two prior foreclosure actions had been filed against the defendant was dispositive of his quest for protection from foreclosure pursuant to \u00a7 49-3 If.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Although we realize that the defendant\u2019s property interest was directly at issue, the record reveals that the defendant had a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the question of the applicability of the statute to his circumstances. Once the court ascertained that there had, in fact, been two prior foreclosures commenced against the defendant within a seven year period, it properly terminated the proceedings. In sum, there would have been be no reason to conduct an evidentiary hearing because the undisputed facts at hand correctly led the court to the conclusion that the provisions of \u00a7 49-3 If were not available to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Due process does not mandate full evidentiary hearings on all matters, and \u201cnot all situations calling for procedural safeguards call for the same kind of procedure.\u201d <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Krause, </em>209 Conn. 352, 377, 551 A.2d 710 (1988). \u201cSo long as the procedure afforded adequately protects the individual interests at stake, there is no reason to impose substantially greater burdens . . . under the guise of due process.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 493. Thus, we conclude that the defendant received all the process that he was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The judgment is affirmed and the case is remanded for the propose of setting a new sale date.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-6\"> Also named as defendants were Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., the department of revenue services, Capital One and Middlesex Hospital. Only Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., and Glenn filed appearances in the trial court. Because only Glenn has appealed, we refer to him in this opinion as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-31f is commonly referred to as the \u201cforeclosure moratorium act . . . .\u201d D. Caron &amp; G. Milne, Connecticut Foreclosures (4th Ed. 2004) \u00a7 15.01, p. 351.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\"> The defendant raises three additional claims, which require little discussion. First, the defendant claims that pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 17-32 (b) the court was required to wait fifteen days after rendering a default to render judgment. In fact, Practice Book \u00a7 17-33 (b) controls this situation. \u201cIt provides in relevant part that the judicial authority, at or after the time it renders the default, notwithstanding Section 17-32 (b), may also render judgment in foreclosure cases . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Branford </em>v. <em>Van Eck, </em>86 Conn. App. 441, 446 n.3, 861 A.2d 560 (2004), cert. denied, 272 Conn. 922, 867 A.2d 839 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Second, the defendant claims that General Statutes \u00a7 49-3 If (g) prevented him from filing an answer to the plaintiffs complaint, which resulted in a default judgment for his failure to plead. Section 49-31f (g) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo homeowner who files a defense to any action for foreclosure shall be eligible to make application for protection from such foreclosure . . . .\u201d The statutory language expressly prohibits only the filing of a defense. It does not, as the defendant argues, state that one cannot file an answer to the complaint. Thus, the defendant misreads the statute, and his claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Finally, the defendant claims that the court \u201cshowed a lapse of ethical conduct and judicial discretion\u201d when it delayed filing its decision for thirty-seven days. This claim appears to be premised on the mistaken belief that no judgment was rendered on May 30, 2006, because the judicial branch\u2019s Internet docket summary did not reflect the judgment until July 10, 2006. Although there may have been a delay in updating the Internet docket summary, the record clearly shows that the court rendered judgment of foreclosure by sale in open court on May 30, 2006, in the defendant\u2019s pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ence. Moreover, the court clarified for the defendant that judgment would be rendered on that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b289-10\"> Two prior foreclosure actions were initiated against the defendant in 2003. They were <em>Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>judicial district of Middlesex, Docket No. CV-03-0100568-S, and <em>Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>judicial district of Middlesex, Docket No. CV-03-0102378-S. Both actions subsequently were withdrawn.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b293-12\"> In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful that the General Assembly has the power to amend the statute to entitle the court, in weighing the equities, to determine whether the mere commencement of a foreclosure action within the statutory time period should invariably preclude the availability of the statute\u2019s protection to a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
