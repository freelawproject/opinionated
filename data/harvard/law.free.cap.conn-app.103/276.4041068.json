Although judges of the Superior Court exercise general jurisdiction, the court must act, in this area of the law, in a manner consistent with the statutory scheme governing the family support magistrate division of the Superior Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>In this matter, which is before us on remand from our Supreme Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> resolution of the issues we confront requires us to examine the Family Support Magistrate\u2019s Act, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-231 etseq., and the interplay between Superior Court judges and family support magistrates. The state of Connecticut, support enforcement services, appeals from the January 12 and August 24, 2004 judgments of the trial court rendered after the Superior Court \u201cinterceded\u201d in a support enforcement action pending before the family support magistrate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The state claims that the court improperly intervened in a matter pending before the family support magistrate, improperly vacated the magistrate\u2019s findings and retroactively modified the magistrate\u2019s orders without notice to the parties and in the absence of an appeal filed pursuant to \u00a7 46b-231 (n). Although we conclude that \u00a7 46b-231 (q) authorizes the Superior Court to intervene in a matter pending before the family support magistrate, the Superior Court does not have the authority to vacate orders issued by the family support magistrate in the absence of notice to the affected parties or an appeal filed pursuant to \u00a7 46b-231 (n). Accordingly, we reverse the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The following facts, as set forth by this court; see <em>Pritchard </em>v. <em>Pritchard, </em>92 Conn. App. 327, 330-33, 885 A.2d 207 (2005), rev\u2019d, 281 Conn. 262, 914 A.2d 1025 (2007); and adopted by the Supreme Court, are relevant to the resolution of the issues before us. \u201cThe plaintiff, Mary Ellen Pritchard, and the defendant, James L. Pritchard, were married on May 5, 1979. Two children were bom of the marriage. On June 11,1996, the parties were divorced. Pursuant to the judgment of dissolution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the defendant was ordered to pay, inter alia, child support in the amount of $180 per week and alimony in the amount of $100 per week. An alimony arrearage of $7549.80 was also found by the court, and the defendant told the court that he would continue to refuse to pay the delinquent alimony. In response, certain bank orders were issued. Nevertheless, on November 1,1996, pursuant to a motion for contempt, the court found the defendant to be in arrears $3600 in child support, $2000 in alimony and $303 in unreimbursed medical expenses. Finding the defendant in contempt, the court issued additional bank orders, transferring certain moneys to the plaintiff. Following the transfer of the bank funds to the plaintiff, which did not clear up the arrearage entirely, the court appointed an attorney for the defendant on March 31, 1997, finding that the defendant was in jeopardy of incarceration for his failure to comply with the orders of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u201cIn response to another motion for contempt filed by the plaintiff, the court, <em>Axelrod, J., </em>on November 25, 1997, denied the motion because it concluded that the plaintiff, herself, had failed to comply with the orders of the court regarding the transfer of certain Florida property to the defendant and that her delay had caused the defendant to lose that portion of the property that the plaintiff had been ordered to transfer to him. The court did find, however, that the defendant owed an arrearage of $13,107.95, consisting of $1700 in alimony, $11,160 in child support and $247.95 in unreimbursed medical expenses. The court also stated that, pursuant to the terms of the judgment of dissolution, alimony had terminated on October 10, 1996, and the court ordered the payment on the arrearage to be $35 per week, with an increase as each child reached majority. On September 3,1998, the plaintiff filed another motion for contempt, which was heard on September 8, 1998. After the defendant failed to appear for the hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the contempt motion, the court found that the arrearage was $27,608.70, and it issued a capias, finding the defendant in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u201cOn July 3, 2000, a new capias was issued after it was discovered that the original had been lost. On September 12, 2002, the defendant was arrested and bond was set at $30,000. After setting the bond, the court, <em>Rodriguez, J., </em>referred the matter to the family support magistrate. On September 18, 2002, the family support magistrate, <em>John P. McCarthy, </em>found the defendant in contempt and set a purge figure of $65,588.70, the amount of the support arrearage. The defendant continued to be brought before the court on a monthly basis for review of the contempt finding. On April 2, 2003, the magistrate increased the defendant\u2019s purge amount to $70,628.70 and also set a bond of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\u201cOn April 23, 2003, the defendant filed a motion for contempt against the plaintiff, alleging that her failure to transfer the Florida property in a timely manner amounted to a fraudulent conveyance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On July 30,2003, during one of the monthly reviews of the defendant\u2019s incarceration on the contempt finding, the magistrate found that property owned by the defendant in Bethel had been fraudulently transferred to the defendant\u2019s companion, Suzanne Spellman, and the magistrate ordered that the defendant could be released if Spell-man placed a mortgage on the property to secure a lien in the name of the plaintiff and then sold the property and paid the plaintiff. On November 26, 2003, the magistrate lowered the defendant\u2019s purge amount to zero and set a bond of $30,000. On December 4, 2003, the state filed a motion for reconveyance of the Bethel property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>with the Superior Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On December 15, 2003, Spell-man and the defendant appeared before the Superior Court for a hearing on the motion for reconveyance. On January 7, 2004, the magistrate lowered the defendant\u2019s bond to $5000, and set another review date for the following week, January 14, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u201cOn January 12, 2004, after a hearing on the state\u2019s motion for reconveyance, the court, <em>Shay, J., </em>ordered the defendant released from custody and vacated [the finding of an arrearage], the capias, the bond and all prior findings of contempt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court also suspended the payment of child support and continued the matter until April 19, 2004. The state filed an appeal from the January 12 [2004] judgment. . . . The state claimed on appeal that the trial court lacked authority under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-231 (q) and 46b-86 to vacate the prior orders issued by the Superior Court and the family support magistrate when the defendant had not appealed from or otherwise challenged those orders. Subsequently, on April 26, 2004, the trial court found that the defendant had fraudulently transferred the Bethel property to Spellman, but stayed enforcement until it could recalculate the amount of arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>\u201cOn August 24,2004, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision in which it reiterated its January 12, 2004 orders, recalculated the amount of arrearage and ordered the defendant to make certain payments. . . . The court explained that it had vacated the September 8, 2002 contempt order because the original court order did not comport with the fundamentals of due process .... With respect to its ruling vacating the arrearage order, the court recognized that the defendant had never filed a motion for modification. It concluded, however, that it was \u2018equitable and appropriate\u2019 to treat the defendant\u2019s April 23, 2003 motion for contempt<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> against the plaintiff for her failure to comply with orders concerning the transfer of the Florida properties as a motion to reopen the September 8, 1998 judgment, because the defendant consistently contended that the loss of the Florida real estate was somehow tied to his child support obligation .... Accordingly, the court concluded that it was authorized to vacate the finding of contempt and to modify the existing child support orders. The state then filed an amended appeal from that decision, indicating that the original judgment was the one rendered on January 12, 2004. Attached to the amended appeal was an amended preliminary statement of issues in which the state raised two new issues related to the August 24, 2004 ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pritchard </em>v. <em>Pritchard, </em>281 Conn. 262, 264-68, 914 A.2d 1025 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Emerging from this procedural and factual history are the following issues: whether the court had the authority to intervene in the matter that was pending before the family support magistrate and, if so, whether the court properly vacated the capias, contempt and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>arrearage orders, and modified the ongoing support order. We respond to each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">At the outset, we address the applicable standard of review. The state\u2019s claims on appeal rest on our interpretation of the Family Support Magistrate\u2019s Act, \u00a7 46b-231 et seq. \u201cIssues of statutory construction raise questions of law, over which we exercise plenary review. . . . The process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language does so apply. . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alvord Investment, LLC </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>282 Conn. 393, 401-402, 920 A.2d 1000 (2007). With the foregoing legal principles in mind, we turn to the state\u2019s specific claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">To resolve the issues before us, we begin with the language of \u00a7 46b-231 (q), which provides: \u201cWhen an order for child or spousal support has been entered against an obligor by the Superior Court in an action originating in the Superior Court, such order shall supersede any previous order for child or spousal support against such obligor entered by a family support magistrate and shall also supersede any previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>agreement for support executed by such obligor and filed with the Family Support Magistrate Division.\u201d Thus, according to the plain language of the statute, the Superior Court may enter support orders in a case that had been pending before the family support magistrate but which originated in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The Superior Court\u2019s authority to intervene in a matter pending before a magistrate is further supported by our jurisprudence regarding the proper exercise of jurisdiction. \u201cOur legislature has consistently drafted legislation to state expressly when a court has exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Sender </em>v. <em>Sender, </em>56 Conn. App. 492, 498, 743 A.2d 1149 (2000). \u201cThe Superior Court of this state as a court of law is a court of general jurisdiction. It has jurisdiction of all matters expressly committed to it and of all others cognizable by any law court of which the exclusive jurisdiction is not given to some other court. The fact that no other court has exclusive jurisdiction in any matter is sufficient to give the Superior Court jurisdiction over that matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>LaBella </em>v. <em>LaBella, </em>134 Conn. 312, 316, 57 A.2d 627 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-231 (d) provides: \u201cThere is created the Family Support Magistrate Division of the Superior Corut for the purpose of the impartial administration of child and spousal support.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-231 (b) (6) provides: \u201c \u2018Family Support Magistrate Division\u2019 means a division of the Superior Court created by this section for the purpose of establishing and enforcing child and spousal support in IV-D cases and in cases brought pursuant to sections 46b-212 to 46b-213v, inclusive, utilizing quasi-judicial proceedings . . . .\u201d As a creature of statute, the family support magistrate division has only that power that has been expressly conferred on it. Thus, while a family support magistrate has only the authority granted by statute, the Superior Court is a court of general jurisdiction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>has authority over all cognizable claims not given to some other court.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Although the primary role of the family support magistrate division is the enforcement of support orders, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-212h (a) grants the family support magistrate division <em>or </em>the Superior Court exclusive jurisdiction over child support orders. Thus, because the legislature has not given the family support magistrate exclusive jurisdiction over child support matters and has specifically given the Superior Court jurisdiction in such matters, the Superior Court has authority to hear a support matter even if the magistrate has already exercised jurisdiction in that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The authority of the Superior Court, however, is not unbounded. Although \u00a7 46b-231 (q) provides that a judge may enter orders that would supersede those of a magistrate, this provision must be read in harmony with the other provisions of the Family Support Magistrate\u2019s Act. \u201cIn giving a statute its full meaning where that construction is in harmony with the context and policy of the statute, there is no canon against using common sense in construing laws as saying what they obviously mean.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Singh v. Singh, </em>213 Conn. 637, 655, 569 A.2d 1112 (1990). Section 46b-231 (n) provides an avenue to appeal a decision of a family support magistrate to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To read subsection (q) as allowing the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Court to vacate an order of a magistrate in the absence of an appeal would render subsection (n) meaningless. Thus, a Superior Court judge may vacate orders of a family support magistrate only when the criteria for appealing that order have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We now apply the general conclusions reached previously to the specific facts of the case before us. As noted, this case originated in the Superior Court as a dissolution matter. Subsequent to the judgment of dissolution, the plaintiff sought the services of the child support enforcement bureau to help her collect the child support she was owed by the defendant by virtue of the dissolution judgment, and the matter was referred to the family support magistrate division. For a period of several years, the family support magistrate enforced the support orders, periodically finding the defendant in arrears and in contempt. When the state filed its motion for reconveyance in the marital dissolution matter, the case was returned to the regular Superior Court docket due to the magistrate\u2019s limited jurisdiction. Because the present case fits squarely within the plain language of \u00a7 46b-231 (q), the court properly could have entertained the issue of prospective child support. Additionally, the capias that ordered the defendant into the custody of the court was an ongoing matter over which the court properly could exercise its authority. However, although the court had the authority to intervene in this matter and to make prospective orders, because the defendant did not appeal from the previous arrearage and contempt orders, and the court was not exercising its statutory appellate authority, therefore, the court did not have the authority to vacate those previously made orders.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The state also claims that it was not afforded adequate notice of the court\u2019s intention to modify the support orders. At the outset, we note the principles underlying the necessity for adequate and proper notice. \u201cIt is the settled rule of this jurisdiction, if indeed it may not be safely called an established principle of general jurisprudence, that no court will proceed to the adjudication of a matter involving conflicting rights and interests, until all persons directly concerned in the event have been actually or constructively notified of the pendency of the proceeding, and given reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard. ... It is a fundamental premise of due process that a court cannot adjudicate a matter until the persons directly concerned have been notified of its pendency and have been given a reasonable opportunity to be heard in sufficient time to prepare their positions on the issues involved.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Egan </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>83 Conn. App. 514, 518, 850 A.2d 251 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Here, the only motion before the court when it vacated the prior contempt and arrearage orders and modified the ongoing support order was the state\u2019s motion for reconveyance of real estate. Although the state sought a reconveyance of property as an avenue for enforcing the support order, there was no motion pending before the court to modify the prior support orders. The court indicated that it was construing the defendant\u2019s motion for contempt, filed April 23, 2003, which may have been withdrawn, as a motion for modification. Because that motion did not even mention child support, it could not fairly be read as a request for modification of support.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, because the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>for contempt was not before the court, and the motion before the court did not pertain to child support, none of the parties had notice that the court might vacate the prior contempt and arrearage orders and modify the support order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because the court acted in violation of the state\u2019s due process rights to be given adequate notice of the issues the court intended to address, and, accordingly, to be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard in sufficient time to prepare a position on the issues involved, the action taken by the court cannot stand.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In sum, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-231 (q), the court properly intervened in this matter and, because the defendant\u2019s imprisonment was ongoing, the court properly released him from incarceration. Because there was, however, no appeal filed from the prior arrearage and contempt orders, the court exceeded its authority in vacating those orders. Additionally, although the court had the authority to enter prospective orders pursuant to \u00a7 46b-231 (q), the court improperly modified the support orders in that it did so without giving adequate notice to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The judgments vacating the arrearage and contempt orders and modifying the child support order are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\"> In <em>Pritchard, </em>v. Pritchard, 281 Conn. 262, 914 A.2d 1025 (2007), the Supreme Court reversed this court\u2019s dismissal of the state\u2019s appeal for lack of a final judgment and mootness and remanded the matter to this court for consideration of the merits of the state\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\"> The minor children of the parties also have filed a brief in this appeal that basically reiterates the position of the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\"> \u201cThe state argues that this motion was withdrawn on May 12, 2003.
