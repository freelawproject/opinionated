The petitioner claims that the court (1) abused its discretion by excluding certain testimony as irrelevant and (2) improperly concluded that defense counsel had not rendered ineffective legal assistance during his representation of the petitioner. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">The following facts and procedural history inform our disposition of the petitioner\u2019s appeal. In connection with the shooting death of Jose Vasquez on December 23, 1994, the petitioner was arrested and charged with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to a plea agreement negotiated by his defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>counsel, John W. Watson, the petitioner pleaded guilty to the murder charge under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on January 5,1998. The trial court, <em>Clifford, J., </em>thoroughly canvassed the petitioner and found that the plea was made knowingly and voluntarily with the assistance of competent counsel. In exchange for the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea, the state recommended a sentence of thirty years incarceration and dropped additional charges and withdrew its request for a sentence enhancement. On March 20, 1998, the court sentenced the petitioner to thirty years incarceration in accordance with the plea agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">On November 29, 2004, the petitioner filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel during the prior criminal proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The petitioner and Watson testified at a hearing on the petition before the court, <em>Hon. Ronald J. Fracasse, </em>judge trial referee, on December 17,2004. On December 20,2004, the court dismissed the amended petition and rendered judgment dismissing the petition. The court granted the petition for certification to appeal on December 29, 2004. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The petitioner sought relief from the habeas court on the grounds that his defense counsel was ineffective both during plea negotiations and before the trial court. \u201cIn <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the United States Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Court enunciated the two requirements that must be met before a petitioner is entitled to reversal of a conviction due to ineffective assistance of counsel. First, the [petitioner] must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. . . . Second, the [petitioner] must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. . . . Unless a [petitioner] makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction . . . resulted from a breakdown in the adversarial process that renders the result unreliable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dixson, </em>93 Conn. App. 171, 184, 888 A.2d 1088, cert. denied, 277 Conn. 917, 895 A.2d 790 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In the present case, the petitioner pleaded guilty to the charged offense, thereby forgoing a trial. \u201cFor ineffectiveness claims resulting from guilty pleas, we apply the standard set forth in <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985), which modified <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u201cTo satisfy the performance prong, the petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. ... A petitioner who accepts counsel\u2019s advice to plead guilty has the burden of demonstrating on habeas appeal that the advice was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. . . . The range of competence demanded is reasonably competent, or within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law. . . . Reasonably competent attorneys may advise their clients to plead guilty even if defenses may exist. ... A reviewing court must view counsel\u2019s conduct with a strong presumption that it falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and that a tactic that appears ineffective in hindsight may have been sound trial strategy at the time. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u201cTo satisfy the prejudice prong, the petitioner must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. . . . Reasonable probability does not require the petitioner to show that counsel\u2019s deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome in the case, but he must establish a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. ... A reviewing court can find against a petitioner on either ground, whichever is easier.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bowden </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>93 Conn. App. 333, 339, 888 A.2d 1131, cert. denied, 277 Conn. 924, 895 A.2d 796 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">We first address the petitioner\u2019s claim that the court improperly excluded certain testimony at the habeas trial. Specifically, the petitioner claims that the court improperly excluded testimony regarding the circumstances surrounding the shooting and testimony relative to whether he would have testified had he elected a trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a threshold matter, we note that these rulings were not specifically challenged in the petition for certification to appeal from the court\u2019s decision. In the absence of demonstrable prejudice, however, the terms of the court\u2019s grant of certification will not limit the specific issues subject to appellate review. <em>James L. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>245 Conn. 132, 138, 712 A.2d 947 (1998). Accordingly, we review these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">The following additional facts are pertinent to the petitioner\u2019s claims. During direct examination at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>habeas hearing, the petitioner offered testimony regarding his recollection of the circumstances surrounding the shooting that predicated his conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The petitioner also offered testimony that if he had pleaded not guilty, Watson would have opposed his testifying at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>criminal trial. The court sustained on relevance grounds each of the objections by the respondent, the commissioner of correction, to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u201c[T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility [and relevancy] of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pilotti, </em>99 Conn. App. 563, 567, 914 A.2d 1067, cert. denied, 282 Conn. 903, 919 A.2d 1037 (2007). \u201cEvidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is material to the determination of the proceeding more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. . . . The proffering party bears the burden of establishing the relevance of the offered testimony.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>97 Conn. App. 719, 726-27, 906 A.2d 705 (2006), cert. denied, 281 Conn. 913, 916 A.2d 55 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">First, the petitioner claims that the court abused its discretion by excluding testimony regarding the circumstances surrounding the shooting. During direct examination at the habeas hearing, the court allowed the petitioner to testify that he believed the shooting was an accident. The corut excluded the petitioner\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>regarding additional details surrounding the shooting. The petitioner offered this testimony as proof that at the time he entered his plea, he had a viable defense that the shooting was an accident. We are not persuaded that the court\u2019s assessment of Watson\u2019s competence turned on the petitioner\u2019s recollection at the habeas trial of every detail of the shooting. As we have noted, reasonably competent attorneys may advise their clients to plead guilty even if defenses may exist. See <em>Bowden </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 93 Conn. App. 339. We therefore conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by excluding this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The petitioner next claims that the court abused its discretion by excluding his testimony that if he had pleaded not guilty, Watson would not have wanted him to testify at trial. This testimony was offered to show that Watson improperly failed to pursue the petitioner\u2019s accident defense. As we have noted, a tactic that appears ineffective in hindsight may have been sound strategy at the time. See id. In this case, the effectiveness of Watson\u2019s trial tactics was never tested because the petitioner pleaded guilty. We are not persuaded that speculation could guide the court\u2019s assessment of Watson\u2019s effectiveness any better than hindsight could. The court did not abuse its discretion by also excluding this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We now turn to the petitioner\u2019s claim that the court improperly concluded that Watson had not rendered ineffective legal assistance during his representation of the petitioner. Specifically, the petitioner contends that his plea was not entered knowingly and voluntarily because Watson failed (1) to discuss adequately with the petitioner the content and admissibility of certain tape-recorded conversations that incriminated the petitioner, (2) to discuss adequately with the petitioner the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>consequences of his <em>Alford </em>plea, (3) to pursue adequately certain defenses or lesser included offenses and (4) to challenge the petitioner\u2019s mental competence to enter a guilty plea.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u201cOur standard of review of a habeas court\u2019s judgment on ineffective assistance of counsel claims is well settled. In a habeas appeal, this court cannot disturb the underlying facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous, but our review of whether the facts as found by the habeas court constituted a violation of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>99 Conn. App. 434, 438, 914 A.2d 585, cert. granted on other grounds, 282 Conn. 910, 922 A.2d 1098 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">At the habeas trial, the petitioner testified as to the following version of events. Watson had discussed with him a possible alibi defense. On the eve of trial, however, Watson told him that the state had acquired certain tape-recorded conversations that incriminated the petitioner. Watson expressed to him little hope of suppressing these conversations at trial and predicted that his chances of being acquitted on the murder charge were minimal. Watson further explained to the petitioner the concept of an <em>Alford </em>plea and the negotiated thirty year sentence for pleading guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine. The petitioner also testified that he had a limited education and that he and his attorney had difficulty communicating with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Watson\u2019s recollection of events differed from the petitioner\u2019s. Watson stated that after listening to the incriminating tapes, he filed a motion for a continuance to investigate the possibility of suppressing the tapes and discussed the content of the tapes with the petitioner. He discussed with the petitioner possible defenses at trial, including alibi and accident, but ruled out the accident defense because the petitioner indicated that such a scenario was untrue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He advised the petitioner that his chances of success at trial were minimal and that they should seek a plea bargain. He took a substantial amount of time ensuring that the petitioner understood the consequences of an <em>Alford </em>plea. He also had some problems explaining to the petitioner what was happening and the complex legal issues involved, but the petitioner ultimately understood Watson\u2019s explanations. The petitioner expressed to him dissatisfaction with the plea bargain he had reached with the state but preferred the plea bargain to risking a murder conviction at trial. According to Watson, if the petitioner had insisted on a trial, he likely faced a sentence greater than the thirty year sentence Watson had negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The court relied heavily on the credibility of the witnesses in reaching its conclusions. \u201cThis court does not retry the case or evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Rather, we must defer to the [trier of fact\u2019s] assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude. ... In a case that is tried to the court . . . the judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of witnesses, and the weight to be given to their specific testimony. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>68 Conn. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>373, 376, 791 A.2d 638, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 911, 796 A.2d 557 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">In its memorandum of decision, the court credited Watson\u2019s testimony and found that Watson fully discussed with the petitioner the evidence against him, including the tapes, as well as the issues involved, several possible defenses and his guilty plea. The court also found no evidence that the petitioner suffered from any mental defect and found that he was able to understand the criminal proceedings and to assist in his defense. We thoroughly reviewed the record of the proceedings in this case. Our review revealed adequate support for the court\u2019s findings, and we therefore conclude that those findings are not clearly erroneous. On the basis of its findings, the court properly concluded that the petitioner failed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel and prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-14\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\"> See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 <em>S. </em>Ed. 2d 162 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b278-9\"> At the sentencing healing, the petitioner was represented by Ellen Mor-rissey, special public defender, who filed a motion to withdraw the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea. The petitioner withdrew this motion before the court imposed a sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b278-10\"> The petition addressed only the performance of Watson during the plea negotiations and before the trial court. The petition made no allegations regarding the performance of Morrissey during the sentencing hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b280-9\"> The petitioner additionally claims that the court improperly excluded testimony regarding the results of a physician\u2019s evaluation of the petitioner\u2019s intellectual capacity. Because the petitioner failed to brief this issue, we decline to review this claim. See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>101 Conn. App. 106, 122, 920 A.2d 340 (2007) (\u201cIt is well established that [w]e are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . . Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failing to brief the issue properly. . . . Where the parties cite no law and provide no analysis of their claims, we do not review such claims.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\"> The following colloquy occurred during direct examination of the petitioner by his counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">\u201cQ.

The amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus did not address the petitioner\u2019s waiver of the presentence investigation. Further, the petitioner offered no evidence, and the habeas court made no findings, regarding his waiver of the presentence investigation.
