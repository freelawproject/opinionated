We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> had known the defendant since she was approximately five to seven years old. When she first came into contact with the defendant, the victim and her immediate family lived in Poughkeepsie, New York, where the defendant, who was the boyfriend of the victim\u2019s aunt, also lived. At that time, the defendant would occasionally watch the victim and her siblings while the victim\u2019s mother and her aunt went out. The victim testified that on many of these occasions, while the victim and the defendant were in her mother\u2019s room, the defendant initiated sexual contact with her by rubbing her chest and vagina underneath her clothing and attempted unsuccessfully to engage in sexual intercourse with her. The victim\u2019s mother testified that the defendant was in his early twenties at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">When the victim was approximately eight years old, she and her family moved to an apartment in Bridgeport. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Shortly after the victim moved to Bridgeport, the victim\u2019s aunt and the defendant moved there as well, taking up residence in an apartment upstairs from the victim and her family. The victim testified that, during the period when she was between the ages of eight to approximately eleven or twelve years old, the defendant continued to engage in the same type of sexual contact with her. She testified specifically to an incident that occurred in her aunt\u2019s upstairs apartment when the defendant began groping and touching her chest area, removed her shorts and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her. She testified that she was successful in warding off his attempts at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Both the victim and the defendant changed residences on at least two subsequent occasions; however, they stayed in Bridgeport and always remained in relative proximity to each other. When the victim was approximately twelve years old, she began to baby-sit for her younger cousin at the home of her aunt and the defendant. The victim testified that one night, when she was twelve years old, the defendant came into her cousin\u2019s room where she was sleeping and had sexual intercourse with her. She testified that this occurred on other occasions, at times when she would sleep overnight at her aunt\u2019s house. She gave a detailed account of another incident that occurred in her cousin\u2019s room when the defendant attempted unsuccessfully to engage in anal intercourse with her. After this incident, the victim confronted the defendant and warned him that she would tell her mother what was occurring if it continued. According to the victim, the sexual assaults stopped after this confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The victim first reported the sexual assaults to her former boyfriend\u2019s mother, J, years later, in 2001. J advised the victim not to tell her boyfriend, S, because J feared that her son would get hurt or do something irrational after hearing that the abuse had occurred. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Eventually, the victim told S about the assaults approximately two years after she made the initial disclosure to J.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In July, 2003, the victim and S were in an argument on the street outside of the victim\u2019s home, which eventually required police intervention. Many other people were present, including the victim\u2019s mother, her aunt, the defendant and J. At some point during the argument, the victim\u2019s aunt got involved. In response to a comment made to S by the victim\u2019s aunt, S stated, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be worried about me, you should be worried about [the defendant]. He molested her when she was little.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">After this argument, the victim admitted to her mother that she had been sexually assaulted by the defendant. The assaults eventually were reported to the authorities in July, 2003. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The defendant\u2019s first claims involve allegations of prosecutorial impropriety. The defendant concedes that his prosecutorial impropriety claims were not preserved at trial. In reviewing unpreserved claims of prosecutorial impropriety, we engage in a two step analytical process, making an initial determination as to whether prosecutorial impropriety occurred and, if so, examining whether it deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial by applying the factors set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>282 Conn. 23, 32-33, 917 A.2d 978 (2007). \u201c[W]e emphasize that counsel\u2019s failure to object at trial, while not by itself <em>fatal </em>to a defendant\u2019s claim, frequently will indicate on appellate review that the challenged comments do not rise to the magnitude of constitutional error .... Put differently . . . prosecutorial [impropriety] claims [are] not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>intended to provide an avenue for the tactical sandbagging of our trial courts, but rather, to address gross prosecutorial improprieties that . . . have deprived a criminal defendant of his right to a fair trial. \u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>89 Conn. App. 1, 27-28, 872 A.2d 477, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 921, 883 A.2d 1247 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The defendant first claims that throughout the trial, the prosecutor improperly alluded to unsupported allegations that the defendant fled the state after the accusations against him surfaced. Specifically, the defendant claims that the prosecutor posited questions to four witnesses,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> probing whether the defendant had gone to his mother\u2019s house in Poughkeepsie, New York, after the allegations against him had been lodged, without any evidence that the defendant had left the jurisdiction. He argues that the state\u2019s use of these unsupported allegations to imply flight and consciousness of guilt on his part amounted to prosecutorial impropriety that deprived him of a fair trial or, in the alternative, constituted plain error warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial impropriety, the state argues that the defendant\u2019s claim pertains to consciousness of guilt testimony, and, therefore, the claim is evidentiary in nature, without constitutional ramifications. Because this evidentiary claim was not preserved at trial, the state argues that we should decline to review the issue. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">At trial, after the state presented its case-in-chief, the defense called two witnesses, the defendant and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>girlfriend, the victim\u2019s aunt. It was during this testimony that the state first sought to question the witnesses about the defendant\u2019s alleged flight to Poughkeepsie, an event that they denied had occurred. After the defense rested, the state called one rebuttal witness, the victim\u2019s uncle, and questioned him about whether the defendant had gone to New York after the July, 2003 incident. Although the victim\u2019s uncle denied that the defendant told him that he had gone to New York, he stated that he assumed that the defendant had gone to Poughkeep-sie and admitted that he may have told an investigator that during a telephone conversation, the defendant told him that he had gone to Poughkeepsie.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">As an initial matter, we must resolve whether the actions of the prosecutor set forth in the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim constitute prosecutorial impropriety. With regard to whether the prosecutor\u2019s attempts to put a consciousness of guilt issue improperly before the jury constitutes prosecutorial impropriety, \u201c[i]t has . . . been stated numerous times that consciousness of guilt issues are not constitutional . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>279 Conn. 139, 153, 900 A.2d 1276 (2006). As such, they do not necessarily rise to a colorable claim of prosecutorial impropriety. Id., 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Camera, </em>81 Conn. App. 175, 839 A.2d 613, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 910, 845 A.2d 412 (2004), the defendant argued that the prosecutor \u201cimproperly used both cross-examination and summation to shift the burden of proof to the defendant and to mislead the jury into believing that the defendant had a duty to assert his innocence, thereby violating his due process right to a fair trial. He arguefd] that the prosecutor, during cross-examination, alluded to a duty on the defendant\u2019s part to initiate contact with the police and that failure to do so was evidence of culpability. The defendant contend[ed] that the prosecutor returned to that theme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>during summation, which the defendant maintain[ed] was sufficient in and of itself to have deprived him of a fair trial.\u201d Id., 186-87. The defendant sought review under <em>State </em>v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A. 2d 823 (1989), because he had not objected to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks as prosecutorial impropriety before the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Camera, </em>supra, 187-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In <em>Camera, </em>we declined to review the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim that the prosecutor\u2019s use of consciousness of guilt testimony constituted prosecutorial impropriety, concluding that \u201c[t]he references made by the prosecutor to the defendant\u2019s departure from the scene before the police arrived and subsequent unwillingness to contact the police pertained to consciousness of guilt. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim [that the defendant had a duty to contact the police and that the failure to do so was evidence of culpability] is actually premised on the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s questioning on the subject of consciousness of guilt, rather than on alleged prosecutorial [impropriety]. In the context of this case, therefore, the defendant\u2019s claim must be considered evidentiary rather than constitutional in nature.\u201d Id., 188-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 145, the state presented evidence that the defendant, who was charged with, inter alia, robbery in the first degree, ran from the police on a subsequent occasion during which he was observed discarding contraband. The defendant chose not to present evidence that he fled because of the contraband. At trial, the prosecutor repeatedly argued that the reason the defendant ran from the police was because the car he was using on the night in question was the same car he used during the robbery two weeks earlier. Id., 148-49. Although this court initially reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction on the ground of prosecutorial impropriety, our Supreme Court reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the decision, noting that the testimony at issue pertained to allegations of the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt and that the defendant had failed to object to the testimony on that ground. Agreeing with our decision in <em>Camera, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that, having failed to object at trial, the defendant had no colorable claim of prosecutorial impropriety with regard to the prosecutor\u2019s comments about consciousness of guilt and that the defendant\u2019s claim was an unreviewable evidentiary claim. Id., 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Here, the defendant\u2019s claim is premised only on the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of the witnesses on the subject of consciousness of guilt. The defendant has referred to nothing in the record to indicate that the state used the purported inference of flight in closing argument,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and no consciousness of guilt instruction was requested. Essentially, the defendant argues that it was improper for the prosecutor to have questioned the witnesses about the defendant\u2019s flight from the state because the trial witnesses denied that the event occurred,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>and, therefore, there was no evidence that it occurred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Thus, we agree with the state\u2019s characterization of the defendant\u2019s claim as an unpreserved evidentiary claim. When the prosecutor sought to elicit testimony from the witnesses about the defendant\u2019s flight to Poughkeepsie, the defendant did not object. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant has no colorable claim of prosecutorial impropriety with regard to the prosecutor\u2019s questions and that the defendant\u2019s claim is an unreviewable evidentiary claim. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Alternatively, the defendant argues that we should reverse his conviction under the plain error doctrine. \u201cThe plain error doctrine is ... a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, for reasons of policy. . . . The plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. ... A party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>275 Conn. 205, 239-40, 881 A.2d 160 (2005). We conclude that the defendant has suffered no manifest injustice constituting plain error.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor improperly asked the jury during closing argument to consider the testimony of the victim\u2019s former boyfriend, S, to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony with regard to prior uncharged misconduct evidence, which he argues denied him a fair trial. The defendant claims that the uncharged misconduct evidence brought in through S, which was first elicited by defense counsel, should not have been permitted as constancy of accusation testimony. As such, the defendant claims that the state\u2019s comments on the testimony as \u201ccorroboration of consistency\u201d during closing argument<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> constituted prosecutorial impropriety, which denied him a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">During trial, the state indicated that it intended to call S to testify regarding the circumstances surrounding his July, 2003 argument with the victim but also intended to question S as a constancy of accusation witness with respect to the disclosures that the victim had made to him previously that the defendant had abused her sexually. After a lengthy discourse with the court about the admissibility of the evidence under the constancy of accusation exception to the rule against hearsay, the state abandoned its request for permission to question S regarding the disclosure and agreed to limit the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>mony to the July, 2003 incident, which it did on direct examination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On cross-examination, however, defense counsel inquired about the disclosure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On redirect, the state then elicited farther information about the details of the disclosure in which S testified that the victim had explained to him that the defendant had used Vaseline during the sexual assaults. The state referred to S\u2019s redirect testimony in its closing argument. See footnote 9. The defendant did not object either to the testimony elicited by the state on redirect examination of S or to the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In asserting his claim on appeal, the defendant concedes that by questioning S about the disclosure on cross-examination, defense counsel opened the door to this testimony. Moreover, the defendant does not object to the testimony itself; rather, his claim is grounded in the assertion that it was improper for the state to comment on the testimony during closing argument because the evidence was inadmissible as constancy testimony.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude that the defendant opened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the door to the redirect questioning and that the prosecutor\u2019s comments on the evidence in closing were not improper.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Was there a point in your relationship with [the victim] that she told you something about her and [the defendant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">\u201c[The Witness]: About a year and a half\u2014about a year and half when we started dating, after, she told me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And was this something that happened when she was a little kid in New York?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">\u201c[The Witness]: Well, from what I was told, it\u2014it happened in New York, but she never went further. She never told me anything else.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u201cGenerally, a party who delves into a particular subject during the examination of a witness cannot object if the opposing party later questions the witness on the same subject. . . . The party who initiates discussion on the issue is said to have \u2018opened the door\u2019 to rebuttal by the opposing party. <em>Even though the rebuttal evidence would ordinarily be inadmissible on other grounds, </em>the court may, in its discretion, allow it where the party initiating inquiry has made unfair use of the evidence. . . . This rule \u2018operates to prevent a defendant from successfully excluding inadmissible prosecution evidence and then selectively introducing pieces of this evidence for his own advantage, without allowing the prosecution to place the evidence in its proper context.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 13, 509 A.2d 493 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Thus, notwithstanding that such evidence may be otherwise inadmissible, if a party opens the door, the court may, in its discretion, permit a party on rebuttal to offer evidence on the same subject if it is responsive to the previously admitted evidence. The purpose is to prevent one party from making unfair use of certain evidence to that party\u2019s advantage, thereby creating a misleading impression to the fact finder.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See id. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>allowing such evidence, the court must apply a balancing test to determine whether the introduction of the evidence would be unduly prejudicial. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Busque, </em>31 Conn. App. 120, 128 n.5, 623 A.2d 532 (1993) (\u201c[b]ecause, as we have stated, [the witness\u2019] testimony was more prejudicial than probative, even if its introduction were permitted under our rules of evidence, we decline to analyze this claim in terms of the doctrine of \u2018opening the door\u2019 \u201d), appeal dismissed, 229 Conn. 839, 643 A.2d 1281 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Here, the defendant successfully prevented the state on direct examination from introducing testimony from S about the victim\u2019s disclosure that the defendant had sexually assaulted her. On cross-examination, the defendant then sought, however, to introduce selected portions of the excluded evidence for his own advantage. Specifically, the record reveals that the defendant sought to attack the victim\u2019s credibility by highlighting the fact that she made vague disclosures to S about the sexual assaults and that her disclosures were limited to incidents that occurred outside of the time frame of the charged offenses, thereby creating a misleading impression.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, in closing argument, defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>counsel also sought to capitalize on the vagueness of the victim\u2019s disclosures to S.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, the state\u2019s followup redirect examination, which sought to elicit more details about the nature of the disclosures and to provide a motive as to why the victim may not have been forthcoming to S, was a proper way to place the statements in context and clear up the misleading impression put forth by the defense. Accordingly, we conclude that it was not improper for the state to place the statements in context and to comment on such statements in closing, and, therefore, the defendant has presented no col-orable claim of prosecutorial impropriety on this ground.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly permitted the state to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s misconduct toward the victim that occurred prior to the time period set forth in the information and outside of the state. Specifically, the defendant claims that it was improper to admit the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant initiated sexual contact with her by rubbing her chest and vagina underneath her clothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>and attempted unsuccessfully to engage in sexual intercourse with her while the defendant cared for her at her mother\u2019s house in Poughkeepsie when she was between the ages of five and seven years old. The defendant argues that these allegations were vague, unsubstantiated and therefore overly prejudicial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u201cThis court reviews evidentiary claims by an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>63 Conn. App. 263, 273, 775 A.2d 338, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 930, 776 A.2d 1148 (2001). \u201cThe rules governing the admissibility of evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s prior misconduct are well established. Although evidence of prior unconnected crimes is inadmissible to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s bad character or to suggest that the defendant has a propensity for criminal behavior . . . such evidence may be admissible for other purposes, such as to prove knowledge, intent, motive, and common scheme or design, if the trial court determines, in the exercise of judicial discretion, that the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial tendency. . . . That evidence tends to prove the commission of other crimes by the accused does not render it inadmissible if it is otherwise relevant and material .... In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling. . . . Reversal is required only [when] an abuse of discretion is manifest or [when] injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Sawyer, </em>279 Conn. 331, 343, 904 A.2d 101 (2006). Our Supreme Court has instructed that evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior sexual misconduct in sexual assault cases is viewed more liberally than other types of prior misconduct. Id., 332 n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Here, the court exercised sound discretion in admitting the evidence. Specifically, the court ordered a voir dire examination of the victim regarding her proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>testimony on the prior uncharged misconduct outside the presence of the jury and heard argument from counsel before rendering a decision on the admissibility of the evidence. The court also made a specific finding that the evidence was admissible on the issues of motive and intent and made a detailed finding that the evidence was highly probative and material, and that its probative value outweighed the prejudicial effect. Furthermore, the court instructed the jury on the limited use of the evidence in order to safeguard against misuse and to minimize the prejudicial impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">With regard to the court\u2019s finding that the testimony was admissible on the issue of motive, <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 560 A.2d 426 (1989), is instructive. In <em>James, </em>our Supreme Court explained that \u201c[e]vidence of prior sexual misconduct with the complainant in a sexual assault case has commonly been admitted to show a lustful inclination toward the victim.\u201d Id., 578. \u201cThat the defendant had a particular sexual interest in [the victim] is certainly relevant to his motivation to commit the crime charged.\u201d Id. Citing <em>James, </em>the trial court determined that the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant previously had committed sexual acts toward her was relevant and material on the issue of motive. We conclude that the court\u2019s reliance on <em>James </em>and its determination that the evidence was admissible were not an abuse of discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>38 Conn. App. 125, 132, 659 A.2d 1211 (\u201cthe victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant had previously committed sexual acts toward her was relevant and material\u201d), cert. denied, 235 Conn. 903, 665 A.2d 904 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">With regard to the court\u2019s balancing test, the defendant argues that the allegations were remote in time and that the victim\u2019s accounts were vague and uncorroborated. \u201cThe remoteness in time of a prior incident is rarely, standing alone, determinative of the admissibility of such evidence; rather, it is one factor to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>considered by the trial court in making its decision.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 62, 644 A.2d 887 (1994) (despite seven year hiatus between prior misconduct and charged offense, court did not abuse discretion in concluding that misconduct evidence \u201cwas sufficiently recent to have probative value\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s claim that the accounts were vague, the record reflects that during the voir dire, the victim gave a specific account of the prior assaults, providing details that included the defendant\u2019s use of Vaseline, the location where the incidents occurred and a description of exactly how the defendant touched her. Moreover, notwithstanding that the defendant was unsuccessful in his attempts to engage in sexual intercourse with the victim on the uncharged occasions, the way in which he touched her on the prior occasions was very similar to the charged events and therefore highly probative on the issue of the defendant\u2019s intent, and the court noted that intent was at issue in this case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Raynor, </em>84 Conn. App. 749, 756, 854 A.2d 1133 (\u201c[w]hen atrial court determines whether it will allow such evidence, it needs to examine the similarities between the prior conduct and the current crime\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 271 Conn. 935, 861 A.2d 511 (2004). Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. Under the totality of these circumstances, we therefore conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the state to introduce the evidence of prior misconduct by the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim on appeal is that the court improperly permitted a state\u2019s expert witness to vouch for the credibility of the victim. The defendant argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>that because the expert had acted previously as a forensic interviewer and counselor to the victim, she was biased, and it was improper for her to be called as an impartial and detached witness to testify about the general characteristics of child sex abuse victims. The defendant also argues that because the victim was an adult when she testified, the expert\u2019s testimony regarding the general characteristics of child abuse victims was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . The trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the qualification of expert witnesses and the admissibility of their opinions. . . . The court\u2019s decision is not to be disturbed unless [its] discretion has been abused, or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law. . . . Generally, expert testimony is admissible if (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Iban C., </em>275 Conn. 624, 634, 881 A.2d 1005 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">At trial, the state called an expert, Lisa Bush, who testified that she is a licensed school psychologist who had been in practice for nineteen years, working primarily with adolescents. In addition, Bush testified that she is a contract forensic interviewer at a rape crisis center and has conducted approximately eighty to ninety interviews with children who presented claims that they had been sexually abused. In these roles, Bush testified, she had the opportunity to become familiar with the general characteristics of sexually abused children.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">After the court qualified Bush as an expert, the defendant objected to Bush\u2019s testimony on the ground that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>to the extent the victim was older than age eighteen at trial, Bush\u2019s testimony regarding general characteristics of sexually abused children was irrelevant. The defendant also argued that Bush, who had conducted an interview with the victim in this case and prepared a report,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> would improperly vouch for the victim\u2019s credibility. In response, the state argued that Bush would testify only as to the general characteristics of sexually abused children and that the state would offer no evidence to indicate that Bush had interviewed the victim. After hearing argument outside the presence of the jury, the court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection and allowed Bush to testify as to general characteristics of sexually abused children, but allowed the defendant a continuing objection to the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Bush then testified that children are more likely to be abused by someone they know over a long period of time. She also opined that if a child is sexually abused by a person whom they know, that child is more likely to make a delayed and only partial disclosure of the abuse. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Bush whether she had conducted a forensic interview with the victim. The state conducted no redirect examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly permitted the state to use Bush, who had interviewed the victim as an expert, to testify on the general characteristics of sexually abused children. Essentially, the defendant\u2019s argument is that because Bush\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>about the way in which child sex abuse victims generally disclose the abuse closely mirrored the victim\u2019s trial testimony regarding what occurred in this specific case, Bush was clearly vouching for the victim\u2019s credibility. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u201c[I]n cases that involve allegations of sexual abuse of children, [our Supreme Court has] held that expert testimony of reactions and behaviors common to victims of sexual abuse is admissible. . . . Such evidence assists a jury in its determination of the victim\u2019s credibility by explaining the typical consequences of the trauma of sexual abuse on a child. ... It is not permissible, however, for an expert to testify as to his opinion of whether a victim in a particular case is credible or whether a particular victim\u2019s claims are truthful. . . . In this regard, <em>we have found expert testimony stating that a victim\u2019s behavior was generally consistent with that of a victim of sexual or physical abuse to be admissible, </em>and have distinguished such statements from expert testimony providing an opinion as to whether a particular victim had <em>in fact </em>suffered sexual abuse.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Iban C., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 635. \u201cThus, [our Supreme Court has] recognized the critical distinction between admissible expert testimony on general or typical behavior[al] patterns of minor victims and inadmissible testimony directly concerning the particular victim\u2019s credibility.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>257 Conn. 797, 806, 778 A.2d 159 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Here, the defendant concedes that during direct examination, Bush made no specific reference to the victim, to having interviewed her or to any statements made to Bush by the victim, and never specifically indicated that she believed the victim\u2019s testimony. Further, the defendant has referred to nothing in the record that would indicate that Bush provided an opinion as to whether the victim had in fact suffered sexual abuse. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Iban C., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 636 (concluding that court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence expert\u2019s diagnosis of victim as sexually abused child); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 812 (court abused its discretion by permitting two experts to testify that particular victim was credible). Moreover, the defendant has cited nothing in the record to support his claim that Bush made even indirect assertions to validate the truthfulness of the victim\u2019s testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Iban C., </em>supra, 635 (\u201ceven indirect assertions by an expert witness regarding the ultimate issue in a case can serve inappropriately to validate the truthfulness of a victim\u2019s testimony\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>supra, 806 (discussing expert\u2019s testimony that her treatment of the victim was for \u201c \u2018the trauma of the abuse that [she] experienced\u2019 \u201d constituted indirect assertion that validated truthfulness of victim\u2019s testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Thus, the defendant\u2019s argument rests on the assertion that the expert\u2019s testimony regarding the general traits of a victim of sexual abuse was consistent with the victim\u2019s behavior. We find nothing improper about the court\u2019s decision to admit the testimony for this purpose. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Freeney, </em>228 Conn. 582, 592-93, 637 A.2d 1088 (1994) (\u201cThe sole purpose of the experts\u2019 testimony was to establish that the victim\u2019s behavior was generally consistent with that of a victim of sexual or physical abuse. . . . [W]e conclude that the admission of the expert testimony was within the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d [Citations omitted.]). Further, the defendant has cited no authority to support the proposition that the expert\u2019s testimony was improper because the expert had prior knowledge of the facts of the victim\u2019s particular case and had interviewed the victim in a capacity as a forensic examiner. Because the expert made no reference to the victim or her statement during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>her direct testimony<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or indirectly vouched for the victim\u2019s credibility during her testimony, we conclude that the admission of the expert testimony was within the trial court\u2019s discretion. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s argument that Bush\u2019s testimony was irrelevant because the victim was an adult at the time of trial, that argument is without merit. It is not disputed that the victim\u2019s allegations involved assaults that occurred when she was between the ages of approximately seven and fourteen and that the disclosures to J in 2001, and S in 2003, occurred when the victim was a minor. Throughout the trial, defense counsel sought to capitalize on the victim\u2019s delay in reporting the incident as a child and the vagueness of such disclosures.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, the testimony of the expert on potential causes of a delay in reporting and vagueness of disclosures made by child sex abuse victims pertained to knowledge not common to the average person and was helpful to the jury in considering the issues before it, namely, the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of the victim and her disclosures of the sexual abuse, all of which occurred when she was a child. As such, the court\u2019s admission of the testimony was not an abuse of discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Iban C., </em>supra, 275 Conn. 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-12\"> The defendant received a total effective sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment, execution suspended after fifteen years, with fifteen years probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\"> Subsequent to oral argument in (Ms court, our Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>State </em>v.

The fourth witness, the victim\u2019s mother, was not questioned about whether the defendant had left the state and merely indicated that the defendant remained in Connecticut after the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\"> The defendant does argue that during closing argument, the state improperly referred to the victim\u2019s uncle as a defense witness. At trial, after the victim\u2019s uncle denied that the defendant had told him that he had gone to Poughkeepsie, the state properly impeached the victim\u2019s uncle on his bias toward the defendant and his prior inconsistent statement to the state\u2019s investigator. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Winot, </em>95 Conn. App. 332, 356, 897 A.2d 115 (\u201cA party may impeach his own witness in the same manner as an opposing party\u2019s witness .... This right includes impeachment by use of prior inconsistent statements.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]), cert. granted on other grounds, 279 Conn. 905, 901 A.2d 1229 (2006). In this context, the state\u2019s isolated remark in closing, which clearly sought to cast the victim\u2019s uncle as sympathetic to the defendant on the basis of his trial testimony, was insufficient to deny the defendant a fair trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b413-12\"> To the extent that the defendant seeks to imply bad faith on the part of the prosecutor in putting forth the questions, such argument is unsupported. Without trial objection, the prosecutor was denied the opportunity to present to the court the basis for questioning the witnesses. Moreover, it is clear from the record that the state did have a good faith basis to question the witnesses, as the victim\u2019s uncle testified that he may have told a state\u2019s investigator that the defendant informed him that he had fled to Poughkeepsie.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> In response to the state\u2019s argument that the claim is merely evidentiary in nature, the defendant argues that both <em>Camera </em>and <em>Rowe </em>involved incidents in which there actually was evidence of flight, whereas in this matter, the state questioned witnesses about a flight that never took place. In the context of this case, we conclude that such a distinction is without a difference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\"> The state, relying on information that one witness had given to an investigator, sought to question the defense witnesses about the defendant\u2019s having left the state. Thus, the relevance in putting forth its questions to the witnesses may have included the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt, but also may have served to impeach their credibility to the extent that they denied that the event had occurred, and the state had a prior statement from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>witness supporting the contrary. Further, once these witnesses denied that the event had occurred, the state may have been able to call the victim\u2019s uncle as an impeachment witness. These evidentiary questions were never raised at trial, however, because no objection was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b415-12\"> In closing argument, the prosecutor remarked: \u201cThe second reason why [the victim is telling the truth] is [that] her testimony was corroborated by other witnesses.
