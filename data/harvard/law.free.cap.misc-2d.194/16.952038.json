Whenever any provision of the Fish and Wildlife Law permits Taking\u2019, the taking permitted is a taking by lawful means and in a lawful manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">The accusatory instrument herein alleged that the defendant was working in a joint effort to commercially harvest razor clams with other permitted diggers and was observed \u201cculling\u201d the clams while the others were digging the clams. The term \u201ccull\u201d or \u201cculling,\u201d while not defined in the Environmental Conservation Law, has been defined, inter alia, to mean \u201c1. to choose; select; pick. 2. to gather the choice things or parts from. 3. to collect; gather; pluck\u201d (Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary 407 [2d ed 1999]).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">As the foregoing definitions reveal, the \u201ctake\u201d or \u201ctaking\u201d of clams is different from the \u201cculling,\u201d or separating out the clams. Under the facts outlined in the accusatory instrument, it appears that the two \u201cother permitted diggers\u201d were in fact \u201cdigging\u201d or \u201ctaking\u201d the clams while the defendant was simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u201cculling\u201d or separating the clams aboard the vessel that had already been \u201ctaken.\u201d Inasmuch as the \u201cother permitted diggers\u201d were licensed and therefore not in violation of ECL 13-0311 (7), the mere sorting of the clams by defendant did not constitute a violation of said section.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">We note that the District Court, after concluding that the riparian rights to the site where the alleged violation occurred vested in the Town of Brookhaven, held that the taking of clams was not subject to regulation by the State. The court based its finding on the belief that since the clams were not <em>ferae naturae, </em>the ownership of the clams vested in the owner of the riparian rights, here the town. It is our opinion that this court\u2019s holding in <em>People v Dunn </em>(159 Misc 2d 536) is controlling. In <em>Dunn, </em>this court, citing <em>People v Morrison </em>(194 NY 175, 177), noted that clams are in the nature of ferae naturae and that private ownership thereof may only be held if the clams are reclaimed from nature and transplanted to a bed where none grew naturally, and the bed is so marked out by stakes as to show they are in the possession of a private owner. Since that is not the situation herein, the ownership of the clams is vested in the State <em>(see, </em>ECL 11-0105) and they are therefore a proper subject of regulation by the State <em>(see, </em>ECL 11-0105, 11-0107 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Floyd, P.J., Doyle and Winick, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
