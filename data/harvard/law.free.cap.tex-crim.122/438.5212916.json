We note that appellant took the witness stand in his own behalf and swore that the officers found the whisky in the car. This testimony in the record without objection renders of no avail appellant\u2019s complaint that the officers searched his car. without warrant and without probable cause. As decisive we cite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Reusch v. State, 119 Texas Crim. Rep., 112, and the authorities therein cited. Both appellant and the officers testified to the driving of the car before it was searched. The other complaint was of the refusal of the court to charge on circumstantial evidence. The facts are such as to establish this as a case of direct testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">No error appearing, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b463-8\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A-k\">Since the affirmance of the case and the filing of the motion for rehearing, appellant has filed his written request, duly verified, asking that said motion be withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The request is granted, the motion for rehearing will be withdrawn, and the mandate issued at once.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">\n<em>Motion redrawn.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
