There was an exception to the court\u2019s charge for failure to charge on the law of circumstantial evidence, which we can not appraise because of the absence of a statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-21\">The Legislature of this state in 1930 enacted what is now article 725a of Vernon\u2019s Annotated P. C., wherein the possession of any narcotic drug is penalized. In section one of said act the expression \u201cnarcotic drug\u201d is defined as meaning and including, among other things, \u201cMarijuana.\u201d We think an indictment sufficient which charges, as in this case, that the accused possessed marijuana, and that there need be no allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>tion where a specific drug is named, the possession of which is forbidden by statute, that same was a narcotic drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
