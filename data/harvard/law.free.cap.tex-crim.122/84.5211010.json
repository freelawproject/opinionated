According to his testimony, Ard was walking leisurely in a direction meeting appellant, and saw him walk. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>up to Mrs. Fuquay\u2019s door, throw a brick-bat through the window, then step out and look both ways, and go back \u201cout of my sight\u201d and after a few minutes, he came out before Ard reached the place. From Ard\u2019s testimony we quote: \u201cIt appeared that he had something in his clothes when he came out of there. * * * When he came out of there he had something in his bosom bulging out there. I was not close enough to tell what it was.\u201d The witness hollered and tried to overtake the appellant. Some two or more hours later, Ard and the witness Smith (the sheriff) went to the home of the appellant and arrested him, but found none of the stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"A6O\">The state\u2019s witness (Sip) Harris gave testimony in substance as follows: At the date of the alleged offense, he was a night cook at Hodge\u2019s Cafe. He saw the appellant \u201cit seems to me like' it was after midnight.\u201d On the night that the offense is charged to have taken place, the appellant was at the cafe and got a chili. From the witness\u2019 testimony we quote: \u201cYes, he paid for it. I don\u2019t know what he paid for it. I think he got the chili for dish washing. It might have been a knob off a car that he traded for it, I don\u2019t know. I may be mixed up in the time but one time he traded a knob off of a car. One time he traded a knob off a gear shift of a car. He traded it for a chili. It was a kind of ivory knob. I am not certain that that was the same night (as the alleged offense.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AoL\">Smith (the sheriff) got the knob from the witness (Sip) Harris the next morning after the burglary. The sheriff testified: \u201cI returned the knob to Mr. DuBose because he identified it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ARM\">The witness Mankin, a deputy constable, testified for the state, in substance, that on the night of the occurrence he saw a man, whom he could not identify, running on a street; that he pursued the man but could not catch him.</p>\n<p id=\"AFs\">The witness Riddle testified on behalf of the appellant that the knob mentioned above had been in the appellant\u2019s possession for a month or so, \u201cor one just like it had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ACj\">The appellant testified in his own behalf that he was at Hodge\u2019s Cafe about 10 or 11 o\u2019clock at night and got a chili; that he exchanged it for a <em>knob </em>which he had gotten off his own car; that he went home and retired; that while he was in bed the sheriff and his deputy came to the house and brought him back to town. On cross-examination he was interrogated about the <em>knob. </em>He said it was his; that he had had it for a long time; that it did not belong to Mr. DuBose; that he did not need it and brought it to town.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The witness Ard' was recalled by the state and testified that he had examined the appellant\u2019s car; that it had a black knob on the gear shift lever; that the knob gotten from the restaurant was a white knob.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The testimony about the knob was received over the objection of the appellant, as shown by two bills of exception. It seems that the knob was entirely disconnected from the offense for which the appellant was on trial, and the use made of the knob was to prove by circumstances and by hearsay testimony that appellant possessed and traded for some chili a knob which he had stolen from DuBose. It had no legitimate bearing upon the case on trial. Its effect upon the jury was to show that the appellant had stolen the knob and was therefore a thief, and probably guilty of the offense with which he was charged. The reception of the evidence concerning the knob was obnoxious to the general rule forbidding the introduction of proof of extraneous crimes, and not within any of the exceptions which warrant the reception of such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Under no phase of the case is it conceived that the testimony that appellant had stolen the knob from DuBose\u2019s car relevant upon any issue in the case. Its harmful effect is obvious, and because of its reception, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
