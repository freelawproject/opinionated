The motion is supported alone by the affidavit of the appellant. In the absence of the facts on the merits of the case and on the motion for new trial, this court has no data upon which to measure the soundness of the appellant\u2019s contention, and under the circumstances is bound by the conclusion of the trial judge in overruling the motion. Especially is this true since the order overruling the motion recites that in passing thereon evidence was heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-19\">The sentence is incorrect, in that it fails to follow the law as set forth in article 775, C.
