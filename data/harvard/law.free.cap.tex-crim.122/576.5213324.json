It is impossible for this court to determine whether a special charge was pertinent to any issue in the case in the absence of a statement of facts. Therefore, their refusal can not be reviewed, although exceptions to the failure to give them was noted upon the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">What has been said with reference to the refusal of special charges applies with equal force to the objections urged against the instructions given the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">No errors of a fundamental character appear from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
