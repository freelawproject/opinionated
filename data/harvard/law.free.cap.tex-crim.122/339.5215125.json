From the record it appears that the foreman\u2019s name was signed to the indictment. However, the indictment appearing otherwise regular, - it is not essential that it bear the signature of the foreman of the grand jury. See Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. P. C., p. 264, sec. 513, citing numerous cases, including Hannah v. State, 1 Texas App., 578. See, also, Tex.

See article 835, C. C. P., 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-17\">For the reasdn last stated, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-18\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
