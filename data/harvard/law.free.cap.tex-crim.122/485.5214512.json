Appellant and his witnesses testified to facts which, if true, showed that M owed appellant $31 for work, pasturage, etc., at the time of his sale of said fifth bale of cotton. Appellant testified that M agreed that the half of the proceeds of said fifth bale should go to pay what he owed appellant. These facts do not make out a case of theft of the cotton. Northcutt v. State, 60 Texas Crim. Rep., 259, Alverez v. State, 109 Texas Crim. Rep., 66. Said cotton had never been in M\u2019s possession and could not have been acquired by appellant under any contract of hiring, borrowing, or other bailment. Appellant raised the cotton and had it in his possession by virtue of such fact. .</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
