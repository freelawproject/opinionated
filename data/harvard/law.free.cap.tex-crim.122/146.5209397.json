Appellant\u2019s bill of exception shows that the testimony complained of had not been received in evidence during the trial. The testimony heard by the court on the motion, as shown by said bill, was in substance as follows: One of the jurors mentioned in the jury room, while the jury was deliberating on their verdict, that he knew of an altercation that said defendant had had with some white men and white boys at a ball game in Marfa, Texas, some time prior to the date of the alleged offense for which this conviction was had, and the defendant was a bad and dangerous nigger. After the statement had been made, the foreman stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>to said juror, \u201cDon\u2019t make any statement,\u201d and told the other jurors that they could not lawfully consider matters as those then being mentioned by the juror, and thereafter there was no further discussion so far as the foreman heard. The foreman of said jury further testified that such discussion did not affect him in arriving at his verdict, but that he could not swear that such discussion did not influence or affect the other jurors in arriving at their verdict and he could not swear that such discussion did not cause any of the jurors who had previously voted for a lower term of years to thereafter vote for the five years assessed against the defendant in this case; that the statement so made by said juror was made- after defendant\u2019s guilt had been voted on but before said jury had arrived at their verdict as to the number of years to be given said defendant as punishment. The bill further shows that the court heard the testimony of the foreman and five other jurors as to such matters; that the testimony of the other five jurors relative to the said matter was almost word for word the same as the testimony of the said foreman.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">We are of the opinion that the learned trial judge fell into error in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s motion for new trial. Subdivision 7 of article 753, C. C. P., provides that a new trial shall be granted in cases of felony where the jury, after having retired to deliberate upon a case, have received other testimony. Information given by one of the jurors to the others is new and other testimony within the meaning of the statute. McDougal v. State, 81 Texas Crim. Rep., 179, 194 S. W., 944; L. R. A. 1917E, 1930; Hanks v. State, 99 Texas Crim. Rep., 218, 269 S. W., 106. Appellant\u2019s bill of exception showed that the statements made by the jurors concerning appellant\u2019s action and reputation had not been received in evidence during the trial of the case, and they were made at a time when the jury had not decided the question as to the number of years that would be assessed against appellant. The statute is mandatory so far as it relates to other testimony, and this ground for new trial is on a different basis and under a different subdivision of the statute from misconduct. When the unsworn \u201cother testimony\u201d is received by the jury, the court will not speculate as to probable injury when it is against the accused. Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., sec. 566, and authorities cited thereunder. See Knight v. State, 66 Texas Crim. Rep., 335, 147 S. W., 268; Blocker v. State (Texas Crim. App.), 61 S. W., 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Appellant also complains in his motion for new trial of the jury having decided the case by lot. As the case must be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>versed for the error above pointed out, we deem it unnecessary to consider said bill in detail as the matter therein complained of is not likely to occur on another trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">For the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Hawkins, J., not sitting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
