The policy was in effect on November 22, 1998 when Myers shot and killed Gary Dahl (Dahl) and then killed himself. Dahl\u2019s heirs and estate instituted a wrongful death and survival action against Myers-. Cumberland then brought this action seeking a declaration that it was not obligated to defend or indemnify for Myers\u2019 conduct. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>trial judge granted summary judgment in favor of Dahl, determining that Cumberland\u2019s policy provides insurance coverage for Myers\u2019 killing of Dahl. The judge then denied Cumberland\u2019s reconsideration motion and awarded counsel fees to Dahl.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">By leave granted, Cumberland appeals from those orders. Cumberland\u2019s central argument is that the evidential materials establish that Myers\u2019 shooting of Dahl was an intentional criminal act with the specific intent to kill and is therefore excluded from coverage under the policy provisions and applicable decisional law. We agree and reverse the orders under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The facts of the shooting and the events leading up to it are not in dispute. These facts have been established through reports of law enforcement agencies and documents obtained by those agencies, including diary entries by Myers, records of two counseling sessions attended by Myers on August 25, 1998 and September 1, 1998, and a psychiatric evaluation of Myers while he was incarcerated on October 30, 1998. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment, agreeing the coverage issue was ripe for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The parties dispute Myers\u2019 mental state at the time of the shooting on November 22, 1998. Dahl produced an expert report by Philip H. Witt, Ph.D., a clinical and forensic psychologist. Witt never interviewed Myers. He formed his opinion based on a review of the materials described in the preceding paragraph. The motion judge conducted a limited evidentiary hearing, with the approval of both counsel, at which Witt\u2019s live testimony was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">We first describe what happened. Myers and his wife married in 1994. They had one child, born in 1994. Myers had a history of mentally and physically abusing his wife throughout the marriage. They separated on August 5, 1998, at which time Stacy Myers obtained a domestic violence restraining order against Myers. The police confiscated Myers\u2019 weapons, two shotguns and a bow, as part of that proceeding. Stacy Myers and the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>continued to live in the marital home in Clayton. Myers moved to an apartment in the neighboring town of Glassboro.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">After the separation, Stacy Myers began a dating relationship with Dahl, who lived in her neighborhood and had recently separated from his wife. Between August and November 1998, Myers violated the restraining order at least nine times. On November 13, he asked his landlord if he knew where he could get a gun, which he said he needed for protection from Stacy\u2019s new boyfriend, who he said had a gun and was threatening him. On November 18, Myers called his wife, asking whose car was in her driveway and stating \u201cover his dead body will she love someone else.\u201d On November 20, he called and told her to \u201ctell Gary to kiss his kids goodbye.\u201d On the day of the shooting, he called Stacy seventeen times. In one conversation he told her, \u201cYou dig your own grave ..., Til death do us part ..., I guess one of us will have to die.\u201d Stacy called the police. Myers called and the officer took the phone. Believing it was Dahl, Myers said, \u201cF[ \u2014 ] You, Gary.\u201d When he was convinced it was actually a police officer he was talking to, he said he did not want to hurt his wife, but \u201cit was Gary he wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">On the afternoon of the shooting, Myers borrowed a gun from a fiiend, telling him it was for hunting and no other purpose. That night, Stacy went out with friends. Her car was at the house, which normally meant she was home. Dahl was in the house, babysitting the child. At about 10 p.m., Myers came to the house, parked his car about a block away, and broke in the back door, dressed in camouflage and armed with a shotgun. He planned to kill Stacy and Dahl, and then himself. He shot Dahl at close range in the head and then shot himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Taped to Myers\u2019 hand was a suicide note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">To whom it may concern,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">This had to be done. They were throwing it in my face. Gary was living in my house. I built that small empire for her. I will not sit back and watch this. God sentenced me to a life of hell all my life. Why can\u2019t I get one break in life. I now f[ \u2014 ]ed up so bad that I can\u2019t change it. If I don\u2019t kill her, Gary and myself, something went wrong. Upon my death, call my sister ... Mom ... Aunt ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Cousin ... and if you could get a hold of my dad. My sister might know his beeper number. Tell them I want to be buried next to Stacy and in my fireman\u2019s uniform. They are my only w[ lishes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">According to Witt\u2019s testimony, Myers entertained thoughts of killing Stacy and Dahl as early as October 24, 1998. Entries in Myers\u2019 diary expressed his dismay over losing Stacy and his jealousy of Dahl. The recovered diary entries were from August 5 to November 1, 1998. Examples of some undated entries are: \u201cGary is always at house. Stacy spent the night in Englishtown w/ Gary 10-3-98.\u201d \u201cOut w/ Gary Rainbow Bar Wednesday 9-16-98.\u201d \u201cOut w/ Gary, Nick, James, and Martin Prospectors 9-11-98.\u201d \u201cOut w/ Gary &amp; his kids. Chuckie Cheesie\u2019s 9-18-98.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Myers was seen by a psychologist, Keith MeDermitt, for marriage counseling on two occasions. The first session, on August 25, 1998, was attended by Myers and Stacy. On the second occasion, September 1, 1998, Stacy did not show up, and Myers participated alone. MeDermitt noted symptoms .of difficulties sleeping and concentrating, restlessness and not controlling his worry well. He found a \u201cpartner relational problem,\u201d and his diagnosis was generalized anxiety disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">While incarcerated in the Gloucester County Jail for violation of the restraining order, defendant was evaluated on October 30, 1998 by a psychiatrist, Prabaker Patel, M.D. Patel\u2019s report states, \u201cAt the time of this evaluation, patient within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, does not appear to be an immediate danger to self or others.\u201d He concluded Myers was \u201cdysphoric\u201d,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but neither hallucinating nor paranoid. His diagnosis was adjustment disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Cumberland\u2019s policy obligates it to pay, within its coverage limits, \u201cthose sums which insureds become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury ... which occurs during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>policy term and is caused by an occurrence covered here.\u201d \u201cOccurrence\u201d means an \u201caccident\u201d resulting in bodily injury. The policy contains exclusions for (1) \u201cbodily injury ..., whether or not expected or intended by the insured, which is a consequence of an insured\u2019s wilful harm or knowing endangerment,\u201d and (2) damages resulting from \u201cknowing violation of penal law ... committed by ... an insured.\u201d Cumberland contends that these provisions preclude coverage for Myers\u2019 killing of Dahl.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u201cPolicy provisions that exclude coverage for liability resulting from intentional wrongful acts are \u2018common,\u2019 are \u2018accepted as valid limitations,\u2019 and are consistent with public policy.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Malec, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6, 514 A.2d 832 (1986). Indeed, providing insurance coverage for intentional wrongs would encourage such conduct, without regard for pecuniary consequences, and is against public policy. <em>Ambassador Ins. Co. v. Montes, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>477, 482-83, 388 A.2d 603 (1978). Thus, \u201can insurer may not contract to indemnify an insured against the civil consequences of his own willful criminal act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 388 A.2d 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Exclusionary provisions are strictly construed against the insurer, so as to provide the insured with protection to the full extent that any reasonable interpretation will permit. <em>Mazzilli v. Accident &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. of Winterthur, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7, 170 A.2d 800 (1961). The burden of proof is on the insurer to bring the case within the exclusionary provision. <em>Burd v. Sussex Mut. Ins. Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>383, 399, 267 A.2d 7 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Dahl relies on the principles announced in <em>Ruvolo v. American Cas. Co., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>490, 189 A.2d 204 (1963). In that case, Dr. Ruvolo shot and killed his associate in practice, Dr. La Face. <em>Id. </em>at 493, 189 A.2d 204. He was immediately arrested and examined by two psychiatrists. <em>Ibid. </em>They certified that Dr. Ruvolo was legally insane, suffering from schizophrenia, paranoid type. <em>Id. </em>at 494, 189 A.2d 204. Dr. Ruvolo was immediately committed to a State psychiatric hospital. The criminal charges were apparently not pursued. Dr. La Face\u2019s widow brought a wrongful death action. <em>Ibid. </em>A declaratory judgment action regarding Dr. Ruvolo\u2019s policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ensued, and two treating psychiatrists opined that on the date of the killing Dr. Ruvolo suffered from a mental disorder that prevented him from distinguishing between right and wrong, he was delusional and psychotic, he did not know the nature and quality of his acts, and he lacked the mental capacity to control his conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 494-95,189 A.2d 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The Court canvassed authorities supporting the proposition that although willful criminal acts may not be insured against, a death that is the product of an insane act is not barred by an intentional act exclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 496,189 A.2d 204. \u201cIn this context, however, the critical, or more precise, problem is the nature or extent of the mental incapacity necessary to transmute the character of the act involved from intentional to insane. Broadly stated, if the actor does not have the mental capacity to do the act intentionally, the policy coverage remains operative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496-97, 189 A.2d 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">After summarizing tests of \u201cinsanity\u201d in this context applied in various jurisdictions, the Court announced the test to be applied in deciding the coverage issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">We have no doubt that if a homicidal act of an insured is of such character as to excuse him from criminal responsibility because of insanity, \u00bfa, because at the time of its commission he did not have the mental capacity to understand the nature and quality of his act, or to be able to distinguish between right and wrong with respect to it, the killing should not be considered \u201cintentional\u201d within the meaning of the defendant\u2019s policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">[W]hile such mental incapacity as would excuse an act from criminal responsibility would preserve the insured\u2019s protection under this policy, in our opinion coverage should not be limited to cases which satisfy that definition. <em>We hold that if the insured was suffering from a derangement of his intellect which deprived him of the capacity to govern his conduct in accordance with reason, and while in that condition acting on an irrational impulse he shot and killed Dr. La Face, his act cannot be treated as \u201cintentional\u201d within the c annotation of defendant\u2019s insurance contract.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 498, 189 A.2d 204 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">In his report and testimony, Witt opined that Myers\u2019 condition and conduct satisfied the <em>Ruvolo </em>standard set forth in the emphasized portion of the passage above. Witt discredited the diagnoses rendered by McDermitt, who personally evaluated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Myers three months before the shooting, and Patel, who personally evaluated Myers three weeks before the shooting. He contends they did not have the benefit of Myers\u2019 diary entries and suicide note and Myers\u2019 condition deteriorated during the time between their evaluations and his death. In Witt\u2019s opinion, at the time of the shooting, Myers suffered from a major depressive episode, which \u201cclouded his judgment\u201d and which caused him to act irrationally in killing Dahl and himself. \u201c[Myers] believed, erroneously as a result of his severe depression, that there was no further hope in life for himself, and therefore the only way to end his intractable pain was to kill the sources of his pain \u2014 his wife or Mr. Dahl \u2014 and then himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In his testimony, Witt explained that Myers\u2019 multiple violations of the temporary restraining order between August and November were indications of \u201cirrational behavior, lack of control.\u201d He noted that, based on several diary entries in October, an impression emerges that Myers was despondent, depressed, having crying spells, not sleeping and obsessed with his wife\u2019s relationship with Dahl. The suicide note indicated the severity of Myers\u2019 depression, despondency and complete irrationality at that time. Witt concluded that Myers \u201cwas not thinking in a way that most of us would consider rational; and that, therefore, he was not able to control his behavior in a way that \u2014 -that, again, most of us would consider rational and reasonable.\u201d Myers\u2019 solution, killing Dahl and Stacy, had she been home, and then himself, was not a \u201crational solution to the problem.\u201d Thus, according to Witt, Myers acted under an irrational impulse when he killed Dahl.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Witt acknowledged that Myers possessed the mental capacity to develop and carry out a plan. But it was a \u201ccrazy plan.\u201d Indeed, the planning process progressed over a number of weeks and included obtaining a gun. Witt conceded that Myers was not legally insane nor did he suffer from diminished capacity. He was able to distinguish between right and <em>wrong. </em>He had the specific intent to kill Dahl. He \u201ccommitted the crime of homicide.\u201d He \u201cknew he was committing a crime at that time.\u201d He knew \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>what he was doing was wrong.\u201d He knew that \u201cif you shoot someone with a shotgun, you would do serious bodily harm or cause death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Witt was asked, \u201cBut this clouding of Mr. Myers\u2019 judgment, if I\u2019m correct, did not completely deprive him of his ability to act in accordance with reason; is that correct?\u201d He responded, \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t. I mean, he obviously formed a plan that he carried out.\u201d Witt\u2019s ultimate conclusion was that Myers \u201ccarried out an intentional act,\u201d but in doing so \u201che had no control over what he was doing, he was not rational because he did something that was not rational.\u201d He acknowledged that people often do things that are \u201cirrational in small ways,\u201d but what Myers did was \u201cso substantially irrational to indicate that he had no control over the actions even though he intended the actions and intended the result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Under Witt\u2019s analysis, had Myers lived he would have been convicted of homicide, presumably murder, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-3a, or, at the very least, passion/provocation manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-4b(2). (We hypothesize this offense for purposes of our analysis, although we doubt that the record would support any finding of reasonable provocation.) Perhaps any mental condition from which Myers was suffering, whether generalized anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, or major depressive episode, would have been considered a mitigating factor for sentencing as \u201csubstantial grounds tending to excuse or justify the defendant\u2019s conduct, though failing to establish a defense.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-lb(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The <em>Ruvolo </em>standard, however, goes beyond legal insanity. In <em>Ruvolo, </em>the Court analyzed the standard by which to determine whether the tortfeasor\u2019s <em>act </em>is \u201cintentional\u201d or \u201cinsane.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496, 189 A.2d 204. If the tortfeasor lacks the mental capacity to <em>act </em>intentionally, insurance coverage remains effective despite the intentional acts exclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 496-97, 189 A.2d 204. In <em>Figueroa v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>578, 575 A.2d 888 (App.Div.1990), we held that the conduct of a tortfeasor convicted of passion/provocation manslaughter could not fit within the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>of unintentional acts under the <em>Ruvolo </em>standard. <em>Id. </em>at 588, 575 A.2d 888. \u201c[I]t is only when the person is insane or so deranged that he or she could not act rationally that his or her conduct is unintentional.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Here, Myers\u2019 act of shooting and killing Dahl was eoncededly intentional. There is no suggestion that Myers was psychotic or delusional, despite his suicide. This was a premeditated, carefully planned murder. The record does not support the conclusion that Myers\u2019 concededly intentional act constituted an \u201cirrational <em>impulse.\u201d </em>The <em>Ruvolo </em>standard is not satisfied by crafting an unreasonable or irrational, solution to a solvable problem, even if the actor\u2019s judgment is substantially clouded by some mental condition. Indeed, much criminal conduct, intentionally committed, fits this mold. There must be a substantial mental derangement that deprives the tortfeasor of the ability to act intentionally. The standard is not met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The orders under review are reversed. We remand with directions to enter summary judgment in favor of Cumberland, declaring that it is not obligated to defend or indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\"> \"Dysphoria\" means \"[e]xaggerated feeling of depression and unrest without apparent cause; a mood of general dissatisfaction, unpleasantness, restlessness, anxiety, discomfort, unhappiness.\u201d <em>Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary </em>593 (17th ed.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
