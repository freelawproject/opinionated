A jury could not reach a unanimous decision as to the penalty, and the trial judge merged the felony murder and possessory offense into the purposeful or knowing murder (count one) and sentenced defendant to life imprisonment with 63 3/4 years to be served before parole eligibility under the No Early Release Act (\u201cNERA\u201d), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2. He imposed a consecutive sentence of 20 years with 85% parole ineligibility for one armed robbery (count two) and 15 years with 85% before parole eligibility \u201cconcurrent to counts one and two\u201d for the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">On this appeal, defendant argues that his motion to suppress \u201cthe ammunition clip, gun and his statements to the police\u201d subsequent to a \u201cpat-down\u201d of his person and \u201cdiscovery of the ammunition clip\u201d should have been granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that there was no authority to order defendant, who had been reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>as a \u201cmissing person,\u201d out of the car in which he was observed by the police, to \u201cpat him down\u201d thereafter or to enter his pants pocket without having felt a weapon, and, in any event, to enter his car where a nine millimeter handgun was located. He further argues that his statements at the scene relating to the ammunition clip in his pocket and the gun in the vehicle and a subsequent formal statement at headquarters about a prior murder were not admissible, that the \u201cinevitable discovery doctrine\u201d cannot be used to permit admissibility of the gun, that the NERA sentence for the murder is illegal, and that the consecutive maximum sentence for the armed robbery of the murder victim cannot stand. We affirm the conviction but vacate the NERA portion of the sentence for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">At approximately 10:30 p.m. on April 9, 1998, the ear defendant was driving was observed in the parking lot of a hotel in Fairfield, Essex County. It was parked on an angle with its engine running in a stall which caught the attention of a police officer while on routine patrol. Based on his knowledge' of car thefts and attempted suicides in the lot, Officer Vincent Crapello ran the license plate number through his mobile data terminal (\u201cMDT\u201d). The MDT inquiry revealed that the last person authorized to drive the vehicle was reported as \u201cmissing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">According to the testimony of Officer Crapello at the motion to suppress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">A The alarm was for a \u2014 it was attached to the vehicle, when I typed in the license plate it came back that \u2014 the registered owner of the vehicle, but then the alarm sounded that a person who was last occupying that vehicle was listed in the computer [as] a missing person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">Q And how does the computer give you that information? How does it display it or otherwise convey it to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">A The information is displayed on the MDT screen itself, on the computer screen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALy\">Q And in this particular case what was it displaying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">A It had displayed the owner of the vehicle, the registration information regarding the vehicle, and then immediately following that said missing person EMD, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>endangered and it gave the particulars of the person that was in the want \u2014 in the hit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">Q Was \u2014 first of all, who was reported to you at that time as the registered owner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">A I\u2019m sorry, it was owned by an Alberto E. Guzman (phonetic), residing at 7678 Market Street in Paterson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">Q Now was that or was that not the same person that the other information came across on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">A That was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">Q And who was the other person identified?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-11\">A As John Kenny Diloreto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-12\">Q And what information did the MDT provide you regarding him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-13\">A That gave his name, his date of birth, Social Security number, the agency that reported him missing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-14\">Q What agency was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-15\">A Jefferson Township Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-16\">Q And what else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-17\">A Other various descriptors of the individual, his sex, race, height, weight, hair color, eye color.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-18\">Q And this information is visible to you on a screen in your \u2014 on your laptop?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A60\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-19\">As a result of the information received, Officer Crapello called for \u201ca backup officer,\u201d and after Officer Richard Filipow arrived, Crapello described what occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>A I walked up to the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle from the rear. I shone\u2014 shone \u2014 shined my flashlight into the car and I noticed an individual inside the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">Q And can you describe the individual you noticed inside the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">A It was a white male and he appeared to be sleeping at the time. He was reclining back in his seat with his head leaning to the left, either against the frame or on the seat of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">Q Now at that point that you made that observation can you estimate for me how much time had passed since you had initially driven by the car and saw exhaust apparently coming out of the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">A It would have been approximately three-and-a-half, four minutes, somewhere thereabouts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">Q After you observed this individual in the vehicle what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-10\">A Officer Filipow had taken up a position on the right rear portion of the vehicle as a \u2014 as a backup unit, as a cover unit. I attempted to open the car door, the door was locked. And at that point I knocked on the window to try to waken the person inside the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-11\">Q And what happened when you did that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-12\">A After I knocked the person inside the ear woke up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-13\">Q And what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-14\">A He rolled down his window. I asked him for identification and he handed up his driver\u2019s license and Social Security card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-15\">Q And did you examine these items?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-16\">A Yes, sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-17\">Q And when you examined those documents what were they, what did they say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"auy-dedup-0\">A The names on the documents were the same name as the person shown on the NCI hit as the missing person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-18\">Q And who was that again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-19\">A That was John Kenny Diloreto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-20\">Q After looking at this documentation that the driver handed to you and after examining it what did you do next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-21\">A I was going to go back to my squad car to have headquarters confirm the want through Jefferson Township P.D. Before I did that Officer Filipow came up, took up my position on the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle to keep his attention focused on the occupant of the vehicle. And once Officer Filipow got there I in fact returned to my squad car, notified headquarters to contact Jefferson P.D. to validate the hit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-22\">While waiting for a response, Crapello decided to \u201csecure\u201d the individual \u201cin the back of the patrol car until Jefferson ... g[o]t back to us one way or the other, whether or not he\u2019s actually wanted or not.\u201d According to Crapello:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>A Again, I was sitting in the patrol ear, we were waiting for a few minutes for Jefferson P.D.\u2019s response and I had told Officer Filipow we\u2019re going to bring this guy out of the car and secure him in the back of the patrol car until Jefferson g[o]t back \u2014 gets back to us one way or the other, whether or not he\u2019s actually wanted or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">Q Now after you had made the determination to place him in the rear of your patrol vehicle, what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">A Officer Filipow went over to the driver, asked him to step out of the car. He was pat-searched before getting into the back of the car for officer\u2019s safety. And as I witnessed, Officer Filipow pat-searching the individual he asked the person who was being searched what the object was that he felt in his right front pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">Initially the individual replied I don\u2019t know, sir. And as Officer Filipow attempted to retrieve the item the person who was being searched said it\u2019s a clip, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">Q Now it was Officer Filipow who was conducting the pat-down you referred to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"abv-dedup-0\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">Q Now as this pat-down was being conducted, what did you observe happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-11\">A Again, Officer Filipow patted down the right side of Mr. Diloreto and as he reached the right front pant pocket he had asked Mr. Diloreto what\u2019s in your pocket and, again, he had stated that I don\u2019t know, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-12\">Q What happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-13\">A At that point Officer Filipow attempted to retrieve the item that was in the front pocket of Mr. Diloreto. And as that was being done Mr. Diloreto stated it\u2019s a clip, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-14\">Q And when he said it\u2019s a clip, what did you understand thatt-what do you understand by the word clip?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-15\">A It\u2019s a magazine for a handgun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-16\">Q What happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-17\">A The clip was removed from his pocket. He was placed against the Toyota itself and he was handcuffed and asked immediately where is the gun. At that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkX\">Q Who asked him that, if you recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-18\">A Officer Filipow. And the immediate \u2014 immediate response by Mr. Diloreto was it\u2019s under the front seat, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-19\">According to Crapello, \u201cOfficer Filipow went into the car in the area indicated by [defendant] under the front driver\u2019s seat, and retrieved a nine millimeter handgun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-20\">Officer Filipow testified at the motion to suppress as to the \u201cpat-down,\u201d and the inquiry on and discovery of the firearm as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>A We determined that it would be best to have the driver exit his vehicle and be brought back to the patrol vehicle until the situation could be sorted out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">Q As a result of that, what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">A I asked the driver to exit the vehicle, which he complied, and then for officer\u2019s safety as well as his own safety I asked him to turn towards the vehicle so I could pat him down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">Q And how did you position him at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">A Again, I asked him to turn towards the vehicle and placed his hands on the roof of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">Q And what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">A At that point I began to pat him down and the first area I began to pat down was his front pocket, right fi'ont pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-11\">Q And when you did that what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-12\">A I felt like a large metal object in his pocket, it would be the right front pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ax-dedup-0\">Q And when you felt that what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-13\">A I asked him what it was at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-14\">Q And did he x-espond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-15\">A Yes. He stated I don\u2019t know, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-16\">Q Now what did this item feel like at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-17\">A Again, it ran almost the length of the pocket and it felt like a vexy hax-d metal type object in the pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-18\">Q Could you identify it just by feel at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-19\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-20\">Q After he indicated to you that he didn\u2019t know what it was what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5_\">A I began to remove the item fi\u2019om his pocket and I asked him once again what it was, what the item was in his pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-21\">Q And did he x'espond at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-22\">A Yes. He stated it was a clip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-23\">Q And what did you understand by the word clip in that context?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-24\">A A clip is referred to as a \u2014 usually an ammunition magazine for a handgun or any type of ammunition magazine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-25\">Q After he indicated that to you what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-26\">A Eight about the same time as he indicated it was \u2014 what the item was I had x\u2019emoved it from his pocket and visually saw that it was an ammunition clip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATi\">Q And what did you do next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-27\">A At that point for my safety as well as you know, Officer Crapello\u2019s safety, we detennined to handcuff the suspect until we could complete the pat-down search of \u2014 for the rest of his body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-28\">Q And how did you handcuff him \u2014 who handcuffed him, first of all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-29\">A Officer Crapello actually placed the handcuffs on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-30\">Q And while he was doing that what were you doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>A I was controlling the suspect basically trying to prevent him so he wouldn\u2019t be able to reach or move to any other areas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">Q And can you tell us the condition of the clip?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">A Well, condition, it just looked like any ordinary clip or magazine to a handgun. I really didn\u2019t notice any distinct condition other than it was \u2014 did have ammunition in the clip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">Q Okay. And when you say ammunition what are you referring to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">A Bullets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">Q And what happened next after the handcuffing and you\u2019ve examined the clip, what did you do next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">A At that point again Officer Crapello was patting him down and I asked the suspect a question, where the gun was for the clip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-12\">Q And did he respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-13\">A He told me it was under the front seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-14\">Q And what did you do in response to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-15\">A At that point, again, he was handcuffed, Officer Crapello began to take him to the car so I entered the suspect\u2019s vehicle and checked under the front seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ5\">Q And what, if anything, did you find there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-16\">A I found a handgun underneath the front seat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-17\">Defendant was placed under formal arrest and taken to Fair-field Police Headquarters. It is undisputed that the officers subsequently learned that the missing person report was withdrawn by defendant\u2019s brother nineteen days earlier, but the Jefferson Police Department\u2019s effort to remove it from the NCIC computer was unsuccessful. At headquarters, it was discovered that defendant matched the description of a man who committed a robbery of two persons at a gas station in Morris County on April 8, 1998. During the robbery, one of the victims was shot and killed. Defendant gave an incriminating tape recorded statement about the robbery and shooting to two Morris County investigators who were called to the Fairfield Police Headquarters, and a subsequent ballistics test revealed that the gun found in the car was the murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-18\">Judge B. Theodore Bozonelis found the request that defendant exit the vehicle and \u201cpat down\u201d during the \u201cmissing person\u201d investigation was lawful based on the \u201ccommunity care taking function,\u201d and a \u201clogical extension of <em>Terry [v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 88 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) ].\u201d He also rejected defendant\u2019s argument that an erroneous \u201cNCIC missing person\u2019s report which should have been removed,\u201d was \u201cakin\u201d to an \u201cinvalid warrant,\u201d despite the officer\u2019s good faith at the time. The judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akk\">[An] [a]rrest warrant is punitive in nature and exists to ensure that a defendant that is detained that is arrested where there\u2019s [a] missing person report, is protective in nature, existing to render help to those who need it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">I think the compelling argument is the nature of the information that is received by the officers, that is protective-type information from the NCIC, remembering that we\u2019re talking about a stop and frisk under the community caretaking doctrine that\u2019s what caused the officers to go there. It wasn\u2019t a warrant for an arrest, it wasn\u2019t a punitive detention type situation, it was an investigation based upon protection to the individual and the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The judge also rejected defendant\u2019s arguments addressed to the handcuffing of defendant and subsequent inquiry, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">[T]he handcuffing was not improper under the circumstances especially in light of what was discovered. The discovery of the clip and the discovery of the clip in and of itself, although I\u2019m not reaching that issue, but in and of itself may have given probable cause to believe a gun was in the car, reaching a probable cause situation and a right to search without a warrant on a motor vehicle stop exception as indicated by State v. Patino at 83 New Jersey one, pages nine through 11, [414 A.2d 1327, 1331-32] 1980 case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">The Court is finding that the handcuffing in terms of chronology of events that occurred here was reasonable, under the circumstances was minimally intrusive, was done based upon all of the suspicious circumstances that the officer had and was done while the officer could confirm or dispel his reasonable suspicion that a gun was either on defendant\u2019s person or within his immediate reach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">Which brings me to the next issue which is the public-safety exception as argued by the State with respect to failure to give Miranda warnings when asking a question of where is the gun at the time of the pat-down and finding of the dip. Public-safety exception in Miranda, is stated in New York v. Quarles at 467 U.S., 649, [104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550] 1984 decision as well as adopted by State In The Interest of AS., 227 New Jersey Super., 541, [548 A.2d 202,] Appellate Division 1988 decision in New Jersey. There police officers were pursuing a suspect who they believe was carrying a gun and after catching the suspect he was frisked, no gun was found. Without Mirandizing AS. they asked the location of the gun and the Court upheld that and found that regardless of whether AS. was in custody at the time of the questioning, the concern for public-safety is paramount to the adherence to a literal reading of Miranda. Because you\u2019re talking there about a prophylactic rule, a procedural rule of giving Miranda warnings versus, if we had a situation where someone had been given them warnings, exercised their constitutional right to remain silent and then before being Mirandized were asked the question, where the gun was, versus the procedural prophy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>lactic rule. The circumstances for the public-safety under the spontaneity of the situation allows that question to be asked, that was clearly the spontaneity of the situation here with respect to the short period of time approaching the vehicle, taking Mr. DiLoreto out of the vehicle, finding the clip and then the concern for the location of the weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The judge alternatively concluded that defendant was \u201cnot in custody\u201d when asked about the clip and gun, and that the gun was, in any event, admissible because of the \u201cinevitable discovery of the weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">We deal first with some procedural issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Early in the morning of April 10, 1998, at the Fairfield Police Headquarters, defendant gave a taped incriminatory statement about the robbery and shooting to Sgt. Gary Denamen of the Morris County Prosecutor\u2019s office. Defendant argues that the statement is a \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d of the illegal search and arrest of the night before notwithstanding the trial judge\u2019s finding \u201cthat he gave statements knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The State contends, \u201c[a]s a threshold matter [that] defendant\u2019s unconditional guilty plea prevents him from now arguing that his statements\u201d \u201cmade at the scene concerning the clip and the gun\u201d and at headquarters are inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">In pleading guilty, defendant was told that, as part of the disposition which left the penalty phase for trial, he could appeal the pretrial rulings. The exchange was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-11\">BY THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-12\">Q Now, Mr. DiLoreto, I just had a Bench conference with your attorneys and with the State to also go over the fact that you will recall that you were before me with respect to issues surrounding a motion that you made through your attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>to suppress evidence in this case that was seized by the police and the statements that you made in that regard. Do you recall all of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">Q Okay. And you understand that I made decisions in that regard. Okay? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">Q All right. And your attorneys have answered all of your questions with respect to that motion to suppress and my decision in that regard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">Q Okay. And even though you\u2019re pleading, you\u2019re admitting to the offenses here, you also understand that those issues are still available to you with respect to rights to appeal. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-11\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">The parties have not presented us with the motion to suppress, but the briefs on the motion have been presented and reflect that it was addressed to the events in the hotel parking lot and not the statement at headquarters. The latter was properly the subject of a subsequent, independent hearing. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>104(c). <em>See also R. </em>3:5-7; <em>State v. Robinson, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>495, 540 A.2d 1313 (App.Div.1988). However, the colloquy with defendant relating to his non-negotiated guilty plea did not develop the differences or distinguish between statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">As a result of the preservation of rights regarding \u201cstatements,\u201d in the plural and without limitation, we shall consider defendant\u2019s attack on all the evidence obtained after .the \u201cpat-down,\u201d including the statements made at police headquarters as well as the scene of the arrest. The guilty plea does not constitute a waiver of defendant\u2019s challenge to any of his statements in this setting. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>338, 350-51 n. 7, 800 A.2d 189,196 n. 7 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>544, 810 A.2d 64 (2002); <em>id. </em>at 357, 360, 800 A.2d at 199-200 (Stern, P.J.A.D. concurring); <em>State v. Stephenson, </em>350 <em>N.J.Super. </em>517, 519, 796 A.2d 274, 276 (App.Div.2002). <em>See also State v. Carty, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>632, 655-61, 790 A.2d 903, 917-20 (2002) (Stein, J. concurring), <em>opinion modified, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>351, 806 A.2d 798 (2002); <em>State v. Lashley, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>405, 413-14, 803 A.2d 139, 144-45 (App.Div.2002) (discussing impact of illegal arrest and suppression of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>physical evidence on statement claimed to be \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The State further argues that \u201cany error\u201d in finding defendant\u2019s oral statements given in the hotel parking lot admissible \u201cwas harmless\u201d because \u201c[e]ven without those statements ... strong circumstantial evidence tied him to the gun. Thus, there is no reasonable possibility that the result below (the decision to plead) would have been different without his statements.\u201d At argument before us, the State also suggested that the defendant\u2019s present claims need not be considered because other evidence, including a videotape of the robbery and shooting<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and defendant\u2019s \u201clatent fingerprints\u201d at the scene of those crimes, was not challenged at the motion to suppress, is admissible, and provides more than enough evidence to sustain the convictions. The State seems to suggest, taking a page from <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>52, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985), that defendant would still have pled guilty even if the evidence he now challenges is inadmissible. In <em>Hill </em>the defendant was denied federal <em>habeas corpus </em>in the absence of an allegation that he would not have pled guilty but for counsel\u2019s incompetence and lack of advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">However, the issue before us involves neither an application to withdraw a guilty plea nor a petition for post-conviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel. It is an appeal under <em>R. </em>3:5 \u2014 7(d) that is premised on the right of a defendant to withdraw his plea if the motion to suppress was wrongly decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>in whole or in part. In other words, defendant\u2019s guilty plea was conditioned on his right to appeal the denial of his pre-plea motion, <em>R. </em>3:5-7(d) (and in this case his pre-plea attack on the statements as well). If he or she succeeds on the appeal, and there is other evidence to warrant prosecution, a defendant may choose not to withdraw a guilty plea if a favorable sentence recommendation was made as part of a negotiated disposition, or because charges dismissed incident to the negotiated plea would be resurrected upon withdrawal. However, our plea preservation rules give the defendant the right to withdraw a guilty plea when the right to appeal survives the plea and defendant succeeds on appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See R. </em>3:5 \u2014 7(d); <em>R. </em>3:9-3(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In this case, defendant would have little incentive for not withdrawing the plea. There was no negotiated disposition, and the jury reported that it could not \u201cunanimously agree upon punishment\u201d at the penalty phase. In New Jersey, a hung jury at the penalty phase of a capital prosecution is a disposition and defendant cannot be subject to a second capital prosecution. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3c(3)(c); <em>see also State v. Biegenwald, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>521, 542, 542 A.2d 442, 452 (1988); <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 309-13, 524 A.2d 188, 283-85 (1987), <em>denial of habeas corpus aff'd sub nom., Ramseur v. Beyer, </em>983 F.2d 1215 (3d Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, Ramseur v. Beyer, </em>508 <em>U.S. </em>947, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2433, 124 L.Ed.2d 653 (1993). Hence, in weighing his decision to withdraw his plea and stand trial, this defendant cannot be encumbered by the fear of being subject to a prosecution seeking the death penalty again. Accordingly, we must examine all issues raised on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">A finding that the officers acted in good faith is implicit in the trial judge\u2019s finding. We accept that finding, <em>see State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 471-74, 724 A.2d 234, 238-41 (1999), and it is critical to our determination. We agree with Judge Bozonelis that in these circumstances the officers, while acting in good faith, could direct defendant, the subject of an \u201cendangered missing person\u201d report, to exit his vehicle and to place him in a police car while they obtained the details regarding the \u201cmissing person\u201d report. We also agree that in these circumstances the defendant could be subjected to a \u201cpat down\u201d prior to being placed in the police car, and that the fact that the \u201cmissing person\u201d report should have been withdrawn from the NCIC system does not affect the objective reasonableness of the officers who relied in good faith on the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">We recognize that the issues before us pose difficult questions and that their resolution is debatable, particularly in a State in which we have afforded greater protection to criminal defendants under the State Constitution, <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, \u00a7 7, than the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, <em>see, e.g., Joye v. Hunterdon Central Regional High School Bd. of Ed., </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>568, 615, 826 A.2d 624, 653 (2003); <em>id. </em>at 636, 826 A.2d at 665 (LaVecchia, J. dissenting); <em>State v. Carty, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>632, 790 A.2d 903 (2002); <em>State v. Cooke, </em>163 <em>N.J. 657, </em>664-71, 751 A.2d 92, 95-99 (2000); <em>State v. Novembrino, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>95, 157-59, 519 A.2d 820 (1987). But it is not for us to select the preferable practice of conducting a \u201cmissing person\u201d investigation or to conclude what the police should have done once the \u201cmissing person\u201d \u201chit\u201d was received. The issue is only whether the police officers acted reasonably in the circumstances they faced, and we cannot conclude that the officers were unreasonable in asking a suspected \u201cendangered missing person\u201d to exit his vehicle and wait in the patrol car while they ascertained the basis for the report. Nor were the police unreasonable in patting down the reportedly \u201cendangered missing person\u201d before they put him in their vehicle until they learned why he was reported missing and the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>relating to the report which could inform them if he might be a danger to himself or others. We acknowledge that the cases on which we rely are distinguishable and that some can be read to support a contrary conclusion. However, the bottom line to us is that the police acted reasonably because they were entitled to consider that a missing person report reflects a concern that something extraordinary has occurred in the subject\u2019s life, and the police were warranted in taking the action they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Defendant argues that the facts did not give rise to reasonable and articulable suspicion of wrongdoing justifying the officers to conduct a pat-down of defendant, or to put him into the police car, pending investigation of the missing person report. We recognize, of course, that an \u201cinvestigatory detention\u201d (or a <em>\u201cTerry </em>stop\u201d) must be based on \u201c \u2018specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts\u2019 give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\u201d <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>117, 126, 796 A.2d 857, 862 (2002) (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 21, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1868, 20 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 906). We also recognize that \u201c[u]nder <em>Terry, supra, </em>an officer is permitted to pat down a citizen\u2019s outer clothing when the officer \u2018has reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual,\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

Thus, a \u201cpat-down\u201d is generally permitted only when an officer has \u201can objectively reasonable suspicion that a suspect is armed and dangerous,\u201d <em>Nishina, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 515, 816 A.2d at 161 (quoting <em>State v.

We have found only one analogous case. In <em>State v. Boyd, </em>654 <em>N.W.2d </em>392 (N.D.2002), a sheriffs officer ran a vehicle \u201clicense plate cheek\u201d on a vehicle with out-of-state license plates. The report noted an NCIC request to perform a welfare check on the owner of the vehicle as a \u201c \u2018possibly missing and/or endangered\u2019 female.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394. When locating the vehicle again, the officer noticed two men in the front seat and a woman in the back seat. <em>State v. Boyd, supra, </em>654 <em>N.W.2d </em>at 394. The officer \u201c \u2018pulled in behind\u2019 \u201d the car and ordered all the occupants out of the car. <em>Ibid. </em>A \u201cpat down search\u201d found drugs on one of the occupants. The vehicle was \u201cimpounded\u201d after a \u201cdrag dog showed\u201d a positive \u201chit\u201d for drugs, and \u201cBoyd later consented to a vehicle search\u201d of her car in which drugs were found. <em>Ibid. </em>The denial of her motion to suppress was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The Supreme Court of North Dakota concluded that the circumstances \u201cillustrate[d] the inapplicability of the community caretaker exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396.

After noting that <em>Terry </em>stops were a different \u201ctype[ ] of law enforcement-citizen encounter[ ]\u201d than \u201ccommunity caretaker encounters, which do not constitute Fourth Amendment seizures,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 395, the majority found that the officer\u2019s actions were supported by \u201creasonable and articulable suspicion that a crime has been or was about to be committed based on the NCIC report that the owner of the vehicle was a \u2018possibly missing and or endangered\u2019 female.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A concurring opinion found that the criteria applicable for enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>ing a \u201cmissing person\u201d report onto the NCIC system warranted a finding of \u201cparticularized suspicion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400. The concurring justice concluded \u201cthat under an objective standard [the officer] acted reasonably in detaining the occupants of the car to ascertain whether there was a \u2018missing and/or endangered female\u2019 [and that] [subsequent events justified the further searches conducted by the officers.\u201d <em>Ibid.

The need to investigate a missing person\u2019s report does not flow from the concern about criminal wrongdoing or involve the search for evidence of a crime, and the police conduct must be evaluated in that context. <em>People v.

If the police can enter a home without a warrant to search for a missing person where there is a perceived danger, the less intrusive conduct at issue before us should be sustained, especially given the fact-finding which suggests no lack of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We have recognized that the community caretaking function is designed to assist citizens in need and is \u201cdivorced from the detection, investigation or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.\u201d <em>State v.

The officer then asked to see defendant\u2019s credentials. <em>Ibid. </em>After they were produced, the officer asked both men to empty their pockets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>and then performed a \u201cpat-down search\u201d which \u201crevealed nothing.\u201d <em>Costa, supra, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 26-27, 742 A.2d at 601-02. Thereafter, the officer placed them in his vehicle while performing a computer check on them and the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 27, 742 A.2d at 602. That check \u201crevealed that nothing was amiss.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We found that, while the initial inquiries of the defendant and his friend were authorized, the subsequent detentions were unlawful because \u201c[t]he officer clearly intended the stop to be an investigation into criminal conduct,\u201d and it was unsupported by an articulable suspicion. <em>Costa, supra, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28, 742 A.2d at 603. The officer was found to have \u201coverreach[ed] his lawful authority provided by his community caretaking function\u201d because the incident did not involve \u201ca benign stop that escalated into a criminal investigation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In reversing the denial of a motion to suppress, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">[Defendant and Priate exited a vehicle in a lit parking lot on the premises of an open business establishment.

In <em>Terry v.

In <em>Joye v. Hunterdon Central Regional High School Board of Education, supra, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>at 573, 826 A.2d at 626 Justice Verniero discussed prior New Jersey precedent and the concept of administrative searches, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">The fruits of the search in <em>[State in Interest of T.L.O., </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>331, 463 A.2d 934 (1983), <em>rev\u2019d, New Jersey v.

Notwithstanding that the case implicated the student\u2019s liberty interests, we nonetheless relaxed the warrant and probable cause requirements because of the unique public-school context. We likewise have condoned other forms of administrative searches, free of traditional constitutional requirements, <em>especially when unconnected with law enforcement. </em>For example, we observed recently that we would expect doctors or nurses at a State-run psychiatric hospital routinely to search all areas of the hospital, including a patient\u2019s private room. <em>[State v.

Traditional notions of search and seizure law and use of the exclusionary rule do not apply in this setting. <em>Joye, supra. See also, e.g., State v.

The fact that evidence of a crime was discovered is not dispositive. Rather, we must evaluate, from an objective point of view, whether the officers acted reasonably at the time of their challenged conduct and reasonably believed their conduct was \u201c \u2018totally divorced from the detection, investigation or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

We are not dealing with a minor motor vehicle or traffic violation which precluded the placement of defendant in the police vehicle and the \u201cpat down\u201d incident thereto. <em>See State v. Lozada, </em>92 <em>Ohio </em>St.3d 74, 748 <em>N.E.</em>2d 520, 525-526 (2001) (holding \u201cthat, during a routine traffic stop, it is reasonable for an officer to search the driver for weapons before placing the driver in a patrol car, if placing the driver in the patrol car during the investigation prevents officers or the driver from being subjected to a dangerous condition and placing the driver in the patrol car is the least intrusive means to avoid the dangerous condition\u201d); <em>Wilson v.

State, supra, </em>745 N.E.2d at 793, noting \u201c[ijnelement weather\u201d and \u201clack of available lighting for paperwork\u201d as \u201ccircumstances\u201d justifying placement of \u201ca stopped motorist\u201d in a police car. We respectfully reject the contrary conclusion of our dissenting colleague who relies on concepts relating to police officers while performing law enforcement functions, as opposed to performing an act designed to protect a member of the public reported to be an \u201cendangered missing person.\u201d As the Supreme Court of Ohio has said in upholding a pat down after ordering a driver out of his car and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>deciding to place him in the police vehicle, \u201c[t]he state\u2019s obligation not to violate the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights does not command that the police officer forsake reasonable precautionary measures during the performance of his duties.\u201d <em>State v.

Wilson, </em>362 <em>N.J.Super. </em>319, 331, 827 A.2d 1143, 1150 (App.Div.2003), in which we held that, while, in New Jersey, exigent circumstances as well as probable cause are necessary to search a vehicle, <em>State v. Cooke, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>657, 670-71, 751 A.2d 92, 99 (2000), knowledge that a gun is missing provides exigent circumstances to search a vehicle despite the arrest of the occupant. As in <em>Wilson, </em>here, the warrantless entry of the vehicle was justified to search for the gun in the automobile, based on the finding of the loaded ammunition clip because the gun could provide a danger even before a warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>could be secured. As Judge Collester wrote in <em>Wilson, supra, </em>362 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 333, 827 A.2d at 1152, there was a \u201creal danger ... that an automatic handgun could fall into malevolent, untrained or immature hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Nor is suppression of the gun required because the police asked defendant where the gun was located. Particularly in these circumstances in which defendant had not been arrested for a crime, the limited inquiry could be made in the interests of public safety. <em>State v. Stephenson, supra, </em>350 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 525, 796 A.2d at 279 (citing <em>New York v. Quarles, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>649, 659, n. 8, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2626, 2633, n. 8, 81 L.Ed.2d 550, 559, n. 8 (1984)); <em>see also State v. Hickman, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>623, 631, 763 A.2d 330, 335 (App.Div.2000) (stating that \u201c[r]oadside questioning of a motorist [about the existence of contraband or a weapon] is not transformed into \u2018custodial interrogation\u2019 that must be preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings simply because a police officer\u2019s questioning is accusatory in nature or designed to elicit incriminating evidence\u201d); <em>State in Interest of AS., </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>541, 547-48, 548 A.2d 202, 206 (App.Div.1988) (Coleman, P.J.A.D.) (applying both principles).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Finally, the fact that the missing person report should have been withdrawn from the NCIC computer and that the Jefferson police unsuccessfully endeavored to do so, does not affect the result. <em>See State v. Boyd, supra, </em>654 N.W.2d at 398 (police officer may rely on NCIC report). Of course, as defendant argues, New Jersey does not recognize the good faith exception to the warrant requirement, <em>State v. Novembrino, supra, </em>but we are dealing here with circumstances in which no warrant was needed and in which the conduct of Officers Crapello and Filipow was reasonable because they were acting in good faith reliance on an existing missing person report, and neither was endeavoring to search nor arrest the person who they asked to exit the car. <em>State v. Novembrino, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 157-59, 519 A.2d at 856-57, held that a search warrant could not be sustained when the warrant was defective, notwithstanding that its execution was in good faith. <em>See also State v. Moore, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>12, 15, 614 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>A.2d 1360, 1361-62 (App.Div.1992) (suppressing evidence obtained in search incident to an arrest premised on a warrant which had been previously \u201cvacated\u201d). Here, as in <em>State v. Moore, </em>we are concerned with the failure of law enforcement officers to update computer records. However, in this case, we do not deal with the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the warrant requirement, and we do not deal with the need for a determination based on probable cause or for a warrant to perfect an arrest. <em>Cf. State v. Chaney, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. 217, </em>226-27, 723 A.2d 132, 136-37 (App.Div.1999), in which the police entered a motel room in good faith reliance on the existence of an arrest warrant for someone with the same name as defendant, and <em>State v. Green, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 353, 723 A.2d 1012, 1015-16 (App.Div.1999), in which the wrong person was arrested on a valid warrant and searched incident thereto. In both cases, speaking through Judge Skillman, we upheld the police conduct as \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>See also State v. Scott, supra. </em>Here, the police in Fairfield acted \u201creasonably\u201d in good faith reliance on information obtained through the NCIC.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The parties agree that the imposition of NERA on the sentence for murder must be vacated given the date of the offense. <em>State v.

While the form of the judgment is in error, because the armed robbery embodied in count three was made concurrent to two separate consecutive sentences (counts one and two), the judge made the armed robbery of the murder victim embodied in count two consecutive to the murder. The judge noted that he was imposing a consecutive sentence for the armed robbery of the murder victim because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>defendant started to leave the scene of the robbery and' then returned to commit a purposeful or knowing murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The robbery victim named in count three was separate from the murder victim. It may have been preferable if that count was expressly made to run consecutive to count one, but the judge did that in the sense that he made it concurrent to the other armed robbery, which was consecutive to the murder. We find no basis for disturbing the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The matter is remanded for resentencing on count one by amendment of the ineligibility term to thirty years. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3b(l). <em>See State v.

Therefore, the magazine, the gun, the admissions, and the confession should have been suppressed as fruits of the illegal seizure and subsequent search. <em>State v. Smith, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>83, 100, 713 A.2d 1033, 1042, <em>cert. denied, </em>525 <em>U.S. </em>1033, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>576, 142 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>480 (1998) (citations omitted). Since I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that defendant preserved these constitutional issues when he entered his guilty plea, I would reverse the order denying suppression and the judgment of conviction, and remand for a trial limited to untainted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">The majority opinion creates an incoherent reading of the Fourth Amendment. Following its logic, a missing adult stopped by the police would have less protection under the Fourth Amendment than someone who appeared to be a criminal, and the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>would have more protection against the missing person than they would have in a confrontation with an apparent criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The majority acknowledges that the police did not have an articulable basis for thinking that a crime was afoot, at least after they learned that defendant was the missing person and he appeared to be entirely safe. Since they received that information before they ordered defendant out of his car, the further detention inherent in that action was unwarranted under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). When it appeared that no crime was in progress and that defendant had no need of police assistance, the confrontation should have reverted to a field inquiry, which only permits questioning of \u201ca citizen in a conversational manner that is not harassing, overbearing, or accusatory in nature.\u201d <em>State v. Nishina, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>502, 510, 816 A.2d 153, 158 (2003)(internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The only possibly applicable exception to the warrant requirement other than <em>Terry </em>is the community earetaking doctrine, which I believe the majority misapplies. Community caretaking justifies police intervention that is \u201ctotally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.\u201d <em>State v. Stott, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>343, 361, 794 A.2d 120, 131 (2002) (internal quotations and citation omitted). However, the police conduct must be reasonably related to the earetaking function. <em>See State v. Costa, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 28-31, 742 A.2d 599, 602-04 (App.Div.1999). As soon as it appeared that defendant was safe and did not want police assistance, which was evident before the order to exit his car, no further police action was warranted, and the police order was a seizure that violated defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Even if additional circumstances were present that would have made the order to exit the car reasonable, the ensuing frisk, which is a separate inquiry from the stop, remains unjustifiable. As we observed in <em>State v. Garland, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>31, 43, 636 A.2d 541, 547-48 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>296, 642 A.2d 1005 (1994), \u201c[a]n officer cannot simply assume that everyone is armed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>and dangerous until proven otherwise.\u201d Were that the case, \u201cofficers would be able to frisk at will \u2014 a result not contemplated by the Fourth Amendment____\u201d Id. at 44, 636 A.2d at 548 (citation omitted). Although we made that statement in the context of a <em>Terry </em>stop, there is no sound reason for treating it as irrelevant here. A possible criminal poses a greater threat than does a voluntarily missing adult. In short, no stop can be accompanied by a frisk for weapons unless the officer has an objective basis, considering all the circumstances, for believing that the person is armed and dangerous. <em>State v. Valentine, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>536, 542, 636 A.2d 505, 507-08 (1994); <em>State v. Thomas, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>673, 678-79, 683, 542 A.2d 912 (1988). Thus, even if we assume that the police were entitled to have defendant exit the car, in the circumstances of this case there was no basis for the frisk because no grounds existed for believing defendant was armed and dangerous. In fact, neither officer testified that he believed defendant posed a danger or that there was any suspicion of defendant being armed as a reason for engaging in the frisk.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The majority tries to avoid the necessity for evidence indicating that defendant posed a danger by asserting that the decision to place defendant in the police car justified the frisk. But the officers\u2019 only reason for placing defendant in their ear was their own convenience. They had not yet formed an intent to drive defendant anywhere. Nonetheless, they decided that a frisk was an appropriate precaution, and the majority opinion accepts that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The general view is that the mere convenience of placing someone in a police car will not justify a frisk. <em>See, e.g., State v. Lozada, </em>92 <em>Ohio </em>St.3d 74, 748 N.E.2d 520 (2001); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>745 N.E.2d 789 (Ind.2001); <em>State v. Evans, </em>67 <em>Ohio </em>St.3d 405, 618 N.E.2d 162 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>1166, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>1195, 127 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>544 (1994); <em>and Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>25 <em>Va.App. </em>277, 487 S.E.2d 864 (1997). Since I agree with those cases, I cannot accept the majority\u2019s conclusion that the decision to place defendant in the police car justified the frisk in this case. Of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>course, we need not decide today whether a frisk would have been reasonable if the officers had decided to drive defendant somewhere and had good reason to do so, or indeed, had any reason to place him in their car other than for their mere personal convenience.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
