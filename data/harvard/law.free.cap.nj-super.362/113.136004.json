The motion was based on the fact that Priscilla Miller, Esq., an associate who accompanied Mr. Braun from the original firm representing defendant to the present firm, and who is now working on the case, had served a clerkship with the trial judge while the judge handled aspects of the case. Plaintiff argues that \u201cthe trial judge should have been recused and the defendant\u2019s present and former counsel should have been disqualified given that Ms. Miller\u2019s representation of defendant was never disclosed nor consented to by all parties and the appearance of impropriety cannot be cured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The underlying facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff' commenced divorce proceedings on May 22, 1995. The case was decided in December 1998. The final judgment of divorce was entered on April 13, 1999. The trial judge thereafter heard several post-judgment applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Ms. Miller served as the trial judge\u2019s law clerk from September 1999 to August 2000. As part of her duties, she \u201cprimarily was responsible for the court\u2019s motion calendar each motion day,\u201d attended oral arguments and conferences in chambers, and \u201cperformed research for the Court.\u201d During her clerkship, several post-judgment motions were filed in the matter. On September 24, 1999, an order was entered which granted a motion filed by defendant in August 1999 to enforce litigant\u2019s rights. In November 1999, defendant filed another motion to enforce litigant\u2019s rights, and after argument on December 3, 1999, an order was entered on February 10, 2000, granting that motion. On April 20, 2000, the judge issued a warrant for plaintiffs arrest as a result of plaintiffs \u201cfailure to abide by the Judgment of Divorce and the Court Order dated February 10, 2000.\u201d Other aspects of the matter remained pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Upon the completion of her clerkship, Ms. Miller began working as an associate of Donahue, Braun, Hagan, Klein &amp; Newsome, P.C. (\u201cDonahue firm\u201d) from September 2000 until April 2002. During this time she had no involvement with this case or the client.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 15, 2002, Ms. Miller left the Donahue firm and became associated with the law firm of Gomperts &amp; Braun (\u201cGom-perts firm\u201d) which Mr. Braun formed with Gerri Gomperts, Esq. Mr. Braun took the file with him to his new firm, and a substitution of attorney was filed on July 15, 2002. In the interim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>defendant was granted relief in the form of discovery, and plaintiff sought leave to appeal. Ms. Miller was assigned to review the Notice of Motion for Leave to Appeal and, on July 9, 2002, drafted a response on behalf of defendant. Ms. Miller thereafter pursued the \u201cdiscovery requests\u201d and corresponded \u201conce with the court stating [defendant\u2019s] position with reference to plaintiffs stipulation of his ability to pay alimony.\u201d Ms. Miller further certifies that she met defendant for the first time on September 5, 2002. Thereafter, she met defendant \u201con one occasion thereafter to update her Case Information Statement\u201d prior to its filing in the pending proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">On September 24, 2002, Ms. Miller attended a deposition of plaintiff being taken by Mr. Braun. During the session, Ms. Miller told plaintiffs attorney that she \u201crecognized\u201d her, and advised counsel that she \u201cwas the former law clerk to the\u201d trial judge. According to opposing counsel, Ms. Miller \u201creferenced motions [before the judge in this matter] during her tenure as law clerk.\u201d After the deposition, the only involvement Ms. Miller had with the case is a follow-up letter to opposing counsel \u201crequesting additional discovery [of plaintiff],\u201d although plaintiff asserts Ms. Miller \u201chas been actively working on the ... matter almost immediately upon the Substitution of Attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">On October 4, 2002, plaintiff wrote a letter to the trial judge requesting that he \u201crecuse himself\u2019 because Ms. Miller was his law clerk when certain motions were before the court and post-judgment orders were entered. Plaintiff further requested that the court recuse and disqualify Ms. Miller and her present and prior law firms, and the judge held a hearing on the matter on October 28, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Plaintiff argued that defendant was required to retain new counsel to avoid \u201cthe appearance of impropriety.\u201d Plaintiff asserted that Ms. Miller had \u201caccess [to the] judge\u2019s thoughts and perceptions and credibility assessments that are not had by the general public.\u201d Plaintiff further suggested that it is too late to create a \u201cChinese wall,\u201d because \u201conce the damage is done ... the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>entire matter is tainted.\u201d Mr. Braun argued that Ms. Miller did not have \u201cintimate knowledge\u201d or \u201cconfidential information\u201d that was not public record, and that neither Ms. Miller nor the firm were disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The court noted that \u201c[i]t is improper for a judge to withdraw from a case where [there is al mere suggestion that the judge is disqualified unless the alleged cause of recusal is known by him to exist and is shown to be fact.\u201d The court also stated that disqualification \u201con the grounds of appearance of bias\u201d must be based on an \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d belief that the proceedings would be unfair. The judge concluded that it was \u201cwell within the guidelines of ethical conduct to maintain the status quo without prejudice to any of the parties.\u201d The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">The application before the Court in 1999 and 2000 concerned the plaintiffs violation of defendant\u2019s rights awarded to her under the dual judgment of divorce and subsequent enforcement orders. Each matter was entered after oral argument in open Court on enforcement of the plaintiffs obligations to the defendant. The plaintiff was found in violation of defendant\u2019s clearly defined rights awarded to her by the dual judgment of divorce and subsequent enforcement orders prior to Ms. Miller\u2019s clerkship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">The Superior Court Appellate Division [on an appeal] entered its decision November 1, 2000. More than a year later and after completion of Miss Miller's clerkship, the parties entered into a consent order on December 14, 2001 resolving the issues remaining on remand from the Appellate Division, as well as other issues and the issue of one year and eight months outstanding warrant for plaintiffs arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">The rules are clear that substantial involvement is the standard, and substantial is defined as making a decision regarding a matter of substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">Ms. Miller described her primary duties as a law clerk and none of which come near or within making a decision regarding a matter of substance. It is also unquestioned that only the judge makes a decision in any matter and it\u2019s also unquestioned that the post-judgment pleadings filed and submitted to the Court are public records and in no way can be classified as confidential information. Rule of Professional Conduct 1:11E.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-11\">It is clear that a former law clerk has no special or intimate knowledge in the current post judgment matter before this Court. Under both Rule of Professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Conduct 1:11A and 1:12A, Miss Miller is not disqualified as representing the firm\u2019s client, the defendant herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The judge also analyzed disqualification pursuant to RPC l:ll(b). He reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">The law clerk\u2019s duties in general and Miss Miller\u2019s, in particular, does not include personal or substantial nor confidential participation in assisting the judge. Miss Miller\u2019s clerkship commenced after the Court made its decision and entered the dual judgment of divorce. It was during the period of Miss Miller\u2019s clerkship that the plaintiff did not comply with the judgment of divorce and the defendant filed enforcement motions to enforce her rights awarded under the judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">It is significant that the issues before the Court were enforcement issues post-judgment decided by the court for judgements entered prior to Ms. Miller\u2019s law clerkship. The issue presently before the Q Court for as a result of the [February] 10, 2002 order of the Court is separate and distinct post-judgment issue of modification of alimony unrelated to the enforcement issues before the Court during Miss Miller\u2019s law clerkship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">Applying the ordinary knowledgeable person standard to these facts, it is clear that there must be something more than a fanciful possibility. Using the reasonable basis standard, the Court finds there is no appearance of impropriety by Miss Miller\u2019s representing of her firm\u2019s client, Miss Schait.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The court also noted the \u201cgreat harm\u201d inflicted upon the \u201caffected client as well as the judicial process,\u201d and concluded that the \u201chistory of expenditure of tremendous amount of time and resources by and on behalf of the defendant by her attorneys ... weighs in favor of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel of her choice, even if there was an appearance of impropriety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">While we must give deference to the Family Part\u2019s fact-finding when supported by \u201cadequate, substantial, [and] credible evidence,\u201d <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 412, 713 A.2d 390 (1998), the matter before us deals with essentially uneontested facts and a legal issue. In that context, we are asked to direct the trial judge to recuse himself, and to \u201center an Order disqualifying the Gomperts\u2019 firm from continuing representation, the Donahue firm from resuming representation, and disqualifying Ms. Miller from representing [defendant] in this case regardless of where employed in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Plaintiff argues that the judge\u2019s \u201crecusal is appropriate due to the clear violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct by-counsel for the defendant, and the consequent inability of this Court to monitor compliance in an effort to obviate any appearance of impropriety.\u201d Plaintiff also maintains that the judge violated <em>Rule </em>1:12 \u2014 1(f), which is the \u201ccatch-all\u201d clause for the requirement of a judge\u2019s recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Defendant contends that \u201cnone of the factors as cited by R. 1:12-1 have been met.\u201d Defendant accuses plaintiff of attempting to \u201cjudge shop\u201d because plaintiffs previous appeals to this court were \u201cadverse to the plaintiff and adverse to the fullest extent possible.\u201d Defendant argues the application is a strategic move by plaintiff to remove the trial judge. Defendant also states that discovery and depositions are complete and that her present counsel is prepared to handle the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">It is clear that a judge who has handled a case cannot be forced out by the hiring of his former law clerk. Any other conclusion would promote the hiring of associates merely to disqualify a judge, a policy no judicial system can tolerate. <em>See Hamid v. Price Waterhouse, </em>51 <em>F.3d </em>1411,1415-17 (9th Cir.1995). In any event, we find no violation of <em>R. </em>1:12-1 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-9\">The judge of any court shall be disqualified on the court\u2019s own motion and shall not sit in any matter, if the judge</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">(a) is by blood or marriage the second cousin of or is more closely related to any party to the action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-11\">(b) is by blood or marriage the first cousin of or is more closely related to any attorney in the action. This proscription shall extend to the partners, employers, employees or office associates of any such attorney except where the Chief Justice for good cause otherwise permits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-12\">(c) has been attorney of record or counsel in the action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-13\">(d) has given an opinion upon a matter in question in the action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-14\">(e) is interested in the event of the action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-15\">(f) when there is any other reason which might preclude a fair and unbiased hearing and judgment, or which might reasonably lead counsel or the parties to believe so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-49, -50; <em>New Jersey Code of Judicial Conduct, </em>Canon 3(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">It has been stated that \u201cfear\u201d that a court may show deference to a party, or will not act \u201cimpartially\u201d because of association with a former law clerk, is \u201cabsolutely unwarranted.\u201d <em>Marxe v. Marxe, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>490, 498, 570 A.2d 44 (Ch.Div.1989). We do not subscribe to that view where the law secretary worked on the matter. <em>Cf. In re Violation of Rule 50, </em>78 <em>F.3d </em>574 (Fed.Cir.1996); <em>Monument Builders of Pennsylvania v. Catholic Cemeteries Ass\u2019n Inc., </em>190 <em>F.R.D. </em>164 (E.D.Pa.1999). <em>See also </em>RPC 1.12(a). However, as we see it, the focal issue is not the recusal of one who properly heard the matter over a period of time. Rather, the question relates to the ability of the firm which hired the former law secretary to remain in the case, and on that question the Rules of Professional Conduct must be dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Plaintiff argues that the firms with which Ms. Miller was associated did not comply with the ethical requirements for employment of former law secretaries, as set forth in <em>Marxe v. Marxe, supra, </em>and that the firms must be disqualified to avoid the appearance of impropriety. Plaintiff argues that \u201cMs. Miller\u2019s objectivity must be examined where she was substantially involved with motions on this case during her tenure as a law clerk ... while at the same time she was interviewing for a position at the adverse firm.\u201d Plaintiff further argues that the \u201cfailure of the Donahue, Braun, Hagan, Klein, &amp; Newsome firm and Ms. Miller to follow prescribed standards when hiring a judicial law clerk, worked an unfair prejudice on Mr. Comparato who was unaware that the Judge\u2019s law clerk was interviewing with and had accepted employment with the adverse firm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Defendant argues that Ms. Miller\u2019s participation as a law clerk in this ease, similar to <em>Marxe, </em>was not \u201cpersonal or substantial.\u201d Defendant notes that both of Ms. Miller\u2019s certifications set forth that \u201cshe has no recollection of any substantial dealings\u201d with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>case during her clerkship.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant further argues that the pending post-judgment application cannot be classified as containing confidential information, and does not relate to any proceedings on which she may have worked as a clerk. Defendant notes that the matter before the court is a request to modify alimony, which is a completely separate issue than the issues adjudicated before the trial court during Ms. Miller\u2019s clerkship. As already noted, defendant further points out that Mr. Braun has been involved in this case since the defendant\u2019s divorce and it \u201cwould be a grave injustice\u201d to defendant to have to hire new counsel on the eve of an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">RPC 1.11(a) precludes a former government attorney from representing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">a private client in connection with a matter (1) in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee, (2) about which the lawyer acquired knowledge of confidential information as a public officer or employee, or (3) for which the lawyer had substantial responsibility as a public officer or employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">RPC 1.11(b) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">An appearance of impropriety may arise from a lawyer representing a private client in connection with a matter that relates to the lawyer\u2019s former employment as a public officer or employee even <em>if the lawyer did not personally and substantially participate in it, have actual knowledge of it, or substantial responsibility for it. </em>In such an event the lawyer may not represent a private client, but a <em>firm </em>with which that lawyer is associated may undertake or continue representation if: (1) the disqualified lawyer is screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom, (2) written notice is promptly given to the appropriate government agency to enable it to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this rule. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">RPC 1.12(a) further provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer <em>shall not represent anyone in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a </em>judge or other adjudicative officer, arbitrator, or <em>law clerk </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>such a person, unless all parties to the proceeding consent after disclosure. (Emphasis added.) <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In <em>Marxe, </em>the Family Part applied these rules to a situation in which the trial judge\u2019s law clerk accepted a position at a firm that had several pretrial applications pending before the court during the clerkship. The judge noted that the clerk did not have \u201cparticular or substantial\u201d participation in \u201cany one matter over another,\u201d given \u201cthe volume of litigation dealt with on a daily basis\u201d in his court, and was exposed only to matters of \u201cpublic record.\u201d <em>Marxe, supra, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 493-94, 570 A.2d 44. The court also noted that pending litigation was not discussed at the law clerk\u2019s interviews with the firm, and that the former clerk had \u201cabsolutely no involvement with the <em>Marxe </em>case\u201d at the firm. <em>Id. </em>at 492-493, 570 A.2d 44. The court concluded that \u201cas long as the attorney is not involved in any way with the matter at hand, it is within the ethical guidelines established for attorneys of the State of New Jersey for [the firm] to continue representation of Mr. Marxe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 570 A.2d 44.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge specifically found that the former law clerk, who performed duties similar to Ms. Miller in the Family Part, had no \u201cpersonal or substantial\u201d connection with the matter during the clerkship. <em>Id. </em>at 497, 570 A.2d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Given the certifications of Ms. Miller concerning her non-involvement in the matter as a law clerk, as well as the judge\u2019s similar findings, we cannot say that Ms. Miller had a \u201cpersonal\u201d or \u201csubstantial\u201d involvement in this matter as a law clerk to a judge who did. Accordingly, RPC 1.12(a) does not prevent her personal involvement in the present post-judgment proceedings filed more than a year after her clerkship ended and following entry of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>order that settled the issues that remained unresolved over a year after the clerkship ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We recognize that the \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d rule remains for consideration even if Ms. Miller did not \u201cpersonally and substantially participate\u201d in handling the matter as a law secretary. <em>See </em>RPC 1.11(b). But even if that rule applies to former law clerks, as opposed to governmental advocates, given the permissive wording of RPC 1.12(a) in the absence of \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201csubstantial\u201d involvement, we decline to find a disqualification under the \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d standard, in light of the undisputed facts of this case. <em>See </em>Michels, <em>New Jersey Attorney Ethics </em>(Gann 2002) \u00a7 22:5. \u201cReport of the New Jersey Supreme Court Committee on the Model Rules of Professional Conduct,\u201d 112 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>(July 23, 1983), supp. at 7-8. In <em>Matter of Tenure Hearing of Onorevole, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>548, 511 A.2d 1171 (1986), the Supreme Court concluded that RPC 1.12(a) applied to whether a former Administrative Law Judge could subsequently handle a matter in private practice, and found no bar. The Court nevertheless also considered the impact of RPC 1.11. However, given the fact that RPC 1.12(a) does not bar subsequent participation in a matter when there was no \u201cpersonal\u201d or \u201csubstantial\u201d involvement as a clerk, the clerkship alone cannot serve as a basis for finding \u201can appearance of impropriety\u201d under RPC 1.11(b). Accordingly, we find that Ms. Miller can participate in the present proceedings and need not consider whether any impermissible involvement by her affects the firm\u2019s continued participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Our disposition promotes good judicial policy, as well as ethical responsibilities, because it would not impair the marketability of law clerks who are familiar with practice and substance before the courts and, in turn, would not inhibit recent law school graduates from taking clerkships which could affect their marketability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The order under appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\"> In a letter from Mr. Braun to the trial judge when the present issue arose, it was said that, while at the Donahue firm, \u201cat no time did she have any contact with the Comparato file or with the client.\" In a certification on the motion, Ms. Miller said that she had \u201cno recollection of having any substantial involvement with this matter.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-12\"> The record before us includes a \"consent order resolving all issues on enforcement of dual judgment of divorce and remand\u201d entered on December 14, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-12\"> We directed the filing of a supplemental \"affidavit or certification from the appropriate person or persons indicating when Ms. Miller interviewed for a position at Donahue, Braun, Hagan, Klein &amp; Newsome, P.C., and the date on which she accepted a position with that firm.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\"><em> </em>RPC 1.12(c) is not applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b152-9\"> Although the judge found that the former clerk \"did not participate personally and substantially\u201d in the matter, <em>ibid., </em>he referred to RPC 1.11 and the \"screening\" approach apparently because the clerk was in practice for less than a year. <em>Id. </em>at 494, 97, 511 A.2d 1171.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\"> There may, of course, be cases on which the clerk worked substantively, such as during a trial, where the nature of the case or post-clerkship proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>might require disqualification of the firm which he or she joined or at least that he or she be \"screened.\u201d <em>Cf.
