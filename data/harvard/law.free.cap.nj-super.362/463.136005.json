Boyadji-an\u2019s application for a duplicate firearms purchaser identification card (FPIC). The trial court\u2019s order mandated issuance of the card \u201cin accordance with the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">The order emanated from a two-day evidentiary hearing at which the proofs, for good and ample reason with the consent of the parties, were presented in a different order than recommended in <em>Weston v. State, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>36, 46, 286 A.2d 43, 48 (1972). Three witnesses testified on behalf of the State; except for proffering his application and FPIC, the applicant presented no affirmative evidence. The court then heard argument on behalf of both the applicant and the State. The judge stated the reasons for his decision in a thorough oral opinion at the close of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>There is no essential factual dispute. On December 17, 1996, the Kearny Chief of Police issued an FPIC to Boyadjian who, at that time, resided in Kearny, Hudson County. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3d. Thereafter, Boyadjian moved to North Arlington, Bergen County. In July, 2001, he applied to the North Arlington Chief of Police for a duplicate FPIC. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>13:54-l.ll(a). The North Arlington Police Department conducted a full compliance review investigation, including a criminal history cheek, as required by statute and regulation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3e; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:54-1.11(c). On the basis of his department\u2019s investigation, the North Arlington Chief of Police denied Boyadjian\u2019s application. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c(5). Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3d, Boyad-jian sought review in the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The first witness at the hearing was Captain Louis M. Ghione of the North Arlington Police Department. His evidence established that the department had received an application for a duplicate FPIC from Boyadjian on the basis of \u201cchange of address[.]\u201d It showed a birth date of January 25, 1966, and a current address in North Arlington. The applicant had circled the \u201cyes\u201d answers on the application in response to two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">(1) Have you ever been convicted of a disorderly persons offense or adjudged a juvenile delinquent?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">(2) Have you ever been convicted of a crime that has not been expunged or sealed?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The space for details following the first question contained the following specifics:</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">1988 Kearny Rec. Stolen Prop.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">1992 Lyndhurst Theft of Parts</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">1997 Bellville [sic] Lewdness</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">The space for details following the second question contained the notation \u201cSee Above.\u201d The circled responses provided to all other questions on the form were in the \u201cNo\u201d column.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">The application was referred to Captain Ghione as the North Arlington Police Department\u2019s officer in charge of processing all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>requests for FPICs and handgun permits. Ghione initiated a routine investigation. His inquiry to the New Jersey State Police regarding criminal history produced a response noting a \u201ccurrent address\u201d in Kearny and a record of the following arrests and dispositions:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Arrest 001 04/28/1987 Unauth use of veh Making false report</p>\n<p id=\"A8f\">Disposition: (Municipal Court Seeaucus) both charges dismissed</p>\n<p id=\"AgY\">Arrest 002 07/25/1988 Disposition: (Municipal Court Kearny) Possess stolen prop Guilty \u2014 receiving stolen veh Dismissed \u2014 unauth use of veh</p>\n<p id=\"A2_\">Susp confinement 10D Amount assessed $150</p>\n<p id=\"AIF\">Arrest 003 09/02/1992 Damage property Attempt to commit larc</p>\n<p id=\"ADe\">Disposition: (Municipal Court Lyndhurst) Amount assessed $575 Dismissed \u2014 damage prop-private Guilty \u2014 attempt to commit larc-parts from veh Dismissed \u2014 burgl tools poss</p>\n<p id=\"aqc-dedup-0\">Arrest 004 09/15/1993 Aggravated assault with weapon</p>\n<p id=\"ASL\">Disposition: (Municipal Court Kearny) No bill \u2014 Aggravated assault with weapon No bill \u2014 Poss weapon unlawful purpose</p>\n<p id=\"ap-dedup-0\">Arrest 005 05/26/1997 Terroristic threats</p>\n<p id=\"A6\">Disposition: (Municipal Court Kearny) Dismissed</p>\n<p id=\"APr\">Arrest 006 06/07/1997 Lewdness</p>\n<p id=\"AlZ\">Disposition: (Municipal Court Belleville) Guilty</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Probation 1Y Amount assessed $507</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Criminal History Diversion Program and Felony Conviction Summary Pre-trial intervention: 000 Conditional discharge: 000 Felony convictions: 000 Violation of probation: 000</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">After receiving this information, Ghione communicated with each police department named to verify the arrests and dispositions indicated, and to obtain details. At trial, he presented the documents he had received in response to his inquiries, and he testified as to each. Ghione also testified concerning a certified driving record abstract he had acquired. According to Ghione, the abstract, dated July 14, 2001, showed no history of \u201ca propensity for alcoholism\u201d as would be indicated by \u201cDWI arrests[.]\u201d However, it showed nineteen suspensions of driving privileges, although Ghione could not determine from the abstract whether Boyadjian\u2019s driving privileges were \u201cin effect\u201d at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">While conducting his investigation, Ghione spoke with Boyadji-an, especially concerning the 1993 Kearny arrest for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon which had resulted in charges that were dismissed. Boyadjian acknowledged firing an arrow from a crossbow at an individual who was dating his sister at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Ghione told Boyadjian that he was continuing the investigation but, based on the information compiled to date, he was \u201cleaning\u201d to recommending to the Chief of Police \u201cagainst [Boyadjian] ... receiving the transfer.\u201d Ghione testified that Boyadjian, in response, \u201cexpressed that it was very important to him to have his firearms and if we could see through some of the incidents and if I could ... look them over closely so that I\u2019d be able to make a fair evaluation, and I agreed to that, absolutely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">After Ghione concluded his investigation he recommended a denial to the Chief of Police, who concurred. Ghione spoke by telephone with an assistant Bergen County prosecutor and received approval of that decision. He then sent a letter to Boyadji-an, dated November 6,2001, advising of the denial without specifying reasons therefor in the letter, and stating that Boyadjian had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the right to seek review of the decision in the Superior Court. Thereafter, Ghione testified, he had at least two discussions with Boyadjian by telephone and in person during which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVO\">Mr. Boyadjian explained to me once again that ... he had some firearms that were important to him. I explained to him that he could appeal ... and ... he also indicated he wanted to know what I had against him. I explained to him that this was not an issue of a personal nature, this was an issue of me doing my job in regard to public safety. And we ended the conversation I think very pleasurable with one another, he understood my position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">When asked at the hearing to explain his reasons for recommending denial, Ghione replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">I am concerned for public safety. There [was] that . Kearny incident which showed a propensity towards violence in <em>the </em>use of a weapon ... in a street setting which concerned me even more. Although there was a finding of no bill on this particular incident, I was concerned that the conversation that I had with him indicative that the event took place showed that \u2014 once again that God forbid if the firearm was in his hand and he became angry enough that there would be a propensity for ... public harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">On cross-examination, Ghione clarified that an FPIC authorizes the purchase of rifles and shotguns and has nothing to do with handguns. Ghione acknowledged that Boyadjian had been truthful and straightforward throughout the process and that he had no felony convictions or conditional discharges. A point was made by Boyadjian\u2019s counsel in questioning Ghione that three of the six arrests noted in the arrest record had occurred in Kearny, where the initial FPIC had been issued. Cross-examination also clarified that, with the exception of a single motor vehicle violation in early 1999, all of the offenses on Boyadjian\u2019s driver\u2019s abstract occurred before 1995. Counsel emphasized in his questioning that the abstract reflected no violations involving alcohol, to which Ghione readily acceded.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Boyadjian\u2019s attorney also emphasized that Ghione had conducted the investigation, and had sent the letter of denial stating no reason for the negative action. Counsel suggested that the Chief of Police had delegated the decision-making function as well as the connected administrative tasks. Ghione denied that was so. The colloquy in this connection was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Q. Is it fair to say that this is where you focus on this task, that you actually make the decision regarding the denial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">A No, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s fair at all. There have been incidents where I made suggestions to the chief of police and ... he has differences of opinion. I bring to him the facts that are presented to me as well as the case and he takes the opportunity to review them. As a matter of fact, there are also additional times where he wants additional facts gathered, so that\u2019s not a fair statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">Q. Well do you know why as the issuing authority he doesn\u2019t send a letter of denial or approval in your department? Do you know why that is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">A The reason that \u2014 he just delegates it to me. Why specifically? Because I\u2019ve done the investigation, I think that it\u2019s in fairness to the people that are being notified so that they\u2019re able to contact me____I was the contact point ... from the beginning to the end, so I think it\u2019s just fairness to the residents of the borough.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The next witness was the victim in the September 15, 1993 Kearny incident which resulted in Boyadjian\u2019s arrest for aggravated assault with a weapon (crossbow). That witness provided factual detail regarding the incident and related events. He testified that the charges were dismissed because he chose not to pursue the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">The third and final witness at the hearing was the North Arlington Chief of Police, Frank Italiano, Jr. He testified briefly that, based on Captain Ghione\u2019s investigation and recommendation and Italiano\u2019s own review of the entire file, he had \u201cdisapproved the application for the interest of public safety,\u201d and had directed Ghione to send a letter to Boyadjian advising him of the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">On cross-examination, Italiano acknowledged having made that decision without conferring with the Chief of Police in Kearny, who had issued an FPIC to Boyadjian less than five years earlier, three years following the crossbow-firing incident in Kearny. Italiano testified that a conversation with the Kearny Chief of Police \u201cwouldn\u2019t [have] affeet[ed his] decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">The State rested. Boyadjian, having elected to present no testimony, objected to the receipt in evidence of the various police reports that had been offered through Ghione\u2019s testimony. The objection was overruled, with the judge indicating: \u201c[t]o to the extent ... they contain impermissible hearsay, that will be redact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ed and will not be considered[.]\u201d After hearing the closing arguments of counsel, the judge rendered his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The trial judge \u201creverse[d] the decision of the Chief of Police of the Borough of North Arlington\u201d on the ground that the initial grant by the Kearny Chief of Police was binding in the absence of demonstrably changed circumstances since the initial grant. The judge opined that \u201cit is important that there be some finality to these decisions by chiefs no matter who they are\u201d or in which community they hold office. He held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">... [Gjiven the strong legislative endorsement of firearms purchaser identification cards and myself having had the opportunity to review all these data, looking at whose opinion was given in what timeframe and for what reason, I cannot come to the firm conviction that in January 2002 . . the grant of the duplicate firearms purchaser identification card would be a detriment to, a hinderance to or in any way significantly or substantially compromise the public health, safety or welfare. X do not find that the proofs demonstrate a disability. And I must say this \u2014 that if proeedurally this somehow was turned around where we were clearly treating this as a revocation application, I would be doing the same kind of analysis and I would be concluding that while a close call, that benefit of the doubt \u2014 because the Legislature says so, not because I say so \u2014 falls to the applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">The kind of disability that the State was suggesting here is one of those kinds of disabilities that can change over time. In other words, ... it\u2019s not an absolute disability, say a conviction for a crime. It\u2019s also not a prohibition such as somebody being under the age of 18, but of course that also can dissipate over time, you just wait a couple of months or years and ... you become qualified. I\u2019m mentioning that because the vagaries of Mr. Boyadjian\u2019s situation may still remain subject to change.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">In coming to this conclusion, the judge had referred to the regulations pertaining to FPICs, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:54-1.1 to -1.15, which, in addition to specific statutory terms, govern a chief of police in determining whether to issue a duplicate FPIC to an applicant new to the municipality who possesses an FPIC issued elsewhere. Specifically, the judge cited <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:54-1.11(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">It shall be the responsibility of the chief of police of the municipality wherein the applicant currently resides to conduct a criminal history records checks and to determine if the applicant is subject to any of the disabilities as provided by law and to issue the duplicate card should the applicant qualify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">He also cited <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:54-1.12(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">Any person denied a firearm purchaser identification card or a permit to purchase a handgun shall be notified in writing by the issuing authority of the reasons for the denial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Relying on <em>Weston, supra, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>at 45, 286 A.2d at 47, the judge then posited the trial court\u2019s responsibility, on review at the behest of an aggrieved applicant, to engage in a \u201creview <em>de novo </em>\u201d of a police chiefs decision. He noted that, notwithstanding the absence of a reason for the denial in the letter-notification to Boyadjian, the basis for the chiefs action had been conveyed verbally to Boyadjian and had been fully developed at trial, thus satisfying the explanation requirement of <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:54 \u2014 1.12(b). The judge found, based upon the evidence at trial, that Chief Italiano had, himself, denied the instant application, as contemplated by law; and the judge held that the chiefs delegation of functions to Captain Ghione had not been improper. The judge found further that, based upon the full record developed in the investigation of Boyadjian\u2019s background, the Chief had denied the application not because of any specific disqualification but because he had determined that \u201cto allow Mr. Boyadjian to continue with his firearms purchaser identification card would be contrary to the public health, safety and welfare.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:58-3e(5); <em>see also In re J.W.D., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>108, 116, 693 A.2d 92, 96 (1997); <em>Adler v. Livak, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>219, 224-25, 705 A.2d 1218, 1220-21 (App.Div.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The judge went on to observe that there were similarities between the process of considering the issuance of a duplicate FPIC and the procedure for revoking an FPIC. He concluded, however, that \u201cthere are some differences between refusing a duplicate firearms purchaser identification card and an application to revoke one that\u2019s been issued.\u201d By way of factual analysis, the judge referred specifically to the chronology of Boyadjian\u2019s arrests and the communities in which they occurred in relation to the dates upon which the initial FPIC had been issued and the instant application denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In reviewing the legislative and regulatory scheme relating to permits for firearms, the judge noted that the authority for granting or denying FPICs was reposed in local chiefs of police</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>presumably because the chief of police of the municipality not only had the tools available to do an investigation, but also was right on the scene. And those tools include being able to do a criminal history check, perhaps a <em>motor </em>vehicle check, has the personnel to go out and talk to people in the neighborhood to review the references that are provided, to do the mental health cheek.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The judge then posited the presumption of validity that attends official action and stated that it applied to the action of the Kearny Chief of Police in granting the FPIC initially. He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">I don\u2019t think that once a firearms purchaser identification card is issued that it can be questioned anywhere except in court, and it must be on a revocation or in the realm of some sort of changed circumstances when a duplicate card or a change of address card is requested. In other words, with all due respect to the exercise of discretion and decision making of the chief of North Arlington, he is bound to follow what the chief of Kearny did up to the point that he can demonstrate from changed circumstances that there\u2019s a reason for a disqualification. To do otherwise would invest and inject the potential for such mischief in the permitting process that anyone could just willy-nilly challenge decisions of the initial issuing agent. That\u2019s not what the gun control contemplates and that\u2019s not what the regulations of the state police contemplate where they do require, no doubt about it, a full review at the time a ... change of address card or a duplicate, is requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">I am not suggesting that a chief of police is free to truncate his or her review just because the permit had been previously issued. But if the duplicate is not to be issued, the articulated reason has to be on the ground not that the [prior chief] erred, but why now, either on a changed circumstance analysis or in the aggregate the applicant for the change card, the duplicate card sports [sic] a disability. So I reject the one prong of the State\u2019s argument that I can go back or that the chief of North Arlington can go back and second guess what was done previously by the Kearny chief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">I have to analyze the second prong of the argument and that is in conjunction with everything that went before December 17th 1996, the two events of the arrest for a terroristic threat and the lewdness conviction demonstrate collectively that Mr. Boyadjian, if issued this duplicate card, thereby be permitted to continue to own his guns and continue to purchase guns, and I\u2019m talking about long guns unless he gets a permit to buy a handgun, would be contrary to the public health, safety or welfare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">To analyze that I think I\u2019m entitled, and I declare that I\u2019m entitled, to look at two different issues, but they are related. One is what evidence is there of some mishandling or proper handling or the absence of any proof of Mr. Boyadjian vis-\u00e1-vis handguns and what is more globally Mr. Boyadjian, how does he present himself in terms of being a threat to the public health, safety and welfare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">In terms of gun specific, there\u2019s no evidence one way or the other. And since the permit had already issued it would be up to the State to demonstrate that there was some evidence of mishandling of guns. And the State asserts that there\u2019s evidence in this case that there\u2019s mishandling of weapons because the major concern of the state is the events in Kearny in 1993 with a crossbow, a crossbow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>that was allegedly fired ... and which luckily or purposely missed. But in the specific realm of handguns, there\u2019s no evidence of mishandling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">More globally what we have here is a history of scraps with the law, it\u2019s not something that Mr. Boyadjian ought to be proud of, it\u2019s not something that I endorse or condone, it\u2019s certainly not something, and the State readily concedes this, is conclusively a disqualification because these are not convictions of crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">I have in the past in other cases determined that in the aggregate the conduct of a party over time can demonstrate a disability. It might be that a final arrest and conviction, if that\u2019s what it is, is the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back, even if just looking at that final event by itself it might not be very meaningful. And that\u2019s one way I\u2019ve looked at this, I\u2019ve tried to analyze it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">Would the lewdness conviction by itself be enough to deprive Mr. Boyadjian under a public health, safety and welfare analysis of his legislative entitlement, unless there\u2019s a proven disability to an FPIC? I say that by itself would not be enough. I don\u2019t like the conviction, but I\u2019m also aware that it\u2019s now not state [sic] but it\u2019s almost five years ago. It was June 7th 1997, so it\u2019s four and a half years ago. And so now I look in the aggregate, not to use this as a term of art, but to try to get a gestalt of what is going on in Mr. Boyadjian\u2019s life since 1987, and does this event, because it\u2019s the conviction more than this arrest \u2014 the arrest \u2014 there\u2019s so much hearsay in that arrest that it\u2019s not very meaningful. I\u2019m talking about the terroristic threat. But the conviction is a conviction, there\u2019s no dispute about that. But does that conviction add anything to everything that went before it? I think that it does, but I don\u2019t think that it amounts to a disability. And I\u2019m making that ... under the rubric of the <em>de novo </em>review that I\u2019m obligated to make under <em>Weston </em>[, <em>supra, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>36,286 A.2d 43],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">I think it\u2019s a close case. Close cases in FPIC cases go to the applicant. And in this case it\u2019s tilted in the applicant [sic] for two reasons. The first reason is * * * there\u2019s a presumption in favor of granting this kind of a permit, unlike what I\u2019ve held is a presumption against granting a permit to carry a handgun. So the Legislature has expressed an encouragement so to speak to this kind of a permit, subject to disabilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">The second thing is I\u2019ve got one chief of police who issued the permit and I\u2019ve got one chief of police who wouldn\u2019t issue the permit. And I don\u2019t want to make it seem so simple that they nullify one another or they balance each other out, but I\u2019ve heard the chief of police from North Arlington. He was here, he was a credible witness, he did not, for whatever reason, diseuss his view with the Kearny chief. * * * And I don\u2019t know what the Kearny chief might have said, but the Kearny chief would have a much more \u2014 and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m stretching for this\u2014 intimate knowledge and understanding of Mr. Boyadjian than Chief Italiano. That\u2019s not a knock on the North Arlington chief, but all of the events that North Arlington is relying upon happened in Kearny and that\u2019s where the permit was issued. And it\u2019s much closer in time, it\u2019s a compressed timeframe. And so I\u2019m not saying that I am elevating the ... chief in Kearny\u2019s opinion over the chief in North Arlington, but that\u2019s an important facet that impels me to the conclusion that the State has not demonstrated this is a disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The man on the scene, the chief in Kearny, presumptively determined there was good cause to issue this, or better said, there was no disability and therefore the permit should issue. North Arlington thought otherwise four years later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">All the findings made by the trial judge are well-supported by the record and are, therefore, binding on appeal. <em>See Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495, 500 (1974). Moreover, we express no cavil, in general, with the judge\u2019s understanding of the statutory/regulatory scheme governing firearms permits or some of the public policies that inform them. We reverse, however, because of an error in the balancing process the trial judge employed in evaluating the local administrative determination under review, <em>ie., </em>the denial of a duplicate FPIC. He gave insufficient weight to the interests of the community in which the applicant resided at the time he filed the instant application. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58~3c (establishing as the basic general criterion that the applicant be a \u201cperson of good character and good repute in the community in which he lives\u201d and not subject to any specified disabilities, including where \u201c(5) ... issuance would not be in the interest of the public health, safety or welfare\u201d). Correlatively, the judge gave too much weight to a decision in the community from which the applicant had moved and in which the initial FPIC had been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The substantive and procedural standards governing a trial court\u2019s review of a denial are generally elucidated in <em>Weston, supra, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>36, 286 A.2d 43. \u201cThe Legislature [has] committed the original decision as to whether a firearms purchaser identification card should be granted to the discretion of the chief of police ..., subject to standards which have been adjudged constitutionally adequate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43, 286 A.2d at 46. \u201c[T]he statute directs issuance of the [FPIC] unless good cause to the contrary appears[J\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43-44,286 A.2d at 47. \u201cThe function of the Police Chief as the local administrative official charged with responsibility for the original decision to grant or withhold the [FPIC] involves largely the exercise of an informal discretion!,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 45, 286 A.2d at 47, based upon the information disclosed by \u201ca good faith investigation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 43, 286 A.2d at 46. That decision is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>subject to <em>de novo </em>review by the Superior Court, designed to \u201ccompensate!] constitutionally for procedural deficiencies before the administrative official!,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 45, 286 A.2d at 48, and \u201ccontemplating] introduction of relevant and material testimony and the application of an independent judgment to the testimony by the reviewing court.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[I]n evaluating the facts ... and the reasons given for rejection of the application, the court should give appropriate consideration to the Chiefs investigative experience and to any expertise he appears to have developed in administering the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46,286 A.2d at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The reason for reposing authority over the grant of FPICs in local chiefs of police seems obvious. Given their responsibilities for public safety, they have compelling interests in firearm control in their communities; and their investigative experience and familiarity with investigative techniques, as well as their expertise in evaluating the data obtained through investigation, <em>see ibid., </em>furnish presumptively reliable bases for determining whether an individual\u2019s access to firearms is likely to compromise public safety in that community. <em>Cf. Adler, supra, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 224-25, 705 A.2d at 1220-21. There are other significant policy bases for localizing the permitting authority. For example, the capacity for harm from access to firearms, even those designed for recreational use, may be very different in large cities, in residential suburbs, and in rural areas. Accordingly, the Legislature has determined it best that the decision whether or not to issue a permit be made on the local level. Although, when a trial court judge conducts the <em>de novo </em>review called for by statute, he is not bound by any factual determinations that have been made, he must, nevertheless act with appropriate regard for the local interest factor to the extent legitimately reflected in the police chiefs denial, as well as for the chiefs \u201cinvestigative experience and ... expertise!.]\u201d <em>See Weston, supra, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>at 46, 286 A.2d at 47. <em>See also In re Phillips, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>567, 578-80, 569 A.2d 807, 812-14 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Thus, this case presents more than just the relatively straightforward problem posited by the trial court of choosing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>between disparate views of two police chiefs. The question presented cannot be resolved by the simple expedient of applying the presumption of validity to one chiefs action and not to the other\u2019s. In considering Boyadjian\u2019s 2001 application, the North Arlington chief was not reviewing the 1996 action of the Kearny chief in granting the initial application. Rather, the North Arlington chief was making an independent determination based on his own investigation and evaluation, as he was obliged to do by the clear requirements of <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:54-l.ll(c) in respect of any application for a duplicate FPIC. Therefore, the presumption of validity, an appellate review standard, <em>see, e.g., In re Petition of New Jersey American Water Co., </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>181, 195-96, 777 A.2d 46, 54-55 (2001); <em>City of Newark v. Natural Resource Council, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>530, 539-40, 414 A.2d 1304, 1308-09, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>983, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>400, 66 L.Ed.2d 245 (1980), not one to be applied between tribunals or decision-makers on the same level, did not come into play when the North Arlington chief was called upon to act. <em>See Central Home Trust Co. v. Gough, </em>5 <em>N.J.Super. </em>295, 301, 68 A.2d 848, 851 (App.Div.1949). To conclude that the presumption of validity applies to the Kearny chiefs determination in a way that limits the discretion of the North Arlington chief would be to hold that the latter official\u2019s determination did not enjoy the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The trial judge\u2019s legitimate concern that one local official\u2019s decision should not be subject to \u201cwilly-nilly challenge\u201d does not apply, as here, where a second official was performing a mandatory evaluation made necessary by an intervening event, <em>i.e., </em>Boyad-jian\u2019s change of residence, and was applying the principled independent judgment called for by statute and regulation to a factual record that had changed, or one that could fairly be viewed as having different values in one community than it had had in the other. The Kearny police chief had once been \u201cthe man on the scene,\u201d as characterized by the trial court judge. That was no longer so. Given the statutory and regulatory scheme vesting first-instance regulation of firearm activity in the police chief of the applicant\u2019s community of residence, and the reasons for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>assignment of responsibility, it is the North Arlington chief who is now \u201cthe man on the scene,\u201d <em>ie., </em>the official whose judgment is entitled to the requisite respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">While Boyadjian resided in Kearny, it was that community\u2019s chief of police whose judgment in granting the initial FPIC was entitled to the \u201cappropriate consideration\u201d referred to in <em>Weston, supra, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>at 46, 286 A.2d at 48. Once Boyadjian moved to North Arlington, he subjected himself to the standards applied by that community\u2019s chief of police. Of course, neither chief was permitted to dispose of Boyadjian\u2019s application on a basis that was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. <em>See Ebler v. City of Newark, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>487, 491, 256 A.2d 44, 46 (1969). But, within the bounds of that controlling standard, each chief was privileged to act as an independent agent, discharging in a principled way, his public safety responsibilities for the community in which he was employed, without being limited by the actions previously taken in another community. Surely, a resident whose application for an FPIC in one community is denied could reasonably expect that a future application in another community to which he moves would be considered on its merits by the fairly established and decently administered standards generally applied by the second municipality\u2019s chief of police, unfettered by the prior denial except as a matter of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">There is no hint of arbitrariness, caprice or unreason in the record before us. When the North Arlington Chief of Police conducted his review, he considered Boyadjian\u2019s record by his own best lights. Moreover, that record was somewhat different from the record the Kearny chief had considered five years earlier in the sense of what it connoted about the applicant\u2019s regard for the law and his capacities for self-control. The record before the North Arlington chief showed additionally that, in the space of less than two weeks in 1997, the applicant had been convicted of yet another charge, lewdness, in Belleville Municipal Court; and had had yet another run-in with the police in Kearny, an arrest for terroristic threats resulting in a charge that was dismissed. Given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>these additional factors, and applying his own fairly-drawn standards for determining the gravity of the earlier arrests as they bore upon an FPIC application from a resident of North Arlington, there is no basis for concluding that the denial at issue here was impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
