In the early evening of the same day, the Camden police, acting on an anonymous tip of a \u201cman with a gun,\u201d stopped, searched and arrested defendant Ronald Patton on a weapons offense and took him to police headquarters. During the ensuing nineteen hours between the time of defendant\u2019s arrest and the commencement of interrogation, law enforcement officers fabricated an account of Hoke\u2019s murder. A law enforcement officer, posing as an eyewitness, was \u201cinterviewed\u201d on an audiotape that was later played to defendant who, despite his early denials of involvement, upon hearing the audiotape, confessed to the murder. The fabricated audiotape, identified as such, was later introduced into evidence at trial, and defendant was convicted of murder and related offenses. His motion to suppress the confession and objection to the use of the fictitious audiotape at trial were denied as was his challenge to the initial arrest and search.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">We reverse. We hold that law enforcement officers may not fabricate evidence to prompt a confession and later introduce that police-fabricated evidence at trial to support the voluntariness of the confession. We reverse the denial of the motion to suppress and remand for a new trial. We also order on remand that the judge reconsider the initial stop and search of defendant in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>266, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">We expand our discussion of the facts adduced at both the motion to suppress and trial. After discovering Hoke\u2019s body, the police determined that she had been shot nine times including seven times in the back. Later the same day, at approximately 4:00 p.m., the victim\u2019s brother informed police that defendant, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the brother knew by the street name of \u201cPhysical,\u201d and the victim had argued the day before. Following information received from an allegedly anonymous tip, at approximately 8:00 p.m., the police arrested defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The police did not begin questioning defendant immediately. During the nineteen-hour period between defendant\u2019s arrest and the commencement of the interrogation on August 11, 1998, the police fabricated an audiotape depicting a fictitious eyewitness to the crime \u201c[t]o let the person we were going to interview think there was an individual who saw him do what we think he did.\u201d Investigator Frank Falco of the Camden County Prosecutor\u2019s Office described the process of creating the audiotape:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">A. We made up a tape, myself and Sergeant Harry Glemser of the homicide unit and Homicide Investigator Aida Marcial [of the Camden County Prosecutor\u2019s Office] where Aida Marcial and myself interrogated Sergeant Glemser who we referred to as PO 150, or Informant 150, and we basically faked a tape of what we wanted to look like a witness to the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">Q. So Investigator Glemser was posing\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">A. Sergeant Glemser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-10\">Q. Sergeant Glemser was posing as a witness to the homicide of Gloria Hoke?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-11\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-12\">Q. And the information that Sergeant Glemser would have related on the tape, where did that come from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-13\">A. We had \u2014 I think [Detective] Monica [Davenport of the Camden Police Department] had told <em>me </em>and [Investigator] Willie [Mahan of the Camden County Prosecutor\u2019s Office] the day before they had some information from the brother of the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-14\">Q. Okay. So the information that Sergeant Glemser relayed would have been information that had been developed during the investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-15\">A Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-16\">At approximately 3:00 p.m. on August 11, the police began interrogating defendant as to the murder. Defendant signed a <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>card at 3:10 p.m., and when the police informed defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>dant that they wanted to speak to him about Hoke\u2019s murder, defendant initially replied that he was at his girlfriend\u2019s house on the night of the murder. The interrogators then told defendant that they had an eyewitness to the murder, and again defendant offered no response. After ten minutes of this \u201cpre-interview,\u201d the police indicated that they would play an audiotape of the eyewitness for defendant and did so. These are the relevant portions of the audiotape:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">AM. Today is Tuesday, August the 10th, 1998.

I think he lives somewhere on Erie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-11\">A.M. Right near by.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-12\">A. I was talking to him, man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-13\">A.M. And how\u2019s he ... what did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-14\">A.

I had talked to her earlier before that shit happened, but I didn\u2019t tell [him], you know, what I\u2019m tellin\u2019 you all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-15\">A.M. Did you tell anybody at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-17\">A.M. What you\u2019re telling us today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-18\">A. No ... he asked me did I know anything, I told him no, but ... when I got caught today I figured fuck it ... you know ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-19\">F.F. Okay, the time is around 11:30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-20\"><em>AM </em>The time ... the time now is about 11:30 a.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-21\">F.F. The statement is now concluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-22\">Immediately after the investigators played the audiotape, defendant asked: \u2018Who was that motherfucker?\u201d Defendant then confessed to murdering Hoke and agreed to give a taped statement. Once defendant confessed, the police ended the interrogation. The entire interrogation process, including the confession, consumed less than one hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-23\">According to defendant, after his arrest and at the time of his statement, he was suffering from the effects of heroin withdrawal, and his statement was \u201ccoerced.\u201d He claimed that the \u201cdetectives told me that if I gave a statement that they was [sic] going to take me [to] Cooper Hospital for detox, and then they told me that I had a tape \u2014 they had a tape referring that somebody witnessed something I supposed to have done [sic].\u201d The jail\u2019s admission form indicated that defendant was suffering from \u201cdiarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and chills[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Defendant was thereafter indicted by a Camden County Grand Jury for first-degree murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3a(l); second-degree possession of a handgun for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4a; third-degree unlawful possession of a handgun, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b; fourth-degree possession of a defaced firearm, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39~9e; third-degree hindering apprehension or prosecution, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:29-3b(l); and second-degree possession of a weapon by a person convicted of a crime, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-7b.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In a pretrial motion, defendant moved to suppress his confession. The judge denied that motion and rejected defendant\u2019s claim that he was suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Defendant also challenged the use of the fabricated audiotape, a challenge later repeated during trial. The judge rejected that claim as well, concluding that the technique was not coercive. The judge opined that \u201c[pjsychologically sophisticated interrogation techniques are proper because, while they are certainly effective enough to elicit confessions from guilty suspects, they would not cause an innocent person to confess.\u201d The judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">There is no question that police interrogation of persons suspected of crimes constitutes a necessary practice in the pursuit of crime solving and justice. Under the proper circumstances, confessions serve a useful social purpose. Because many criminal cases lack witnesses or physical evidence, police often would be incapable of collecting enough evidence to punish the wrongdoer without a confession. <em>Furthermore, as a practical matter, a confession often minimizes the need for further police investigation and often leads to conviction, both of which reduce costs to taxpayers. </em>Nevertheless, the potential for conflict arises because criminal offenders \u201cordinarily do not utter unsolicited, spontaneous confessions.\u201d Thus, the police are confronted with the difficult task of procuring a confession from a less than willing suspect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">There is no question that the use of trickery and deception provides a highly effective means of extracting confessions; and given the important role of confessions in law enforcement, police must be free to employ effective means of obtaining them. Thus, police deceit is justified as a necessary and proper means of ensuring effective law enforcement and crime control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">To elicit a confession from a guilty suspect, the interrogator must be allowed to use techniques which effectively decrease the suspect\u2019s resistance to confess, while at the same time increasing a desire to tell the truth. Out of necessity, these techniques are psychologically sophisticated. They involve persuasion, insincerity, and potential trickery and deceit. They do not involve coercion, or compulsion and they do not remove a <em>suspect\u2019s free </em>will. <em>Most assuredly, none of the techniques </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>or tactics presented here would cause an innocent person to confess a crime. </em>As to whether defendant\u2019s will was overborne by the investigator\u2019s deceit, the court need only look to the defendant\u2019s own testimony in which not a single word was said as to the impact of the faked tape upon his decision to confess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\n<em>The creation and me of the bogm eyewitness testimony was an astute decision by experienced investigators attempting to solve a brutal crime. Their actions were creative and unusual as well as being entirely appropriate and lawful.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">[ (Emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">At trial, the State proffered the police-fabricated audiotape for consideration by the jury as evidence of the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s confession. Included within the contents of the purported eyewitness account were references to incidents of domestic violence and \u201cother bad acts\u201d committed by defendant, an issue prompting an objection by defendant. Defendant moved for a mistrial after the audiotape was played, but the judge denied the application, opting to give a limiting instruction to the jury. The limiting instruction, which the judge determined to be \u201cmore than sufficient,\u201d advised the jury to consider the allegations of domestic violence not \u201cfor the truth of the statement or as proof that the defendant committed a violent act or is a bad person,\u201d but, as the judge advised, the audiotape could be considered \u201conly as it relates to the effect that the statement may have had upon the state of mind of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">Defendant was convicted, and now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">On appeal, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">THE INTERROGATION TECHNIQUE USED BY THE POLICE TO INDUCE DEFENDANT\u2019S CONFESSION \u2014 THEY CREATED A TAPE RECORDING OF A FAKE EYEWITNESS TO THE MURDER AND PLAYED IT FOR THE DEFENDANT AS IF IT WERE GENUINE EVIDENCE-RENDERED IT INVOLUNTARY, AND THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S DECISION TO ADMIT THE CONFESSION INTO EVIDENCE VIOLATED THE FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS, AS WELL AS STATE COMMON LAW.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">BECAUSE THE POLICE HAD NO REASONABLE SUSPICION TO STOP THE DEFENDANT, THE ENSUING PAT DOWN AND SEIZURE OF THE GUN WAS ILLEGAL.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>A.

This issue implicates two considerations: the voluntariness of the confession and whether the use of such evidence both in the interrogation process and thereafter at trial comports with both Federal and State Constitutional protections. We commence our analysis with an historical overview of police interrogation practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Over the last century, police interrogation procedures evolved from the use of physical force to extract confessions to the modern day use of psychologically coercive techniques. <em>See Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 446-48, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1602,16 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 707-09; Jerome H. Skolnick and Richard A. Leo, <em>The Ethics of Deceptive Interrogation, </em>11 <em>Crim. Just. Ethics </em>3 (Winter/Spring 1992). The shift away from physically coercive police practices began in the 1930s in response to several studies, the most prominent of which was the Wickersham Report to Congress, National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement, Report No. 11, <em>Lawlessness in Law Enforcement </em>(1931) (Wickersham Report), decrying the use of brutality and \u201cthird degree\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> techniques to extract confessions. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 446-48, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d at 707-09. In 1936, the United States Supreme Court specifically banned the use of physical force during police questioning. <em>See Brown v. Mississippi, </em>297 <em>U.S. </em>278, 286, 56 <em>S.Ct. </em>461, 465, 80 <em>L.Ed. </em>682, 687 (1936) (holding that the use of confessions to convict three African-American defendants who had been whipped and beaten by the police until they confessed to murder was \u201ca clear denial of due process.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">By the 1960s, studies indicated that while police in some jurisdictions continued to use physical force, the majority practice was to use psychologically-coereive methods to extract confessions, including the use of trickery. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 448-49, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1614, 16 L.Ed.2d at 708-09. For example, one police manual cited in <em>Miranda </em>advocated the use of fake line-up procedures where the suspect would be chosen as the perpetrator of the crime by a \u201ccoached\u201d witness or in a \u201creverse-line-up,\u201d the suspect would be identified by fictitious witnesses as the perpetrator of different offenses. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 453, 86 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>S.Ct. </em>at 1616-17, 16 L.Ed.2d at 711 (citing O\u2019Hara, <em>Fundamentals of Criminal Investigation, </em>105-06 (1956)). The manual explained: \u201cIt is expected that the subject will become desperate and confess to the offense under investigatio n in order to escape from the false accusations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting O\u2019Hara, <em>supra, </em>at 106).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">To address such interrogation methods, the United States Supreme Court mandated in <em>Miranda </em>that for police to obtain a voluntary confession, they must inform suspects subject to custodial interrogation of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 479, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d at 726. While <em>Miranda </em>focused on informing suspects of their rights, it did not address the propriety or use of the psychologically coercive techniques it deplored, once suspects validly waived their rights. Yale Kamisar et al., <em>Modern Criminal Procedure, </em>609-10 (8th ed.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Other decisions have addressed the issue, and the use of psychological coercion including trickery and deceit by police has received judicial sanction. Without defining the limits of such conduct, the Supreme Court has upheld certain forms of trickery. <em>See Frazier v. Cupp, </em>394 <em>U.S. </em>731, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>1420, 22 L.Ed.2d 684 (1969) (holding confession was voluntary where police lied to defendant that his co-defendant had implicated him in the crime); <em>see also Miller v. Fenton, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>104, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>445, 88 L.Ed.2d 405 (1985) (upholding confession obtained after an hour long interrogation where the police lied about evidence they had against defendant, expressed sympathy toward defendant by indicating suspect was not a criminal and should receive psychiatric help, and where the suspect collapsed in a state of shock immediately after confessing).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">But the Supreme Court has cautioned that psychological techniques may be just as coercive as the use of force. <em>E.g., Chambers v. Florida, </em>309 <em>U.S. </em>227, 238-39, 60 <em>S.Ct. </em>472, 478, 84 <em>L.Ed. </em>716, 722-23 (1940) (rejecting confessions of \u201cyoung colored tenant farmers\u201d who were questioned over a period of five days and then \u201cbroke\u201d after an all-night interrogation session despite the lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>physical violence, noting that \u201cJust as our decision in <em>Brown v. State of Mississippi </em>was based upon the fact that the confessions were the result of compulsion, so in the present case, the admitted practices were such as to justify the statement that \u2018The undisputed facts showed that compulsion was applied.\u2019 \u201d); see <em>Blackburn v. Alabama, </em>361 <em>U.S. </em>199, 206, 80 <em>S.Ct. </em>274, 279, 4 L.Ed.2d 242, 247-48 (1960) (reversing conviction where primary evidence was a confession from the insane defendant and noting \u201cthat the efficiency of the rack and the thumbscrew can be matched, given the proper subject, by more sophisticated modes of \u2018persuasion.\u2019\u201d). <em>See also Lynumn v. Illinois, </em>372 <em>U.S. 528, 83 S.Ct. </em>917, 9 L.Ed.2d 922 (1963) (invalidating confession after defendant was falsely threatened that her children would be taken away from her and she would lose her government benefits for them if she did not \u201ccooperate\u201d); <em>Spano v. New York, </em>360 <em>U.S. </em>315, 79 <em>S.Ct. </em>1202, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265 (1959) (invalidating confession to murder where police officer, who was a \u201cchildhood friend\u201d of defendant, falsely told defendant that his telephone confession had placed the officer\u2019s job at risk and losing his job would create a hardship for the officer\u2019s family).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Other Federal and State courts have similarly tolerated the use of trickery after a suspect has waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights permitting, among other forms of deceit, police falsely advising a defendant that the police possess incriminating evidence inculpating defendant for the alleged offense. <em>See, e.g., Sovalik v. State, </em>612 P.2d 1003 (Alaska 1980) (defendant\u2019s fingerprints were found at the crime scene); <em>State v. Cobb, </em>115 <em>Ariz. </em>484, 566 P.2d 285 (1977) (same); <em>State v.

Drechsler, Annotation, <em>Admissibility of Confession as Affected by its Inducement Through Artifice, Deception, Trickery, or Fraud, </em>99 <em>A.L.R.2d </em>772 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">New Jersey courts also have permitted the use of trickery in interrogations. <em>See, e.g., State v. Cooper, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>326, 355-56, 700 A.2d 306 (1997) (upholding confession where police, after informing defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, confronted suspect with evidence of his guilt and wrongly informed him that he could be facing life in prison for murder rather than a death sentence), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>1084, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>809, 145 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>681 (2000); <em>State v. Manning, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>19, 30-31, 397 A.2d 686 (App.Div.1978) (upholding the admission of a confession given after police lied to defendant that his co-defendant had already confess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ed as \u201c[a] confession induced by deception or trickery is not inadmissible unless the method used was calculated to produce an untruthful confession or was offensive to due process.\u201d) (quoting Wharton, <em>Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 685 at 471-474 (13th ed.1973)), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>417, 413 A.2d 605 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">This case presents a different circumstance than the other trickery cases. Thematic throughout most of the legion of cases approving the use of trickery and false representations by police officers is the common fact that the falsity emanates from the \u201cvoice\u201d of the officer. The teachings of these cases support a view that a police officer in the interrogation process may, by the officer\u2019s statements, make misrepresentations of fact or suggest that evidence in the form of reports or witnesses exist that will implicate a suspect. That the \u201cvoice\u201d of the misrepresentation is the police officer is a distinguishing factor between these decisions and those questioning the use of police-fabricated tangible evidence, the issue extant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The use of police-fabricated evidence to induce a confession has been addressed in other jurisdictions. In <em>State v. Cayward, </em>552 So.2d 971 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1989), <em>review dismissed, </em>562 So.2d 347 (Fla.1990), the police fabricated two scientific reports, one on stationery of the Florida Department of Criminal Law Enforcement, the other on stationery of a scientific testing organization, \u201cLife Codes, Inc.,\u201d indicating that semen stains on the victim\u2019s underwear came from defendant. The police presented the reports to defendant during their interrogation, and \u201c[s]ome time later during the interview, defendant confessed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 972. Noting that police deception does not render a confession involuntary <em>per se, </em>the court held that \u201cthe police overstepped the line of permitted deception,\u201d answering the question \u201cwhether there is a qualitative difference between the verbal artifices deemed acceptable and the presentation of the falsely contrived scientific documents challenged here,\u201d in the affirmative. <em>Id. </em>at 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In rendering its decision, the court focused on both constitutional and practical considerations. It first noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>It may well be that a suspect is more impressed and thereby more easily induced to confess when presented with tangible, official-looking reports as opposed to merely being told that some tests have implicated him. If one perceives such a difference, it probably originates in the notion that a document which purports to be authoritative impresses one as being inherently more permanent and facially reliable than a simple verbal statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">We think, however, that both the suspect\u2019s and the public\u2019s expectations concerning the built-in adversariness of police interrogations do not encompass the notion that the police will knowingly fabricate tangible documentation or physical evidence against an individual. Such an idea brings to mind the horrors of less advanced centuries in our civilization when magistrates at times schemed with sovereigns to frame political rivals. This is precisely one of the parade of horrors civics teachers have long taught their pupils that our modern judicial system was designed to correct. Thus we think the manufacturing of false documents by police officials offends our traditional notions of due process of law under both the federal and state constitutions. <em>U.S. Const, </em>amends. V, XIV; <em>Fla. Const, </em>art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 9. <em>[Cayward, supra, </em>652 &lt;So.2d at 974.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Addressing practical concerns, the court noted that police-fabricated evidence was dangerous as;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">Unlike oral misrepresentations, manufactured documents have the potential of indefinite life and the facial appearance of authenticity. A report falsified for interrogation purposes might well be retained and filed in police paperwork. Such reports have the potential of finding their way into the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">We are further concerned that false documents retained in police or state attorney\u2019s files might be disclosed to the media as a result of the public records law. A suspect\u2019s reputation could be unwittingly yet unfairly and permanently marred and his right to a fair trial jeopardized by the media\u2019s innocent reporting of falsified documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\"><em>We can also conceive of an unintended scenario where a manufactured, document, initially designed only for use in interrogation, might be admitted as substantive evidence against a defendant. </em>Although one hopes that such an error would be discovered in preparation for trial, the reality of our courts\u2019 heavy caseloads is that counsel and trial judges routinely accept as true documents which appear to be reliable reports from known government and private agencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">We shudder to think of the impact that questionable authenticity of court records might have not only on the trial level, but on the appellate level. We are routinely presented with documents in court files which we must assume to be genuine. To sanction the manufacturing of false documents, which have the potential of being admitted as substantive evidence, would severely diminish our confidence in relying upon facially valid documents in court files..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-11\"><em>[Cayward, supra, </em>552 So.2d at 974-75 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">The court finally noted that it was concerned with public perception of the police and fashioned a <em>per se </em>rule against such tactics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>stating that police-fabricated evidence \u201chas no place in our criminal justice system.\u201d If?, at 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The rule enunciated 'in <em>Cayward </em>has been addressed in other jurisdictions. The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals cited <em>Cayward </em>with approval in <em>State v. Farley, </em>192 <em>W.Va. </em>247, 452 S.E.2d 50 (1994). Although <em>Farley </em>did not involve the fabrication of tangible evidence as the police there falsely told defendant that he had failed a polygraph test, the court warned in a footnote that it would not have upheld the validity of the confession if defendant had been shown a written document indicating that he failed the test. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">We do not believe that merely telling the defendant that he did not do well on a polygraph examination without further elaboration is likely to encourage an innocent person to confess. Had the police intentionally fabricated more <em>specific </em>false results to obtain a confession, our view may very well be different. This is particularly true if the police had reduced these fabrications to a written report and disclosed it to the defendant. We definitely draw a demarcating line between police deception generally, which does not render a confession involuntary <em>per se, </em>and the manufacturing of false documents by the police which \u201chas no place in our criminal justice system.\u201d <em>State v. Cayward, </em>552 So.2d 971, 974 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1989).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\"><em>[Farley, supra, </em>452 <em>S.E.</em>2d at 60 n. 13.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">The Supreme Court of Hawaii discussed <em>Cayward </em>in <em>State v. Kelekolio, </em>74 <em>Haw. </em>479, 849 P.2d 58 (1993), a ease that also did not involve the fabrication of evidence but rather a verbal misrepresentation of evidence possessed by police. The Supreme Court of Hawaii, in a footnote, appeared to agree with the principle enunciated in <em>Cayward, </em>but ultimately adopted the rule that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASW\">employment by the police of deliberate falsehoods <em>intrinsic </em>to the facts of the alleged offense in question will be treated as one of the totality of circumstances surrounding the confession or statement to be considered in assessing its voluntariness; on the other hand, deliberate falsehoods <em>extrinsic </em>to the facts of the alleged offense, which are of a type reasonably likely to procure an untrue statement or to influence an accused to malte a confession regardless of guilt, will be regarded as coercive <em>per se, </em>thus obviating the need for a \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d analysis of voluntariness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 73.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">The court considered \u201cintrinsic falsehoods\u201d to include misrepresentations by police \u201cregarding the existence of incriminating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cExtrinsic falsehoods,\u201d on the other hand, involved misrepresentations beyond the scope of the crime, such as \u201cassurances of divine salvation upon confession ...

Only confessions based on extrinsic falsehoods were <em>per se </em>inadmissible; confessions resulting from intrinsic falsehoods were subject to the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test to determine whether the interrogation technique should be \u201ccondemned under principles of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74 (citing <em>Cayward </em>as an example of such a technique). <em>Kelekolio </em>appears to agree with the <em>Cayward </em>result, but would have reached that determination by using a totality of the circumstances test rather than applying a <em>per se </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The majority of the Supreme Court of Nevada followed <em>Keleko-lio </em>\u2019s intrinsic/extrinsic dichotomy in <em>Sheriff Washoe County v. Bessey, </em>112 <em>Nev. </em>322, 914 P.2d 618 (1996) (Bessey), and rejected a <em>per se </em>rule that police-created evidence should not be admitted into evidence. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Bessey, </em>police created a \u201cfalsified lab report\u201d indicating defendant had committed a sexual assault against a minor. Because the majority considered that the fabricated lab report \u201cwent to the strength of the evidence against [defendant], a consideration intrinsic to the facts of the alleged offense,\u201d the court applied the totality of the circumstances test and determined, without explanation, that \u201c[t]here [was] nothing about the fabricated document presented to [defendant] in this case which would have produced a false confession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621. The majority also criticized <em>Cayward, </em>in concluding that a verbal lie by police and one \u201cembodied in a piece of paper\u201d was \u201ca distinction without a real difference.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. </em>Jerome H.

They argued that permitting police to use verbal deception while prohibiting the use of \u201cfalsehoods or deception in written or other tangible form ... strikes an appropriate balance between the necessity for the police to use some deception in developing evidence, while prohibiting the carrying of such deception or falsehoods to a truly unfair advantage over an accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The dissenters distinguished the eases relied upon by the majority that did not involve the fabrication of evidence as \u201cthose cases did not consider the reliability of a confession induced by confrontation with ostensibly irrefutable hard scientific evidence, as opposed to mere oral allegations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For the dissenters, these concerns and the practical implications of fabricated evidence rendered the difference between the two types of evidence to be \u201cvery real\u201d and \u201csignificant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>They warned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">The potential for havoe and injustice resulting from allowing police to fabricate evidence to obtain confessions appears to be much greater than its potential benefits in obtaining otherwise unobtainable, valid confessions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 624.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Finally, in <em>Arthur v. Commonwealth, </em>24 <em>Va.App. </em>102, 480 S.E.2d 749 (1997), the Virginia Court of Appeals, applying the totality of the circumstances test, held that a confession resulting from police showing defendant \u201cdummy\u201d reports indicating that defendant\u2019s fingerprints and hair were found at the crime scene was voluntary. <em>Id. </em>at 751. Although not discussing Cayward\u2019s practical evidential concerns, the court did note that the \u201c[pjolice [had] kept the false documents in a file separate from the actual investigative documents and lab reports.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Also, the court observed that defendant \u201cdid not immediately confess after being shown the \u2018dummy\u2019 reports, but admitted his involvement only after the detective later told him that the victim\u2019s parents wanted to know why the killing had happened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 752. And, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>addition to making the oral admission to the police and giving a taped and written statement, defendant \u201cwrote a letter, in private, to the victim\u2019s parents.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Other jurisdictions have permitted the use of fabricated evidence in procuring confessions. <em>See, e.g., United States ex rel.

Both the State and defendant noted to the jury that the audiotape was created by the State and was apparently false. The flaw in the State\u2019s position and the relevance of the <em>Cayward </em>prediction surfaced when it became equally apparent that some of the information contained in the falsified audiotape was true. Defendant suddenly found himself in an untenable strategic dilemma. To cross-examine Inv. Falco would expose defendant to establishing the bona tides of information contained in the audiotape regarding \u201cother bad acts\u201d including involvement in domestic violence disputes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, the audiotape contained inadmissible hearsay of prior bad acts by defendant, i.e., the domestic violence restraining order against him, and although one of the investigators who created the audiotape, Inv. Falco, was subject to cross-examination, asking the investigator whether the prior bad acts evidence was valid would have presumably prompted a truthful response that it was genuine. Everyone in the courtroom recognized that to give the audiotape credibility to defendant, it was necessary to \u201cseed\u201d the tape with some truth. Even the judge asked the prosecutor, rhetorically: \u2018Would there not have to be something on that tape, counsel, to give a ring of truth to the defendant for him to think, \u2018Gee, this is a genuine tape?\u2019 \u201d The use of seemingly true hearsay statements generated an issue certainly not anticipated by <em>Cayward, </em>but very real here.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>In <em>State v. Bankston, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>263, 307 A.2d 65 (1973), the Court held that a police officer may explain at trial that he apprehended a suspect or went to a crime scene \u201cupon information received\u201d without violating the hearsay rule. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 307 A.2d 65 (quoting <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 248 (2d ed.1972)). This testimony is admissible because it merely demonstrates that the officer was not acting in an arbitrary manner. The hearsay rule is violated, \u201c[h]owever, when the officer becomes more specific by repeating what some other person told him concerning a crime by the accused ... [as] the admission of such testimony violates the accused\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to be confronted by witnesses against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268-69, 307 A.2d 65 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In <em>Bankston, </em>police officers testified that they had spoken to an informant prior to arresting defendant, and based on the information given them, they went to a particular tavern. Then one of the officers stated, \u201c[W]e were looking for a certain individual. We had a description of his clothing. He was inside the tavern____We were looking for an individual that had narcotics in his possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 307 A.2d 65. Another officer testified that upon entering the tavern he had observed \u201cfour black males inside, \u2018one of them fitting the description that we had obtained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 307 A.2d 65. The Court found error stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">Although <em>in </em>the present ease the police officers never specifically repeated what the informer had told them, the <em>inescapable inference </em>from [the first offieer]\u2019s testimony was that the informer had given information that defendant would have narcotics in his possession. Thus the jury was led to believe that an unidentified informer, who was not present in court and not subjected to cross-examination, had told the officers that defendant was committing a crime. The testimony was clearly hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 271, 307 A.2d 65 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">Here, the State introduced the police-fabricated audiotape containing allegedly fictitious hearsay information from an informant indicating that the victim had told the informant that she and defendant had argued on the day she was murdered and that he knew \u201cLora\u201d who had told him that she had a domestic violence restraining order against defendant. Unlike in <em>Bankston, </em>Inv. Falco was subject to cross-examination. But, defendant knew the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>information was actually true (a representation accepted by the trial judge), and questioning Inv. Falco would have only exacerbated the problem of presenting this evidence to the jury. Because the jury was told that the police created the audiotape to persuade defendant to confess, there was a \u201creasonable inference\u201d that the audiotape contained valid information \u2014 that is, it had a \u201cring of truth\u201d \u2014 sufficient to convince defendant that there was an eyewitness who witnessed the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The judge\u2019s curative instructions neither prevented nor cured the error. <em>See Bankston, supra, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>at 272, 307 A.2d 65 (noting that trial judge\u2019s curative instructions, which only addressed the prosecutor\u2019s references to hearsay and did not reference the officer\u2019s hearsay testimony, \u201cdid not remove the prejudicial effect of that testimony from the minds of the jury.\u201d). The judge admonished the jury not to consider the audiotape as true, but limited his cautionary instructions to the restraining order; yet there was other information in the audiotape to be considered by the jury, including a hearsay rendition of an argument having taken place between defendant and the victim on the day of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">But, there is a more fundamental problem caused by the use of this fabricated audiotape at trial. The fabricated audiotape provided a \u201croad map\u201d for the State\u2019s theory of the case: defendant had fought with the victim; defendant was violent towards women; defendant was associated with drug users; defendant had shot the victim in the back while she was running down the alley; and the \u201ceyewitness\u201d had communicated with the victim\u2019s brother. All of this was described through the use of hearsay, inadmissable as probative evidence and immune from challenge by defendant\u2019s cross-examination. Through the guise of this audiotape, the State presented a neatly packaged summary of its case in a form and manner that was inadmissable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>We do not discuss the apparent errors caused by the use of the audiotape at trial as an independent basis for reversing the conviction. Our purpose is more focused. The objective of the fabricated audiotape was to elicit a confession. One of the evils identified in <em>Cayward </em>was potential for mischief if the fabricated evidence found its way into the trial. Of course, Cayward\u2019s expressed concern did not predict all of the potential problems that could arise from future use of fabricated evidence. This case demonstrates another variation of mischief, a mischief that was palpable and impacted on the rights of defendant. The creation of the audiotape set in motion a confluence of events that tainted not only the interrogation process but the trial itself. This is too heavy a price to pay for eliciting the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Ultimately, the admissibility of the confession must be considered within the scope of Constitutional principles. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution establishes a privilege against self-incrimination. <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. V; <em>see State v. Presha, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>304, 312, 748 A.2d 1108 (2000). This right, although not found in the New Jersey State Constitution, \u201cis firmly established as part of the common law of New Jersey, and has been incorporated into [New Jersey\u2019s] Rules of Evidence.\u201d <em>Presha, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 312-13, 748 A.2d 1108 (quoting <em>State v. Hartley, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>252, 260, 511 A.2d 80 (1986)) (quoting <em>In re Martin, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>295, 331, 447 A.2d 1290 (1982)). A person may waive his or her right against self-incrimination and confess to the commission of a crime, but the police may not elicit such a waiver through coercion; and in such event, the prosecution is prohibited from admitting the confession as part of its case in chief. <em>Presha, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 313, 748 A.2d 1108; <em>Hartley, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>267, 511 A.2d 80. To admit a confession into evidence, the State \u201cmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the suspect\u2019s waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary in light of all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Presha, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 313, 748 A.2d 1108 (citing <em>State v. Burris, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>509, 534, 679 A.2d 121 (1996); <em>State v. Kelly, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>283, 294, 294 A.2d 41 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">In determining whether a confession was coerced, a court will consider \u201cwhether a suspect\u2019s will has been overborne by police conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To make this decision, \u201ccourts traditionally assess the totality of circumstances surrounding the arrest and interrogation!)]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This analysis includes consideration of the characteristics of the suspect, including age, intelligence, education, and prior encounters with the law, as well as the conditions under which the questioning took place, i.e., whether it was \u201crepeated and prolonged,\u201d the length of the suspect\u2019s detention, and whether \u201cphysical punishment or mental exhaustion was involved.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. Miller, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>392, 402, 388 A.2d 218 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">A critical factor in any analysis is the conduct of the police, conduct that if overreaching violates due process. In <em>State v. Smith, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>501, 161 A.2d 520 (1960), <em>cert. denied, </em>364 <em>U.S. </em>936, 81 <em>S.Ct. </em>383, 5 L.Ed.2d 367 (1961), our Supreme Court adopted the due process analysis for confessions set forth in <em>Brown v. Mississippi, supra. Smith, supra, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>at 542-44, 161 A.2d 520 (upholding juvenile\u2019s confession to felony-murder obtained after police told juvenile that co-defendant confessed and his family and friends did not corroborate his alibi). <em>Smith </em>and subsequent New Jersey cases \u201cimposed a mandatory burden on all courts to test the admissibility of confessions not only by the ordinary rules of evidence, but by the deeper constitutional requirement of fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>State v. Driver, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>255, 282, 183 A.2d 655 (1962) (invalidating confession to murder based on \u201cintensive and prolonged\u201d interrogation of defendant over nine days); <em>see also State v. Pickles, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>542, 577, 218 A.2d 609 (1966) (invalidating mother\u2019s inculpatory admission to child neglect because it \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>extracted by basically unfair means\u201d as she was questioned immediately after her son\u2019s funeral and her emotional state made her \u201can easy prey to interrogative pressure.\u201d); <em>State v. Fauntleroy, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>379, 397, 177 A.2d 762 (1962) (setting aside murder conviction because trial judge only considered the police\u2019s five-day delay in arraigning defendant and provision of inadequate food and sleeping facilities during interrogation as mere \u201ctechnical\u201d violations that did not render defendant\u2019s confession inadmissible absent \u201cbrutality or misrepresentation.\u201d). <em>And see State v. Roach, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>208, 226-28, 680 A.2d 634, <em>cert. denied, </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>1021, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>540, 136 L.Ed.2d 424 (1996) (upholding confession despite defendant\u2019s allegation that police deceived him into thinking he was only giving statement as a witness as there was no evidence that the statement \u201cwas not the product of \u2018an essentially free and unconstrained choice.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Pickles, supra, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>at 577, 218 A.2d 609). These cases mandate an appellate review of police-obtained confessions that is \u201csearching and critical.\u201d <em>Pickles, supra, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>at 577, 218 A.2d 609; <em>Smith, supra, 32 N.J. </em>at 544, 161 A.2d 520 (\u201cWe must ever be alert, however, that recognition is not mere lip service. Eeview [of the fundamental fairness of a confession] has to be both wide and penetrating to make sure these constitutional rights have not been trampled upon.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">More recently, our Supreme Court alluded to the analysis for whether police conduct violates due process in <em>State v. Reed, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>237, 269, 627 A.2d 630 (1993), where the Court established the rule that to satisfy Miranda\u2019s requirement of a knowing waiver, police officers must inform a suspect in their custody if an attorney has been retained and is available for the suspect. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">[TJhe police conduct in this case illustrates the close correlation between police conduct that can increase the inherently coercive atmosphere of custodial interrogation and conduct that is excessive, shocking, and fundamentally unfair and therefore violative of due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 268, 627 A.2d 630.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-8\"><em>But see Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>412, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1135, 89 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 410 (1986) (holding that the failure of police to inform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>defendant that an attorney was available to assist him did not violate his Fourth, Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights as he had knowingly and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In <em>Reed, </em>the Court noted that other jurisdictions had similarly banned such police conduct, although courts differed in their rationales for imposing a duty to inform; even so, the one \u201csupervening principle\u201d that all the courts agreed on was that: \u201cthe atmosphere of custodial interrogation is inherently coercive and protecting the right against self-incrimination entails counteracting that coercion.\u201d <em>Reed, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 255, 627 A.2d 630. The \u201clesson\u201d that the Court derived from the differing analysis was that \u201ca waiver of the right against self-incrimination which, by all subjective indicia, appears knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, may still be deemed invalid when elicited in an atmosphere of coercion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256, 627 A.2d 630. The Court explained that \u201cthe determination of the subjective mental state that leads to a waiver is often so problematic,\u201d <em>id., </em>referring to a study demonstrating that people differ widely in their ability to resist pressure. <em>Id. </em>at 257, 627 A.2d 630 (citing George Thomas III, <em>Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s Pragmatic View of Coerced Self-Incrimination, </em>13 <em>Women\u2019s Rts. L. Rep. </em>117 (1991)); <em>see also </em>Welsh S. White, <em>Police Trickery in Inducing Confessions, </em>127 <em>U. Pa. L.Rev. </em>624-25 (Jan.1979) (noting that \u201c[t]he psychological pressures of custodial interrogation undoubtedly weaken the defenses of many criminal suspects,\u201d as social psychological \u201cevidence indicates that \u201cwhen an individual finds himself disagreeing with the unanimous judgment of others regarding an unambiguous stimulus, he may yield to the majority even though this requires misreporting what he sees or believes.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Edwin D. Driver, <em>Confessions and the Social Psychology of Coercion, </em>82 <em>Harv. L.Rev. </em>42, 51-52 (Nov.1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The Court therefore adopted a bright-line, <em>per se </em>rule, rejecting a totality of the circumstances approach \u201cbecause it is not feasible to determine defendant\u2019s subjective state of mind. The inherently coercive nature of incommunicado interrogations argues in favor of a clear principle to safeguard the presumption against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>waiver of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Reed, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 265, 627 A.2d 630 (citation omitted). The Court specifically did not ground its decision on the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution in light of <em>Moran v. Burbine, id. </em>at 263, 627 A.2d 630, but noted that its \u201cdetermination of the nature and application of the ancillary right to counsel directs the focus of future judicial inquiry, in [New Jersey], away from the assessment of the subjective level of coercion to which a suspect was exposed and toward an evaluation of objective police conduct,\u201d noting that \u201csuch a focus \u2014 toward police conduct \u2014 invariably raises questions of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 627 A.2d 630. This due process inquiry involves \u201cconsiderations of reasonableness, fairness, and judicial integrity that collectively define the bounds of tolerable police conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268, 627 A.2d 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\"><em>Reed </em>suggests that New Jersey courts have been less tolerant of aberrant police conduct when applied to custodial interrogations than the United States Supreme Court, determining such issues with due process considerations at the fore. We need not dwell on whether such conflict exists here as we view the police conduct to be so inappropriate that it cannot be tolerated or withstand scrutiny under any constitutional or common-law principles. Nevertheless, we need only conclude that the conduct here violates New Jersey\u2019s due process standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">As demonstrated in <em>Reed, </em>the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d test is not without limits. Certain interrogation techniques are so inappropriate that application of a totality of the circumstances test is inadequate to assure that the resultant confession was voluntary, and the use of the technique renders the confession <em>per se </em>inadmissible. <em>See also Presha, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 315-16, 748 A.2d 1108 (holding that any confession resulting from the interrogation of a juvenile under fourteen years old whose parent or guardian is available but not present is inadmissible as a matter of law); <em>Hartley, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 256, 511 A.2d 80 (holding that police must furnish a suspect who has asserted his right to silence \u25a0with a fresh <em>Miranda </em>warning before resuming custodial interro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>gation of the suspect or any resulting confession is inadmissible as a matter of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Applying the principles set forth in <em>Reed, Hartley, </em>and <em>Presha, </em>we hold that the circumstance presented here, the fabrication of evidence by police to elicit a confession and admission of that evidence at trial, violates due process, and any resulting confession is <em>per se </em>inadmissable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the United States Supreme Court has yet to define the permissible limits of police trickery, we are informed by another <em>post-Miranda </em>decision of our Supreme Court, which noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">The necessity for our giving guidance to our own law-enforcement officials cannot be underestimated. We are faced with a situation similar to that presented in <em>State v. Deatore, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>100, 358 A.2d 163 (1976). When we decided that case, the United States Supreme Court had not yet ruled on whether a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence could be used on cross-examination to undercut an \u201calibi\u201d defense. Recognizing the importance of this issue to our state\u2019s criminal justice system, as well as the confusing \u201cdisarray in decisional treatment of the question,\u201d we ruled <em>as a matter of state law </em>that such cross-examination was improper. 70 <em>N.J. </em>at 112, 358 A.2d 163. Our concern with the effective administration of our state criminal-justice system has led us in other circumstances to create or enforce criminal defendants\u2019 rights under our supervisory power, <em>N.J.

In criticizing police conduct in extracting confessions through the use of the third degree, the authors of the report observed: (1) \u201c[i]t is not admissible to do a great right by doing a little wrong,\u201d (2) such practice \u201cinvolves also the dangers of false confessions, [ (3)] it tends to make police and prosecutors less zealous in the search for objective evidence,\u201d and (4) it \u201clowers the esteem in which the administration of justice is held by the public.\u201d <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 447-48, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1614, 16 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 708 (quoting Wickersham Report, <em>supra, </em>at 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The admonitions of that report and the decisional law following has not been lost on police training. In fact, the actions here were not in conformity with standard police interrogation practices described in the \u201cInbau Manual,\u201d Fred E. Inbau et al., <em>Criminal Interrogation and Confessions </em>(4th ed.2001), an interrogation manual used by many police departments. <em>See </em>Welsh S. White, <em>What Is An Involuntary Confession Now?, </em>50 <em>Rutgers L.Rev. </em>2001, 2004 (Summer 1998) (describing the Inbau Manual as \u201cthe leading interrogation manual\u201d); Yale Kamisar, <em>What is an \u2018Involuntary\u2019 Confession? Some Comments on Inbau and Reid\u2019s Criminal Interrogation and Confessions, </em>17 <em>Rutgers L.Rev. </em>728 (1963); <em>see also Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 449 n. 9, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1614 n. 9, 16 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 709 n. 9 (discussing prior edition of Inbau Manual as having \u201crather extensive use among law enforcement agencies and among students of police science, with total sales and circulation of over 44,000\u201d). The Inbau Manual recommends the use of trickery, including \u201coutright lies concerning the existence of evidence.\u201d Inbau Manual, <em>supra, </em>at 428. It reaches a different recommendation regarding the creation of \u201cfalse incriminating documents,\u201d however. <em>Id. </em>at 217 n. 2. Specifically, the Inbau Manual advises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">Before entering the interview room, the investigator should prepare and have on hand an evidence case folder, or a simulation of one. Then, at the outset of the interrogation, and also at appropriate times during the various steps that follow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>initial confrontation, the investigator can make visual reference to the evidence folder. This is to lead the suspect to believe that the folder contains information and material of incriminating significance, even though, in fact, the file may contain nothing but blank sheets of paper. The mere sight of the file has a desirable effect on both guilty and innocent suspects because of the impression of preparedness on the part of the investigator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">In addition to an evidence file, depending on the nature of the case, the investigator may consider bringing into the interview room other visual props, such as video or audio tape, a fingerprint card, an evidence bag containing hair or other fibers, spent shell casings, vials of colored liquid, and others. No verbal reference needs to be made at all concerning these items of apparent physical evidence. The visual impact of seeing the implied evidence can have a desirable effect on a guilty suspect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 217 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Despite its instruction to use props during an interrogation, the Inbau Manual precludes the use of fabricated evidence. It explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\"><em>The investigator, however, should not prepare false incriminating documents that appear to have been generated through an official source (for example, a crime lab, the FBI). </em>The reason for this is a concern that such falsified documents may find their way into the court system, <em>see State v. Cayward, </em>552 So.2d 971 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1989).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\"><em>[Id. </em>n. 2 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">We hold that law enforcement and the public would best be served by a \u201cbright-line\u201d rule precluding the use of police-fabricated evidence that later finds its way into the trial. Such \u201cbright-line\u201d rules serve to protect the constitutional rights of suspects while providing a clear procedure for police to follow that should produce consistent results. <em>Presha, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 316, 748 A.2d 1108; <em>Hartley, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 287, 511 A.2d 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">We recognize that the rule here invalidates a confession to a murder, yet on balance, the sanctity of our constitutional protections for all remains paramount. As a noted jurist observed: \u201cThe quality of a nation\u2019s civilization can be largely measured by the methods it uses in the enforcement of its criminal law.\u201d Walter V. Schaefer, <em>Federalism and State Criminal Procedure, </em>70 <em>Harv. L.Rev. </em>1, 26 (Nov.1956), <em>quoted in Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 480, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1631, 16 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 727. His cogent observa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>tion was echoed by the former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">We can have the Constitution, the best laws in the land, and the most honest reviews by courts \u2014 but unless the law enforcement profession is steeped in the democratic tradition, maintains the highest in ethics, and makes its work a career of honor, civil liberties will continually \u2014 and without end \u2014 be violated----The best protection of civil liberties is an alert, intelligent and honest law enforcement agency. There can be no alternative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">[J. Edgar Hoover, <em>Civil Liberties and Law Enforcement: The Role of the FBI, </em>37 <em>Iowa L.Rev. </em>175, 177 (1952), <em>quoted in Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 483 n. 54, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1633 n. 54, 16 L.Ed.2d at 729 n. 54.1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">The promulgation of a <em>per se </em>rule validates these common interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">In sum, we hold that the use of police-fabricated evidence to induce a confession that is then used at trial to support the voluntariness of a confession is <em>per se </em>a violation of due process. We deem it in the same class and nature as the physical coercion interdicted by <em>Brown v. Mississippi, supra, </em>the psychological coercion prohibited in <em>Spano v. New York, supra, </em>and the very concerns identified by the Wickersham Report as early as 1931. The trial judge erred in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">We next address the propriety of the stop, search and arrest of defendant after receipt of the anonymous tip. Our consideration of the issue requires a further expansion of the factual premise for the judge\u2019s determination that the stop was proper. These are the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">At 8:19 p.m. on August 10, the police received an anonymous tip that \u201ca black male dressed in dark clothing\u201d was walking near the Centennial Village apartments and was \u201c[ajrmed with a gun and possibly related to the killing the night before.\u201d Officer Mark Toscano of the tactical unit of the Camden Police Department arrived at the scene within minutes. He described the stop of defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-15\">Q. When you got to the area, where did you pull your car up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>A. I pulled my car into Centennial Village, into the center portion. Then Sergeant Merrick called on the radio and said he saw a person walk away from the scene that matched the description.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">Q. Okay. Was Sgt. Merrick in a different location than you were when he was giving this information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">A. Yes. He was in the front of Centennial Village by a parking lot that runs parallel with East State Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">Q. So after getting the radio call from Sgt. Merrick, what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-9\">A. I pulled over, turned around and went back out towards State Street and pulled into the parking lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">Q. And when you pulled into the parking lot, did you see anyone that drew your particular attention?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">A. Yes, ma'am. I saw a black male in dark clothing walking away across the parking lot towards [the] Tenth Street bridge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-13\">Q. Did you see any other pedestrians in that area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-14\">A. No, there was no one else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-15\">Q. And what did you do at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-16\">A. At that point, I called out the window something to the words of, \u201cHey, let me talk to you a second.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-17\">Q. Okay. Did this male that you saw walking away respond in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-18\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-19\">Q. Did he look around at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-20\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-21\">Q. After you called out the window, \u201chey, let me talk to you\u201d or whatever it was, what was the next thing you did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-22\">A. When I didn\u2019t get a response, I turned my spotlight on him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-23\">Q. Were you still in your ear at this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-24\">A. Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-25\">Q. And when you say you turned your spotlight on, how far away was the male from your car at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-26\">A. Approximately thirty feet. Little bit further than where the benches are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-27\">Q. Okay. Can you just describe the spotlight and how much of an area around this man it illuminated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-28\">A. It illuminated the person real bright. It\u2019s about 70,000 candlepower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-29\">Q. When you put the spotlight on this male, did you say anything at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-30\">A. I told him, I \u2014 \u201cstop, let me talk to you,\u201d and I didn\u2019t get a response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-31\">Q. When you say no response, did the male even look around?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-32\">A. No. He walked straight ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Q. Again, at that point was there anybody else in the immediate vicinity you could have been yelling out to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">Q. After attempting to stop the male verbally twice and also with the spotlight the second time and getting no response, what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">A. I stopped my car and positioned it [to] give me some cover. Sgt. Merrick pulled up a little further and exited the car and commanded him to stop, at which point the suspect did stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">Q. So let me ask you this. When you say both you and Sgt. Merrick pulled up, Sgt. Merrick was a little bit in front of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">Q. At the point you pulled up, the male\u2019s back would have been to your car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-12\">A. He was facing away from me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-13\">Q. Facing away from you. How was he facing in relation to Sgt. Merrick?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-14\">A. When Sgt. Merrick issued this challenge, he turned a little bit towards Sgt. Merrick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-15\">Q. Okay. And when you say Sgt. Merrick commanded him to stop, what did he do besides telling him to stop?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-16\">A. He drew his weapon and pointed it at him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-17\">Q. And you say at this point the man did stop?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-19\">Q. Okay. What did you do at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-20\">A. At that time, I nodded over to Sgt. Merrick. We work together. He\u2019s on the tae [tactical] force. He\u2019s my sergeant. He knew I was going to go up and pat him down. As soon as I went up and grabbed him by his hand, [I] put my hands on his waist. I immediately felt a gun. I recognized immediately he had a gun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-21\">Officer Toscano admitted that defendant had not committed any crime prior to Toscano discovering the gun on defendant. Defendant was arrested at approximately 8:30 p.m. and taken to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-22\">In his decision upholding the stop and arrest, the judge relied on our decision in <em>State v. Sharpless, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>440, 715 A.2d 333 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>542, 724 A.2d 802 (1998), and concluded that under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances, for their own safety, certainly the officers had a right to pat-down the defendant.\u201d Although not stating his view as such, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>seemingly relied on <em>Sharpless </em>as articulating a \u201cman with a gun\u201d exception that would permit a stop of an individual whose other actions appeared entirely lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">As we noted in <em>State v. Goree, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 240-42, 742 A.2d 1039 (App.Div.2000), <em>Sharpless </em>involved other furtive behavior occurring before the search that corroborated the \u201cman with a gun\u201d anonymous tip and provided the requisite \u201creasonably articulable suspicion\u201d to warrant a stop and frisk under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Also, subsequent to the denial of the motion to suppress, the Supreme Court of the United States decided <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>266, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>1375, 146 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 254 (2000), wherein the Court eschewed the \u201cman with a gun\u201d rule as providing a sufficient basis for prompting a <em>Terry </em>stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Although defendant here moved for reconsideration of the denial of his suppression motion based on <em>J.L., </em>the trial judge never had the opportunity to address the application of <em>J.L. </em>in the context of this case because defendant withdrew the motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have commented since the decision in <em>J.L. </em>that the anonymous tip cases involving guns and drugs \u201care close and difficult, waffling about in a \u2018no-man\u2019s land\u2019 of nuances.\u201d <em>State v. Richards, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>289, 306, 798 A.2d 136 (App.Div.2002) (quoting <em>Goree, supra, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 244, 742 A.2d 1039). This is another of those nuanced cases, and neither the \u201cnuances\u201d nor the application of <em>J.L. </em>were previously addressed. Additionally, the State offers that this is not an \u201canonymous tip\u201d case, which a careful reading of the record suggests may be accurate. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the officer never identified the source of the information as an anonymous tip, that information was offered in colloquy by the prosecutor and later found its way into the fact-finding by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Even assuming that the information emanated from an anonymous tip, the tip referred to a murder and contained more than the information described in <em>J.L., Goree </em>or <em>Richards </em>as there was reference to a murder as well. <em>Cf. State v. Golotta, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>477, 808 A.2d 135 (App.Div.2002) (upholding suppression where an anonymous tip described erratic driving and the police officers who stopped defendant did not observe such conduct), <em>certif. granted, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>70, 819 A.2d 1186 (2003). Whether such information is of any moment or reflects the \u201cnuances\u201d referred to in <em>Richards </em>and <em>Goree </em>should be addressed in the first instance by the trial judge on remand. This should be accompanied by a full record including the details of the information transmitted to the police. We would be remiss if we did not question the propriety of the State\u2019s minimalist approach in meeting its burden in this case by suggesting in the first instance that the stop resulted from an anonymous tip and thereafter suggesting the availability of more profound proofs to meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Because we reverse the motion to suppress and remand for a new trial, we need not address defendant\u2019s arguments as to either the waiver of a jury on the charge of a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-7 or the propriety of defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">We recognize that our decision barring the use of fabricated evidence effectively denies the right of the State to use defendant\u2019s confession to a murder. However, adherence to constitutional precepts cannot cease simply because the result is unfavorable to law enforcement or, as the trial judge opined, because \u201ca confession often minimizes the need for further police investigation and often leads to conviction, both of which reduce costs to taxpayers.\u201d There is a more significant principle at stake: due process. The United States Supreme Court recognized the issue when it observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The abhorrence of society to the use of involuntary confessions does not turn alone on their inherent untrustworthiness. It also turns on the deep-rooted feeling that the police must obey the law while enforcing the law; that in the end life and liberty can be as much endangered from illegal methods used to convict those thought to be criminals as from the actual criminals themselves. Accordingly, the actions of police in obtaining confessions have come under scrutiny in a long series of cases. Those cases suggest that in recent years law enforcement officials have become increasingly aware of the burden which they share, along with our courts, in protecting fundamental rights of our citizenry, including that portion of our citizenry suspected of crime. The facts of no case recently in this Court have quite approached the brutal beatings in <em>Brown v. Mississippi, </em>297 <em>U.S. </em>278, 56 <em>S.Ct. </em>461, 80 <em>L.Ed. </em>682 (1936), or the 36 consecutive hours of questioning present in <em>Ashcraft v. State of Tennessee, </em>322 <em>U.S. </em>143, 64 <em>S.Ct. </em>921, 88 <em>L.Ed. </em>1192 (1944). But as law enforcement officers become more responsible, and the methods used to extract confessions more sophisticated, our duty to enforce federal constitutional protections does not cease. It only becomes more difficult because of the more delicate judgments to be made\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\"><em>[Spano v. New York, supra, </em>360 <em>U.S. </em>at 320-21, 79 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1205-06, 3 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 1270-71 (1959) (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The rule we enunciate here reflects one of those \u201cdelicate judgments\u201d but recognizes that constitutional protections cannot be compromised by actions that go beyond the bounds of lawful conduct and in the end truly threaten our society\u2019s reliance on a rule of law. We recognize that criminal investigations are not to be conducted on a level playing field. The public interest demands a \u201ctilt\u201d in favor of law enforcement, and the judicial sanctioning of the limited use of police trickery provides such an advantage. But the \u201ctilt\u201d can never become so severe that the Constitution loses its balance. This is what happened here.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-17\"> The circumstances of the arrest and the issues raised in that regard are discussed, <em>infra, </em>at Section II.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b49-18\"> <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b50-18\"> \"A.M.\u201d refers to Inv.
