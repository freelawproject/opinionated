Defendant, a New Jersey resident, instituted an action against plaintiff in California, on behalf of a class of Discover Card credit holders, seeking relief for allegedly improper fees and charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">While plaintiffs appeal was pending before us, we conducted a telephone conference with counsel as a result of communications requesting an adjournment of this action by virtue of a possible settlement in California. The matter was adjourned with the understanding that if the California trial judge approved the settlement, the appeal would be dismissed without prejudice to reinstatement if the trial judge subsequently rejected the settlement after hearing from members of the aggrieved class.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>We have now been advised that on April 10, 2003, the Superior Court of California, <em>County of </em>Orange, granted a motion preliminarily approving settlement of the class action. Plaintiff was directed to mail or cause to be mailed the settlement notice to members of plaintiffs class, and a \u201cFormal Fairness Hearing to determine whether there exists any reasonable basis why the settlement should not be approved as being fair, reasonable, adequate, lawful, and in the best interests of the Plaintiff Class\u201d was scheduled for September 18, 2003. Accordingly, consistent with the parties\u2019 agreement, confirmed by letter of April 25, 2003, we dismiss the appeal, without costs, subject to reinstatement in the event that, after the \u201cFormal Fairness Hearing\u201d in the Superi- or Court of California, the trial judge does not approve the settlement or for any other reason the settlement does not become final.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
