Plaintiff alleged that defendants intentionally inflicted emotional distress and violated the Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-1 to -8, by causing her to suffer psychiatric problems, which ended her active employment with Bristol Myers-Squibb. Essentially, plaintiff asserted that she was retaliated against by her coworkers who ostracized her and gave her an unfavorable performance evaluation after learning that she had reported unethical conduct on the part of certain employees. Following extensive discovery, defendants moved for summary judgment on December 1, 2000. Oral argument on defendants\u2019 motion was heard on May 25, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">On April 22, 2002, Judge Sapp-Peterson filed an opinion finding that none of plaintiffs coworkers\u2019 alleged retaliatory acts were \u201csufficiently severe or pervasive\u201d to have altered plaintiffs conditions of employment in \u201can important and material manner.\u201d 362 <em>N.J.Super. </em>366, 827 A.2d 1173, 2002 <em>WL </em>32136233 (Law Div.2003). Judge Sapp-Peterson also found that there was no factual basis to support plaintiffs claim that Barker engaged in retaliatory conduct. She determined that plaintiff had effectively waived her emotional distress claim by filing her CEPA action pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-8. She also determined that even if there was no effective waiver the alleged disputed actions on the part of the coworkers were not \u201cso extreme and outrageous as to be actionable\u201d to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Lastly, Judge Sapp-Peterson found that there was no underlying wrongful conduct on defendants\u2019 part to support plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>tiff\u2019s claim for punitive damages. On June 21, 2002, following oral argument, plaintiffs motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Plaintiff appeals, raising the following points:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY FOUND THAT THE HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH PLAINTIFF WAS SUBJECTED IN RETALIATION FOR BLOWING THE WHISTLE ON ILLEGAL SPENDING PRACTICES DID NOT CONSTITUTE \u201cADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION\u201d UNDER CEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">CEPA ENVISIONS INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY AND PLAINTIFF HAS ESTABLISHED SUFFICIENT FACTS TO PUT BEFORE A JURY THE ISSUE OF WHETHER BARKER IS LIABLE UNDER CEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">CEPA\u2019S WAIVER PROVISION DOES NOT REQUIRE THE DISMISSAL OF PLAINTIFF\u2019S INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS CLAIM AND THE FACTS ARE SUFFICIENT FOR THAT CLAIM TO GO TO A JURY.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">\n<em>POINT IV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">THE ISSUE OF WHETHER, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES, IS ONE FOR THE TRIER OF FACT AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DECIDED ON SUMMARY JUDGMENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">The facts are set forth at length in Judge Sapp-Peterson\u2019s written opinion, they need not be repeated here. We have carefully reviewed the entire record and considered the arguments of counsel and find no error in the proceedings. Plaintiffs arguments are devoid of any merit necessitating a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E). We affirm for the reasons set forth by Judge Sapp-Peterson\u2019s written opinion of April 22, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
