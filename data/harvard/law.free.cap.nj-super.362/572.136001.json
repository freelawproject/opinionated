A. </em>2C:24-4b(5)(a) for his alleged receipt and subsequent distribution of child pornography, and the fourth-degree crime established in <em>N.J.S A. </em>2C:24-4b(5)(b) for his alleged possession of child pornography. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of both charges. The trial court merged the convictions, and sentenced defendant to a five-year term of imprisonment followed by sex offender registration pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-1 to -19. Appropriate statutory fees, penalties and assessments were also ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">On appeal, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>POINT I </em>BECAUSE IT PROHIBITS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF PROTECTED SPEECH, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-4b IS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY OVERBROAD IN VIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\"><em>POINT II </em>BECAUSE THE STATE\u2019S OWN EXPERTS COULD NOT ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE IMAGES OF CHILDREN IN THIS CASE WERE COMPUTER-GENERATED OR ACTUAL PHOTOGRAPHS, DEFENDANT IS ENTITLED TO A JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL UNDER <em>ASHCROFT </em>V <em>FREE SPEECH COALITION.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\"><em>POINT III </em>BY PERMITTING THE STATE TO PROVE THAT A PERSON DEPICTED IN AN IMAGE WAS A CHILD WITHOUT SUBMITTING EVIDENCE OF ACTUAL AGE, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-Ab(6) UNCONSTITUTIONALLY SHIFTS THE BURDEN TO DEFENDANTS TO PROVE THAT THE MATERIALS THEY POSSESSED DO NOT DEPICT CHILDREN.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\"><em>POINT IV </em>THE DELAY OF MORE THAN TWO AND ONE-HALF YEARS IN BRINGING DEFENDANT TO TRIAL DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\"><em>POINT V </em>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN REFUSING TO DOWNGRADE DEFENDANT\u2019S OFFENSE TO THE THIRD DEGREE FOR SENTENCING PURPOSES.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\"><em>POINT VI </em>BECAUSE THE OFFENSES WHICH DEFENDANT WAS CONVICTED OF DO NOT FALL WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF MEGAN\u2019S LAW, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2b(2), THAT PORTION OF HIS SENTENCE REQUIRING HIM TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER IS ILLEGAL AND MUST BE VACATED. (Not Raised Below)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">The terms of the pertinent provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b in effect at the times charged in the indictment, June 1, 1998 to October 27, 1998, are in the unemphasized portions of the following excerpt. The emphasized language was added to the statute by <em>L. </em>1998, c. 126, effective May 1,1999.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-12\">(5) (a) Any person who knowingly receives for the purpose of selling or who knowingly sells, procures, manufactures, gives, provides, lends, trades, mails, delivers, transfers, publishes, distributes, circulates, disseminates, presents, exhibits, advertises, offers or agrees to offer, <em>through any means, including the Internet, </em>any photograph, film, videotape, computer program or file, video game or any other reproduction or reconstruction which depicts a child engaging in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such an act, is guilty of a crime of the second degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-13\">(b) Any person who knowingly possesses or knowingly views any photograph, film, videotape, computer program <em>or file, </em>video game or any other reproduction or reconstruction which depicts a child engaging in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such an act, including on the Internet, is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-14\">(6) For purposes of this subsection, a person who is depicted as or presents the appearance of being under the age of 16 in any photograph, [or] film, <em>videotape, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number><em>computer program or file, video game or any other reproduction or reconstruction </em>shall be rebuttably presumed to be under the age of 16. <em>If the child who is depicted as engaging in, or who is caused to engage in, a prohibited sexual act or simulation of a prohibited sexual act is under the age of IS, the actor shall be strictly liable and it shall not be a defense that the actor did not know that the child was under the age of IS, nor shall it be a defense that the actor believed that the child was IS years of age or older, even if such a mistalcen belief was reasonable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">No argument defendant raises concerning the meaning and application of the amendments themselves has bearing upon the questions presently before us. The amendments have no impact upon our understanding of how the pre-amendment provisions apply to the case at hand. <em>See State v. Sisler, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>199, 827 A.2d 274 (2003); <em>State v. Brady, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>445, 753 A.2d 1175 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>606, 762 A.2d 220 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The factual bases of the charges were that defendant had distributed and possessed child pornography he posted to and received from the Internet on his home computer. Among the defenses at trial was the contention that the images were not of actual children, but rather of dolls and virtual, eomputer-drawn- and-created images of children. In advancing that argument, defendant relied on <em>Free Speech Coalition v. Reno, </em>198 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir.1999). That decision has since been affirmed <em>sub norm. Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 <em>U.S. </em>234, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>1389, 152 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>403 (2002), in which the United States Supreme Court determined that certain definitional sections of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA), 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2251 to \u00a7 2260, to the extent they criminalized the possession or distribution of virtual images, were overly broad in their abridgements of freedoms protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and, hence, unconstitutional. The Court reasoned that the governmental interest in protecting children did not extend to the use of images in the production of which real children had not been involved. The Court did not consider issues bearing on the process known as \u201ccomputer morphing,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>\u201caltering] innocent pictures of real children so that the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>appear to be engaged in sexual activity.\u201d 535 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1397, <em>152 L.Ed.2d </em>at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The primary questions before us are whether <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24^b is unconstitutional in whole or in part and, if the statute survives constitutional scrutiny, whether the trial court committed reversible error when it instructed the jury relative to what may be termed defendant\u2019s virtual-image defense that, because the State alleged the images possessed and distributed by defendant were of real children, the issue of whether <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(5) is violated by possession and distribution of virtual images of children was not before the jury. We are also called upon to determine whether the trial court erred when it: (1) denied defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case, (2) assertedly shifted to defendant the burden of proving the age of the persons depicted in the images obtained from his computer, (3) denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment based on the alleged violation of his right to a speedy trial, (4) denied defendant\u2019s request to be sentenced as a third-degree offender, rather than as a second-degree offender; and (5) ordered compliance with sex offender registration laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">There is no essential factual dispute. In June and July 1998, the New York State Attorney General\u2019s Office investigated the dissemination of child pornography over the Internet. The investigation centered on \u201cnews groups,\u201d which are Internet sites devoted to specific topics and which were described at trial as functioning \u201c[m]uch like the bulletin board at your local supermarket.\u201d News groups allow a person to post messages and files on a site for other persons to read, and they allow a person to read and download messages and files posted on the site by other persons. The New York authorities were mainly interested in the newsgroup site designated as \u201calt.binaries.pictures.erotiea.preteen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Monitoring that site, the New York authorities determined that a news-group user who identified himself as \u201cmrperfect@big-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>foot.com\u201d made postings to the site on June 16, July 2, and July 5, 1998. The postings contained many images that could be characterized as child pornography. The New York authorities traced the postings to their origin, determining that they had come from defendant\u2019s home computer in New Jersey. At that point, the New York authorities referred the matter to the New Jersey State Police.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">On October 27, 1998, representatives from various law enforcement organizations executed a warrant to search defendant\u2019s home in Bridgewater, seizing defendant\u2019s computer and other equipment, including floppy disks, that were in the room with the computer. Defendant\u2019s pre-trial motion to suppress this evidence was denied. That denial is not in issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The computer\u2019s hard drives and the floppy disks were subsequently examined by Detective Peter J. Wolf of the New Jersey State Police Division\u2019s High Technologies and Computer Vehicles Support Unit. Wolf testified for the State as an expert in \u201ccomputer forensics,\u201d which involves the \u201ctechnical aspects of computer analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Wolf determined that the matter inspected contained about 959 \u201cimage files.\u201d Of those, Wolf determined that approximately 300 files pertained to the child-pornography investigation because he \u201cbelieved that they contain[ed] children in sexually explicit poses or in sexual activities.\u201d At trial, the State introduced fifty-eight of those image files into evidence against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The trial judge precluded the prosecutor from eliciting on direct examination Wolfs opinion about the ages of the persons depicted in the fifty-eight images presented to the jury. The court instructed the jurors that Wolf had not been qualified as an expert for the purpose of determining age and that the jury had to make its own determination about the ages of the persons in the images. On cross-examination, Wolf testified that he had no \u201cfactual knowledge\u201d concerning the age or identity of the persons depicted in the fifty-eight images, and, on redirect examination, he stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>that it \u201creally takes an expert, usually a pediatrician,\u201d to make such a determination of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Wolf testified on direct examination that one of the images in evidence appeared to be a \u201cmorphed photograph,\u201d which is an image made when one \u201ctake[s] two photographs, maybe one of an adult and one of a child, and take[s] the child\u2019s head and put[s] it on the adult body or rearrange^] it in any way you want to arrange it.\u201d On cross-examination, Wolf acknowledged that, through computer \u201cmorphing,\u201d it was possible to \u201ctake a picture of an adult and cause that picture to change into the same recognizable face, but with a younger look to it[.]\u201d Wolf conceded that, by employing computer-morphing software, it would be possible to take a picture of him, an adult, and transform it \u201cinto a picture of ... a four foot tall little boy, but recognizable\u201d as him. Wolf also agreed that morphing is \u201ca process of transforming an image into something that it never was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Wolf was then asked whether it was \u201cpossible in your opinion\u201d that some or all of the fifty-eight images \u201cof the young people\u201d presented to the jury \u201cmight have been morphed images.\u201d Wolf testified that it was \u201cpossible,\u201d but that he did not believe most of the images depicted were morphed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Wolf replied in the affirmative that it was \u201cpossible to create an image entirely on the computer.\u201d He also conceded the possibility that all fifty-eight of the images before the jury could have been \u201ccomputer generated,\u201d but he rejected the premise that a particular image was a \u201cdoll,\u201d stating that the image looked \u201cvery real\u201d to him. On redirect examination, Wolf clarified that his opinion of the image as that of a real \u201chuman being\u201d and not a \u201cdoll\u201d was based on the \u201cshading\u201d of the image and the \u201cexpressions on the child\u2019s face.\u201d On recross-examination, Wolf explained the term \u201ccomputer generated\u201d by agreeing with the following questions: \u201cIf an image is computer generated, then there is no child involved, no actual child involved? Correct? No actual child was photographed?\u201d Wolf stated further, though, that a \u201cchild may have been used as a model\u201d for the computer-generated image.</p>\n<p id=\"AZz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Wolf was also asked on redirect examination about morphed images among the fifty-eight images presented to the jury, and he repeated that \u201csome of them, I believe[ ], were morphed ... but the majority of them I do not believe were morphed.\u201d He stated here, too, that this opinion was based on the lack of distortion in image shading, facial expressions, and body position that is common in morphed images.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">On recross-examination, Wolf agreed there was \u201canother way that images of people can get onto a computer, and that is called computer generation[,]\u201d and he conceded he was not \u201cprepared to say that none of the images in evidence could have been computer generated.\u201d Wolf also acknowledged that he could not make a distinction between an image that is \u201cof an actual child or ... is a computer-generated image.\u201d He disclaimed any ability to \u201ctell whether an image is ... a photograph of an actual person or a computer-generated image.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The State also offered testimony from James Domres of the New York State Attorney General\u2019s Office, who was qualified as an expert \u201cin computer and interrelated Internet-related crimes, investigation and forensics.\u201d Domres testified that, although he made the initial determination that the Internet website files posted by defendant contained child pornography, he had no knowledge of the identity of the \u201cyoung persons in those image files\u201d or of their actual ages. Domres testified, as well, that he had made no determination whether the image files were \u201cactual photographs\u201d or \u201ccomputer-generated images.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Defendant, appearing <em>pro se </em>at trial, testified on his own behalf. He stated that he visited the alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.preteen website and downloaded image files, but, in his opinion, the images were of young adults, not younger teenagers and definitely not children. According to defendant, if there had been any question in his mind concerning whether a particular image contained child pornography, he segregated that image in a separate file labeled \u201ckids\u201d for later deletion from his computer. Defendant also testified that, in his opinion, many of the images he downloaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>were \u201cnot pictures of real children\u201d because \u201cit is not possible to get children to do this.\u201d Defendant did not \u201cbelieve this could possibly be a real child, because no real child would allow this to be done to him or her.\u201d Defendant stated, as well, that \u201cif an image is not that of a real child, then you haven\u2019t done anything to a child. You haven\u2019t endangered a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">On cross-examination, defendant testified that he subscribed to and posted material on the website alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.preteen, along with several similar websites. According to defendant, those websites were \u201ca lot of hype\u201d because the images conveyed \u201cwere not pictures of children, [but rather] they were labeled as such in order to attract the sort of traffic that the news group wanted.\u201d Thus, defendant asserted, the images were either of young-looking adults, or of \u201cdolls.\u201d Defendant insisted that, because \u201cdolls are not children,\u201d there was nothing wrong with viewing images of \u201csimulated kids\u201d or \u201cdolls\u201d \u201cengaged in various prohibited sexual acts or simulated acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">On redirect examination, defendant testified that the images he posted to the website alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.preteen were of adults, not children. Defendant then referred to the prosecutor\u2019s question to him on cross-examination whether \u201cit was okay to look at pictures of dolls or any pictures that weren\u2019t those of ... real children or real people\u201d engaging in sexual acts, responding: \u201cAnd yes, I believe that that is not within the area of ... prohibited pictures. It may be perverted ... but that is not against the statute[,]\u201d <em>ie., N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(5)(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">If possible without frustrating the Legislature\u2019s basic design, we are obliged to construe the statutory provisions at issue here in a manner that saves them from invalidity on constitutional grounds. <em>See Hamilton Amusement Ctr. v. Verniero, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>254, 280, 716 A.2d 1137, 1149-50 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>527 <em>U.S. </em>1021, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>2365, 144 L.Ed.2d 770 (1999). Thus, in the light of <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, supra, </em>535 <em>U.S. </em>234, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403, we must view the pertinent terms of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24^4b(5)(a) and (b) to encompass distribution and possession of only that child pornography which depicts real children, categories of activity that are considerably narrower than encompassed in the definitional provisions of the federal CPPA declared invalid by the United States Supreme Court. It follows that defendant\u2019s basic challenge to the constitutionality of the statute must fail. There is no similarity, for constitutional-evaluation purposes, between the pertinent provisions of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-4b(5)(a) and (b) as so construed and the statutory language of the federal CPPA invalidated in <em>Free Speech Coalition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Passing over the substantive contentions of unconstitutionality, we conclude that the trial judge erred in guiding the jury to a proper understanding of our statute as validly construed and applied. Manifestly, in the light of <em>Free Speech Coalition, N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-4b(5)(a) and (b) may not be interpreted to apply to images comprised of virtual child pornography or pornography involving young-looking adults. Nevertheless, the prosecutor argued in summation for such an interpretation, contending essentially that those provisions apply to \u201ccomputer-generated\u201d images of virtual children. Immediately after the summation, following a sidebar conference, the trial judge, however, delivered a corrective instruction, charging the jury that the State contended that the images at issue were of \u201creal children\u201d and that \u201cit will not be an issue for you with respect to whether or not the statute is violated if there are computer-generated images transmitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The State contends that the result was that the jury was essentially instructed both that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(5)(a) and (b)\u00b0 apply only to real children and that the State must be taken to have contended that the fifty-eight disputed images entered into evidence were of real children. Thus, the argument continues, as applied in this case, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-4b(5)(a) and (b) concerned alleged child pornography involving real children and not virtual children or young-looking adults; and defendant was prosecuted for possessing and distributing images of real children. As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>view the record, however, defendant was unduly limited in defending against the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The factual and procedural particulars are critical. Prior to trial, defendant announced to the court that he intended to argue in his defense that the fifty-eight disputed images seized on his computer were not those of \u201cactual\u201d children. During cross-examination of one of the State\u2019s experts, Domres, defendant elicited testimony that Domres had made no determination whether the disputed images were \u201cactual photographs\u201d or \u201ccomputer-generated images.\u201d During cross-examination of the other State\u2019s expert, Wolf, defendant elicited testimony that all of the disputed images could have been \u201cmorphed\u201d or \u201ccomputer generated,\u201d even though Wolf did not believe that all of them had been so produced. On recross-examination, Wolf testified that he could not say that none of the disputed images were computer generated. Nor was he able to tell whether an image was of an \u201cactual child\u201d or a computer-generated image, and he was not aware of any method of making such a distinction. Additionally, Wolf agreed that, if an image is computer generated, \u201c[n]o actual child was photographed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Testifying in his own defense, defendant stated that many of the images he downloaded were not of real children, but were, instead, images of \u201cdolls,\u201d virtual children, or young-looking adults. In his closing argument, defendant made similar assertions, contending that the images were not of \u201cactual children,\u201d but rather \u201cthey were computer-generated images, or they were well-constructed dolls,\u201d or persons older than sixteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">In her closing argument, the prosecutor addressed defendant\u2019s contention that the pictures were computer-generated images of virtual children, arguing that, because Hollywood cannot make believable computer-generated images of human beings, the images introduced into evidence must have been of real children. Continuing, the prosecutor argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>And that\u2019s the same thing that we have here. Computer-generated images of human beings, they are not there. You won\u2019t find them. And these are not those types of images.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">These are real children, ladies and gentlemen. And I submit to you on that count that [defendant\u2019s] take on the statute would be wrong even if they were computer-generated. Even if it was possible. Because the statute indicates reconstruction or reproduction showing a child. And that I submit to you covers those types of situations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Following summations, the trial judge inquired about the prosecutor\u2019s statement during summation that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(5)(a) and (b) covered computer-generated images of virtual children, asking whether this was the proper ease to address that issue. The prosecutor replied that she thought she had argued forcefully that these were not such images. The court then indicated that it would clear up the matter by instructing the jury that, despite the prosecutor\u2019s summation statement, the State did not contend that defendant should be found guilty if the disputed images were computer generated, but only if the images were of real children.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">At this juncture, defendant inquired, \u201c[t]hen, are you also going to instruct the jury that if they believe that these pictures are computer-generated, that they cannot find the defendant guilty, or they must find him innocent?\u201d The judge declined to give such an additional instruction, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">I suppose it follows that I should give that instruction. I don\u2019t think that is the law---- I am not going to give an instruction on something that I think is an incorrect statement of the law, but I will try to make it clear that the issue here is whether these are images of real children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">Thereafter, the judge instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-12\">I just wanted to clear up one aspect of the State\u2019s summation to you just a few minutes ago. [The prosecutor] did say somewhere in the summation, I believe somewhere in the middle, something about the statute applying to computer-generated images. And I want to make clear to you that the State does not contend in this case that the defendant ... violated the statute by transmitting any computer-generated images or possessing or viewing any computer-generated images. The State\u2019s contention is that these are images of real children contained in the exhibits, and that the violation of the statute has occurred because these are photographs or images of real children that have been possessed and viewed and transmitted or published by defendant____So it will not be an issue for you with respect to whether or not the statute is violated if there are computer-generated images transmitted. You should rely on what the State contends here with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>to what its ease is; in other words, that these are real children. And the defendant contends that the images are not of real children. So that is the issue that you will have to decide tomorrow when you come back to hear my final instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">In delivering his charge to the jury on the following day, the judge instructed: \u201c[Defendant] contends that the State has offered no proof that the images submitted in evidence were of real people.\u201d This was the court\u2019s only reference to defendant\u2019s contention that the disputed images were of virtual children. We hold that, in instructing the jury on the elements of the crimes charged, the court did not adequately distinguish between images of real children and virtual images or focus sufficiently on the State\u2019s proof responsibilities in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">There is much merit in defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred when it declined to instruct \u201cthe jury on what to do if it found insufficient evidence to support the State\u2019s contention that the children in the images were real.\u201d Defendant asserts that, given the court\u2019s instruction, the jury could have viewed his virtual-image defense as \u201cirrelevant under the law and therefore not worth considering,\u201d or it could have \u201cagreed with the defense but nevertheless felt compelled to find [defendant] guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">By initially instructing the jury that \u201cit will not be an issue for you with respect to whether or not the statute is violated if there are computer-generated images transmitted,\u201d the court appears to have removed the issue of computer-generated images from the case, unduly minimizing, if not entirely vitiating, the impact of defendant\u2019s virtual-image defense. In the circumstances, the jury would have been justified in regarding the virtual-image defense to be irrelevant, an eventuality that cannot be tolerated in the face of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Free Speech Coalition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">A burden of proof problem was also created by the trial court\u2019s instructions. Defendant contends that the State failed to prove its case. A line of federal court cases emerging since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>interpreting similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>provisions of the CPPA indicates that, where a defendant asserts that the disputed images entered into evidence on the prosecution\u2019s proffer are of virtual children, the prosecution bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the images were of real children. <em>See United States v. Sims, </em>220 F.Supp.2d 1222, 1226 (D.N.M.2002) (holding, in the light of <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>that the same court had \u201cpreviously erred by ruling that the government did not have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the visual depictions at issue involved real children\u201d); <em>United States v. Oakes, </em>224 F.Supp.2d 296, 301-02 (D.Me.2002) (observing in the light of <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>that, in a trial, the prosecution bears the burden of proving that defendant possessed images of \u201creal children\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Reilly, </em>2002 WL 31307170, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. October 15, 2002) (holding, in the light of <em>United States v. X-Citement Video, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>64, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>464, 130 L.Ed.2d 372 (1994), and <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>that, to support a criminal conviction, \u201ca defendant in possession of materials containing visual depictions of real minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct must know that real minors were the subject of the visual depictions\u201d); <em>United States v. Marcus, </em>239 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>277, 283 (E.D.N.Y.2003) (same); <em>accord United States v. Pabon-Cruz, </em>255 F.Supp.2d 200, 204-08 (S.D.N.Y.2003); <em>People v. Alexander, </em>204 <em>Ill.2d </em>472, 274 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>414, 791 N.E.2d 506, 515 (2003); <em>but see United States v. Kimler, </em>335 F.3d 1132, 2003 WL 21519916, at *6-*8 (10th Cir.2003) (holding that the proof need not be based on expert opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The trial court herein did not instruct the jury with sufficient particularity on the State\u2019s burden of proof when faced with a virtual-image defense. Specifically, the court did not instruct the jury that the State bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the images on defendant\u2019s computer were of real children and that he knew the images were of real children.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The deficiency in the foreshortened instructions that were given is especially critical in the face of the testimony from the State\u2019s expert, Wolf, that all of the images could have been computer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>generated virtual children and that he could not tell the difference between an image of a real child and that of a virtual child. That testimony is a far cry from a discharge of the State\u2019s burden to prove that the images were of real children and that defendant knew they were of real children. And, it rendered as effectively unsupported by the evidence the prosecutor\u2019s assertion in summation that because Hollywood cannot make believable computer-generated images of human beings, the images before the jury must, perforce, have been of real children.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The absence of more precise instructions concerning the State\u2019s burden of proof, especially in the light of Wolfs testimony, denied defendant a fair trial. It may well be, if the State cannot produce better evidence than it proffered at trial, that it cannot prevail given the burden of proof it must shoulder. We will not dismiss the charges, however. Because the rules of law affecting the matter have been in flux and development since the charges were filed, the State should have an opportunity to reorder its proofs to meet the substantive standards so recently clarified definitively.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">We reach this conclusion at least in part on plain error grounds; defendant did not object specifically to the court\u2019s instruction on the burden of proof. <em>See R. </em>1:7-2; <em>R. </em>2:10-2. Under the plain error rubric, an error should not be disregarded on appeal if it was clearly capable of producing an unjust result. <em>See R. </em>2.T0-2. The omissive error in the instruction to the jury concerning the State\u2019s burden of proof, as well as the commissive error in the instruction that it was not an issue for the jury whether <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(5)(a) and (b) could be violated through the use of computer-generated images, were in combination, if not each separately, clearly capable of producing an unjust result because the jury was not as well-informed, specifically, as it should have been on the elements the State was required to prove and the standard of proof which governed. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction must be reversed on this basis and the matter remanded for retrial with more comprehensive jury instructions reflecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>effect of <em>Free Speech Coalition </em>on the prosecution\u2019s proof obligations in the face of defendant\u2019s virtual-image defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">With this disposition, we need not address separately either defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case, or his appeal from the trial court\u2019s ruling declining to downgrade the second-degree crime to third-degree status for sentencing purposes pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lf(2); and we shall not do so. Although the other sentencing issue is also moot in the light of our disposition, we note the State has conceded that the order subjecting defendant to sex offender registration requirements was erroneous because the statutes under which defendant was convicted are not predicate provisions in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2b(2). Even though we are not required, either, to address the issues raised regarding proof of the age of the children depicted in the material admitted in evidence against defendant, we shall do so in order to provide guidance to the trial court on remand in the likely event those questions arise again.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Defendant argues that \u201c[b]y permitting the State to prove that a person depicted in an image was a child without submitting evidence of actual age, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-4b(6) unconstitutionally shifts the burden to defendants to prove that the materials they possessed do not depict children.\u201d The trial judge wisely eschewed an instruction on the statutory presumption, but the instruction he did give to the jury regarding the determination of the ages of those depicted should have been accompanied by other steps designed to address this problem of proof more comprehensively.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">At the time of trial, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(6) in its entirety provided: \u201cFor purposes of this subsection, a person who is depicted as or presents the appearance of being under the age of 16 in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>photograph or film shall be rebuttably presumed to be under the age of 16.\u201d At trial, the State attempted to have Detective Wolf testify that, in his expert opinion, the fifty-eight images seized from defendant\u2019s computer were of \u201cchildren in sexually explicit poses or in sexual activities.\u201d The court excluded that testimony because Wolf had not \u201cbeen qualified as an expert in determining ... age____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">At that juncture, defendant objected, arguing essentially that, because the State had to prove that the images were of persons under the age of sixteen and because Wolf could not offer such testimony, an essential basis for the child-pornography charges against him was lacking. In response to a question from the court, the prosecutor stated that she was not going to present an expert witness to opine that the persons depicted in the images were children. Instead, the prosecutor stated that \u201c[t]he pictures speak for themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The court then instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">I am <em>going to </em>strike from the record the detective\u2019s last answer to the question that was asked about his opinion regarding children being depicted in the pictures; in particular, any pictures that haven\u2019t been shown to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">First of all, you should rely on the evidence that is actually presented to you, and there were some 58, I think, pictures shown to you over the last hour or so. But this detective has not been qualified <em>by </em>me as an expert in determining the age of the people who are depicted. And ultimately it will be your decision regarding the age of the people depicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">I will tell you right now that under the law, under the statute that I will instruct you on at the end of the case, the relevant age is 16. That is, in order to meet the statutory requirements for depiction of minors, the person who is depicted must be less than 16 years old. So you should disregard the detective\u2019s opinion about how old anybody is and reach your own conclusions regarding the evidence that has been presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Subsequently, at a charge conference, the prosecutor requested that the jury be instructed in accordance with the \u201cpresumption\u201d language of N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4b(6) concerning the ages of the persons depicted in the fifty-eight images. The judge indicated that he would instruct the jury on the issue, but not in terms of a \u201cpresumption\u201d because such an instruction would run afoul of the limitations articulated in <em>N.J.R.E. </em>303.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Defendant then argued that, if the jury was permitted to determine the ages of the persons in the images based only on the jurors\u2019 perceptions and impressions, the State would be relieved of the burden of proving the essential element that those persons were under sixteen years of age. The judge rejected defendant\u2019s argument, reasoning that use of the images themselves was an acceptable alternative means to the use of expert opinion for the State to prove the ages of the persons depicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Later, at another charge conference, defendant objected to the proposed instruction concerning proof of the ages of the persons depicted in the images that had been received in evidence. The proposed instruction recited that the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that those persons were under sixteen years of age, and it also informed the jurors that they could base their findings on that issue on their own perceptions of the images themselves. Defendant argued that these two statements were \u201cdirectly contradictory.\u201d The judge disagreed, indicating again that the images themselves provided an alternative means for the State to prove the ages of the persons depicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Subsequently, defendant objected to the prosecutor\u2019s summation statement that the State was not required to prove the birthdate of each person depicted in the fifty-eight images. The judge overruled defendant\u2019s objection, indicating that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(6) implicitly provided that such specificity in proof of age was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">In his charge to the jury, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">The use of the word \u201cchild\u201d in this statute <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b] means any person under 16 years of age. The State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the child in any particular photograph or reproduction or reconstruction was under 16 years of age at the time of the prohibited sexual act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">If you determine that a person who is depicted appears to be under the age of 16 or is depicted as being under 16, then you may, but you are not required to, regard the appearance of the person as sufficient evidence of the person being less than 16 years old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">You should remember, however, that the State bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt based on all the evidence that the person depicted is less than \u00cd6 years old.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Defendant asserts that the instruction \u201cpursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(6)\u201d shifted to defendant the burden \u201cto prove that he ... did not possess or distribute images of children,\u201d with the result that defendant \u201cwas convicted despite no proof ever having been submitted to the jury as to actual age[s]\u201d of the persons depicted in the fifty-eight images.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">On the record before us and in the light of the arguments advanced by the parties, we reject the argument that expert testimony was necessarily required to prove the ages of the children depicted in the images at issue. The trial judge correctly avoided the pitfalls of charging the jury in accordance with the presumption established in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(6). And, at no point in the instructions that were given did the court shift the burden of proof on the issue of age from the State to defendant. Indeed, the instructions given stated with clarity that the State bore the burden of proving the ages of those depicted as well as the other issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Moreover, though the State did not provide direct proof of the birthdates of the persons depicted in the images, as defendant unsuccessfully proposed it should, the State did present evidence to the jury to prove the ages of those depicted. That evidence consisted of the fifty-eight images proffered and received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">We are mindful that proof of a person\u2019s age by his or her appearance alone is a questionable practice. <em>See State v. Koettgen, </em>89 <em>N.J.L. </em>678, 683, 99 <em>A. </em>400, 402 (E. <em>&amp; </em>A.1916) (observing that \u201c[i]t is a matter of common knowledge, derived from observation and experience, that there is nothing more uncertain and highly speculative than that of attempting to fix the age of a person by his or her appearance\u201d); <em>Laurino v. State Div. of Alcoholic Bev. Control, </em>81 <em>N.J.Super. </em>220, 226, 195 A.2d 306, 309 (App.Div.1963) (noting that \u201cdetermining the age of a person by his appearance is most often very speculative\u201d). In the instant matter, even the State\u2019s witness, Detective Wolf, remarked that \u201cit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>really takes an expert, usually a pediatrician\u201d to determine a child\u2019s age from the images presented in a child-pornography case.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Notwithstanding the potential pitfalls, we are constrained to observe that, in particular circumstances, determinations of an age threshold-based on outward appearance alone can be seen to be as valid an exercise of common knowledge as of expert opinion. Whether or not a person is older or younger than sixteen years of age may well be easier to determine than a precise age. We cannot conclude that such evaluations are always, in the terms of the standard test, \u201cbeyond the ken of the average juror[,]\u201d <em>DeHanes v. Rothman, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>90, 100, 727 A.2d 8, 13 (1999), or that experts are invariably better equipped than laypersons are to make the judgment based on appearance alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">\u201cLike any other fact, age is, of course, for the determination of the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Carlone, </em>109 <em>N.J.L. </em>208, 211, 160 <em>A. </em>551, 552 (Sup.Ct.1932). \u201c[W]hether the age of a model in a child pornography prosecution can be determined by a lay jury without the assistance of expert testimony ... must be determined on a case by ease basis.\u201d <em>United States v. Katz, </em>178 F.3d 368, 373 (5th Cir.1999). If the disputed images in such a case depict either very young child-models or older \u201cmodels of sufficient maturity,\u201d expert testimony will not be required because a layperson can plainly make the determination whether the person so depicted is younger than sixteen. <em>Ibid. </em>However, when the persons depicted in the images approach sixteen years of age, \u201cexpert testimony may well be necessary to \u2018assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Fed. R.Evid. </em>702). <em>See United States v. Fox, </em>248 F.3d 394, 409 (5th Cir.2001), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>535 <em>U.S. </em>1014, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 152 L.Ed.2d 617 (2002) (upholding admission of photographs into evidence without expert testimony as to age of the young persons depicted); <em>see also United States v. Riccardi, </em>258 F.Supp.2d 1212, 1218 (D.Kan.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">We adopt the rationale of these federal cases, including the implicit requirement that the trial court must examine each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>image to be presented to the jury in order to make discrete assessments, in discharge of its gatekeeping functions, which of the images can be evaluated by the jury on a common-knowledge basis and which require expert testimony to assist the jury in determining whether the person depicted is older or younger than sixteen years of age. <em>See Riccardi, supra, </em>258 F.Supp.2d at 1219; <em>see also United States v. Nelson, </em>38 <em>Fed.Appx. </em>386, 392 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cThere is no requirement that expert testimony be presented in child pornography cases to establish the age of children in the pictures.\u201d); <em>State v. Roberts, </em>796 So.2d 779, 784-85 (La.App.2001)(state law permits trier of fact to evaluate the age of an individual displayed or depicted in an offensive image). Moreover, we emphasize that, irrespective of how the State chooses to prove the age element, when the trial court addresses the age issue in its instructions to the jury, the judge must specifically instruct the jury that the State bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the person depicted in each image to be used as a basis for conviction is less than sixteen years of age. The judge must charge the jury that speculation about age is not permitted, but rather that the jury must be persuaded by the evidence that, in each instance, the sixteen-year age threshold has been proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The final question which must be addressed is whether the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial, by reason of a \u201cdelay of more than two and one-half years in bringing defendant to trial[.]\u201d \u201cThe Sixth Amendment protects a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial after arrest or indictment.\u201d <em>State v. Long, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>439, 469, 575 A.2d 435, 449 (1990). In <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 <em>U.S. </em>514, 530, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2182, 2192, 33 L.Ed.2d 101, 117 (1972), the United States Supreme Court \u201cformulated a four-part test to analyze a defendant\u2019s sixth-amendment speedy trial claim. The enumerated factors are: (1) the length of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>delay, (2) the reasons for the delay, (3) whether and how defendant asserted his speedy trial right, and (4) the amount of prejudice to defendant caused by the delay.\u201d <em>Long, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 470, 575 A.2d at 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">On March 6, 2001, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, alleging that he had been waiting two and one-half years since his arrest to be tried on the charges against him and that the delay constituted a denial of his right to a speedy trial. After hearing argument, the judge issued a comprehensive oral decision in which he applied the <em>Barker </em>test to defendant\u2019s speedy-trial claim and determined that no constitutional violation had occurred. In denying defendant\u2019s motion, the judge held, in sum, that the delay had not been unreasonable given the unique circumstances of the case and that defendant had not been unduly prejudiced by that delay. There was no in error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The judge first reviewed the chronology of the delay between defendant\u2019s arrest on October 27, 1998, and the anticipated trial date of May 7, 2001, dividing the time into discrete periods of delay which the court attributed to the State, defendant, or the court system. Defendant concedes that the judge\u2019s apportionment of times to the various periods is \u201creasonably accurate\u201d and he \u201cdoes not challenge the court\u2019s findings in this respect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">According to the judge, defendant was arrested on October 27, 1998, and was indicted on March 30,1999, five days after the State Police \u201cHigh Tech Unit\u201d completed its examination of defendant\u2019s seized computer files. Defendant was to be arraigned on May 18, 1999, but his arraignment was delayed until July 23, 1999, so that his attorney could obtain a \u201ccomputer expert.\u201d Shortly thereafter, defendant filed a suppression motion originally returnable on September 23,1999, but which was delayed until October 18,1999, because of the prosecutor\u2019s illness. To that date, about one year had passed since defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">The court contemplated a trial date in January 2000, but that plan was thwarted by the unavailability of State witnesses. Trial was then scheduled for March 13, 2000. However, shortly before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>that trial date, the State requested and received an adjournment because its computer expert at the time required treatment for cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">That expert was apparently back at work at some point during the summer of 2000, and the court attempted to schedule trial for the early fall months. However, the prosecutor had been assigned to a \u201cthree-defendant murder case\u201d during that season, and was not available. Additionally, the court itself experienced \u201cscheduling problems\u201d in the later months of 2000, which prevented setting a trial date during that period. At this juncture, about two years had passed since defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">In late 2000, defendant moved to represent himself at trial and, on December 8, 2000, the court conducted a hearing and granted defendant\u2019s motion to proceed <em>pro se. </em>The court set a trial date of January 29, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">At a status conference in early January 2001, the State revealed that its expert had had a relapse, required a lung transplant, and was also suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease. The State requested an adjournment to obtain another computer expert. The court granted the request and scheduled trial for May 7, 2001, which was about thirty months after defendant\u2019s arrest and about twenty-five months after his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Also in early January 2001, defendant had stated that he was \u201cready for trial\u201d and \u201cwanted it to occur sooner rather than later.\u201d This was his first assertion of his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Considering the first element of the four-part <em>Barker </em>test, the length of the delay, the judge determined that the twenty-five-month period between indictment and trial was a factor that, facially, weighed in defendant\u2019s favor. However, when the court addressed the second factor, the reasons for the twenty-five-month delay, it determined that the delay was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Defendant contends that the multi-month delay attributable to the illness of the State\u2019s initial expert was not properly substantiated because there was no proof that he was an \u201cessential\u201d witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>or that the State could not have replaced him in a more timely fashion. The judge concluded that, because it was difficult for the State to obtain computer experts, the six-to-ten-month delay occasioned by that illness was not unreasonable or inappropriate in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Defendant also attacks the judge\u2019s reasoning concerning the delays caused by the prosecutor\u2019s illness in the fall of 1999, the unavailability of State\u2019s witnesses in early 2000, and the prosecutor\u2019s scheduling problems because of the murder trial in the fall of 2000. The judge determined that these \u201cfive or so months of delays\u201d were \u201cpurely attributable to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office,\u201d but were not unreasonable, either, in the extant circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Defendant contends that, because the five-month delay was in no part due to any action by him, it should inure to his benefit in any speedy-trial analysis. There is merit to the argument as framed, but it fails when considered against the remaining two <em>Barker </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The third <em>Barker </em>factor bears upon \u201cwhether and how defendant asserted his speedy trial right.\u201d <em>Long, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 470, 575 A.2d at 450. The judge acknowledged that defendant had done so in January 2001, but noted that this occurred \u201cmore than two years after the date of the initial arrest\u201d in October 1998. Thus, defendant waited a long time before asserting his speedy-trial right, a circumstance weighing against any determination that the right was violated, especially in light of the fact that trial began only about four months after the first assertion of the speedy-trial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The last <em>Barker </em>factor concerns \u201cthe amount of prejudice to defendant caused by the delay.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The judge recognized that defendant had suffered the prejudice inherent in having \u201cthis kind of indictment hanging over his head for a period of some two and a half years,\u201d but determined that such prejudice was \u201cnot of sufficient weight to overcome the other factors in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Defendant conceded at the hearing that the delay in his trial had not caused him prejudice through the \u201closs of witnesses\u201d or evidence, and he conceded further that the only prejudice he had suffered was the \u201cpersonal hardship\u201d of having the crime \u201changing over\u201d him for the preceding two years. While the hardship on defendant ought not to be minimized, it is clear that the delay had no adverse impact on his ability to defend. Thus, we conclude the judge properly weighed the \u201cprejudice\u201d factor in the <em>Barker </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Defendant now contends that he suffered a \u201closs of memory\u201d concerning the facts of his case because of the length of the delay, and that his ability to defend himself was impaired by that loss. Defendant failed to raise the issue of a possible loss of memory before the trial court on the motion or during trial, however. Therefore, we will not consider that argument. <em>Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142, 145 (1973) (\u201cIt is a well-settled principle that our appellate courts will decline to consider questions or issues not properly presented to the trial court when an opportunity for such a presentation is available \u2018unless the questions so raised on appeal go to the jurisdiction of the trial court or concern matters of great public interest.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The delay in defendant\u2019s trial date can be viewed as having benefitted him to some extent. It provided him with a virtual-image defense to the crimes charged against him which was not so clearly available at the time of arrest or indictment. That defense at trial in May 2001, emanated from the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Free Speech Coalition, </em>which came to be affirmed by the United States Supreme Court about one year after trial. The Ninth Circuit decision was handed down on December 17, 1999, more than one year after defendant was arrested and more than eight months after he was indicted. Around the time the Ninth Circuit rendered its decision, however, the Eleventh Circuit held that such a defense was not maintainable. <em>See United States v. Acheson, </em>195 <em>F.3d </em>645, 650-51 (11th Cir.1999). By the time of trial, the Fourth Circuit had also rejected it. <em>See United States v. Mento, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>231 F.3d 912, 920-21 (4th Cir.2000), <em>vacated, </em>535 <em>U.S. </em>1014, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 152 L.Ed.2d 617 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Nevertheless, the first year of delay in defendant\u2019s trial effectively benefitted him by opening up an avenue of defense supported by some case law. That tangible benefit must be weighed against defendant\u2019s assertions of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The trial court, did not err in its consideration and application of the four <em>Barker </em>factors in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy-trial grounds. The trial court\u2019s rationale in evaluating the separate periods of delay and their practical effects was sound. The delay in bringing defendant to trial did not prejudice his ability to present a defense. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on speedy-trial grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part; remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
