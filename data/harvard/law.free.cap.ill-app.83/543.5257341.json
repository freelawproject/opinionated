As to these claimed damages some correspondence took place between the parties, the claim being asserted upon one side and denied upon the other.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-3\" pgmap=\"549\">The statement of account referred to was dated June 18, 1897, and on June 21, 1897, appellants returned it to appellees with a notation on the bottom of it as follows: \u201c Less 10,000 yds. at 1 ct.,$ 100.00,\u201d and accompanied it with their bank check for $206.57, and the following letter:</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-4\" pgmap=\"549\">\u201c Chicago, June 21, 1897.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AfK\" pgmap=\"549\">Messr\u00e1.

We decline to accept the adjustment. You have no right to make these deductions. There is no legal and equitable cause for it. We have referred the matter to Mr. Spurr to communicate the matter to you, with the hopes that his explanation will enable you to see it in the proper light and that you will adjust it. We further instructed him relative to the contingency of your refusing to do so. Yours respectfully,</summary><summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-13\" pgmap=\"549\">J. H. Lane &amp; Co.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-14\" pgmap=\"549\">Appellants made no reply to this last letter. Appellees had the check certified by the bank upon which it was drawn, and passed the amount of the check to the credit of appellants. Within a few days thereafter, Mr.. Spurr, an agent for appellees, called on appellants and stated that the deduction of $100 would not be allowed, and that he, Mr. Spurr, ivas instructed to collect the $100.</summary><summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-15\" pgmap=\"549(31) 550(94)\">The plaintiffs (appellees) offered to prove that if Mr. Spurr were present at the trial in this case he would testify that during the conversation Mr. Lang (one of the appellants) said the reason they had deducted $100 from their remittance was because of the damage they had sustained by the non-fulfillment of their order of March 30, 1897, to which Mr. Spurr replied that the reason that the order of March 30, 1897, was not filled was because they had been delinquent in paying their prior bills, but that Mr. Lang then said that he would give $70 in payment of the balance of the account, to which Mr. Spurr replied that he did not have authority to settle for less than $100.</summary><summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\" pgmap=\"550\">Defendants (appellants) admitted that if Mr. Spurr were present he would testify as above stated, but objected to the introduction of the above statement, on the ground that it is incompetent and inadmissible, because the conversation relates to an offer of compromise.</summary><summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\" pgmap=\"550\">A witness for appellees testified that he was in the employ of appellees and had a conversation with Mr. Lang, of appellants\u2019 firm, in regard to the matter in dispute, subsequent to the time the dispute arose, and a week or ten days subsequent to the receipt of the check. The substance of his testimony, shown by the abstract, is as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-7\" pgmap=\"550\">\u201c I met Mr. Lang on the street and told him I was sorry the difficulty\u2014sorry for the controversy\u2014thought we had made more than an equitable proposition to settle the matter at $85; he said that $70 was all that he would remit. * * * He never mentioned the check.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-8\" pgmap=\"550\">Mr. Lang testified for appellants as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-9\" pgmap=\"550\">\u201c Mr. Spurr came to me twice and asked me if it would not be better to settle this matter out of court. I told him that Ave had nothing to settle outside of what was paid, but in order to keep the matter out of court I was Avilling to accept\u2014to stand one-half of the loss. That was, the first conversation, \u00e1nd he told me, \u2018Well, I tell you Avhat I Avill do, Mr. Lang; all I can do is to alloAv you attorneys\u2019 fees.\u2019 I says, \u2018 That depends Avhat attorneys\u2019 fees means.\u2019 He says, \u2018From $10 to $15.\u2019 1 Avould not accept it. A few days after that he came over again. We had the matter talked over again, and I told him, 1 As a matter of friendship betAveen you and I, to settle the matter, I will give yon a check for $70 and call it off, but I don\u2019t oavb you anything.\u2019 \u201d</summary><attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-10\" pgmap=\"550\">Hofheimer &amp; Pflaum, attorneys for appellants.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b551-3\" pgmap=\"551\">Wilber, Eldridge &amp; Alden, attorneys for appellees.</attorneys><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b551-4\" pgmap=\"551\">In order to make an acceptance of the money sent binding as an accord and satisfaction it is necessary that the money should be offered in satisfaction of the claim and the offer accompanied by such acts and declarations as amount to a condition that if the money is accepted it must be accepted in full satisfaction, and such condition must be so clearly expressed that the party to whom it is offered is bound to understand therefrom that if he takes the money he takes it subject to such condition. Fuller v. Kemp, 138 N. Y. 231; Preston v. Grant, 34 Vt. 201; McDaniels v. Lapham, 21 Vt. 222; Rockford, Rock Island &amp; St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Rose, 72 Jules Lang, D. Walter Evans and D. M.

When a tender or offer is thus made, the -party to whom it is made has no alternative but to refuse it, or accept it upon such condition. If he takes it, his claim is canceled, and no protest, declaration or denial of his, so long as the condition is insisted on, can vary the result.\u201d Preston v. Grant, 34 Vt. 201.</blockquote> <p id=\"b552-3\" pgmap=\"552\">The Court of Appeals of New York (Fuller v. Kemp, 138 N. Y. 231), adopting the language, as above, from Preston v. Grant, adds:</p> <blockquote id=\"b552-4\" pgmap=\"552\">\u201c To make out the defense the proof must be clear and unequivocal that the observance of the condition was insisted upon, and must not admit of the inference that the debtor intended that his creditor might keep the money tendered, in case he did not assent to the condition upon which it was offered.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b552-5\" pgmap=\"552\">The party seeking to settle for a less sum than is claimed to be due, must, by his words and conduct when making the offer, clearly inform the other of what is sought and expected. The transaction must be such as that the. condition is as plain as the tender, so that the acceptance of the tender will involve the acceptance of the condition. In other words, the tender and the condition must be incapable of severance, for the law will not otherwise draw the inference that the acceptance of the tender involves the acceptance of the condition.</p> <p id=\"b552-6\" pgmap=\"552\">The case of Ostrander v. Scott, 161 Ill. 339, relied upon by appellants, in no manner opposes the rules we have stated, but is in effect in support of them, for it rests upon what it finds, from the facts there existing, was necessarily the understanding and agreement of the parties.</p> <p id=\"b552-7\" pgmap=\"552(168) 553(17)\">The question in that case, as in this one, goes to the effect to be given to the words and acts of the party in connection with the check. There the check had written upon its face, \u201c in full of all demands to date.\u201d Here the check contained no words limiting its effect. There the letter enclosing the check stated that it was\u201c in full of account to date.\u201d Here the letter enclosing the check says it is \u201c in payment of bills\u201d of specified dates, \u201c less $100 on 10,000 yards at one cent.\u201d There was also in the Ostrander case an element wholly lacking here. There, as soon as the debtors were informed that the check was not accepted by the creditors in full payment, but only as a credit on account, the debtors wrote that the check was sent in full settlement, and - demanded it be returned if not so accepted. Here appellants made no reply to appellees\u2019 letter declining to assent to the deduction, but did afterward offer to pay $70 of the $100 that had been deducted.</p> <p id=\"b553-4\" pgmap=\"553\">It would require us to unwarrantably extend the Ostrander ease to hold that this case is parallel to that one. The present case is much more like that of Lapp et al. v. Smith, 83 111. App. 203, where numerous authorities are reviewed. The case of Hamilton v. Stewart, 31 S. E. Eep. (Ga.) 184, is cited by appellants, but that, like the Ostrander case, turns upon the payment being made upon the condition of its acceptance in fulL We are unable to hold that even though this case stood without any question of waiver by appellants, we could reverse the judgment. The learned circuit judge before whom the case was tried, held certain propositions of law which were most favorable to appellants\u2019 contention, but held properly, as a modification of one of them, that the debtor might waive his right to have the payment made by him applied in satisfaction, and that the evidence, shows in this case there was such a waiver. We fully concur there was such a waiver. The testimony clearly shows what amounts to a waiver by the appellants of any rights they claimed, to have the check applied in full payment. That testimony, even though incompetent in so far as it showed an offer of compromise, was clearly competent to show there was no condition attached to the acceptance of the check, or if there were, that the condition was waived.</p> <p id=\"b553-5\" pgmap=\"553\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
