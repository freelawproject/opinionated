It is in accordance with my understanding that under the agreement I have made with Mr. Skinner and yourself for the purchase of Whitebreast Fuel Company stock, I will buy the stock of either of you, should one wish to sell and the other not. You can attach this letter to the contract, which I think will be sufficiently binding on me. Have you been offering your stock for sale in Hew York ? Mr. Tobey, a stock broker, has' been hawking the stock around. The amount, 325 shares, leads me to believe it is either yours or Mr. Skinner\u2019s. I trust I am mistaken, for it seems to me it Avould have been courteous for you to let me know if you desired to sell the stock. As I told you, there is no actiATe market for the stock, there having been none offered for \u25a0sale, and under the present condition of the money market, there are few, if any, investors. It is possible Mr. Tobey was simply trying to see what he could get for the stock without intending to sell it, but in a close corporation like ours, not widely known, it does not do the stock any good to have it hawked around as he has done.</summary><summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-5\" pgmap=\"462\">Yours truly,</summary><summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-6\" pgmap=\"462\">J.

John Skinner and Wm. H. Emerson, dated Aug. 1, 1890, you have agreed to purchase from them 650 shares of the Whitebreast Fuel Co.\u2019s stock, which ivas originally given them in partial payment for purchase of mines, and are in certificates, as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-9\" pgmap=\"462\">Ho. 102, 100 shares.</summary><summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-10\" pgmap=\"462\">Ho. 103, 100 shares.</summary><summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-11\" pgmap=\"462\">Ho. 104, 100 shares.</summary><summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-12\" pgmap=\"462\">Ho. 183, 25 shares.</summary><summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-13\" pgmap=\"462\">Ho. 105, 100 shares.</summary><summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-14\" pgmap=\"462\">Ho. 106, 100 shares.</summary><summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-15\" pgmap=\"462\">Ho. 107, 100 shares.</summary><summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-16\" pgmap=\"462\">Ho. 184, 25 shares.</summary><summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-17\" pgmap=\"462\">The contract provides that in case they desire to avail themselves of the option to sell, they are to notify you on or before August 1, 1891, and accordingly, per authority Arnsted in me by power of attorney, I hereby notify you that they desire you to purchase and pay for, August 1, as per contract, the 625 shares of stock. The same will be-forwarded to you through our bank, the Hational Bank of the Republic. Signed by G. B.

This he refused to do upon the ground that the contract was illegal, being merely a contract for an option, and upon the further ground that Skinner had engaged in the coal business after the making of the contract in question.</summary><summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-4\" pgmap=\"463\">For breach of the contract by appellee this suit was brought.</summary><summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\" pgmap=\"463\">The only defense relied upon was that the contract was a contract for an option and illegal under the provisions of Sec. 130 of the Criminal Code, and that the notice sent by the attorney in fact of appellants to appellee was insufficient in that it specified 625 shares of the stock instead of 650 shares.</summary><summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-6\" pgmap=\"463\">A jury was waived, and the issues were submitted to the court. The court found the issues for the defendant, appellee. The court held, upon propositions of law submitted, that the notice was sufficient, that appellee having refused to purchase upon the ground that the contract was illegal, the sufficiency of the notice was unimportant, and, in effect, that a recovery could not be had by appellants because the contract for the purchase of the stock was illegal under the provisions of Sec. 130 of the Criminal Code.</summary><summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\" pgmap=\"463\">From judgment upon the finding of the issues for the appellee this appeal is prosecuted by appellants.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-8\" pgmap=\"463\">John S. Winter and Cratty, Jarvis &amp; Cleveland, attorneys for appellants.</attorneys><p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-9\" pgmap=\"463\">Section 130 of the Criminal Code is in derogation of the common law and is highly penal, and hence must be strictly construed. It should not be extended to cases not clearly within its terms. Hall v. Irwin, 2 Gilm. 176, 184; Pickering v. Misner, 11 Ill. 597; Thompson v. Weller, 85 Ill. 197; Chicago v. Kumpff, 45 Ill. 90.</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-10\" pgmap=\"463(19) 464(55)\">The defense is that the parties violated a criminal statute, that is, committed a criminal offense. To sustain such defense it is necessary to make out a case sufficient to convict the parties if on trial under indictment. Germania Fire Ins. Co. v. Klewer, 129 Ill. 599; Sprague v. Dodge, 48 Ill. 142; Harbison v. Shook, 41 Ill. 141; Crandall v. Dawson, 1 Gilm. 556; McConnell v. Del., etc., Ins. Co., 18 Ill. 228.</p><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-4\" pgmap=\"464\">The contract should not be held void unless the parties could be indicted and convicted for making it, since it is the violation of the statute which makes the contract void.</p><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-5\" pgmap=\"464\">The court should not be controlled in construing the contract by any particular phrase or language, but should consider the entire transaction and the two contracts in determining the real intent and agreement of the parties. Minnesota Lumber Co. v. Whitebreast Coal Co.,. 160 Ill. 85.</p><attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-6\" pgmap=\"464\">Chester M. Dawes and Wm. McNett, attorneys for appellee.</attorneys><p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-7\" pgmap=\"464\">The contract for the right to sell the stock back to Osgood was in form a contract for an option to sell within the ordinary meaning of the term \u201c option,\u201d and the definitions given in standard lexicons, and approved in the following cases: Tenney v. Foote, 4 Ill. App. 494, 95 Ill. 99; Schneider v. Turner, 30 Ill. 28; Webster\u2019s Dictionary, the word \u201c option.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-8\" pgmap=\"464\">\u201c Whoever contracts to have, or to give to himself or another the option to sell or buy at a future time any grain or other commodity, stock of any railroad or other company, or gold * * * shall be fined, etc., * * * and all contracts made in violation of this section shall be considered gambling contracts, and shall be void.\u201d 1 Starr &amp; Cur. Stat., p. 791.</p> <opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b464-9\" pgmap=\"464\">Mr. Presiding Justice Sears</author> <p id=\"Acq\" pgmap=\"464\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b464-10\" pgmap=\"464\">But two questions need be considered upon this appeal, viz: first, whether this contract comes within the prohibition of Sec. 130 of the Criminal Code, as a gambling contract, and second, whether the error in the notice of election to sell the stock according to the provisions of the contract will bar a recovery.</p> <p id=\"b465-3\" pgmap=\"465\">In the determination of the first question indicated, we regard the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Wolf v. Nat. Bank, 178 Ill. 85, as controlling. In that case, which was merely a contract of purchase, with privilege of reselling at option of the purchaser, the court said:</p> <blockquote id=\"b465-4\" pgmap=\"465\">\u201c In other words, the bonds were turned over by the bank to the plaintiff at a certain stipulated price, with the distinct agreement that the plaintiff had the right, during the month of January, 1897, to elect whether he would keep them or return them to the bank, and in case he concluded to return the bonds, he was entitled to receive his money back\" with interest. The transaction was one both reasonable and proper, and one not within- or prohibited by the statute. Indeed, it contains no element of a gambling contract.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b465-5\" pgmap=\"465\">In the case here, as in the one cited, the privilege of reselling upon election was made a condition to the original transaction, and without such privilege it is to be concluded from the evidence that the stock Avould not have been accepted by appellants. Indeed, the facts of this case are much stronger for the legality of the contract than were the facts in the case cited; for in this case the giving of the option to resell Avas an incident to an otherwise perfectly valid contract, including many important elements of transfer of other property, etc. Under the authority of Wolf v. Hat. Bank, we hold that the part of this contract granting the privilege to resell is but an incident or condition to a valid contract, and that it is not within the prohibition of the statute.</p> <p id=\"b465-6\" pgmap=\"465\">The only other question to be considered is as to the sufficiency or necessity of the notice.</p> <p id=\"b465-7\" pgmap=\"465(100) 466(116)\">It seems apparent from an inspection of the notice, that it was intended to require a carrying out of the contract to repurchase all of the shares of stock in question, viz., 650 shares, and not merely 625 shares, the number mentioned in the latter part of the notice, and that the latter mention was a mistake. The shares specified in the notice in detail amount to 650, and the expression \u201c the 625 \u201d can only be read intelligently as referring back to the shares specified, i. e., 650. It is contended by counsel that the court can not disregard the mistake and read the notice as intended by the parties. If the mistake was latent, not apparent-on the face of the instrument, and such that it would be necessary to resort to evidence dehors the writing to correct it, the contention would be s ound; but when, from an examination of the writing itself, the intention of the parties can be clearly ascertained, a court of law will give effect to the intention, notwithstanding there may be some language used which, taken by itself, would not authorize the construction adopted. Mercantile Ins. Co. v. Jones, 87 Ill. 199; Holmes v. Parker, 25 Ill. App. 225; Bishop on Contracts, Sec. 383, 397, 420.</p> <p id=\"b466-5\" pgmap=\"466\">We are of opinion that the notice should be construed as an offer of the 650 shares of stock.</p> <p id=\"b466-6\" pgmap=\"466\">But aside from the terms of the notice, we do not regard the sufficiency of it as vital to a right to recover. Appellee, by refusing to carry out his contract upon the ground that it was illegal, and that Skinner had entered into competition with him in the coal business, waived any necessity of a notice under the provisions of the contract. After he had announced his refusal to comply with the contract, a demand would have been of no consequence. Lyman v. Gedney, 114 Ill. 388.</p> <p id=\"b466-7\" pgmap=\"466\">The many decisions in insurance suits as to waiver of notice would seem by analogy to apply here.</p> <p id=\"b466-8\" pgmap=\"466\">The trial court held upon propositions of law submitted, and we think rightly, both that the notice was sufficient and that the necessity of any notice was waived.</p> <p id=\"b466-9\" pgmap=\"466\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed and the cause is remanded, with directions to the Circuit Court to enter a judgment in favor of appellants and against appellee for the amount shown by the evidence to be due to appellants upon the contract, viz., $32,500, with interest at the rate five per centum per annum from October 1, 1891. Reversed and remanded with directions.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
