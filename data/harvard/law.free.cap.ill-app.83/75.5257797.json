The Appellate Court say:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-7\" pgmap=\"80\">\u201c We are not prepared to hold that a defendant, in every civil suit, where there was no arrest of his person or attachment of his goods, may, upon the suit being decided in his favor, turn around and upon the mere allegation that the suit was brought maliciously and without any reasonable and'probable cause, maintain an action on the case against the plaintiff as for malicious prosecution. The drift of the opinion of the court in Gorton v. Brown, 27 Ill. 489, although much that is said is mere obiter dictumand that not from a very comprehensive view of the authorities, is manifestly against such actions being maintainable, except upon the ground of some special grievance.\u201d Paynes v. Donegan, 9 Ill. App. 569.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-8\" pgmap=\"80\">There is no special grievance shown in case at bar. Payment of attorney fees, court costs and more or less injury to credit, are things incident to each and every suit at law. Potts v. Imlay, 4 N. J. L. (1 South.) 330.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-9\" pgmap=\"80\">Also the weight of the decisions in this country and elsewhere is against the maintenance of this sort of suit.

The case was tried by jury and the appellees recovered a verdict and judgment. The appellant brings the case by appeal to this court and insists upon our reversing the judgment on the ground that the Circuit Court improperly directed the jury to return a verdict for the appellees that is contrary to the law and evidence. The declaration charges that the appellees maliciously and without probable cause, prosecuted two civil suits in the Circuit Court of McLean County, Illinois, against the appellant, in both of which he defeated them and obtained a judgment against them for costs; and that the appellant was put to great expense and attqrneys fees in defending the suits for which he claims damages. The appellees interposed pleas of not guilty, upon which issue was joined..</p> <p id=\"b81-5\" pgmap=\"81\">When all the evidence was in, on their motion, the court directed the jury to return a verdict for the appellees. And in this it committed no error, because the declaration and evidence both failed to show that the appellant was arrested or any of his property seized in the suits in question; nor did they disclose that the appellant had suffered any special damages on account of those suits, beyond the expense and trouble attendant upon defending them; so that he was not entitled to recover a verdict or judgment on the pleadings and evidence, as is expressly held in Smith v. Michigan Buggy Co., 175 Ill. 619.</p> <p id=\"Asy\" pgmap=\"81\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
