Therefore, roads within the limits, if they belong to the borough at all, belong to it by force of the provisions in the charter, and not by virtue of the apportionment by the commissioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-10\">2. Whatever may be the proper construction and effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the seventh section of the charter of said borough, considered by itself, yet the resolution of the general assembly, passed May, 1852, repealing the charter of the Windham and Coventry turnpike company, taken in connection with said borough charter, clearly places upon the borough the liability of maintaining that portion of said road which lies within its limits.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-5\"><em>J. H. </em>Carpenter, <em>for the </em>plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-6\">I. The Willimantic borough charter treats only of highways, and says nothing of turnpike roads. The road upon which the repairs in question were made at the time of the incorporation of the borough of Willimantic, was a turnpike road, owned and repaired by the Windham and Coventry turnpike company, and used by the public only as they paid tribute to said turnpike company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-7\">II. The legislature, in providing for the apportionment of highways between said borough and the town of Windham, in said borough charter, took into the account highways only, and such as the town of Windham were then liable to repair. They did not intend to provide for the repairs of said turnpike road when the charter thereof should be repealed. Sh<em>erwood </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>18 Conn. R., 32. 7th Sect. of the borough charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-8\">III. By the act of 1852, repealing the charter of the Wind-ham and Coventry turnpike company, the town of Windham is made liable for repairs on that portion of said turnpike road within the limits of said Windham. The borough of Willimantic had no notice of that proceeding before the legislature, and could not of course be affected by it. <em>Sherwood </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>18 Conn. R., 44.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-9\">IV. The town of Windham had a right to repair this turnpike if the charter thereof had not been repealed. Rev. Stat., 606.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b98-10\">Hinman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4X\">This was an action for work and labor upon one of the highways in the town, done at the request of the selectmen. The town being bound to keep all the highways <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>in its limits in sufficient repair, except only such as belong to some particular person or corporation to repair; and the selectmen being the general agents of the town to manage affairs of this sort, the plaintiff has an undoubted right to recover, unless it appears that some other person or corporation was bound to maintain and keep in repair the particular highway upon which the work was performed. This highway is also within the limits of the borough of Willimantic, and by the charter of the borough it was made the duty of that corporation to keep in good and sufficient repair all the highways which were open and within its limits at the time it was granted, (1833); and the claim is, that under this provision of the charter, the borough, and not the town ought to repair this road. If this were so, it would be rather ungracious to refuse to pay for work done at the request of their selectmen, and apparently for the benefit of the town, unless the plaintiff knew that it was not the duty of the town to repair the road. But we need not examine the question, whether the town would be liable in such a case, because we are all satisfied that the town, and not the borough, is bound to maintain this highway. At the time the borough-charter was granted, the highway was a part of the Windham and Coventry turnpike road, originally built and then maintained by the turnpike company. The charter of that corporation was repealed in 1852, and their road was discontinued as a turnpike, and it was provided that thereafter said road should be and\u2018remain a part of the public highway in the respective towns in which it was situated. We think, therefore, this was not a highway open in 1833, within the meaning of the borough-charter, and that it only became such on the repeal of the turnpike company\u2019s charter in 1852. In one sense, a turnpike road is an open highway, but it is not a town highway, and the clause of the charter which refers to highways then open, we think obviously means -only such ordinary town highways as the town were then bound to maintain and repair. It was not intended to apply to turnpikes, and thus shift the burden of repairing them from the turnpike corporation to the borough. Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>was it intended that all future highways should belong to the borough to maintain, merely because they might be within the limits of the borough. This is evident from the provision that was made for an apportionment of them between the borough and the town. The legislature, instead of continuing the liability on the part of the town to maintain all the highways within its limits, chose to excuse the inhabitants of the borough from the payment of any portion of the ordinary town highway taxes, and to throw a fair proportion of the town highways upon the borough to maintain. Accordingly, the highways then open and within the borough were assigned to the borough, and provision was made for an apportionment, according to the assessment lists of the inhabitants of the borough and the town, at stated periods thereafter, of other highways. If, therefore, the burden should become unequal, in consequence of a change, relatively, in the assessment lists of the borough and of the town, the inequality is at all times subject to a regulation by which it can be corrected. We are satisfied, therefore, that there was no error in the rulings of the superior court, and a new trial is not advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In this opinion, the other judges, Storrs and Ellsworth, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">New trial not granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
