Florida, alleging that the appellant, Law Offices of David J. Stern (\u201cStern\u201d), a law office engaged in debt collection, violated \u00a7 1692g by failing to give appropriate notice as required by statute. The Bankruptcy Court, in a lengthy opinion and order, found that Stern had violated the Act, granted Martinez\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denied Stern\u2019s motion, and granted judgment to Martinez for $1,000 plus cost and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-17\">Stern appealed to the District Court, which affirmed with a full opinion. On motion for rehearing, Stern suggested that the District Court erroneously utilized a clearly erroneous standard in reviewing the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision. The District Court denied the petition, holding that whether it applied a clearly erroneous standard or a <em>de novo </em>review standard, the result of the appeal would be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-18\">The issues in this case have been clearly and carefully examined at length and disposed of by the opinion of the Bankruptcy Court, the opinion of the District Court, and the District Court order denying the petition for rehearing. We see no error, and we affirm on the basis of the opinions and judgments of the Bankruptcy Court and the District Court, and we suggest that they be published in the West Bankruptcy Reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-19\">The decision of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
