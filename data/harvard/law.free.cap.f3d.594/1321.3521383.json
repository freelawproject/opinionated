In both instances, the district court held that the Occupational Safety and Health Act (\u201cOSH Act\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651-78, preempted a section of the Ordinance mandating wind load standards for tower cranes and hoists.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Considering these appeals together, we affirm the district court\u2019s order of summary judgment and grant of a permanent injunction and dismiss the appeal of the preliminary injunction as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-9\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-10\">On March 18, 2008, Miami-Dade County passed and adopted the Ordinance, which set binding regulations for the construction, installation, operation, and use of tower cranes, personnel, and material hoists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-11\">Soon thereafter, several building and contracting groups (\u201cplaintiff-appellees\u201d) sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prohibit enforcement of the Ordinance. In part, plaintiff-appellees argued that the Ordinance violated the OSH Act because it was a non-approved state regulation of occupational safety and health issues governed by federal standards. The OSH Act\u2019s regulations seek to ensure occupational safety by requiring compliance with either the manufacturer\u2019s specifications for erection, maintenance, and operation of cranes and hoists<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or, if those are unavailable, compliance with the determinations of a qualified engineer competent in the field. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.550(a)(1). If a state desires to override these federal occupational safety standards, the state must submit a plan for federal approval. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-16\">After a hearing, the district court temporarily enjoined the enforcement of certain provisions of the Ordinance, concluding that they were preempted by the OSH Act. In relevant part, the district court held the Ordinance\u2019s hurricane wind load standard of 140 miles per hour for tower cranes was a non-approved occupational safety regulation preempted by the OSH Act\u2019s regulations. The County timely appealed this preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-17\">Before we could address that appeal, plaintiff-appellees filed a motion for summary judgment asking the court to permanently enjoin the enforcement of the Ordinance that the district court held was preempted in the preliminary injunction. The district court granted the motion for summary judgment motion and permanently enjoined the County from implementing the wind load standards. The County appealed. We review these appeals together.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-18\">\n<em>II. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-19\">Once an order of permanent injunction is entered, any preliminary injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>merges with it, and appeal may be had only from the order of permanent injunction. <em>Sec. &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n v. 1st Fin. Group of Tex., </em>645 F.2d 429, 433 (5th Cir.1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, the district court\u2019s order of summary judgment granted a permanent injunction, thus merging the preliminary injunction into the permanent injunction and mooting the appeal of the preliminary injunction. Thus, the only issues properly before us are the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and the permanent injunction. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Gilmour v. Am. Nat'l Red Cross, </em>385 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">In <em>Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Ass\u2019n, </em>the Supreme Court reasoned that Congress intended to establish \u201cuniform, federal occupational and health standards\u201d in the OSH Act to avoid \u201cduplicative, and possibly counterproductive, regulation.\u201d 505 U.S. 88, 102, 112 S.Ct. 2374, 120 L.Ed.2d 73 (1992). The Court concluded that \u201cthe OSH Act precludes any state regulation of an <em>occupational safety or health issue </em>with respect to which a <em>federal standard </em>has been established, unless a state plan has been submitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Because it is undisputed that the Ordinance had not been submitted as a state plan, we must determine (1) whether the Ordinance\u2019s wind load standard is an \u201coccupational safety or health issue\u201d and, if so, (2) whether it is preempted because the OSH Act\u2019s regulations establish a superseding \u201cfederal standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">The County first argues that the Ordinance\u2019s wind load standards are not preempted because these standards do not regulate an \u201coccupational safety or health issue.\u201d As the County explains it, because \u201cfalling cranes kill people, workers and non workers alike,\u201d the standards are directed toward <em>public </em>safety during hurricanes and not occupational safety. In other words, the County\u2019s position is that the Ordinance has a singular purpose: to protect public safety and not workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-8\">This argument is not persuasive. Construction job sites are closed to the public and it is undisputed that the Ordinance\u2019s wind load standards regulate how <em>workers </em>use and erect tower cranes during the course of their employment, thus directly affecting occupational safety. Furthermore, the County failed to identify a single incident in which a crane accident injured a member of the general public during a hurricane. To the extent that the Ordinance does provide a benefit to the general public, the regulation is a dual purpose law. A state law is still an occupational standard even if it serves the dual purposes of protecting both public and occupational safety: \u201cThat such a law may also have a nonoccupational impact does not render it any less of an occupational standard for the purposes of pre-emption analysis.\u201d <em>Gade, 505 </em>U.S. at 107, 112 S.Ct. 2374. We therefore conclude that the wind load standards in the Ordinance are \u201coccupational safety or health\u201d regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">The County next argues that the OSH Act does not set a \u201cfederal standard\u201d for wind load in its regulations and therefore cannot preempt the Ordinance. The Code of Federal Regulations defines a \u201cstandard\u201d as \u201cthe adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1911.2(c). Under this definition, a plain reading of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.550 reveals that the OSH Act\u2019s regulations create a federal \u201cstan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>dard\u201d: Employers operating cranes or hoists on a job site <em>must </em>comply with either the manufacturer\u2019s specifications (the vast majority reflect a national consensus and are identical) or the limitations set forth by a competent expert in the field. As the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor testified at the preliminary injunction hearing, the OSH Act \u201cexists at this moment and binds the employer to operate all his cranes on a construction site in accordance with the specifications of the manufacturer.\u201d It is immaterial that the OSH Act\u2019s regulations do not set a uniform wind load standard; every job site with a crane or hoist has a federally mandated safety standard. Thus, we conclude that the OSH Act\u2019s regulations set a federal standard for wind load standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">Finally, the County argues that the OSH Act unconstitutionally delegates legislative power to set federal occupational safety standards to manufacturers by failing to provide an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d to govern the use of this delegated legislative power. <em>See J.W. Hampton, Jr. &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>276 U.S. 394, 48 S.Ct. 348, 72 L.Ed. 624 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">This argument is also unavailing. The OSH Act provides an intelligible principle, directing the Secretary of Labor to adopt standards that are in accordance with the \u201cnational consensus standard.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(a). In this case, the majority of crane manufacturers have reached a consensus by adopting the European Standard, requiring cranes to accommodate a wind load of 93 miles per hour. By adopting these consensus specifications, the OSH Act\u2019s wind load regulations, therefore, conform with an intelligible principle and are constitutionally valid. Faced with the same constitutional challenge, the Sixth Circuit reached the same conclusion: \u201c[T]he requirement that employers comply with manufacturer\u2019s load limits is not an</p>\n<p id=\"A3u\">unlawful delegation because the manufacturer\u2019s limits reflect the \u2018national consensus standard\u2019 that Congress authorized the Secretary to adopt.\u201d <em>Towne Constr. Co. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>847 F.2d 1187, 1189 (6th Cir.1988). The Sixth Circuit further reasoned that \u201cthe physical impossibility of requiring OSHA independently to set safety standards for every industry job classification and industrial substance in the country adequately explains and justifies Congress\u2019s decision to allow the Secretary to adopt the fruits of private efforts as governmental standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190. The Third Circuit used similar reasoning in concluding that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration could rely on information from chemical manufacturers in setting standards. <em>Associated Builders &amp; Contractors, Inc. v. Brock, </em>862 F.2d 63, 68-69 (3d Cir.1988). We therefore refuse to invalidate the OSH Act\u2019s wind load standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-9\">Because the Ordinance contains non-approved occupational safety or health regulations conflicting with a federal standard, the Ordinance is preempted. Therefore, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and the issuance of a permanent injunction are</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1355-12\">. In both cases, the County limits its appeal to whether the Ordinance\u2019s wind load standard is preempted by the OSH Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1355-20\">. The vast majority of manufacturer\u2019s specifications in the United States reflect a national consensus and require the crane to comply with the European Standard for wind loads of 93 miles per hour.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">. Fifth Circuit decisions rendered prior to October 1, 1981 are binding precedent on this court. <em>See Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
