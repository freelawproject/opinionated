Charles\u2019s estate and his injured relatives sued J&amp;B Tours and several other defendants in the Southern District of Florida,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> asserting various common-law claims and a federal statutory claim under the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30301-08. The Frasers appeal from the district court\u2019s order dismissing their claims against J&amp;B Tours for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b876-18\">J&amp;B Tours is a commercial tour operator, organized under the laws of the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI), that specializes in providing boat charters and recreational water-sports services to foreign visitors. It is owned and operated by two full-time TCI residents and maintains its only offices in that territory. Although the company has no property or official presence in the United States, many of its customers are American tourists. To attract business from the United States and elsewhere, J&amp;B Tours maintains a publicly accessible website (originally designed by a former customer in Pennsylvania) with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>local contact information and descriptions of its services.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">In its efforts to draw customers over the years, J&amp;B Tours has advertised in several publications with circulation in the United States. It once placed an advertisement in Bridal Magazine, an American publication. It also placed a joint advertisement, with local hotels and the TCI Tourist Board, in the Miami Herald, and it has paid for advertising in a magazine distributed on commercial flights from the United States to the Islands. In addition, the company has appeared on an American television show and allowed itself to be listed in travel guides and directories available on the U.S. market.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">J&amp;B Tours has also established a number of business relationships with companies based in the United States. For example, it procured liability insurance through an insurance agent in Florida and has occasionally hired U.S. businesses to provide miscellaneous services to the company and its owners. It is the preferred services provider in the Turks and Caicos Islands for Maritz Company, a St. Louis-based travel company, and it maintains local relationships with TCI hotels owned by American companies. Furthermore, J&amp;B Tours receives a commission for referring its customers to either of two American-owned car-rental companies. Finally, since its founding in 1993, J&amp;B Tours has purchased about half of its boats in Florida.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Although J&amp;B Tours has no employees in the United States, its owners have traveled here frequently, for both business (to arrange company purchases) and pleasure. One of the owners, in fact, is a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport. In addition, the company once sent a maintenance supervisor to attend a five-month course on mechanical repairs in Florida. And on three occasions, J&amp;B Tours sent representatives to the United States to promote its services: first, at a Delta Airlines promotion of the Turks and Caicos Islands in Atlanta, Georgia; second, in St. Louis to establish its relationship with Maritz Company; and third, at a trade show for the tourism industry in Florida. J&amp;B Tours also had a brief promotional agreement with an individual in the Washington, D.C. area, but the arrangement failed to yield any business.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">The <em>Sundance </em>was one of five boats J&amp;B Tours had purchased in Florida from Jerry Smith, a co-defendant in this litigation. The Frasers allege that Smith\u2019s defective design and construction of the <em>Sun-dance, </em>along with J&amp;B Tours\u2019 negligent maintenance thereof, allowed a spark inside the hull of the vessel to ignite fumes surrounding the fuel tank.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The resulting explosion formed the basis for the Frasers\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">J&amp;B Tours filed a motion to dismiss for, among other things, lack of personal jurisdiction. Following oral argument, the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over J&amp;B Tours and granted the motion. The Frasers appeal, arguing that the district court had both general and specific jurisdiction over J&amp;B Tours pursuant to Florida\u2019s long-arm statute and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction <em>de novo. Sculptchair, Inc. v. Century Arts, Ltd., </em>94 F.3d 623, 626 (11th Cir.1996). We accept factual allegations in the complaint as true to the extent that they are uncontested and, in eases of conflict, construe all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor. <em>SEC v. Carrillo, </em>115 F.3d 1540, 1542 (11th Cir.1997). The Frasers assert four bases for personal jurisdiction over J&amp;B Tours, and we address them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">\n<em>A. Florida\u2019s Long-Arm, Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>federal district court in Florida may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant to the same extent that a Florida court may, so long as the exercise is consistent with federal due process requirements.\u201d <em>Licciardello v. Lovelady, </em>544 F.3d 1280, 1283 (11th Cir.2008). We therefore turn to Florida\u2019s long-arm statute to determine whether a Florida court could exercise jurisdiction over J&amp;B Tours in this case. <em>Sculptchair, </em>94 F.3d at 626-27. The Frasers argue that J&amp;B Tours was subject to the district court\u2019s general jurisdiction pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 48.193(2) and, in the alternative, that the court had specific jurisdiction to adjudicate their claims against J&amp;B Tours under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 48.193(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">\n<em>1. General Jurisdiction Under Section 18.198(2)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Section 48.193(2) of Florida\u2019s long-arm statute provides: \u201cA defendant who is engaged in substantial and not isolated activity within this state, whether such activity is wholly interstate, intrastate, or otherwise, is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state, whether or not the claim arises from that activity.\u201d The reach of this provision extends to the limits on personal jurisdiction imposed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Woods v. Nova Cos. Belize, </em>739 So.2d 617, 620 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1999). With respect to general jurisdiction under Florida\u2019s long-arm statute, therefore, we need only determine whether the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over J&amp;B Tours would exceed constitutional bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">\u201cThe exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with due process if the non-resident defendant has established \u2018certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oldfield v. Pueblo De Bahia Lora, S.A., </em>558 F.3d 1210, 1220 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, </em>466 U.S. 408, 414, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984)). The defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum must be \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d to support the exercise of general jurisdiction. <em>Helicopteros, </em>466 U.S. at 416, 104 S.Ct. 1868. We conclude that J&amp;B Tours\u2019 contacts with Florida do not meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">Many of J&amp;B Tours\u2019 contacts with the forum in this case were also present in <em>Helic\u00f3pteros, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that general jurisdiction over the defendant would not lie. In that case, the defendant had purchased eighty percent of its helicopter fleet in the forum and sent its employees there for training. But as the Supreme Court explained, \u201cpurchases and related trips, standing alone, are not a sufficient basis for a State\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417, 104 S.Ct. 1868; <em>accord Consolidated Dev. Corp. v. Sherritt, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number><em>Inc., </em>216 F.3d 1286, 1292 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cMerely purchasing materials, even if done regularly, is not contact sufficient to support personal jurisdiction.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor is an employee\u2019s temporary presence in the forum for training purposes sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 418, 104 S.Ct. 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Unlike the defendant in <em>Helic\u00f3pteros, </em>however, J&amp;B Tours solicited business in Florida as part of its general effort to attract customers from the United States. Nevertheless, \u201c[pjlacing advertisements in a newspaper is not a sufficient connection to the forum for in personam jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Sherritt, </em>216 F.3d at 1292, and we see nothing continuous or systematic about J&amp;B Tours\u2019 limited advertising in Florida. A defendant does not confer general jurisdiction on the courts of Florida by occasionally soliciting business there. <em>Price v. Point Marine, Inc., </em>610 So.2d 1339, 1342 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">With respect to J&amp;B Tours\u2019 website, although we have not established a firm rule for personal jurisdiction in the Internet context, <em>Licciardello, </em>544 F.3d at 1288 n. 8, other courts have recognized that \u201cthe mere existence of a website that is visible in a forum and that gives information about a company and its products is not enough, by itself, to subject a defendant to personal jurisdiction in that forum.\u201d <em>McBee v. Delica Co., </em>417 F.3d 107, 124 (1st Cir.2005); <em>see also, e.g., Trintec Indus. v. Pedre Promotional Prods., </em>395 F.3d 1275, 1281 (Fed.Cir.2005). \u201cThough the maintenance of a website is, in a sense, a continuous presence everywhere in the world,\u201d J&amp;B Tours\u2019 Internet contacts with Florida were \u201cnot in any way \u2018substantial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Revell v. Lidov, </em>317 F.3d 467, 471 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">After considering all of J&amp;B Tours\u2019 Florida contacts in aggregation, we conclude that they are insufficient to afford the Florida courts jurisdiction over claims totally unrelated to those contacts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Due process concerns therefore preclude the exercise of general personal jurisdiction over J&amp;B Tours under Florida\u2019s long-arm statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">\n<em>2. Specific Jurisdiction Under Section A8.198(l)(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">The specific-jurisdiction provision of Florida\u2019s long-arm statute states, in relevant part, that a defendant \u201csubmits himself or herself ... to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state for any cause of action arising from\u201d the defendant\u2019s activities \u201c[ojperating, conducting, engaging in, or carrying on a business or business venture in this state.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 48.193(l)(a). We conclude that J&amp;B Tours\u2019 conduct does not satisfy the requirements of this subsection.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>In support of their argument that J&amp;B Tours conducted business in Florida, the Frasers rely on the same contacts that they alleged to be \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d for the purposes of the general-jurisdiction analysis. To establish a court\u2019s specific jurisdiction under \u00a7 48.193(l)(a), however, a nonresident defendant\u2019s activities \u201cmust ... show a general course of business activity in the State <em>for pecuniary benefit\u201d Dinsmore v. Martin Blumenthal Assocs., </em>314 So.2d 561, 564 (Fla.1975) (emphasis added) (construing materially identical statutory language in Florida\u2019s serviee-of-process statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 48.181(1)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">J&amp;B Tours\u2019 business activities in Florida boil down to purchases, visits, and advertising. A purchase of goods or services inures to the seller\u2019s pecuniary benefit, not to the purchaser\u2019s. <em>Cf. Future Tech. Today, Inc. v. OSF Healthcare Sys., </em>106 F.Supp.2d 1278, 1281 (S.D.Fla.1999) (\u201cThe contract with plaintiff was not for defendant\u2019s pecuniary benefit in any direct sense.... [T]he immediate pecuniary interest to the defendant was the expenditure in excess of $800,000 paying for plaintiffs services.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>218 F.3d 1247 (11th Cir.2000). Similarly, among the visits of J&amp;B Tours\u2019 representatives to Florida, only its employee\u2019s attendance at the tourism trade show could have financially benefitted the company \u201cin any direct sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, although \u201csolicitation is one factor the courts consider in deciding whether a company is conducting business in\u201d Florida, <em>Citicorp Ins. Brokers, Ltd. v. Charman, </em>635 So.2d 79, 81 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1994), the Frasers have not alleged that they ever actually saw any of J&amp;B Tours\u2019 advertising. \u201c[T]he plaintiff bears the burden of proving personal jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Sculptchair, </em>94 F.3d at 627, and in the absence of any allegation that J&amp;B Tours\u2019 solicitation activities in Florida influenced the Frasers\u2019 decision to charter the SUNDANCE, we cannot conclude that their claims \u201caris[e] from\u201d those activities under \u00a7 48.193(1)-</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">The Frasers also argue that J&amp;B Tours\u2019 contacts with Florida satisfied the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Although we are skeptical of this contention, <em>see </em>discussion <em>infra </em>Part II.B.2, we need not address it here. Section 48.193(l)(a) \u201crequires more activities or contacts to sustain service of process than are ... required by decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d <em>Citizens State Bank v. Winters Gov\u2019t Secs. Corp., </em>361 So.2d 760, 762 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1978). The Frasers must establish that both the statutory and the due process requirements for specific jurisdiction have been met, <em>Licciardello, </em>544 F.3d at 1283, and their failure with respect to the former precludes the assertion of specific jurisdiction over J&amp;B Tours under Florida\u2019s long-arm statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">\n<em>B. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure mm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">Failing the existence of personal jurisdiction under Florida\u2019s long-arm statute, the Frasers argue that J&amp;B Tours is subject to the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under the \u201cnational long-arm statute,\u201d Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae4\">Where, as here, a defendant is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of general jurisdiction of any one state, Rule 4(k)(2) permits a court to aggregate a foreign defendant\u2019s nationwide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>contacts to allow for service of process provided that two conditions are met: (1) plaintiff\u2019s claims must \u201carise under federal law;\u201d and, (2) the exercise of jurisdiction must be \u201cconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-5\"><em>Sherritt, </em>216 F.3d at 1291 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(k)(2)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Frasers\u2019 DOHSA and maritime tort claims arise under federal law. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30302; <em>Mink ex rel. Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Genmar Indus., </em>29 F.3d 1543, 1544-47 (11th Cir.1994). We therefore must determine whether the exercise of federal jurisdiction over J&amp;B Tours would be consistent with the requirements of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">\n<em>1. General Jurisdiction Under Rule mm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">As in other contexts, a district court\u2019s exercise of general personal jurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(2) requires a showing of continuous and systematic contacts between the defendant and the relevant forum \u2014 here, the United States. <em>Sherritt, </em>216 F.3d at 1292. Accordingly, to the extent the Frasers rely on the same Florida contacts they alleged to support general jurisdiction under Florida\u2019s long-arm statute, our analysis is the same. The question is whether those contacts, when combined with J&amp;B Tours\u2019 other U.S. contacts, may fairly be described as continuous and systematic in relation to the nation as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">In addition to J&amp;B Tours\u2019 Florida-specific contacts, the Frasers rely on the broader reach of its U.S. advertising and promotional activities, the substantial representation of U.S. tourists among its customers, and its relationships with American businesses based outside Florida. With respect to J&amp;B Tours\u2019 promotional activities, we note the two additional trips its representatives made to the United States trying to secure American business, and we acknowledge the impact of its advertising campaign outside Florida. Even so, these activities were no more continuous and systematic than the company\u2019s activities in Florida. Similarly, the fact that J&amp;B Tours provided services to American citizens in the Turks and Caicos Islands does not establish \u201ccontinuous and systematic general business contacts between the defendant and the forum state.\u201d <em>Sherritt, </em>216 F.3d at 1292. A defendant\u2019s business contacts with foreign tourists are not, by themselves, contacts with the tourists\u2019 home forum. <em>Cf. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 474-75, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985) (\u201cThe unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident defendant cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State.\u201d (quoting <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958))).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">J&amp;B Tours\u2019 forum contacts through American businesses are somewhat more substantial. Although a defendant does not confer personal jurisdiction on our courts by making purchases from American companies, <em>Helicopteros, </em>466 U.S. at 417, 104 S.Ct. 1868, two American car-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>rental companies paid J&amp;B Tours commissions for its referrals in the Turks and Caicos Islands. It also acted as the preferred services provider for Maritz Company, based in St. Louis, and received business from American customers via that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Even in combination with J&amp;B Tours\u2019 Florida-specific contacts, however, these nationwide contacts cannot support the exercise of general jurisdiction over J&amp;B Tours. To conclude that J&amp;B Tours is subject to general personal jurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(2) would imply that the company is amenable to suit everywhere in the United States on any claim arising under federal law. That result would undermine our adherence to the proposition that \u201c[a] party\u2019s contacts with the forum that are unrelated to the litigation must be pervasive in order to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(2).\u201d <em>Associated Transp. Line, Inc. v. Productos Fitosanitarios Proficol El Carmen, S.A., </em>197 F.3d 1070, 1075 (11th Cir.1999) (emphasis omitted). When a defendant\u2019s contacts with the United States are confined to intermittent purchases, limited self-promotion, and a few narrow relationships with American businesses, the exercise of nationwide general jurisdiction over that defendant would \u201coffend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,\u201d Heli<em>copteros, </em>466 U.S. at 414, 104 S.Ct. 1868. We thus conclude that the contacts in this case were not sufficiently pervasive, continuous, and systematic to establish general jurisdiction over J&amp;B Tours.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">\n<em>2. Specific Jurisdiction Under Rule mm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">The due process prerequisites to the exercise of specific jurisdiction over a defendant are less restrictive than the requirements for general jurisdiction. <em>Sherritt, </em>216 F.3d at 1292. The minimum-contacts test for specific jurisdiction has three elements. First, the defendant must have contacts related to or giving rise to the plaintiffs cause of action. Second, the defendant must, through those contacts, have purposefully availed itself of forum benefits. Third, the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum must be such that it could reasonably anticipate being haled into court there. <em>Sculptchair, </em>94 F.3d at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Although J&amp;B Tours\u2019 contacts with the United States demonstrate its propensity to avail itself of certain forum goods, services, and advertising, \u201ca fundamental element of the specific jurisdiction calculus is that plaintiffs claim must \u2018arise out of or relate to\u2019 at least one of defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum.\u201d <em>Oldfield, </em>558 F.3d at 1222 (quoting <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 472, 105 S.Ct. 2174). In other words, \u201cour inquiry must focus on the direct causal relationship among \u2018the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Helicopteros, </em>466 U.S. at 414, 104 S.Ct. 1868). We conclude that the Frasers have not established the necessary relationship between their claims and J&amp;B Tours\u2019 contacts with the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">We have not developed a specific approach to determining whether a defendant\u2019s contacts \u201crelate to\u201d the plaintiffs claims, but we recently held that \u201c[n]ecessarily, the contact must be a \u2018but-for\u2019 cause of the tort.\u201d <em>Oldfield, </em>558 F.3d at 1222-23. The Frasers insist that J&amp;B Tours\u2019 U.S. contacts bear a causal relation to the explosion aboard the <em>Sundance, </em>but many of these contacts cannot reasonably be construed as but-for causes of the accident. For instance, as we explained in our analysis of specific jurisdiction under Florida\u2019s long-arm statute, if the Frasers were never exposed to J&amp;B Tours\u2019 advertising in the United States, then its efforts to solicit business there could not have led to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>injuries.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Likewise, because the Frasers have not alleged exposure to the company\u2019s website in the United States, we will not assume that but for the website they would not have been injured. The same must be said for most of J&amp;B Tours\u2019 business relationships with American companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Two of J&amp;B Tours\u2019 contacts arguably do qualify as but-for causes of the Frasers\u2019 injuries. First, the Frasers allege that they booked their reservation with J&amp;B Tours through the American-owned hotel where they were staying. Second, J&amp;B Tours purchased the <em>Sundance </em>in Florida and had it repaired in the Turks and Caicos Islands by one of co-defendant Smith\u2019s agents from Florida. As we indicated in <em>Oldfield, </em>however, a pure \u201cbut-for approach is ... over-inclusive, making any cause of action, no matter how unforeseeable, necessarily \u2018related to\u2019 the initial contact.\u201d 558 F.3d at 1223. We must therefore search for \u201ca closer and more substantial causal relationship between the relevant contacts and the alleged tort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1224. This search entails a \u201cfact-sensitive inquiry ... hew[ing] closely to the foreseeability and fundamental fairness principles forming the foundation upon which the specific jurisdiction doctrine rests.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">The Frasers\u2019 injuries were not a sufficiently foreseeable consequence of their hotel\u2019s business relationship with J&amp;B Tours to satisfy the constitutional relatedness requirement. \u201c[A] negligence action for personal injuries sustained ... while vacationing in another country does not \u2018arise from\u2019 the simple act of making a reservation .... \u201d <em>Sun Trust Bank v. Sun Int\u2019l Hotels, Ltd., </em>184 F.Supp.2d 1246, 1270 (S.D.Fla.2001) (citation omitted). \u201cA finding that such a tenuous relationship ... somehow satisfied the relatedness requirement would not only contravene the fairness principles that permeate the jurisdictional due process analysis, but would also interpret the requirement so broadly as to render it virtually meaningless.\u201d <em>Oldfield, </em>558 F.3d at 1223-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">Nor can the Frasers\u2019 claims fairly be said to relate to J&amp;B Tours\u2019 purchase of the <em>Sundance </em>in the United States. Although the purchase might support the exercise of specific jurisdiction over J&amp;B Tours on contractual claims arising directly from that transaction,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Frasers\u2019 injuries have only an attenuated causal connection to the purchase itself. Buying goods from within a forum does not make a nonresident defendant amenable to suit there on the unrelated tort claims of a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">With respect to the <em>Sundance\u2019s </em>repair by one of Smith\u2019s agents, although injuries arising from the negligent repairs may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>have been foreseeable in some sense, \u201c \u2018foreseeability\u2019 alone has never been a sufficient benchmark for personal jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. </em>Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 295, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980). On the contrary, \u201cthe foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis is not the mere likelihood that a product will find its way into the forum State\u201d \u2014 or, in this case, that a service rendered by another company will cause injury to the defendant\u2019s customers. <em>Id. </em>at 297, 100 S.Ct. 559. \u201cRather, it is that the defendant\u2019s conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The overseas acceptance of warranty repairs from an American company is not conduct such that J&amp;B Tours reasonably should have anticipated being haled into a U.S. court on claims arising from subsequent injuries to third parties. And we may not ascribe the forum contacts of one co-defendant to another in determining the existence of personal jurisdiction. <em>See Rush v. Savchuk, </em>444 U.S. 320, 331-33, 100 S.Ct. 571, 62 L.Ed.2d 516 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Notwithstanding the insubstantial relationship between J&amp;B Tours\u2019 forum contacts and the claims in this case, the Frasers argue that considerations of \u201c \u2018fair play and substantial justice\u2019 \u201d may here \u201cserve to establish the reasonableness of jurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts than would otherwise be required.\u201d <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (quoting <em>Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 320, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945)). The barrier to exercising specific jurisdiction over J&amp;B Tours in this case, however, is not a paucity of forum contacts. As we already have observed, J&amp;B Tours\u2019 forum contacts may very well be constitutionally sufficient to establish specific jurisdiction over claims adequately related to those contacts. The claims in this case, however, do not meet that standard. <em>Cf. World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 294, 100 S.Ct. 559 (\u201cEven if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State; even if the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy; even if the forum State is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment.\u201d (citation omitted)). The district court\u2019s order granting J&amp;B Tours\u2019 motion to dismiss is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-11\">.
