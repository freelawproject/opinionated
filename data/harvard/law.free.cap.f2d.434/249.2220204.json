Citizens Casualty Co. of New York, et al., 5th Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b323-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b323-22\">The defendant, Ignacio Wilkins Castillo, was found guilty by a jury of violating 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4705[a], and 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4704[a], all relating to the unlawful possession and sale of narcotics. He now appeals from that conviction alleging the following twelve points as error:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-23\">1. The trial court refused on voir dire to inquire into whether or not any member of the jury panel had previously sat on a case involving the illegal sale of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-24\">2. The trial court allowed the government agent, a non-expert, to testify that the result of a chemical test conducted by him showed the material in question to be heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-25\">3. The trial court did not allow the defendant to impeach the testimony of the government agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-26\">4. The trial court refused to allow the defendant to prove that certain pre-trial statements taken from an informer contained nothing about the informer lighting a cigarette.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-27\">5. The trial court allowed the government to ask the informer leading questions concerning the cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-28\">6. The trial court allowed the government to impeach the defendant by showing that he had a 1960 conviction for the illegal sale of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-29\">7. The trial court permitted the government to impeach the defendant by showing that- he had a 1955 conviction for a Dyer Act violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-30\">8. The trial court -refused to allow the defendant to explain his 1955 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-31\">9. The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objection to the court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-32\">10. The trial court refused to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>11. The trial court refused to instruct a verdict for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">12. The trial court refused to order defendant discharged from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We have examined each of the complaints asserted by the defendant and have found them without merit. The record conclusively shows that the defendant was afforded a fair and impartial trial and that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction. Accordingly the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
