The importer claims that the merchandise is dutiable at a lower rate under item 668.06, TSUS, as parts of machines for making paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-20\">The imported merchandise consists of parts of what is generally designated in the record and arguments as a \u201cMadeleine System\u201d. It includes Madeleine rolls, and some accessories, such as brackets to install the rolls and some sections of ductwork. The evidence shows that the Madeleine System is used in the drying portion of a Fourdrinier type paper making machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-21\">From testimony submitted in the trial below, we elicit that, during the paper making process, the Fourdrinier machine provides a sheet of paper pulp with a high water content. This sheet, or web, is continuously and directly fed into the drying portion where it is passed over a series of steam-heated cylindrical drying rolls to eliminate most of the water. Moving felt bands are sometimes provided to hold the sheet against the drying rolls to facilitate extraction of the water from the sheet. In machinery utilizing the Madeleine System, these felt bands, which become wet in the operation just described, are passed over the Madeleine rolls for drying. These Madeleine rolls, which are installed between consecutive drying rolls, have openings through which hot air is passed radially outward through that part of the felt engaging the roll at each instant. The felt is thus dried by the hot air before it is again used to press the pulp sheet against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>a subsequent drying roll. The Madeleine rolls do not contact the pulp sheet at any time. Also, there is evidence that the hot air from the Madeleine rolls, after passing through the felt to dry it, helps to eliminate from the drying section some of the moist air resulting from the action of the drying rolls on the pulp sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">The pertinent portions of the statutory provisions involved are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0m\">Schedule 6, Part 4:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-5\">Subpart A. \u2014 Boilers, Non-Electric Motor and Engines, and Other General Purpose Machinery</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALF-\">Subpart A headnote:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-6\">1. A machine or appliance which is described in this subpart and also is described elsewhere in this part is classifiable in this subpart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-8\">Industrial machinery, plant, and similar laboratory equipment, whether or not electrically heated, for the treatment of materials by a process involving a change of temperature, such as heating, cooking, roasting, distilling, rectifying, sterilizing, pasteurizing, steaming, drying, evaporating, vaporizing, condensing, or cooling; instantaneous or storage water heaters, non-electrical; all the foregoing (except agricultural implements; sugar machinery, and machinery or equipment for the heat-treatment of textile yarns, fabrics, or made-up textile articles) and parts thereof:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-10\">661.70 Other.......... 12.5% ad val.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-12\">S.ubpart D. \u2014 Pulp and Paper Machinery ; Bookbinding Machinery; Printing Machinery</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-r\">Machines for making cellulosic pulp, paper, or paperboard; machines for processing or finishing pulp, paper, or paperboard, or making them up into articles:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-13\">668.00 Machines for making cellulose pulp, paper, or paperboard..... 7% ad val.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-15\">Parts of the foregoing machines:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-17\">Other:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-18\">668.06 Parts of machines for making cellulosic pulp, paper, or paperboard ............7% ad val.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-20\">The government apparently does not contest that the importations are described in item 668,06 as parts of machines for making paper. Assuming for present purposes that such is the case, the issue breaks down into two elements. These are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-21\">(1) Whether the importations are also described in item 661,70 (as classified) and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anq\">(2) Whether the importations fall within the scope of above-quoted Headnote 1, Schedule 6, Part 4, Subpart A, which provides for Subpart A of Schedule 6, Part 4 to invade other subparts of that schedule and part, including Sub-part D in which item 668.06 (claimed) falls.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-23\">The Customs Court found from the evidence that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-24\">* * * the imported material in particular, and the drier section in general, do treat materials by subjecting them to a change in temperature. In this instance the material being treated is the drier felt and the paper web or sheet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-25\">The court then ruled that the case of American SF Products, Inc. v. United States, 61 Cust.Ct.257, C.D. 3593 (1968), is controlling and that the importations are therefore classifiable under item 661.70. In reaching that conclusion, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-26\">Insofar as [it is) the contention of plaintiff that the headnote of subpart A, <em>supra, </em>covers only machines and appliances and not parts, we are in total agreement. As indicated, <em>supra, </em>this court and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals have held that no one machine makes paper. An examination of plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 2 and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>diagram contained on page 2 of defendant\u2019s exhibit A makes it abundantly clear to us that the so-called Madeleine System is one of the machines utilized to make paper. It is admittedly a part of the dryer section of paper machinery, not in the sense of th\u00e9 term \u201cpart of a machine\u201d, but part of the section, to wit, one of the machines of the dryer portion of paper making. Even if we were not-to-consider-the Madeleine System a machine, it actually falls within the common meaning of the term \u201cappliance\u201d which has among other meanings, equipment, accouterments, appurtenances, implements, devices, etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-4\">We also conclude that the classification of the importations under item 661.70 is correct, although our reasoning does not coincide precisely with that of the Customs Court. In the first place, we are inclined to agree with the importer that the \u201cmaterials\u201d which that item requires to be treated must be something other than a part of the machinery such as the drier felt. However, it is clear that that portion of the entire paper making machinery which drys the wet web or sheet coming from the web-forming section thereof in the present case \u2014 that is, the drying rolls, the drier felt, and the Madeleine System and associated parts \u2014 constitutes a drying section of the complete paper making assembly. The entire drying section obviously constitutes machinery for the treatment of material \u2014 in this case, the pulp sheet \u2014 by a process involving a change in temperature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">. Of course, the importations, as parts of the Madeleine System, constitute but parts of the machinery constituting the drying section. However, item 661.70 specifically includes parts of the machinery or equipment described therein. The question whether the importations are described in item 661.70 therefore must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-8\">The importer urges that Headnote 1, Subpart A, Part 4 of Schedule 6 \u201cis not applicable to 'parts\u2019 of the machines and appliances provided for/in Subpart A\u201d and notes the Custom^' Court\u2019s agreement in the second quqted portion of its opinion, <em>swpra, </em>that the headnote \u201ccovers only machines and appliances and not parts.\u201d While the court sets forth no reason for its conclusion on this point, the importer bases its position largely on the absence of the words \u201cand parts thereof\u201d after \u201cmachine or appliance\u201d in the headnote.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-9\">We find the importer\u2019s reasoning unpersuasive. The term \u201cmachine or appliance\u201d appears in the headnote, <em>not in item 661.70. </em>The question therefore is not whether parts of a \u201cmachine or appliance\u201d are classifiable under item 661.70. Instead, it is whether the \u201cparts thereof,\u201d which item 661.70 includes along with the specified \u201cindustrial machinery, plant and similar laboratory equipment,\u201d are precluded from constituting, in the words of the headnote, \u201ca machine or appliance which is described\" in item 661.70 of Subpart A. We think it obvious that the omission from the headnote of words specifically including <em>parts </em>of a \u201cmachine or appliance\u201d is no indication that articles which meet the description of \u201cparts thereof\u201d under item 661.70 are'not subject to the provisions of the headnote.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-10\">In short, we are satisfied that the present \u201cparts\u201d of the \u201cmachinery\u201d and \u201cequipment\u201d, which meet the requirements for classification in Item 661.70, are covered by the term \u201cmachine or appliance\u201d in headnote 1. We point out that that term appears to have been selected not just for its applicability to the merchandise and parts of Item <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>661.70, but also to all the diverse other merchandise, and \u201cparts thereof\u201d, described in other items in Subpart A of Part 4 of Schedule 6,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to all of which the headnote applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">The importer refers to certain aspects of legislative history as demonstrating \u201cthat TSUS Item 661.70 was not intended to provide for paper-making machinery or parts of such machinery\u201d but this argument also fails to convince us of error in the Customs Court\u2019s judgment. In the first place,' the evidence advanced on that point is less than persuasive. But what is more important, the language of the statute makes it clear that the invasionary headnote to Subpart A is applicable to all other sub-parts of Part 4, including Item 668.06 for parts of papermaking machines. Since we are convinced that the instant imported merchandise otherwise meets the requirements for classification in Item 661.70, we cannot permit the clear meaning of the statutory language to be overcome merely by the showing of a possibly contrary legislative, intent. American Customs Brokg. Co. Inc. v. United States, Cust. &amp; Pat.App., 433 F. 2d 1340, decided by this court on December 3, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">The judgment of the Customs Court is affirmed-.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1127-22\">. 62 Cust.Ct. 729, C.D. 3855 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1129-11\">. This conclusion is in conformity with the decision of the Customs Court in American SF Products, Inc. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the case which the court found controlling here. In that case, merchandise in the form of <em>parts </em>(although it appears no issue as to \u201cparts\u201d was raised) of a drier used in making paper were held dutiable under item 661.70 instead of item 668.06 because of the invasionary effect of the here-involved headnote 1 to Subpart A. See also Amalgamated Sugar Co. v. United States, 60 Cust.Ct. 268. C.D. 3361 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">. Other merchandise provided for in Sub-part A includes steam engines, internal combustion engines, air and vacuum pumps and compressors, air-conditioning machines, centrifuges, weighing machinery and scales, and mechanical appliances for spraying liquids or powders.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
