He received sentences of two years on each of the three counts, the sentences to run concurrently, and a fine of $1000. From his final judgment and the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>overruling <em>his </em>motion for a new trial, appellant brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">The record shows that United States Treasury agents investigating an illegal distillery operation in Macon County, Alabama, discovered \u201cmoonshine\u201d in an automobile allegedly owned by appellant, and found a distillery on a large tract of land owned by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">On this appeal, appellant questions (1) the propriety of allowing the government to prove a prior conviction for violation of an Alabama misdemeanor statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> prohibiting possession of tax-paid whiskey and beer in a \u201cdry\u201d county, and (2) the correctness of an instruction to the jury by the district court that such a crime involved moral turpitude and could be considered for the purpose of impeachment of appellant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">We find that the instant case is controlled by this court\u2019s decision in United States v. Smith, 420 F.2d 428 (5th Cir. 1970), and we therefore reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">Although in the present case the record does not reveal that the trial court <em>charged </em>the jury on the admissibility of the prior misdemeanor conviction because it involved moral turpitude, as was the case in <em>Smith, </em>that information was conveyed to the'jury by the court during closing argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This distinguishing feature in the case at bar does not abate the highly prejudicial effect such comment and evidence has in a case of this nature, especially since the case turns on the defendant\u2019s credibility. From the guilt of one liquor offense, erroneously characterized as involving moral turpitude, too easily flows the presumed guilt of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1096-9\">. 29 Code of Alabama \u00a7\u00a7 98, 99 (Recompiled, 1958). \u201e</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1096-10\">. \u201cTHE COURT: Any other offense doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this offense. There was some evidence with reference to Poole having had (511(11)) two previous convictions, the only purpose of that is \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean in any way should that <em>that </em>be evidence against the offense here. It is admitted because it is considered to be a crime involving moral turpitude and it goes to the credibility of Ms testimony \u2014 as to what he has said. And that is the only purpose. Any other offenses about anybody else is not\u2014 shouldn\u2019t be considered by you. We are trying these offenses right here. Go ahead.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
