Over a period of approximately nine months, and without apparent excuse, appellants failed to amend their complaint as directed by the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>court. The order dismissing the action was thus founded not only on appellants\u2019 failure to appear at the pre-trial conference, but also on their refusal to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">It is well settled that a district court has inherent power to dismiss a case for failure to prosecute and there is no abuse of discretion when counsel fails to appear, at a pre-trial conference and when there is evidence of prior dilatory conduct. Link v. Wabash R. Co., 1962, 370 U.S. 626, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734; Provenza v. H. and W. Wrecking Co., 5 Cir., 1970, 424 F.2d 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">Finding both these elements present in the instant ease, we hold that there was no abuse of discretion by the district court and its decision is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
