There was no water on the same floor for that purpose, and the fire spread and did the damage complained of. Morse was familiar with the box and its conditions, but did not caution the workman, who was not familiar with it. The place where the work was to be done, being inside of the box, was somewhat dark, and the workman asked for a lamp. Morse procured one, a small tin lamp with no chimney, and filled with lard oil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">Morse testified that, after lighting the lamp, he handed it to the workman, who was outside of the box, and that the workman took it and went to work with it inside the box, he, Morse, then leaving the room and not returning until the fire had started.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">The workman, called for the defendant, testified that Morse himself placed the lamp inside of the box upon a circular shafting while the workman was at work inside, and that then Morse left the room. The defendant asked the judge to rule :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-7\">\u201c1. That the contracted position in which the defendant\u2019s workman was placed, being at the time covered or saturated with oil, which place was new to the workman and unexplained to him, and the lamp furnished with a naked flame by the plaintiff, were such acts of contributory negligence as will bar the plaintiff from recovering.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-8\">\u201c 2. That the neglect to explain to the workman that the place in which he was to work was dangerous in regard to fire was contributory negligence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-9\">The judge declined to rule as requested, and found that the defendant\u2019s agent was negligent, and that there was no contributory negligence of the plaintiff or his agent, and further found for the plaintiff; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-10\"><em>J. L. </em>Powers, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-11\"><em>W. A. </em>Knowlton, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbH\">The plaintiff\u2019s case was, that the defendant\u2019s workman took the lamp into the shafting box where he had to mend the pipe, and that he knew that the box was soaked with oil. The judge was warranted in finding these to be the facts. If he did so, we cannot say that he was not warranted in finding that a plumber who knew his business would not set fire to the box unless he was careless. On the other hand, we cannot say that the plaintiff was not warranted in assuming that the condition of the box was obvious, and would be noticed by the workman, and that the workman was aware that oil is easily ignited by flame. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
