Sts. c. 112, \u00a7 212.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-10\">Tort, by the administrator of Daniel Sullivan, to recover under the Pub. Sts. c. 112, \u00a7 212, for injuries causing his death on June 8, 1887.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-11\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Mason, C. J., there was evidence tending to show that Sullivan and another boy named Scanlan were playing ball near the coal shed of the defendant on Lehigh Street, in Boston, and that the ball, while the game was in progress, was batted so that it fell upon the roof of the coal shed ; that the boys started to get the ball, going up into the interior of the coal shed out upon the roof of an ell through a window in the shed, and climbed upon the roof of the coal shed from there; that Sullivan procured the ball and threw it down, and then came in contact with two naked copper wires fastened to the roof of the shed, and used by the defendant to conduct electricity, and received injuries from which he died. The electric wires were used in the ordinary lawful business of the defendant, and were not designed as a trap. The plaintiff saved several exceptions to the exclusion of evidence, and also an exception to the refusal to submit the question of the due care of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-12\">The judge, at the defendant\u2019s request, directed a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-13\"><em>E.
