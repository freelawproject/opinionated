D. further released all his right of passage, if any, or right to swing doors or blinds in and upon the land of the church, and all other rights which he had in or upon the land, excepting, however, the privilege of swinging blinds to the windows then existing. The court found, at the hearing on a bill in equity for an injunction, that the walls of the brick house were the same which existed at the date of the indenture, except that they had been built several feet higher; that the estate on which the brick house stood had been conveyed to the defendants, but that the other estate had not, and that the wall of the brick house on the side adjoining the land of the plaintiff stood about seven and one half inches within the limits of the land of the defendants. <em>Held, </em>in the absence of covenants that other windows should not be opened in the wall of the brick house, that none could be implied from the covenants concerning the windows in the wooden house, and that the release of D. in the indenture did not touch the right to open windows in the wall of the brick house which stood within the limits of the defendants\u2019 land, as this right was not a right in the plaintiff\u2019s land, and could not by long continuance become a right or easement in such land.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-13\">Bill in equity, praying that the defendants he restrained from further constructing or maintaining certain windows or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>new windows in their building, and that the building be restored to its original condition so far as the windows were concerned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">The bill alleged that the plaintiff was possessed of a certain parcel of land, with the buildings thereon, situated in Boston and known as Christ Church ; that the defendants were owners of an adjoining parcel of land, with' the buildings thereon ; that said defendants\u2019 land was originally bought of the church coiy poration, and was conveyed subject to certain restrictions to one Jonathan Merry in 1803, and thereafter by subsequent owners to one William Dillaway in 1830; that differences arose between Dillaway and the wardens and vestry as to what was the true boundary line between the two estates, and also whether certain easements claimed by Dillaway existed, which differences were adjusted by a certain agreement entered into between Dillaway, his heirs and assigns, with the Wardens and Vestry and their successors and assigns, dated April 9, 1841, and thereafter recorded'in Suffolk Registry of Deeds, which agreement, after defining and fixing the boundary line between the two estates, recited, \u201c And the said Dillaway <em>doth hereby covenant </em>and agree with the said Wardens and Vestry, their successors and assigns, that he will cause a large door now opening from his brick house on the northeast side thereof upon the land of the said Wardens and Vestry to be closed up forever hereafter, it being, however, understood and agreed by the said parties that a window may be put in the place of said door, and doth further covenant and agree as aforesaid that he will cause the lower part of four windows, now opening on the northeast side of his wooden house, upon the back part of the land of the said Wardens and Vestry, to the height of two thirds thereof, to be permanently blinded by stationary blinds, so as to intercept the view therefrom upon and over the said land; and the said Dillaway hereby releases to the said Wardens and Vestry, their successors-and assigns, all his right of passage, if any, or right to swing doors or blinds in and upon the land of the said Wardens and Vestry aforesaid, and all other rights which he may have in or upon the said land, excepting, however, the privilege of swinging blinds to those windows now existing \u201d; that the defendants, \u201c without right and in violation of the terms and spirit of said agreement, and against the protest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Wardens and Vestry of said church, have permanently consfcructed and built on to said building, which existed at the time of said agreement, two large windows which look directly into the windows of said church, and which are objectionable to the Wardens and Vestry of said church, and an annoyance to the proprietors of and the worshippers in said church.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-5\">The defendants denied most of the allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s bill.

The brick walls of the house in which said windows were placed, as above described, are the same which existed when said indenture was entered into, except that they have been built several feet higher.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>T.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyH\">The plaintiff complains of the third paragraph of the decree entered by the Superior Court. The contention is, that by the indenture of April 9, 1841, between the Wardens and Vestry of Christ Church and William Dillaway, Dillaway and his grantees were prevented from opening windows in the brick house on the side adjoining the land of the plaintiff. It has been found by the court that the wall of the house on this side stands about seven and one half inches within the limits of the land of the defendants; and that the wooden house mentioned in the indenture \u201c referred to a wooden house which stood upon land in the rear, and adjoining, but not parcel of, the estate now owned by the defendants.\u201d It seems that Dillaway, when he executed the indenture, owned two estates, on the first of which was a brick house, and on the second, which was in the rear of the first, was a wooden house; that the walls of the brick house are the same which existed at the date of the indenture, except that they have been built several feet higher; and that the estate on which the brick house stands has been conveyed to the defendants, but that the other estate has not. By the indenture Dillaway covenanted that he would cause a door opening from his brick house upon the land of the plaintiff to be closed up, it being agreed that a window might be put in place of the door. There are no covenants that other windows shall not be opened in the wall of the brick house, and none can be implied from the covenants concerning the windows in the wooden house. The release by Dillaway of \u201c all his right of passage, if any, or right to swing doors or blinds in and upon the land of \u201d the plaintiff, \u201c and all other rights which he may have in or upon the said land, excepting, however, the privilege of swinging blinds to those windows now existing,\u201d etc., does not touch the right to open windows in the wall of his brick house which stood \u201c about seven and one half inches within the limits \u201d of his own land. This right to open windows is not a right in the land of the plaintiff, and cannot by long continuance, under our laws, become a right or easement in its land.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed,</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
