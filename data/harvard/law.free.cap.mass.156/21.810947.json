And in his charge to the jury the judge instructed them in accordance with said ruling in letting in the evidence; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-8\">There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff\u2019s husband had been an habitual drunkard for the last ten years, drunk very often at all times of day, and frequently going home drunk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-9\">The defendant requested the court to instruct the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-10\">\u201c First. That if the plaintiff\u2019s husband obtained any liquor of defendant which caused his intoxication as alleged, the defendant cannot be liable for the damage unless he knew, or had good reason to believe, when he sold it to him, that he was intoxicated, or was accustomed to get intoxicated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-11\">\u201c Second. That defendant cannot be liable in damages on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>account of the alleged intoxication unless he knew when he sold him the liquor that he was then intoxicated, or was then known to the defendant to be a drunkard, or to have been intoxicated within the six months next preceding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">\u201c Third. That the last count is too general and indefinite to admit of any proof under it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-6\">\u201c Fourth. That the first count is barred by Public Statutes, chapter 197, section 3.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-7\">\u201c Fifth. That the allegations and proof must correspond; and under this declaration this action cannot be maintained unless all the liquor which made her husband drunk was furnished him by the defendant, and with such knowledge as mentioned in the first and second requests, or without such knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-8\">\u201c Sixth. That plaintiff cannot in any event recover anything on account of what occurred, or was caused by defendant,, before about January 1, 1888, nor on account of any damage caused by defendant at other times than on or about the times alleged in the first six counts in the declaration, and that several months\u2019 variance from the times alleged is not near enough.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-9\">The court refused to give any of these instructions, and instructed the jury, among other things, that under the law, as well as under the declaration, if, on any of the occasions mentioned in the first six counts, when the plaintiff\u2019s husband went home intoxicated, no matter when, if within six years of the date of the writ, and did the damage alleged in consequence of intoxication, such intoxication was caused in whole or in part by what liquor the defendant furnished him on those occasions, then the defendant was liable to the plaintiff for the damage; and that it made no difference whether the defendant or his clerks or servants knew, or had good reason to believe, that when the liquor was furnished he was intoxicated, or accustomed to get intoxicated, or known to any of them to be a drunkard, or that he had been drunk before at any time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-10\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-11\"><em>L. W. </em>Howes, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-12\"><em>H. N. </em>Sheldon, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b45-13\">Field, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIK\">It was not necessary under any of the first six counts of the declaration to prove the averment of time as laid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The only absolute legal limit is that the time proved must be within the statute of limitations applicable to the action. The defendant did not ask the court to order the plaintiff to file a statement of particulars, pursuant to the Pub. Sts. c. 167, \u00a7 61, nor did the defendant contend that he had been surprised at the trial by the evidence admitted by the court, and ask for time to obtain evidence to meet it. There are reasons, perhaps, why, in an action of this kind, great pains should be taken to secure to a defendant an opportunity to meet the case proved by the plaintiff, because the injuries to the plaintiff are not likely to be within the knowledge of the <em>defendant; </em>but the rules of law are the same in this as in other similar actions. <em>Little </em>v. <em>Blunt, </em>16 Pick. 359, 365. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>10 Cush. 69. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>4 Gray, 11. <em>Sackett </em>v. <em>Ruder, </em>152 Mass. 397. <em>Leatherbee </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>152 Mass. 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Knowledge on the part of the defendant that the plaintiff\u2019s husband was accustomed to get intoxicated, or had been intoxicated within six months next preceding the sale of intoxicating liquors to him by the defendant, is not necessary to sustain an action under the Pub. Sts. c. 100, \u00a7 21. The statute does not make such knowledge a constituent element of the cause of action. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Julius, </em>143 Mass. 132.'</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Under the last count, a sale on one occasion of intoxicating liquor within the time alleged could be proved. <em>Sackett </em>v. <em>Ruder, ubi supra. </em>The cause of action is not within the Pub. Sts. c. 197, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The allegations of the different counts in substance are that the defendant sold intoxicating liquors to Henderson J. Edwards, the plaintiff\u2019s husband, to be drunk by him, which he drank, and thereby became intoxicated, and that the defendant thus caused his intoxication. This is not in terms an allegation that the defendant wholly caused his intoxication, and it is sufficient to support the action to prove that the defendant caused it in whole or in part, for this is the language of the statute. <em>Bryant </em>v. Tidge<em>well, </em>133 Mass. 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">If this is not such an action as is described in the Pub. Sts. c. 197, \u00a7 3, it has not been contended that the time within which the action may be brought is not six years next after the cause of action accrued. Pub. Sts. c. 197, \u00a7 1, cl. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
