It was further provided by said agreement, that a complete plan of such unity of interest and for tho accomplishment of the other purposes therein contemplated should be prepared at once, and that in all other respects the purpose contemplated should be consummated at once, and that all future action to which the defendants should agree was to be binding upon them, and, in the event of any difference between them, any and all action should be binding upon the defendants to which any two of them should agree who together represented a majority in interest, with the addition, so far as concerned legal matters, of John E. Parsons, and, so far as concerned all other matters, of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">\u201c And the plaintiff says that he performed a vast amount of work for the defendants, at their request, and expended a large sum of his own money in connection with said agreement of Sept. 12, and that thereafter, on Oct. 16, 1889, the defendant Frederic L. Felton, duly authorized thereto by the firm of Felton and Son-, made an agreement with the plaintiff in behalf of the defendants, a copy whereof is hereto annexed, marked B, and made a part of this declaration, by which it was agreed that, the defendant Sortwell or the defendant Chapin assenting, there should be paid to the plaintiff ten per cent of the original capitalization of one million dollars, provided for by the agreement of Sept. 12, 1889, above referred to, for and in consideration of the services rendered by the plaintiff to the trust arranged between the defendants as per said agreement of Sept. 12, 1889, and in consideration of other services and attention to be given to the interests of said combination or trust by him, except in the matter of service that might be rendered by him as an officer of the trust.

And the plaintiff says that Sortwell &amp; Co., who, with said Felton and Son, represent a majority in interest, have agreed and assented in behalf of the defendants as provided in said agreement of Oct. 16, 1889, and the plaintiff says he is entitled to $100,000 of the original capitalization aforesaid, but the defendants have refused, and, though often requested by the plaintiff, do still refuse, to carry out their agreement. And the plaintiff says the defendants owe him $100,000, and interest thereon from Nov. 1, 1889, to the date of plaintiff\u2019s writ.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AuK\">The agreement A set out that the above named parties, \u201c being desirous of effecting a complete and permanent unity of interest between their distilleries, and also between their and other distilleries, and, preliminary to that purpose, wishing at once to accomplish such unity of interest between themselves, leaving details and the union of other distilleries to be arranged hereafter,\u201d covenanted and agreed that from and after November 10, 1889, <em>\u201c </em>the business of their several distilleries shall be united in interest; the proprietors of each distillery shall contribute its business to the common interest; and the subscribers, as proprietors of their several distilleries, shall be interested in the united business of such distilleries \u201d in the proportion therein set forth. It further set out the undertakings as declared, article 7 providing as follows : \u201c A complete plan for such unity of interest and for the accomplishment of the other purposes \"herein contemplated shall be prepared at once, and in all other respects the purpose contemplated shall be consummated at once. All future action to which the four representatives above mentioned shall agree shall be binding upon the subscribers.

We do not so regard it. It begins by saying \u201cthat the subscribers, . . . being desirous of effecting a complete and permanent unity of interest between their distilleries, and also between their and other distilleries, and, preliminary to that purpose, wishing at once to accomplish such unity of interest between themselves, leaving details and the union of other distilleries to be arranged hereafter, have covenanted,\u201d etc. Arti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>cle 7 provides that \u201c a complete plan for such unity of interest and for the accomplishment of the other purposes herein contemplated shall be prepared at once, and in all other respects the purpose contemplated shall be consummated at once.\u201d It is clear that on some things the minds of the parties had met, and on others they had not. The scheme or plan was not completed, and, until it was, there was no complete or final contract. Until then it was provisional and incomplete, and failure to agree upon the details or upon a complete plan would render all the preliminary agreements void. <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>14 Allen, 242, 252. <em>May </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>134 Mass. 127. <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Butterworth, </em>136 Mass. 511. <em>Freeland </em>v. <em>Ritz, </em>154 Mass. 257. <em>Appleby v. Johnson, </em>L. R. 9 C. P. 158. <em>Ridgway </em>v. <em>Wharton, </em>6 H. L. Cas. 238. The first cause of demurrer assigned is that the agreement between the defendants was incomplete, and as we are of opinion that this ground is well taken and is fundamental, it is not necessary to consider the other causes of demurrer. The entry must be, <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
