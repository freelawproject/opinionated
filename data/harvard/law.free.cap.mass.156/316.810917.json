After the decision in the former case, reported 153 Mass. 300, a trial was had in the Superior Court, before <em>Blodgett, </em>J., who ruled that, under the Pub.

At the second trial, it appeared that at the time of the accident the intestate was crossing one of the defendant\u2019s tracks at a place where he had no right to cross. Although evidence was offered tending to prove that when struck by the train he was lying upon the track in an unconscious and helpless condition in an epileptic fit, he came there in an attempt to cross the track at a place where he had no right so to do. Knowingly standing or walking upon a railroad track without right is prohibited by statute. Pub. Sts. c. 112, \u00a7 195. He was therefore upon the railroad contrary to law. Because the death was instantaneous, and there is no action at common law, no action can be maintained except one given by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the statute; and the Pub. Sts. c. 112, \u00a7 212, under which the plaintiff seeks to recover, expressly provide that there shall be no liability \u201c for the loss of life by a person while walking or being upon its road contrary to law or to the reasonable rules and regulations of the corporation.\u201d Since it now appears that he was upon the railroad contrary to law, and that his death was instantaneous, the action cannot be maintained either at common law or under the statute referred to, and the ruling of the presiding justice was right. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>142 Mass. 296, 301. <em>McCreary </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>153 Mass. 300, <em>304.
