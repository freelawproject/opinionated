The identity of the defendant and the identity of the offence were agreed to by the District Attorney, and the record of the District Court of East Norfolk, holden at Quincy in the county of Norfolk, being the court by which it was alleged the defendant was acquitted of the charge, was introduced. The record showed that the defendant was \u201c discharged,\u201d because \u201c it does not appear that there is probable cause to believe defendant guilty.\u201d The court ruled that this was not an acquittal such as to constitute a bar to the indictment. To this ruling the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-6\">There was evidence tending to show that the defendant, on January 31, 1892, was standing behind a bar in a bar-room on the premises complained of as a- nuisance; that as the officers with a search-warrant were going toward the bar-room through an adjoining room connected with the bar-room, some one in the adjoining room, being three feet away from the bar-room, and the door thereto being open, cried out, \u201c Cheese it! Here comes the officers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-7\">To the introduction of this evidence the defendant objected, but <em>Mason, </em>C. J. overruled the objection, and admitted the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-8\">The evidence tended to show that the door between the barroom and the room in which the remark was made was at the time open. There was no evidence that the defendant heard the remark, except as might be inferred by the jury .from the action of the defendant in throwing a bottle containing whiskey, which had been on the bar behind which he was standing. The evidence also tended to show that, when the officers passed into the bar-room, the defendant was standing behind the bar. Upon their entrance the defendant grabbed the bottle in question, which was standing on the counter, and, leaving the barroom, threw it and broke it on the floor of the cellar under the bar-room. The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>J.

Pub. Sts. c. 101, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7; c. 154, \u00a7 18. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Harris, 8 Gray, 470. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>129 Mass. 479. Whether in a particular case the court took jurisdiction, or merely conducted a preliminary examination, must be determined from the record of its proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In the present case, the record states that the defendant is discharged because \u201cit does not appear that there is probable cause to believe defendant guilty.\u201d This language indicates that the court did not assume to take final jurisdiction, but was simply doing the preliminary duty of determining whether the defendant should be held for appearance before a higher tribunal. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>129 Mass. 479, it was expressly held that such a record does not show an acquittal which will bar conviction on an indictment in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">While the defendant is not bound by what was said by a stranger found on the premises, a remark made, apparently in his hearing, in reference to the approach of the officers, and his conduct in immediately afterwards \u201c grabbing \u201d a bottle of whiskey, and carrying it from the bar-room and breaking it, may well be considered together in connection with other circumstances tending to show his guilt. The evidence was rightly admitted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>147 Mass. 401. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>148 Mass. 14. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gillon, </em>148 Mass. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled!.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
