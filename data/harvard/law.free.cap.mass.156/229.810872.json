O\u2019Brien\u2019s acts upon the defendant\u2019s premises were competent, as furnishing some reason to infer that he was acting in the defendant\u2019s interests, under his employment; especially when taken in connection with the subsequent evidence that he was with the defendant when the latter applied for a license to keep the premises in question as a hotel. Common<em>wealth </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>145 Mass. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">2. Bailey\u2019s testimony that empty lager beer bottles were found on August 19th, which were not there on July 8th, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>some tendency to show a replenishing of the stock after the former seizure, and to support the charge of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\">3. It was competent to show that the defendant applied for and obtained a license, to identify him as keeper of the premises. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>143 Mass. 23. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>124 Mass. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">4. It was for the court to determine whether sufficient notice had been given to warrant the introduction of secondary evidence of the license. This was a preliminary question of fact, and we are unable to say that the determination of the court that sufficient notice had been given was wrong. <em>Smith </em>v.
