Dawes died on July 9,1867, leaving a will, which was duly admitted to probate, containing the following provisions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-9\">\u201c I give, devise, and bequeath to my said husband, Henry Dawes, his heirs and assigns forever, my estate in Hanover Street in said Boston, being now numbered three hundred and sixty-three on said street, being the same premises described in a certain indenture of trust dated December 4th, A. d. 1845, recorded with Suffolk Deeds, Lib. 555, fol. 87. To have and to hold the same to him, my said husband, his heirs and assigns forever, in trust nevertheless for the following uses and purposes, to wit: in trust to let and manage the same as he may think best, without any dictation or interference whatever, and to pay over the net rents and income of the same, quarter-yearly, to my niece, Adaline L. E. Barnes (daughter of my sister Adaline Barnes) during her natural life, hereby giving to my said niece full power to devise said estate by will at her decease to such person or persons as she may elect.

Wilmer, </em>132 Mass. 131, and <em>Cumston </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>149 Mass. 243, but the distinctions pointed out do not seem to us to affect the rule established by those cases. In <em>Cumston </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>149 Mass. 243, 248, it is said in the opinion: \u201c The general rule is now well established in this Commonwealth, that a general residuary devise will operate as an execution of a power to dispose of property by will, unless there is something to show that .such was not the testator\u2019s intention.\u201d In <em>Sewall </em>v. <em>Wilmer, </em>132 Mass. 131, 134, it is said in the opinion: \u201c But in this Commonwealth the decisions in England since our Revolution and before the St. of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>7 Will. IV. &amp; 1 Vict. c. 26, \u00a7 27, have not been followed; the court has leaned toward the adoption of the rule, enacted by that statute .as to wills thereafter made in England, namely, that a general devise or bequest should be construed to include any real or personal estate of which the testator has a general power of appointment, unless a contrary intention should appear by his will,\u201d etc. The order must be,</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
