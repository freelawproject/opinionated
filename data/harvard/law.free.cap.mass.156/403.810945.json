A dispute arose over the second ballot, in which P. received fourteen, K. ten, and B. three votes, and there was one scattering vote, which the tellers and then the mayor declared to be illegible, and the mayor decided that no choice had been 'made. Some members thought that the vote was intended for P., and that it should \u2022 be counted for him. At a joint convention held two weeks thereafter, P. was declared elected a collector of taxes; the convention, without first attempting to remove K. for cause, under the St. of 1873, c. 154, \u00a7 13, voting that \u201c the third ballot, being the one which resulted in the choice of K. as collector of taxes, at the meeting of January 5th, be declared void.\u201d The board of aldermen refused to accept the bond of K, on the ground that he was not elected to the office, and that P. was elected. Held, on a petition for a writ of mandamus brought by K. against the board of aldermen, that the writ should issue declaring P. not elected to the office, and commanding him to refrain from usurping the office and performing the duties, and declaring K. to have been duly elected thereto, and commanding the board of aldermen to consider the bond presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>by him, and to accept or reject it as it might or might not be found satisfactory to them, and in the form required by law.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b424-3\">This court cannot compel the board of aldermen of a city to approve a bond which is required by the Pub.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"At85\">The use of the writ of mandamus to try the title to an office is unusual, but we are of opinion that in such a case a.s this it affords the speediest and best method of settling the dispute of two rival claimants of a municipal office. We have stated the reasons for this opinion in the recent case of <em>Luce </em>v. <em>Board of </em>Examiners, 153 Mass. 108, and the use of the writ for this purpose is not without authority. The report finds that all the allegations of the petition were proved. The material facts are, that at a joint convention of the city council held on January 5, 1892, pursuant to the St. of 1873, c. 154, \u00a7 13,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> two ballots were had without effecting an election, and that the convention \u201ctook a third ballot, on which all the members of the said city council voted, on which last named ballot the whole number of votes cast was twenty-eight (28), of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>your petitioner received fifteen (15), and one Daniel Proulx received thirteen (13), and that the mayor, who was presiding officer of said joint convention, declared that your petitioner was elected, \u2014 all of which proceedings of the said joint convention appear by the records thereof, . . . and that said joint convention dissolved.\u201d According to the record, a dispute arose over the second ballot, in which it appears that Daniel Proulx received 14 votes, the petitioner 10 votes, one Richard S. Burns 3 votes, and there was one scattering vote. The tellers reported that this scattering vote was not legibly written, and that they were unable to count it for any person. The mayor also examined this vote, decided that it was not legible, and that no choice had been made, and directed another ballot to be taken, which was done, and is the third ballot, at which the petitioner was declared elected. Some member's of the convention thought that the vote was intended for Mr. Proulx, and that it should be counted for him, and that he should be declared elected. The justice who heard the case has found, if it was competent for him so to find, \u201c that the paper should be counted as a ballot, and that the voter who cast it had not legibly expressed his choice.\u201d Without considering whether there is any absolute rule of law as to what should be done with a vote of this kind, it is plain that the mayor\u2019s decision on the facts was a reasonable one, and that it was for the tellers in the first instance, and then for the mayor, to make the decision. If the name on the vote could not be made out with reasonable certainty, it ought not to have been counted for any person; if the vote was cast by a member of the convention as a vote for a real, and not a fictitious person, it should have been counted in ascertaining the whole number of votes cast. The convention, by proceeding to another ballot, in which all the members voted, assented to the decision of the mayor\u2019, and the petitioner, having been elected on that ballot, and having been duly declared elected, and the convention then having been dissolved without taking any action affecting this declared result, the petitioner must be held to have been duly elected to the office. If there could have been an appeal to the convention from the decision of the mayor, none was taken. By the St. of 1873, c. 154, \u00a7 13, the officers therein named, of which the collector <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>of taxes is one, \u201c may be removed at any time by the city council for sufficient cause.\u201d The subsequent joint convention, held on January 19, 1892,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> at which Daniel Proulx was declared elected a collector of taxes, was not acting as the city council, and it did not attempt first to remove the petitioner from the office for cause, but proceeded to vote that \u201cthe third ballot, being the one which resulted in the choice of James C. Keough as collector of taxes, at the meeting of January 5th, be declared void.\u201d This was beyond the power of that convention. The result is, that the petitioner has been duly elected to the office of collector of taxes, and that Proulx has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\">The report finds \u201c that the board of aldermen refused to accept the bond of the petitioner for the proper performance of the duties of his office, on the ground that he was not elected to the office of tax collector, and that the respondent Proulx was elected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The records of the board of aldermen of the meeting held on February 2, 1892, show that, \u201c on the motion of Alderman Laporte, it was voted that the bond of James 0. Keough, as collector of taxes, be not accepted, as he is not recognized by this board as the legally elected tax collector.\u201d At a meeting of the board held on March 1, 1892, it was ordered that the records be \u201c corrected and amended so as to conform to the facts, by inserting in the vote relative to the rejection of the bond of James 0. Keough, at the end thereof, the following words: 1 And for other reasons.\u2019 \u201d And this appears of record. We have not been furnished with any of the ordinances of the city of Holyoke. The case has been argued on both sides on the theory that \u00a7 124 of the Pub. Sts. c. 27, is applicable to it, and that, by virtue of the Pub. Sts. c. 28, \u00a7 2, the board of aldermen in cities have the powers of selectmen. See St. 1878, c. 154, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 24. Section 124 of c. 27 of the Pub. Sts. is as follows : \u201c Every col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>lector shall give bond to the town, in such sum as the selectmen may require and with sureties to their satisfaction, for the faithful discharge of the duties of his office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\">It is not necessary to decide whether the amendment of. the record by the board of aldermen was within their power, or, if it was, whether it was competent for the justice who heard the case to find that there were no other reasons than, those mentioned in the first record. We cannot compel the board of aldermen to approve any particular bond, because it must be \u00e1 bond \u201cwith sureties to their satisfaction.\u201d As we have held that the petitioner was duly elected, unless he is thereafter removed for cause, it is the duty of the board of aldermen to approve his bond, if it is in such sum as they require, and is with sureties to their satisfaction, and in the form required by law. A writ of mandamus should issue declaring Daniel Proulx not elected to the office of collector of taxes, and commanding him to refrain from usurping the office and performing its duties, and declaring James C. Keough to have been duly elected to the office, and commanding the board of aldermen to .consider the bond presented by him, and to accept or reject it as it may or may not be found satisfactory to them, and in the form required by law.- <em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-9\"> The material portions of this section are as follows: \u201cThe city council [of Holyoke] shall, annually, as soon after their organization as may be convenient, elect by joint ballot in convention, a collector of taxes [and other officers], who shall hold their offices respectively for the term of one year, and until their successors shall be chosen and qualified; <em>provided, how</em>ever, that either of the officers named in this section may be removed at any time by the city council for sufficient cause.
