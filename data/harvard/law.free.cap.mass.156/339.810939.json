The writ is dated May 16, 1890, and the declaration is on an account annexed, and the account annexed is in the form of a debit of the defendant to the plaintiff for \u201c services in relation to making title to flats on Albany Street, viz.: \u201d and then follows a general description of the services, which consist of an examination of the title, conferences and advice, numerous interviews and correspondence, \u201c entry on the land for foreclosure, with witnesses, and making and filing certificate of entry,\u201d etc., without any specification of the date of any particular service. The account is dated \u201c Boston, May 19, 1890,\u201d at the head of it. We think that on the face of the account it does not purport to declare that all the services were performed on that date, or on one day. The defendant has not set up in his answer that the services were performed after the date of the writ. Apparently, no such question of fact was raised before the auditor or at the trial. The jury might well have found that the auditor had found that the services had been performed before the suit was brought, and that the date of the account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>annexed was a clerical mistake. The court rightly refused to rule, as matter of law, that it appeared from the pleadings and evidence that the cause of action did not accrue until after the date of the plaintiff's writ. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"ALDt\"><em>J.
