The plaintiff testified:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-11\">\u201cAs I came to the corner,.just about got to the crossing to turn the corner of Oak Street to go down toward the Boston and Albany freight, coming up here, the avenue, I saw this team commencing to turn this corner. [Referring to a plan.] I was standing then right here, if you will notice, calling this the curbstone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-12\">\u201c After coming from Mr. Brennan\u2019s store I stood right on this corner. This heavy team, four-horse team, I don\u2019t know what you might call it, came right up here and turned down here, going on Oak Street towards the Boston and Albany freight, I suppose; I don\u2019t know where it was going, but it turned that way. While I waited there on this corner there was a lady waiting here on the corner, waiting to come across to go up the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>avenue, both of us waiting for this team to turn around. When the end of the team got out of my way, I leisurely turned across and up Oak Street, to go towards Washington Street, to cross Harrison Avenue. I had taken about three steps, or a little more, three or four, but I know I had got just about into the middle of the horse-car track.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-5\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>Now indicate where you were. <em>A. </em>Well, I got about here. This is the horse-car rails. I got about here, and I heard a rumbling noise; in an instant I turned quick, like that, and I saw this team on to me. I made a grab; when I found I could not get either way, either beyond or back, I made a grab for the bridle; at the same time I hollered; then I heard hollering from, it seemed to me, both men. I don\u2019t know who it was, it was so dark, but I could see the covered team that was on top of me. It seemed that the man turned around as I hollered, and I think he had the reins only in one hand; then he put the. two reins together ; he pulled the horse up; at the same time I was taken off my feet, something hit me in the forehead; I don\u2019t know but that it was the shaft nearest to the sidewalk that hit me in the forehead; I let a scream out of me; I dropped the bridle also, and dropped at the horses\u2019 feet insensible. The next thing that I remember was finding myself in my dining-room and the kitchen, and two gentlemen, one on each side of me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-6\">Edward Williams, fourteen years of age, a newsboy, testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-7\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>When did you see Mr. Purtell first? <em>A. </em>I did not see him until he was coming off of the curbstone, when he stepped off of the curbstone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-8\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>Do you remember of seeing any team there? <em>A. </em>There was a big jigger; it seemed to me it was going up Washington Street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-9\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>That was where? <em>A. </em>That was going from Oak to Washington Street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-10\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>You saw it go by, near Oak and Washington Streets ? <em>A. </em>Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-11\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>Did you see any other team besides that ? <em>A. </em>No, sir ; not that I can remember.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-12\">\u201c Q.'

That if the plaintiff, standing where he was on Harrison Avenue, could not, before he attempted to cross the street, by reason of the position and movement of the large team, see vehicles coming down Harrison Avenue and approaching Oak Street, he was not in the exercise of due care in attempting to cross the street until such obstacle to his view was removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-11\">\u201c 5. If, when the plaintiff started to cross Harrison Avenue, he could not see defendants\u2019 team approaching by reason of the position of the large team, and attempted to cross so closely to the rear of the large team that he could not see defendants\u2019 team approaching until he got by the large team, he was not in the exercise of due care.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-12\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-13\"><em>J.

The jury might also have found that the plaintiff was using such care as persons of ordinary prudence are accus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>tamed to exercise under like circumstances. The court rightly refused to order a verdict for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The defendants requested the presiding justice to instruct the jury as follows: \u201c That if the plaintiff, standing where he was on Harrison Avenue, could not, before he attempted to cross the street, by reason of the position and movement of the large team, see vehicles coming down Harrison Avenue and approaching Oak Street, he was not in the exercise of due care in attempting to cross the street until such obstacle to his view was removed. If, when the plaintiff started to cross Harrison Avenue, he could not see defendants\u2019 team approaching by reason of the position of the large team, and attempted to cross so closely to the rear of the large team that he could not see defendants\u2019 team approaching until be got by the large team, he was not in the exercise of due care.\u201d It is urged, in behalf of the defendants, that it is always negligent for a pedestrian in the streets of Boston to attempt to cross behind a high loaded team until the team has passed so far as to enable him to see that no other team is coming from behind it on the other side. We cannot lay this down as a legal proposition. <em>Bowser </em>v. Wellington, 126 Mass. 391. <em>Skapleigh </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>134 Mass. 118. The circumstances of different cases so vary, and the natural and usual methods of crossing our crowded streets are so affected by facts and influences which are difficult of statement, and which are seldom found twice in the same combination, that there are few rules of law which can be arbitrarily laid down in reference to the effect of particular acts. When a pedestrian is run over by a team on a street, the question whether there was negligence on his part, or on the part of the driver of the team, or on the part of both of them, is usually a question of fact, to be decided by the jury. One passing behind a loaded team which obstructs his view has no such reason to apprehend danger from a team driven in the opposite direction, when he hears nothing, as he would have if he were crossing over one track of a railroad to another on which a rapidly moving train might be coming. Of course he should take precautions, and endeavor to ascertain whether he is exposing himself to danger. But in view of the rate of speed at which horses are ordinarily driven in crowded streets, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>control which is usually exercised over them, to determine what precautions are necessary to prevent being run over is commonly a matter of fact, and not of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">We are of opinion that the instructions requested were rightly refused. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
