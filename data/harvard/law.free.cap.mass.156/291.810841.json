M. to two o\u2019clock P. M. on the same day; and that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was three years, one month, and ten days old at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\">The plaintiff and another witness testified that the boy was large, strong, and intelligent, and for two or three months before the accident had been in the habit of walking on this sidewalk, and by the point where the hole was dug, to meet his father, who came home to dinner generally between twelve and one o\u2019clock P. M.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-6\">The mother testified that she had been washing clothes on the morning of the accident, and hanging them, out in the yard; that the child was playing therein, and that she. knew nothing about this hole in the sidewalk, and did not know that the defendants, or their servants, were engaged in digging the same until after the accident; that about twelve o\u2019clock she went into the house to set the table for dinner, and left her child playing alone just inside the open gateway leading into Williams Street; and that the child was found in the hole ten or fifteen minutes after she left him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-7\">The defendants asked the court to rule that, upon the foregoing evidence, the plaintiff in each action could not recover, because, as matter of law, the evidence showed contributory negligence on the part of the mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-8\">The court declined so to rule, and left the cases to the jury, under instructions otherwise acceptable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-9\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in each case; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>H.

The case was left to the jury, under instructions as to what would constitute. contributory negligence on her part, to which no exception was taken, and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in each case. We think that the refusal of the court to rule that the evidence showed, as matter of law, that there was contributory negligence by the mother was correct, and that there was evidence to warrant the verdicts of the jury. <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>135 Mass. 333. <em>Marsland </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>148 Mass. 91. <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Union Street Railway, </em>150 Mass. 86. <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>O'Connell, </em>153 Mass. 94. <em>\u00a1Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
