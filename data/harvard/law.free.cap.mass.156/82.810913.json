At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Hammond, </em>J., it appeared that the defendants signed the subscription paper in question. In defence they offered to show that one Harriman, as a solicitor of subscriptions for the capital stock of the corporation which was to be formed at some time after the subscription was made, asked the defendant Herman C. Tower to subscribe; that Tower said that, if the subscribers were going to mortgage tlie property to be bought with the subscriptions, his subscription would be merely nominal, but that if they would raise the full amount by subscription and not mortgage the property he would subscribe for ten shares, or five hundred dollars\u2019 worth ; that Harriman thereupon asked him to subscribe with that understanding, but he declined to do it; that, Harriman urging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>again that he should subscribe upon that understanding, Tower said that he would put down his name if it was understood between them that that was the condition of his subscription, and upon this assurance from Harriman he did subscribe at the time for that amount; that thereafter Harriman reported to the meeting of the subscribers the condition of the defendants\u2019 subscription, and that in consequence of that report the meeting voted \u201cthat there shall be no mortgage on the property\u201d; that thereafter, and before anything was done by the subscribers, one of them, then active in their affairs and later president of the corporation, informed Tower that they intended to rescind the vote whereby they voted not to mortgage; that thereupon Tower told this gentleman that, if they so voted, he would n\u2019t pay a penny of his subscription; that this information had come to the ears of a number of the subscribers, that thereafter, namely, upon August 31, 1889, they voted, \u201cthat the vote whereby we voted, August 14, 1889, not to place a mortgage on the property, be rescinded \u201d; that thereafter the subscribers formed a corporation, and the corporation did, on April 1, 1890, place a mortgage for $17,000 upon the property. The defendants further offered to show that nothing had been done by the subscribers, in consequence of the subscriptions, before the revocation by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-4\">The court ruled that this would not constitute a defence, and directed a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-5\"><em>J.

Until the organization of the corporation, the subscription is a \u2022 mere proposition or offer, which may be withdrawn, like any other unaccepted offer. Unless the signer is bound upon a contract, he is not bound at all. ' It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>is open to him to withdraw. It is not on the ground that there was no sufficient consideration. The seal would do away with any doubt on that score. But it is on the ground that tor the time being and until the corporation is organized the writing does not take effect as a contract, because the contemplated party to the contract, on the other side, is not yet in existence, and for this reason, there being no contract, the whole undertaking is inchoate and incomplete, and since there is no contract the party may withdraw. <em>Limerick Academy </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>11 Mass. 113. <em>Thompson </em>v.
