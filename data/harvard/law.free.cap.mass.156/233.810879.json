Sts. c. 100, \u00a7 10; and that he sold the liquor to Markham without requiring from him a certificate of the use for which the same was wanted. The defendant contended that the complaint should contain a specific allegation setting forth the omission to require such certificate, in order properly to describe the offence shown by the agreed facts; and requested the presiding judge to rule that the offence was not set forth with sufficient fulness and precision. The judge refused so to rule, and ruled that the complaint was sufficient; and to this ruling and refusal to rule the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">We are of opinion that no error appears. By the Pub. Sts. c. 100, \u00a7 1, \u201c f\u00edo person shall sell, or expose or keep for sale, spirituous or intoxicating liquor, except as authorized in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>chapter.\u201d Section 10 provides for \u201c Licenses to druggists and apothecaries to sell liquors of any kind for medicinal, mechanical, and chemical purposes only, and to such persons only as may certify in writing for what use they want it.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ajzx\"><em>C. H. Conant, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AMD\"><em>C. H. Harris, </em>Second Assistant Attorney General, (6r. <em>C. Travis, </em>First Assistant Attorney General, with him,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b254-3\">The complaint was not, in form, for a violation of the condition of the license, but for making an unlawful sale under \u00a7 1. The defendant had authority to sell only so far as his license authorized him to do so; and this was only to such persons as should certify in writing for what use they wanted the liquor. The agreed facts showed an unlawful sale, and such a sale was sufficiently described in the complaint. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rafferty, </em>133 Mass. 574. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O'Brien, </em>134 Mass. 198. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Towle, </em>138 Mass. 490. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>138 Mass. 511. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Luddy, </em>143 Mass. 563. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusie, </em>145 Mass. 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The fact that the St. of 1889, c. 114, so amends the Pub.
