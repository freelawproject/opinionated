However, the court in <em>Honig </em>never addressed the issue of \u201ccompensatory education.\u201d The issue in <em>Honig </em>was whether a student could be suspended while expulsion proceedings were pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-18\">Federal courts before and after <em>Honig </em>have granted what has been called \u201ccompensatory education,\u201d in which the school district has been required to provide further education beyond the normal age to which the Act applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-19\">Compensatory education has been granted to those overage students who have been able to show that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>had failed to provide a free appropriate education during the years it was obligated to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We agree with the United States Court of Appeals in <em>Lester H. </em>v. <em>Gilhool </em>(C.A. 3, 1990), 916 F. 2d 865, 872, which held that <em>Honig </em>does not preclude an award of compensatory education beyond the age of entitlement for the denial of an appropriate education before age twenty-two.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">It is thus <em>possible </em>that the hearing officer <em>could </em>have ordered compensatory education after a finding that the student did not receive a free appropriate education.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Accordingly, the court of appeals\u2019 ruling that the hearing officer was without jurisdiction is error since it precluded him from considering the issue of possible compensatory education.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Since we find that appellant had jurisdiction to conduct the hearing on this substantive basis, we need not address his other arguments based on procedural grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the writ of prohibition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-13\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
