We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-24\">Appellant contends that he is entitled to \u00a7 2255 relief because the district court refused to appoint a fellow inmate \u201cjailhouse lawyer\u201d to represent him at his second trial. On retrial after a reversal by this Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lepiscopo was again convicted and that judgment was affirmed on direct appeal. United States v. Lepiscopo, 5th Cir. 1970, 429 F.2d 258, cert. denied 1970, 400 U.S. 948, 91 S.Ct. 255, 27 L.Ed.2d 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-25\">The district court stated findings and conclusions in its final order in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-26\">\u201cAt both trials petitioner waived counsel and ably conducted his own defense. Notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s waiver, able counsel was appointed to represent him. At the court\u2019s request counsel was present in the courtroom at all times during trial and available to petitioner. Furthermore, the court knows of no constitutional authority which commands that an inmate defendant is entitled to have a \u2018jailhouse lawyer\u2019 appointed to represent him.\u201d (Footnotes omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-27\">We agree with the district court\u2019s ruling. On the appellant\u2019s later direct appeal, we held that \u201cThe record amply illustrates that . . . [Lepiscopo] was competent to waive, and did validly waive, representation of counsel in the entire proceedings below. It is further apparent that Lepiscopo ably and ag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>gressively served as his own counsel with a degree of competence which few laymen could exceed.\u201d 429 F.2d at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">There can be no doubt that a defendant in a criminal case has the right to assistance of counsel. Johnson v. Zerbst, 1938, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461; Gideon v. Wainwright, 1962, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed. 2d 799. Nevertheless, an accused also has the right to defend himself at his trial, provided that he has knowingly, understandingly and voluntarily waived his right to the assistance of counsel. <em>See </em>Hawkins v. United States, 5th Cir. 1970, 434 F.2d 738, 739; United States v. Odom, 9th Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 875; Minor v. United States, 8th Cir. 1967, 375 F.2d 170, cert. denied 1967, 389 U.S. 882, 88 S.Ct. 131, 19 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Here there is a strong showing of valid waiver of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">A person accused of a criminal offense \u201cis entitled to such counsel as is reasonably likely to render and who does render reasonably effective assistance.\u201d Moore v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1972, 458 F.2d 386. The courts are not required, however, to furnish an indigent defendant with any particular attorney who may be desired. <em>See </em>Brown v. Craven, 9th Cir. 1970, 424 F.2d 1166, 1170; Raullerson v. Patterson, D.Colo. 1967, 272 F.Supp. 495. This latter rule is all the more applicable to a \u201cjailhouse lawyer,\u201d who is unlikely to have any formal training in the law, and who would not be subject to the ethical obligations which are imposed on members of the bar. Indeed, Lepiscopo\u2019s fellow inmate would be prohibited by the district court\u2019s Local Rules from practicing before it because he is not a member of the bar.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">It seems hardly necessary to add that the appellant\u2019s reliance on Johnson v. Avery, 1969, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718, is misplaced. In the <em>Johnson </em>case the Supreme Court held that \u201cunless and until the State provides some reasonable alternative to assist inmates in the preparation of petitions for post-conviction relief, it may not validly enforce a regulation such as that here in issue, barring inmates from furnishing such assistance to other prisoners.\u201d 393 U.S. at 490, 89 S.Ct. at 751. At both of Lepiscopo\u2019s trials, however, the district court offered him full and proper assistance of counsel, which he chose to waive.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-29\">.
