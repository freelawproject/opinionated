ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b658-16\">This case is before the court on appellant\u2019s motion for release from custody pending his appeal from a conviction of violation of the federal narcotic laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Appellant was arrested by police officers who, armed with a warrant, entered and searched an apartment wherein he and three others were present, and uncovered a substantial quantity of heroin and various items of narcotics paraphernalia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An indictment was subsequently returned against appellant and two of the others,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and he was granted pretrial release on personal bond.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Some thirteen months later, following a ten-day trial, appellant was found guilty by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Upon return of the verdict, the trial judge directed that custody of appellant be resumed. At sentencing, the judge imposed a mandatory five-year term of imprisonment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and refused to enlarge appellant pending his contemplated appeal. In denying bail,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the judge, relying on provisions of the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> setting standards for the District, ruled that appellant had not satisfied the criteria specified in that legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-14\">Subsequent to the sentencing, this court held that applications for release of persons convicted in the District under federal criminal statutes having nationwide application, as was appellant,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> must be considered under the Bail Reform Act of 1966 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and not the Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thereafter appellant, having formalized an appeal from his conviction, moved the trial judge for reconsideration. The judge denied the motion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the bail application was renewed in this court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We entered an order remanding the record to the District Court for an acceptable statement of the reasons which led the trial judge to keep appellant in confinement. Our order stated that this opinion for the court would follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The Bail Reform Act requires release of a convicted defendant pending an appeal unless the appeal is frivolous or a procrastinating maneuver, or unless there is reason to believe that no conditions of release will reasonably assure that he will not flee or pose a danger to another or to the community.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Act thus reflects a policy strongly favoring posttrial as well as pretrial release,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but both its structure and its interpretation underscore the delicacy of the determinations which must precede any ruling on that score.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A conclusion as to whether \u201can appeal is frivolous or taken for delay\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> demands a careful exploration into its potentialities on the merits and the seriousness of its underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>purpose.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Save for situations where the unlikelihood of flight or community danger is relatively plain, the judicial decision hangs on the availability and capability of conditions to reduce those risks to a level of reasonable safety.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Act directs that that determination be made on the basis of what the judge \u201chas reason to believe,\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the process of deriving a belief one way or the other is ofttimes an exacting task. For \u201creason to believe that\u201d an imposition of conditions will or will not \u201creasonably assure\u201d against flight or dangerousness<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cinvolve [s] an attempt to predict future behavior on the basis of present information\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and requires a close weighing of the probabilities in light of the relevant circumstances.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">Not surprisingly, then, initial resolution of an application for release pending appeal is a function historically committed to trial judges.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It cannot be gainsaid that \u201cthe keynote to successful administration of any system of bail is the adequacy of the information upon which the decisions are based.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The need for ample information is particularly acute to investigations of potential danger to the community, findings relative to which, as has aptly been said, \u201cmust rest on a \u2018scrupulous inquiry\u2019 into appellant\u2019s past, his prospects if released, and conditions of release to mitigate the danger.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The trial court is not only the traditional but also the superior tribunal for the kind of information-gathering which a sound foundation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>a bail ruling almost inevitably requires. For it is there that, at a hearing, the judge can come face-to-face with the primary informational sources, and probe for what is obscure, trap what is elusive, and settle what is controversial. It is there, too, that the judge has at his disposal \u201cthe judicial machinery necessary to marshal the facts typically relevant to the release inquiry.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Indeed, \u201cas a practical matter only the District Court can conduct the \u2018scrupulous inquiry\u2019<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and make the findings contemplated . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Moreover, the trial judge\u2019s familiarity with the case ordinarily enables ready association of the relevant facts in appropriate relationships with the criteria governing release from custody. The judge's role in evolving trial evidence and his observation of the accused\u2019s trial demeanor often imparts to those facts a significance not discernible from the paper record upon which bail decisions in appellate courts must be achieved.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Findings on the risks of danger or flight, and on the efficacy of particular conditions of release to sufficiently minimize those risks, are obviously enriched by a feel of the case that comes only from participation in the live trial. The respect we customarily accord the district judge\u2019s determinations<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> attests the value of his appraisal of the intangibles which ultimately make or break the case for bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">So, even prior to the Bail Reform Act, our settled practice called for submission of applications for release pending appeal to the District Court for decision in the first instance.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> With the advent of the Federal Rules of Crim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>inal Procedure,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> that practice became a uniform requirement in all federal judicial circuits. Rule 38(c) provided that motions in courts of appeals for release pending appeal must show that prior application to a district judge had been made and denied or was impracticable,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and nothing in the scheme of the Bail Reform Act signaled a change in that regard.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> More recently, Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure has explicated that \u201c[application for release after a judgment of conviction shall be made in the first instance in the district court\u201d, and that only \u201c[thereafter\u201d could \u201ca motion for release, or for modification of the conditions of release, pending review be made to the court of appeals or to a judge thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Since jurisdiction of a court of appeals attaches immediately upon the filing of a notice of appeal,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> this requirement did not spring from any lack of power on that court\u2019s part to deal with bail matters from the very beginning. It emanated instead from recognition that initial processing by the trial judge was apt to make a contribution to any consideration of bail that might later be required at another level.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">Appellate Rule 9(b) couples a second requirement to the one that release pending appeal be first sought in the trial court. It is that the trial judge state in writing his reasons in the event that release is either denied or conditioned.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Quite obviously, the values of initial consideration by a district judge are lost to the extent that the significance he assigned to the various and often conflicting factors \u2014 legal and factual \u2014 is left unknown. Without the settling effect of a reasoned treatment of the relevant information by the judge, we are apt to confront \u201ca welter of assertion and counter-assertion [by the parties] . . . from which we have no adequate means of emerging.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Without elucidation of the bases for the judge\u2019s action, we cannot fairly evaluate the merits of either the application or the judge\u2019s decision thereon. As we have had occasion to point out, \u201c[t]he District Judge\u2019s reasoning must be delineated both out of fairness to the appellant and as an aid to this court in its role in bail administration.\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We read the twin specifications of Rule 9(b)\u2014 that applications for release pending appeal be first adjudicated in district courts and that district judges supply their reasons for dispositions other than unconditional release \u2014 as a mandate that circuit judges give those reasons respectful consideration in arriving at their own decisions on bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">In Weaver v. United States,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> we defined the trial judge\u2019s duty in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">The District Judge should indicate not only which one or more of [the statutory] reasons has prompted him to deny release, but should also delineate the basis for his utilization of such reason or reasons. If he deems the appeal frivolous, he should state the considerations, legal and factual, which led him to that conclusion. If he views appellant\u2019s release as posing a risk of danger or flight, he should point to those factors in the record which foreshadow such a possibility. He should also inquire concerning available financial and nonfinancial conditions of release and offer reasons why they do not \u201cassure that the person will not flee or pose a danger to any other person or to the community.\u201d <footnotemark>40</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">We added that \u201c[o]nly when these reasons are spelled out can an appellant intelligently renew his motion before this court; and only then can this court fairly review the merits.\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">In the case at bar, we are not favored with a Weaver-type statement of the trial judge\u2019s reasons for denying appellant\u2019s release pending appeal. The judge\u2019s response to Rule 9(b) is little more than a recitation of certain of the procedural events during the prosecution and an expression of opinion that release conditions would not suitably safeguard against flight or dangerousness.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Vague insinuations aside, no facts which might augur risks of that magnitude are identified, and no reasons why an imposition of conditions might not sufficiently minimize them is offered. The statement <em>Weaver </em>envisions must fairly explain the judge\u2019s ruling in order that it may be intelligently reviewed. The statement with which we are presented is wholly conclusory and in no way comports with <em>Weaver </em>standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In this milieu, we confront a problem which we have had to face in the past: the course appropriately to be taken when a trial judge has failed to comply with Rule 9(b). Our decisions have traveled each of two possible routes, according to whether an opportunity for a solid decision by this court on bail was present. Where the relevant facts have been clear enough to lead convincingly to but one conclusion on release, we have resolved the question ourselves without a remand for a further statement of reasons.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> We have followed the same course in situations where it appeared that the cause of elucidation would not be served by a remand.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> But where we have felt unable to soundly resolve the bail issue on the information available to us and a further call upon the trial judge promised real assistance, we have remanded for suitable amplification of the Rule 9(b) statement.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> That, we think, is the disposition incumbent upon us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">The question at hand is not the standard by which we are to decide motions for release from custody during the pendency of an appeal. The question is whether we can justifiably proceed to any decision without soliciting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>from the trial judge conceivably helpful information we do not have. Our duty in the statutory scheme is to insure against indiscriminate administration of bail and, indubitably, \u201c[t]he function of this court on a bail application pending appeal ... is not merely appellate but includes the duty to make an independent determination of all relevant factors.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Once all pertinent information has been developed by the parties and subjected to the decision-making process by the trial judge, we are accorded leeway in assessing the merits of both the information and the judge\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> But this does not mean that we are free to ignore the reasons assigned by a trial judge for his action<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> or, except where the ruling properly to be made on release is very clear, to adjudicate the application when the judge has neglected a statement of reasons.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The requirement that the trial judge furnish such a statement, we have said, is a direction that we in turn consider it, with all the deference it is due.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> We can no more remain faithful to our responsibilities by venturing a decision when potentially valuable views of the trial judge remain unknown than when other material information remains ungathered.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">We cannot proceed confidently to a resolution of the present appellant\u2019s bail motion without an expression of the trial judge\u2019s reasons for denying it. The information before us does not point inexorably to a single conclusion; rather, in critical respects, it lends itself to duplicitous interpretations. On the one hand is appellant\u2019s impressive showing, predicated largely on personal and family ties to the District,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> the absence of any substantial prior criminal record;<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> a good performance on pretrial release,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> and the offer of a home and a job pending appeal.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> On the other hand, appellant has been found guilty of a heinous offense,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> he admits to past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>use of narcotics,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> and he faces five years in prison without hope of probation or parole.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Contrary to the appraisal of our dissenting colleague, we do not rate the case for bail \u201coverwhelming\u201d <footnotemark>58</footnotemark> or a grant of release \u201cinescapable.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> We are completely in the dark as to the treatment the trial judge gave the circumstances we already know and, beyond that, more remarkable indicia of nonreleasability may reside in circumstances we do not know.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> We cannot afford to discount either possibility; the judge revoked appellant\u2019s bail immediately upon return of the jury\u2019s verdict and, when asked to reconsider, stated emphatically that no conditions of release could provide a reasonable assurance against flight or danger to the community. On the information before us we could not be nearly so positive, but we realize that we lack the benefit of the judge\u2019s thinking as well as his observations of and impressions from the ten-day trial at which he presided.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In this state of affairs, both principle and reason caution against an attempt to assess and safeguard against the risks of flight and community danger which may be incidental to appellant\u2019s enlargement. Our current predicament is comparable to that in which we found ourselves in United States v. Jackson,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> where we were forced to remand a record similarly unrevealing :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-13\">We do not know whether the District Judge deemed appellant a potential fugitive or a potential menace to the community, or in either event precisely why. Nor do we know just what consideration he may have given to an imposition of conditions with a view to minimizing the risks of flight and danger. These, of course, are initially subjects for the District Judge\u2019s inquiry and decision, and we intimate no view as to them. On the contrary, our practice is to defer to the District Judge\u2019s determinations when deference is due, in preference to a de novo investigation and ruling on our own \u2014either for or against release. With evidence here pointing both ways on the issues of flight and danger, we cannot intelligently perform our review responsibilities without an understanding of the District Judge\u2019s decisional basis.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">We realize, of course, that remands necessitated by failures to observe the commands of Rule 9(b) may occasion some encroachment on the accused\u2019s right to a speedy resolution on bail.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> That enroachment, however, need not be more than slight. A remand simply calls upon the trial judge for an articulation of reasons he already has. Prompt compliance with the remand order is expected, and indeed may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>required.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The truth of the matter is that the judge can act responsively about as quickly as we can de novo. Thus we discern no substantial incompatibility between promptness and soundness in bail determinations.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> To scrap a remand in this case is not only to uproot previous decisions of this court <footnotemark>67</footnotemark> but also to emasculate the wholesome policies undergirding the scheme of the Bail Reform Act and the implementing Rules.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> We admonish counsel and trial judges alike to tap every available source of information potentially helpful to a solid decision on releasibility.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> As judges likewise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>charged with administration of the bail system, we are not at liberty to do less,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">. \u201cWhoever fraudulently or knowingly imports or brings any narcotic drug into the United States or any territory under its control or jurisdiction, contrary to law, or receives, conceals, buys, sells, or in any manner facilitates the transportation, concealment, or sale of any such narcotic drug after being imported or brought in, knowing the same to have been imported or brought into the United States contrary to law, or conspires to commit any of such acts in violation of the laws of the United States, shall be imprisoned not less than five or more than twenty years and, in addition, may be fined not more than $20,000.

So, unlike our dissenting colleague, <em>post </em>pp. 589, 590, 591, we cannot attach great importance to the circumstance that the written record before us may be the same as that which was before the trial judge. In every case in which bail pending appeal is sought in this court, that is so or can be made so simply by the process of supplementation. If identity of record were the redeeming virtue in bail-pending-appeal cases, little or nothing would be served by the requirements that the trial judge make the initial decision, text <em>infra </em>at notes 30-35, and furnish a statement of his reasons for an adverse ruling, <em>infra </em>Part II. Compliance with these requirements is ordinarily the safeguard assuring that significant considerations not apparent from the paper record are gotten before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b662-12\">.

On May 21, 1971, defendant was found guilty by a jury of receipt and concealment of narcotic drugs knowing same to have been imported contrary to law, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-16\">2. The evidence introduced at trial was more than sufficient to sustain defendant\u2019s conviction and the Court can recall no error in that proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-17\">3. During defendant\u2019s pre-sentence interview he admitted using narcotics during his employment as a Metropolitan Police Department officer, and re-affirmed this fact at sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-19\">4. On August 2, 1971, defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years, the <em>minimum </em>sentence permitted for a violaion of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-20\">5. On that same date, this Court, <em>sua spante, </em>determined that defendant should not be released pending appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-21\">6. On October 27, 1971, defendant filed the within motion, arguing that this Court erred in referring to 23 D.C. Code \u00a7 1325 for the appropriate standards for judging release pending appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-22\">II. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-23\">1. The appropriate standard for judging release pending appeal following a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3146 and 3148, as determined in United States v. Benjamin Thompson, [147 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 452 F.2d 1333] D.C.Cir. No. 71-1182 decided October 7, 1971; i. e., subsequent to denial of defendant's release on August 2, 1971.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-24\">2. By reason of the foregoing findings this Court is of the opinion that no one or more conditions of release as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>outlined in IS U.S.C. \u00a7 3146 will reasonably assure that defendant will not flee or pose a danger to any other (jerson or to the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">We note that the judge\u2019s statement only obliquely opines that appellant\u2019s appeal is frivolous. See \u00b6 2. Appellant claims error in instructing and failing to instruct the jury, in admitting evidence allegedly hearsay, and in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">We express no opinion on the merits of these contentions save that we are satisfied that nonfrivolous issues are presented.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b665-9\">.

That we have frequently done in the past.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b668-5\">. This is the point of departure for the majority and dissenting approaches in this case. Motions for release pending appeal are to be passed on \u201cpromptly.\u201d Fed.R. App.P. 9(b). Compare the similar provisions in the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3147 (b) (appeal from imposition of conditions on pretrial release). See also Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 4, 72 S.Ct. 1, 96 L.Ed. 3 (1951) (pretrial release). That is not to say, as the dissent appears to argue, <em>post </em>pp. 589-590, that Rule 9 outlaws remands consequent upon omitted or inadequate statements of reasons. With a view to expedition, the Rule identifies the steps prerequisite in the trial court and streamlines the paperwork for appellate consideration, but it hardly sacrifices sound decision-making on the altar of speed. That is evident, if not from logic, from the admonition that \u201c[ejqually important to the just and speedy disposition of [bail] appeals is the requirement that the district court state the reasons for its decision.\u201d Advisory Committee Note Rule 9(a). The dissent, moreover, mislabels our purpose, which is not a \u201cforay [] for more evidence,\u201d <em>post </em>p. 589, but a quest for reasons; and distorts our position, which is not \u201cthat we will remand the record whenever a District Court judge has failed adequately to state reasons\u201d <em>post </em>p. 590, but rather is that we are obliged to do so when we cannot act responsibly otherwise, see text <em>supra </em>at notes 43-45.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b668-8\">. Seemingly, the position in dissent <em>(post </em>p. 590) is that this court, in lieu of remanding, should proceed to resolve applications for bail pending appeal in all instances where the judge has failed to supply an acceptable statement of reasons for his actions. We have declined that invitation, even on plainer records, in the past, <em>e. g., </em>United States v. Jackson, <em>supra </em>note 14, 135 U.S.App.D.C. at 209-210, 417 F.2d at 1156-1157, and we are not persuaded that we should accept it now. We do not agree that remands of this type are potentially fruitless, or that we are free to ignore the clear implications of Fed.R.App.P. 9(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b668-11\">. The extremes to which the dissent is forced illustrate the point. It argues that the statement of reasons Rule 9(b) explicitly requires need not be brought to our attention; indeed, that we may \u201cact without interposing the trial court\u201d. <em>Post </em>p. 589. We in the majority would not tolerate such practices. It also argues that since we cannot be certain that the trial judge was right in concluding that appellant is apt to flee or menace the community, we should exercise our discretion in favor of releasing him until we are sure. We think the Rule accepts the wisdom of our remand in the circumstances here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b668-12\">. See Febre v.

I also share the view that the statement of reasons in this case is little more than a parroting of the statute and insufficient to satisfy the demands of Fed.R.App.P. 9(b) and our case law. My disagreement goes only to the issue of the proper disposition in this court. I believe that the letter and spirit of the governing rules require both that we reach the substantive issues in this motion now and that we order Stanley released, subject to conditions, pending determination of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The majority justifies its remand of this record by invoking Fed.R.App.P. 9(b) in support of its assertion that \u201cappraisal of the intangibles which ultimately make or break the case for bail\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> can best be performed by the District Court. In my opinion the Court misconceives the thrust of both the rule and our decisions construing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">The overriding purpose of the procedural requirements of the rule is <em>expedition </em>\u2014 even at some expense to the \u201ctraditional\u201d role of the trial court. The Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes make clear that the provision for trial court determination in the first instance was in no way intended to discourage appellate courts from acting: \u201c[Sjpeedy determination [of the motion is necessary] if relief is to be effective.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To this end the rule provides that if the District Court refuses release or imposes conditions, it must state its reasons, and the appellant may then move the Court of Appeals to order his release or lift conditions. If read without reference to the narrow exception added by our case law, the rule then commands us to <em>determine </em>that motion, not hold it while we engage in forays for more evidence. Indeed, it goes on to specify that the evi-dentiary basis of our decision is to be \u201csuch papers, affidavits, and portions of the record as the parties shall present\u201d; <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> thus leaving to the parties the decision whether to put the trial court\u2019s opinion and underlying record into evidence. And not only does the rule contemplate that we will act without interposing the trial court, but it also explicitly empowers us to order the movant\u2019s release pending our determination of the motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The majority, however, today chooses to invoke the judicially created exception and ignore the urgency permeating the rule itself. This choice leads the Court to hold the motion, remand the record to the District Court, and let Stanley continue to suffer his second year of post-trial incarceration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this I think it goes too far. Our decision in Weaver v. United States<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> did, it is true, require that the District Court state its reasons for attaching conditions to release altogether. But the basis for that holding was a belief that requiring such a statement in all subsequent cases would facilitate an expeditious determination of subsequent motions addressed to this Court. <em>Weaver </em>should not be read, particularly in light of our later experience, as an announcement that we will remand the record <em>whenever </em>a District Court judge has failed adequately to state reasons. Every additional proceeding required in these cases imposes an additional denial of liberty on the moving appellant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, to remand is to punish the movant solely because the trial court denied him his clear statutory right \u2014 a statement of reasons. The emasculation of the Bail Reform Act of 1966 that the Court fears, if not already a fact, will come through the application of logic like this rather than through any abandonment of the trial court. The <em>Weaver </em>remand, as an exception necessary to correct trial court errors, cannot be made the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">The Court acknowledges that \u201cremands necessitated by [trial court] failures to observe the commands of Rule 9(b) may occasion some encroachment on the accused\u2019s right to a speedy resolution on bail.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It justifies giving short shrift to the rule\u2019s contrary command by observing, first, that the trial judge has viewed the demeanor of the movant at trial, and, second, that there may be some \u201cremarkable indicia of nonreleasibility ... in circumstances we do not know.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Again, I think that Rule 9(b) itself strikes the balance between the advantages of testimonial inferences and the necessity of a speedy determination, and strikes it wisely at least as regards the two classes of inference hypothesized by the Court here.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">The value of predictions of future conduct based on observations of a defendant\u2019s behavior during the extraordinary stress of trial has itself been severely questioned by insightful trial judges.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Here even less is possible, for a remand will not produce the unrecorded observations of a prescient witness; but only the faded recollections of a busy judge. I cannot countenance, nor believe that the rule permits, the saeri-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>fice of what may be months of freedom to the pursuit of such chimera.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">I similarly reject the Court\u2019s speculation that the trial judge may have been possessed of some \u201cremarkable indicia of nonreleasibility\u201d that were not only outside the record, but that the trial judge thought unnecessary even to mention in his statement of reasons. I cannot take account of such a remote and improper possibility.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Since I conclude that we have no justification for returning the record to the District Court, I turn to the merits of this motion. The Bail Reform Act of 1966 requires that a convicted offender be released pending appeal unless the court finds that the appeal is frivolous or taken for delay, or unless no one or more conditions of release will reasonably assure that the person will not flee or pose a danger to any other person or to the community.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Since no one asserts that Stanley\u2019s appeal is frivolous, our concern is with the likelihood of flight and danger to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Movant's showing on the question of flight is, as the majority concedes, \u201cimpressive.\u201d Stanley has close ties to the community. His wife and children, parents, three brothers, six sisters, seven aunts and uncles, and wife\u2019s parents reside in the area. The pre-sentence report includes Stanley\u2019s wife\u2019s characterization of their marriage as \u201csolid,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and Stanley has been assured work in his father-in-law\u2019s business if released. Moreover, while at liberty prior to and during trial, Stanley has always appeared when required to do so. The sole factor which points to the possibility of flight is that he is facing a five-year sentence. While relevant, it does not outweigh the overwhelming factors supporting release on strict conditions, and it is doubtful it would outweigh release on lesser ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">Nor can the record support a finding that Stanley will pose a danger to the community if released. Only two facts in the record give any indication of dangerousness \u2014 Stanley\u2019s current conviction and his admission that he used narcotics while he was employed as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">Certainly the act for which a person seeking release stands convicted is relevant in assessing whether the community\u2019s safety would be imperiled by release. Here, however, the substantial issues Stanley raises on appeal directly concern whether or not he committed the offense for which he was convicted. In such cases, unlike appeals where the fact of the offense is unchallenged, the inference to be drawn from the guilty verdict is more questionable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And, in Stanley\u2019s case, the inference is further attenuated by the almost total absence of prior criminal activity. His only other involvement with the law was a disorderly conduct charge in 1965 which resulted in a ten dollar fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">The remaining factor concerns Stanley\u2019s admission of past drug usage, but not addiction. Stanley claims that he stopped using drugs in December, 1970, and it is uncontested that he is not addicted at this time. Further, it appears from the pre-sentence report that Stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>ley sought help in stopping his drug usage when arrested for the present crime. Finally, Stanley has been promised work in his father-in-law\u2019s business if released and his father-in-law would be in a position to see that Stanley conducts himself properly during the working day.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">In sum, Stanley would have a supervised job; he has no prior convictions or even arrests, save a ten dollar fine of some vintage, and he is apparently not addicted to drugs. On the identical record that was before the trial court, I think the conclusion inescapable that Stanley can be released without an unreasonable risk of flight or danger to the community under the conditions or release of the sort set forth in the form order appended to this opinion. I believe we are obligated to do so, and therefore dissent from the remand of this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Ordered by the court that Thomas E. Stanley, Jr., shall be released on his personal recognizance on the following conditions: (1) Upon the representation of counsel that Stanley has obtained regular employment within the Washington Metropolitan Area, he shall be released. (2) His employer shall report immediately to - upon Stanley\u2019s failure to present himself for work at the proper time, and - shall report that failure to .counsel for the United States, counsel for Stanley, and the Criminal Clerk\u2019s Office of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. (3) Stanley shall reside with his wife and children and not leave the Washington Metropolitan area without permission of the District Court. Stanley\u2019s wife is to report immediately to - upon Stanley\u2019s overnight absence from their residence. (4) Stanley shall report to the D. C. Bail Agency weekly on - in person. (5) Stanley shall not use any narcotic drug and shall report weekly (or as otherwise may be reasonably required) to the D. C. Bail Agency for testing to determine whether he has used any narcotic drug. (6) Stanley, his wife, and his employer shall sign a statement indicating their understanding of the conditions set forth above and promising compliance with them.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\">.
