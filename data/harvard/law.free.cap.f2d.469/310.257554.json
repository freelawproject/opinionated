In 1961, the District Director of Internal Revenue for the Manhattan District, New York, took the position that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>instead of such sum, plaintiff should have included the amount of $630,740.04, <em>i. e., </em>an additional $217,361. The inclusion of such larger amount in plaintiff\u2019s gross income resulted (after the making of various adjustments) in plaintiff\u2019s allegedly owing an additional $188,153.-35 in income tax for such year, and the Director at that time assessed plaintiff in such amount, plus interest thereon in the amount of $60,103.40, or a total of $248,256.75. Plaintiff paid the additional tax and interest so assessed, and then filed a timely claim for refund therefor. Having received neither a notice of dis-allowance nor any refund, plaintiff instituted the instant suit to recover such assessed amount, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s husb.and died on August 12, 1954. By his will, he gave plaintiff one-half of his residuary estate. The remaining half was, after the deduction therefrom of any \u201clegacy, succession, transfer, estate or inheritance taxes payable by [the] estate with respect to any property disposed of by [the] Will or payable by any recipient of any such property,\u201d given, in equal shares, to the trustees of four testamentaiy trusts for the children of plaintiff and the decedent <em>(i. e., </em>the issue of their or prior marriages). The will provided that such taxes \u201cshall be paid by [the] Executors out of [the] estate as part of the expenses of administration thereof,\u201d with the proviso that \u201cno part of such taxes shall be deducted from or payable out of the one-half (%) of [the] residuary estate\u201d which the decedent bequeathed to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">During 1955, and prior to the ultimate distribution of the residuary estate, the executors made distributions to the five beneficiaries thereof in the total sum of $36,004,082.23. Of this amount plaintiff, by eleven payments, received $27,-467,768.51. The four trusts, by ten payments to each, received the balance of $8,436,295.75 (in equal shares of approximately $2,134,000). All the distributions were in the form of cash, stocks and bonds. None of the distributions were required by the will to be made pri- or to the ultimate distribution of the residuary estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">The federal fiduciary income tax return filed by the executors on behalf of the estate showed distributable net income <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for 1955 in the amount of $1,005,-682.94. A deduction of $826,758.68 was shown on the return for distributions of such income to the five residuary estate beneficiaries, the difference of $178,924.26 between such two figures consisting of tax-exempt income (and expenses allocable thereto).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">Section 662(a)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 662 (a)(2)(B) (1958)) provides that, where the amounts distributed to all beneficiaries of an estate accumulating income or distributing corpus exceed the distributable net income of the estate, each beneficiary shall include in his gross income an amount which bears the same ratio to distributable net income as the total amount distributed to him bears to the total of the amounts distributed to all the beneficiaries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>The amount of $27,467,768.51 which plaintiff received in 1955 from the residuary estate equaled 76.2907 percent of the total amount of $36,004,082.23 distributed to all beneficiaries during such taxable year. Since such total amount distributed exceeded the distributable net income, the District Director concluded that the provisions of Section 662 (a)(2)(B) were applicable and accordingly applied the same percentage to the taxable distributable net income of the estate, the resulting figure being regarded as the amount which plaintiff should have included in her gross income. Application of such 76.2907 percent to the taxable distributable net income figure of $826,758.68 produces the aforementioned figure of $630,740.04 as the amount the District Director concluded plaintiff was required by the statute to have included in her gross income. The inclusion of such amount in plaintiff\u2019s gross income produced the additional income tax which is the subject of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Plaintiff contends that, pursuant to accurate accounting by the executors in calculating the amount of the estate corpus and income which they distributed to the five beneficiaries in 1955, she in fact actually received during the year only the taxable amount of $413,379.34, which amount was but one-half of the taxable distributable net income, and not 76.2907 percent thereof, the figure that the statutory formula produces. Such accounting in the administration of the estate was, plaintiff says, in no way tax motivated, but was in accordance with common practices followed at that time by executors in New York in the administration of estates, and was permitted by the terms of the will and applicable local law. Furthermore, she points out, the accounts of the executors for the year 1955, which set forth the income distributions to plaintiff and the four trusts on a basis of one-half to plaintiff and the other half to the trusts, were judicially settled and allowed by the Surrogate Court of New York County, New York.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">Although the approximately $27,500,-000 paid to plaintiff during the year greatly exceeded the aggregate amount of approximately $8,500,000 paid to the four trusts, each of such total payments coneededly consisting of both corpus and income, plaintiff says that such unequal amounts nevertheless included the equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>amounts of $413,379.34 of taxable net income. For this result, plaintiff relies upon the manner in which the executors made their distributions of what they designated as \u201ccorpus.\u201d The executors, in accordance with a common New York practice, made simultaneous distributions of \u201cprincipal\u201d and \u201cincome\u201d among all the residuary legatees on a basis proportionate to their respective interests in the residuary estate. Further, since here the will directed that all legacy, succession, transfer, estate, or inheritance taxes (sometimes collectively referred to as \u201cdeath taxes\u201d) were to be paid as administration expenses of the estate, but with plaintiff\u2019s share of the residuary estate to be undiminished thereby, whenever the executors made any such tax payments (which were, according to their accounting, entirely out of corpus), they also made, again following a common New York practice where wills provided for payment of death taxes out of one or more shares of the residue but not out of one or more other shares, \u201ccorpus\u201d distributions to the plaintiff simultaneously with and in the same amounts as such tax payments. Thus, these simultaneous distributions to plaintiff always served, says plaintiff, to keep the remaining corpus interests of the plaintiff and the four trusts in the residuary estate in equal balance, with such equal corpus shares therefore always generating equal amounts to income. The result of adopting these simultaneous distribution practices was the avoidance of complicated calculations of shares of income earned, over varying periods of time, by unequal shares of principal (or by undistributed income). (In this case the decedent\u2019s will specifically provided that the income should be distributed proportionately to the residuary legatees, and that if distribution of the residuary estate was not made simultaneously, \u201can adjustment of the income shall be made by my Executors.\u201d) To illustrate, when, on January 1, 1955, the executors distributed $1,125,000 to each of the trusts \u2014amounts which the executors designated as coming entirely from corpus <footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2014 they simultaneously paid plaintiff $4,-500,000, also designated as a corp\u00fa's distribution. And when, on February 8, 1955, they paid $4,310,000 on account of the New York estate tax, they distributed the identical amount (again designated as principal on their accounts) to plaintiff. Similarly, when on November 14, 1955, they paid $14,621,454.81 on account of the federal estate tax, plus an amount aggregating $3,524,558.49 to the four trusts, such sums totaling $18,146,013.29, they distributed the identical total sum to plaintiff (all amounts again being designated as coming entirely out of principal). In accordance with the will, the New York and federal estate tax payments were deducted from the trusts\u2019 aggregate one-half interest in the residuary estate. The several 1955 distributions to plaintiff and the four trusts which the executors designated as distributions of estate income were so calculated by the executors that the amount of such income distributed to plaintiff on any date equaled the aggregate amount distributed to the trusts on the same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">It is on the above basis that plaintiff argues she actually received only one-half of the distributable net income of the estate in 1955, and not 76 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">In a situation such as the instant one, plaintiff contends, Section 662(a)(2)(B) was not intended to be applicable for the formula there prescribed would attribute to plaintiff income which she in fact did not receive. She should not, she argues, have attributed to her more than her actual share of estate income simply because the executors, in their authorized discretion, made principal distributions to her in order to balance the death tax payments and other principal distributions to the trusts. The purpose of the statutory provision here involved was, she contends, to prevent fiduciaries, where the estate had principal, current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>income, and accumulated income, from controlling tax consequences by manipulating distributions, as, for instance, making distributions designated as coming from \u201cincome\u201d to beneficiaries in low income tax brackets, while distributions designated as coming from \u201cprincipal\u201d are made to beneficiaries in high brackets, and therefore not taxable at all.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There was no intent here on the part of the executors, she argues, to gain any kind of income tax advantage for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">These contentions cannot be accepted as justifying recovery. There can be no doubt but that plaintiff\u2019s situation falls squarely within the literal provisions of Section 662(a)(2)(B), and plaintiff is not understood to contend otherwise. The nub of her contention is that the payments here involved should not be treated as being covered by the statute because the executors\u2019 actions were not tax motivated. Even so, the section applies. Clear statutory coverage of this kind, based upon a presumption that any distribution is deemed to be a distribution of the estate\u2019s income to the extent of its income for the year, does not and cannot be made to depend on such intangible factors as the subjective intent of executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Section 662(a)(2)(B) was specifically intended, for the purposes of that section, \u201cto avoid the necessity for tracing of income.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Such tracing was required by the 1939 Code, which provided that distributions by an estate or trust to its beneficiaries were taxed to the beneficiaries for the taxable year in which they received the distributions only if the distributions were made from the current income of the estate or trust.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As shown, this lent itself to various kinds of manipulations by executors in the labeling of estate moneys as \u201cincome\u201d or \u201cprincipal.\u201d To eliminate such manipulations and tax consequences based upon such estate tax accounting designations of what was \u201cprincipal\u201d and \u201cincome\u201d and from which source a distribution had been made, the \u201ctracing\u201d requirement was, for such distribution purposes, eliminated. Instead, \u201c[t]he beneficiary\u2019s proportionate share of the distributable net income * * * is determined by taking the same fractional part of [the] distributable net income * * * as the * * * amounts * * * distributed to him * * * bear to the total of [the] amounts * * * distributed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>all beneficiaries.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In short, Congress wished to establish an easily useable formula, and to avoid both the necessity of \u201ctracing\u201d and an inquiry into the subjective intention of executors or trustees. As was pointed out in Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. v. United States, 312 F.2d 785, 793, 160 Ct.Cl. 582, 596, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 880, 84 S.Ct. 150, 11 L.Ed.2d 111 (1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">* * * Around this concept of \u201cdistributable net income\u201d the Code builds its provisions for (a) the deduction allowed the trust for its current distributions to the beneficiaries, and (b) the distributions which the beneficiaries must include in their own gross incomes. \u201cThus, distributable net income has been termed the measuring rod or yardstick to be employed in determining, on the one hand, the maximum deduction for distributions which may be allowed to the estate or trust and for gauging, on the other hand, the extent to which beneficiaries may be taxable on the distributions.\u201d 6 Mertens \u201cLaw of Federal Income Taxation\u201d \u00a7 36.04.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">We accept plaintiff\u2019s contention that there were no tax motivations on the part of the executors in making the distributions at the times and in the amounts they did, and that they made the \u201cbalancing-\u201d corpus distributions to plaintiff only to avoid complicated calculations of estate income due to the beneficiaries which would result from their having disproportionate interests in the residuary estate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The fact nevertheless remains that, by making the discretionary \u201cbalancing\u201d distributions as they did\u2014 required neither by the will nor state law \u2014 plaintiff received, under their estate accounting, less of the distributable net income than she probably otherwise would have.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is no showing that\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>either by not making distributions until the estate was wound up finally, or otherwise \u2014 the residuary estate could not have been so managed as to produce the same result as the statutory formula. Thus, in that sense (and not in the sense of tax avoidance), the distributions were \u201cmanipulated\u201d so that plaintiff, who received over 75 percent of the 1955 payments, is nevertheless said to have received in that year only 50 percent of the taxable distributable net income. On its face and as its purpose is shown by its development and legislative history, the statute was designed to prevent such a result for tax purposes. Indeed, the statutory formula could be considered as providing the more natural and logical result \u2014 income earned during the administration of the residuary estate is allocated to the beneficiaries in the same .ratio as their interest in the corpus of such estate. Generally, of course, various percentages of corpus will produce like percentages of income. It is thus, plain that plaintiff\u2019s situation is, by the unambiguous provisions thereof, covered by the statute<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and although recognizing, of course, the difficulties involved in envisaging every specific situation that could arise under general statutory language, it would nevertheless appear to constitute the type of situation that Congress intended should be covered.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Plaintiff further contends that, even if Section 662(a) is applicable, its formula was erroneously applied because the death taxes should be included in the \u201camounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed to * * * beneficiaries.\u201d Crediting the trusts with such taxes as if they constituted distributions to the trusts would result in plaintiff and the trusts receiving equal total amounts. Accordingly, they would, under the statutory formula, be considered as having received equal amounts of the taxable distributable net income.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s basis for treating the payment of the death taxes as distributions to the trusts is based upon the provisions of Regulations \u00a7 1.662(a)-4 (26 C.F.R.) that \u201c[a]ny amount which, pursuant to the terms of a will * * * is used in full or partial discharge or satisfaction of a legal obligation of any person is included in the gross income of such person under section 662(a) * * * (2) * * * as though directly distributed to him as a beneficiary, * * *.\u201d Since the taxes were not deductible from or payable out of plaintiff\u2019s one-half of the residuary estate, they therefore were, argues plaintiff, a charge upon, or obligation of, the remaining one-half passing to the trusts. As such an obligation, they should, plaintiff says, be considered, under the Regulations, as expenditures made on behalf of the trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">This contention too cannot be sustained. The death tax moneys never constituted a part of, nor were they ever incorporated in, the trusts. The will bequeathed one-half of the residuary estate to the trusts <em>\u201cafter </em>the deduction therefrom of all of the [death] taxes * * (Emphasis supplied.) There is, therefore, no warrant for adding to the amounts paid to the trusts the amount of the death taxes, an amount which was never paid or payable to the trusts and which the trusts were, under the will, never to receive. Furthermore, these taxes were the legal obligations of the estate, and not of the trusts, the will specifically so recognizing and providing that such taxes, \u201cpayable by my estate * * * shall be paid * * * out of my estate as part of the expenses of administration thereof * * The taxes were a \u201ccharge\u201d upon, or an \u201cobligation\u201d of, the trusts only in the loose sense that, in calculating the net amount of the residuary estate which the trusts were to receive, the amount of the taxes was to be deducted from the share left to the trusts. They were not a \u201clegal obligation\u201d of the trusts in the sense used by the regulation upon which plaintiff relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">The trusts received $8,536,313.72 from the estate in 1955. It is such amount that is properly to be considered as the amount \u201cproperly paid, credited, or required to be distributed to\u201d them under the statute. The $18,931,454.81 in death taxes paid during the year by the executors, described by the will as part of the administration expenses of the estate, were not \u201camounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed to * * beneficiaries\u201d within the meaning of the statute or the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">Finally, plaintiff contends that if Section 662(a), properly construed, does cover the instant situation, it is unconstitutional as applied to her because it would impose an unapportioned direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>tax on principal or capital in violation of Article I of the Constitution. Section 2, clause 3 of the Article provides that direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, and section 9, clause 4 provides that no direct tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the census or enumeration directed by the Constitution to be taken. Plaintiff relies on the eases of Pollock v. Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co., 158 U.S. 601, 15 S.Ct. 912, 39 L.Ed. 1108 (1895), Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. 189, 40 S.Ct. 189, 64 L.Ed. 521 (1920), and Taft v. Bowers, 278 U.S. 470, 49 S. Ct. 199, 73 L.Ed. 460 (1929), among others, for the proposition that a tax on principal or capital is a direct tax which must be apportioned among the states in proportion to the census.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Although Section 662(a)(2)(B) purports to be an income tax, nevertheless, plaintiff contends, the section, as here applied, actually imposes a tax on the principal or capital distributions received by plaintiff from the estate of her deceased husband. The Sixteenth Amendment, plaintiff points out, empowers only the levying of taxes \u201con <em>incomes </em>* * * without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Additionally, plaintiff argues that Section 662(a)(2)(B) deprives her of property without due process of law because, although she actually received only 50 percent of the taxable income which the estate distributed to the beneficiaries in 1955, she has been taxed on an additional 26,2907 percent of such income. That part of the income, she says, was in fact received by the trusts and not by her, and to attempt to measure her tax by reference to the income of others, <em>i. e., </em>the four trusts, would, she argues, conflict with the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">In upholding constitutionality, defendant urges the broad proposition that, even though the disputed amount ($217,-361) which taxpayer received in 1955 may have constituted corpus, still the challenged sections (as applied here) are valid on two- alternative grounds, first, that the receipt of a bequest, devise or inheritance (whether or not it be from corpus) properly falls within the Sixteenth Amendment as \u201cincome\u201d to the recipient, and, second, that in any event the sections impose an indirect tax upon the receipt of property which under the Constitution need not be apportioned. On either of these views, plaintiff\u2019s invocation of the Fifth Amendment would also fail because the taxpayer would clearly not be taxed on the income or property of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">We do not have to delve into the difficult issues of large scope which the Government presents because, as we see it, there is a much narrower ground upon which to sustain the statute as applied to plaintiff\u2019s case. That more limited approach stresses the factor (which plaintiff underplays) that the executors did have a choice in 1955 whether to make the distributions in the form they did or, instead, so to manage distributions, to the extent governed by Section 662(a), that the several beneficiaries would not be taxable under Section 662(a) on more than their share of the estate\u2019s income. Plaintiff has failed to show that this could not be done.<footnotemark>14a</footnotemark> There was no legal compulsion, in the will or in New York law, to make the \u201cbalancing\u201d distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>tions of corpus and income which were made. That course was selected because the other would have been much more burdensome, requiring over the years complicated calculations of shares of income, earned either by principal or by undistributed income, which were due to the various residuary legatees. But the choice was not a forced one, and the other route could have been picked (though at the cost of more work and trouble).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> If the application of Section 662(a)(2)(B) was deemed unfair to plaintiff taxwise, when such \u201cbalancing\u201d distributions were made, the presumed inequity could be avoided by not making \u201cbalancing\u201d distributions but employing the other methods of distribution which were available.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">That these other methods would have occasioned more trouble (and possibly some more expense) does not invalidate the statutory formula. As we have already indicated, Congress could properly assume, as it did, that in the generality of instances the formula would correspond to reality and not be unfair to any beneficiary. At least where an option is open to avoid an unfair and unrealistic result, use of the formula is not prohibited in the minority of instances in which it may be thought harsh or inequitable. In view of the broad Congressional power in taxation (cf. Fernandez v. Wiener, 326 U.S. 340, 351-353, 66 S.Ct. 178, 90 L.Ed. 116 (1945); A. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U.S. 40, 44, 54 S.Ct. 599, 78 L.Ed. 1109 (1934)), Congress is not required by the Constitution to assure that the way of the option be just as easy as the way of the formula; added work and some added expense, if the option is selected, are permissible accompaniments of that choice. Taxation is not a field in which Congress must use a watchmaker\u2019s refinement and instruments, or a jeweler\u2019s balance, to achieve precise equality in treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The use of formulas which can be avoided if the taxpayer considers them unfair or not to reflect reality in his particular case is, of course, no stranger to the federal income tax system. The best-known is the standard formula for deductions on the individual income tax form; if the standard deduction is thought to be unfair or inadequate, the deductions can be itemized \u2014 sometimes at the cost of considerable extra work and some expense. Although the parallel is not exact (particularly since the standard deduction involves deductions, not income), the option available in plaintiff\u2019s case is roughly comparable to this common choice open each year to millions of individual taxpayers. We cite this example to show that formula solutions are not uncommon, and are invulnerable to attack where an escape-hatch is available if the formula proves unjust in a particular instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">It may be said that Mrs. Harkness, the taxpayer, did not have or make the choice here \u2014 the executors did. Technically that is the situation, but there is no hint that plaintiff objected in any way to the estate\u2019s course of action, or suggested the other course, or was compelled to accept the large distributions of principal in 1955. It is unrealistic to suppose that, if she had objected on the ground that the estate\u2019s mode of distribution increased her own taxes, the executors would nevertheless have forced her to accept those large payments. Indeed, there is no reason to believe that under the will the executors could lawfully compel her to accept the large corpus distributions in 1955, if she was unwilling to do so because of the tax consequences to her.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s reply brief to the court makes it clear that plaintiff was not so compelled, and suggests that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>deliberate chance was taken as to how the law would be applied. The brief indicates that the executors (and probably plaintiff\u2019s own counsel) believed that \u00a7 662(a)(2)(B) should not be interpreted (in this type of case) as the Internal Revenue Service and we have construed it \u2014 and they acted accordingly.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Without intimating in any way that the statute would be invalid if applied where there was no such option as in this case, we hold that the existence of the choice removes whatever defect there might otherwise be. At least where the option is present, Congress can reasonably and validly forbid \u201ctracing\u201d and presume that its formula in \u00a7 662(a)(2) (B) gives an accurate reflection of the division of the estate\u2019s \u201cdistributable net income\u201d among the beneficiaries. <em>Cf. </em>Smith v. Westover, 191 F.2d 1003 (9th Cir. 1951), aff\u2019g 89 F.Supp. 432 (S.D. Cal.1950). Normally, use of the formula would be fair and accurate enough. If discretionary \u201cbalancing\u201d payments which include large amounts of corpus are made and accepted, as here, the necessary consequence is to invoke the formula nonetheless, and the taxpayer will not be allowed to \u201ctrace\u201d in order to show that the source of part of his receipts was in fact not \u201cdistributable net income\u201d but corpus. If the tax consequences of this approach are deemed sufficiently undesirable, there is the other route which can and should be taken. In these circumstances, there is no compulsion to accept an unfair or unrealistic division of \u201cdistributable net income.\u201d For these reasons, we hold that the tax was lawfully imposed and that plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\"> This opinion incorporates the opinion of Trial Commissioner Saul Richard Gamer (now Chief Commissioner), with modifications and additions made in the light of the presentation by the parties to the judges which, in the case of the Government, differed in substantial part from the presentation to the Trial Commissioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-5\">.

It seems clear that defendant errs. In that case, the statute provided that \u201cUnless otherwise expressly provided by the will of a person dying after this act takes effect, all income from real and personal property earned during the period of administration of the estate of such testator and not payable to others or otherwise disposed of by the will shall be distributed pro rata as income among the beneficiaries of any trusts created out of the residuary estate of such testator and the other persons entitled to such residuary estate.\u201d The court held that where, in accordance with the direction of the testator, payment of the death taxes was made out of the residuary estate, the net income earned by the estate during administration was to be divided pro rata among the income beneficiaries in proportion to the division of the residuary estate set up in the will before consideration of the effect of the tax payments. However, the court specifically pointed out that the will did not provide for the payment of the taxes prior to distributions to the beneficiaries or that the taxes were to be treated as administration expenses to be subtracted initially. Thus there was no provision in the will \u201cotherwise expressly\u201d providing differently from the Section 17-b formula. The court held that a general direction that death taxes be paid out of the residuary estate was not equivalent to a direction that the taxes be treated as administration expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">In the instant case, however, the will expressly provided (1) that an adjustment of the income should be made in the event simultaneous distribution of the residuary estate was not made to the beneficiaries, and (2) that the trusts\u2019 one-half share was to be calculated \u201cafter the deduction therefrom of\u201d the death taxes, with the taxes to be considered as part of the estate\u2019s administration expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\">.

See, Final Report of the Advisory Group on Subchapter J of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, dated December 30, 1958, in Hearings on Advisory Group Recommendations on Subchapters C, J and K of the Internal Revenue Code before the House Committe on Ways and Means, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 257, 286-92.

In my opinion, the majority opinion by failing to hold that Section 662(a)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 662(a)(2)(B) (1958)) and the related Treasury Regulations 1.662(a)-3 are unconstitutional and invalid, has placed a stamp of approval upon the acts of the Internal Revenue Service in collecting income taxes from the plaintiff that she did not owe and in exempting the trusts from income taxes that they owed. This has caused an unconscionable result to be reached in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">Regardless of the elaborate and complicated provisions of the statute and regulations and the involved and sophisticated reasoning of the government, we end up with the following undisputed facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">1. The plaintiff has been required to pay income taxes on $217,361 of the income of the decedent\u2019s estate that she never received.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">2. The trusts were exempted from the payment of income taxes on the $217,361 income of the estate which they received and which taxes they owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">3. The tax on the $217,361 was levied upon the property of the plaintiff and collected from her under the guise of an income tax, but was actually a direct tax on the corpus of the decedent\u2019s estate that she inherited from him (her husband) under the terms of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">4. The direct taxes levied upon and collected from the corpus of the decedent\u2019s estate received by the plaintiff was not a tax that had been apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers and in proportion to their population as required by the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">5. All indirect taxes (estate and inheritance taxes) had already been paid on the transfer of decedent\u2019s estate ($14,500,000 Federal and $4,300,000 to the State of New York).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-18\">With these well-established and admitted facts in mind, I will proceed to show that the statute and related regulations, as well as the acts of the Internal Revenue Service, were unconstitutional and invalid, which is the main <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>thrust of plaintiff\u2019s appeal. The majority chose to sidestep this question and refused to decide it. Instead, they decided the case on the narrow basis that the executors of the estate had an option to distribute the corpus and income as they did which resulted in the tax on plaintiff, or to effect distribution a different way without such resulting tax on plaintiff. There is no showing that plaintiff had any control over the executors or that she had anything whatever to do with what they did. It seems unjust to me to place a beneficiary of an estate in a position of owing or not owing an income tax according to the whim and actions of the executors of the estate. It also appears that this is an unrealistic solution of the problem because ordinarily a person either owes an income tax or he does not owe it according to law and not according to what someone else over whom he has no control does with respect to his property. The court cites Smith v. Westover, 191 F.2d 1003 (9th Cir. 1951), aff\u2019g 89 F.Supp. 432 (S. D.Cal.1950). That case does not appear to be applicable because it involved the division of trust income for income tax purposes between a trust and a <em>beneficiary of a trust. </em>Whereas, here we are concerned with a formula to allocate estate income <em>among various estate beneficiaries </em>for income tax purposes. Furthermore, in that case, there was an attempt at tax avoidance when the testator tried in his will to convert income to principal by saying such income was principal. None of these facts are present here. Also, the statute in that case did not involve the allocation formula that we have here. The cases are clearly distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">In my opinion, the court should have decided the constitutional question instead of avoiding it. When it appears that a provision of the Internal Revenue Code is clearly contrary to the Constitution, it is the duty of a court to declare it unconstitutional. Nicol v. Ames, 173 U.S. 509, 515, 19 S.Ct. 522, 43 L.Ed. 786 (1899). I cannot accept the solution of the majority of the problem involved because it avoids the constitutional questions that should decide the case. All that the majority really decides is that the government wins and the plaintiff loses.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The statute and related regulations involved in this case are contrary to and violate Article I (Section 2, Clause 3) (Section 8, Clause 1) (Section 9, Clause 4), and the Fifth and Sixteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, as will be clearly shown below.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\n<em>Section 662(a) (2) (B) and Related Treasury Regulations Violated the Fifth Amendment by Depriving Plaintiff of Property Without Due Process of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The relationship of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution will be considered first because its violation by the statute and regulations is so clearly apparent and obvious. The tax collected from plaintiff was collected as an income tax in connection with her income tax returns. Section 662(a) (2) (B) is an income tax statute and is found in the income tax section of the Code (subchap-ter J of Subtitle A) and was used by the District Director in taxing plaintiff on the $217,361 income of the estate that she never received. He simply added that amount to her gross income. There was no doubt that the IRS considered the tax exacted of the plaintiff to be a tax on income at the time it was collected. In fact, when the case was before our trial judge, the defendant so contended by saying in its brief presented to him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">* -\u00bb * [j]t is quite clear that Section 662(a) has not imposed a tax upon a distribution of corpus of the estate, but rather <em>the tax has been imposed on the income of the estate. </em>[Emphasis supplied.] <em>lid. </em>at 29.] <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>In fact, the tax exacted of plaintiff was figured and calculated according to the rates applicable to income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">On appeal before us the defendant admits in its brief that plaintiff never received the $217,361 of estate income on which she was taxed when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">x x x [T]axpayer repeatedly states * * * she was entitled to income from only one-half of the corpus of the estate, that <em>she received only this portion </em>of .the estate\u2019s income, * * *. <em>The Government here concedes these facts. </em>[Emphasis supplied.] <em>lid. </em>at 15.] <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Having conceded that plaintiff did not receive the $217,361 on which she paid an income tax, the act of the government in taxing her on such income flies squarely in the face of the Fifth Amendment as the taking of property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The cases are legion that prohibit the taking of one\u2019s property without due process of law. It hardly seems necessary to cite any of such authorities here because the case is so plain and conclusive that such a taking occurred in this ease. Simply stated, plaintiff\u2019s property was taken for an income tax on income she did not receive and applied to the payment of the income tax owed by the trusts which received the income but who were not required to pay the tax. This appears to be a classic example of the taking of one\u2019s property without due process of law. This amounts to a confiscation of plaintiff\u2019s property and is forbidden by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. <em>See also, </em>Nichols v.

In further support of this proposition, it should be pointed out that it is the universal practice of the IRS in all of the states not to tax beneficiaries of estates on the corpus of such estates when received by them where there has been no income earned by the estate, but in the case before us a beneficiary has been taxed on the corpus of an estate which she received pursuant to the terms of her husband\u2019s will. This has been done despite the requirement of Article I, Section 8, clause 1, that provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5g\">* * * [A] 11 Duties, Imposts and Excises <em>shall be uniform throughout the United States; </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\n<em>Section 662(a)(2)(B) and Related Treasury Regulations Violate the Sixteenth 'Amendment to the Constitution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">The defendant makes the further argument that even if the tax imposed on the plaintiff is a direct tax on the corpus or principal that she received to the extent of a tax on the $217,361, nevertheless, it is a legal tax because such corpus or principal that she received is <em>income </em>and taxable. This is indeed a novel and unreasonable contention. Here again defendant\u2019s argument is contrary to another provision of the Constitution, namely, the Sixteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Prior to the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court held in Pollock v. Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co., <em>swpra, </em>that Congress did not have the power to impose an income tax. In that ease the Court held invalid the Act of August 15, 1894 [August 27, 1894], e. 349, \u00a7 28, 28 Stat. 509, 553, which included in income subject to tax of \u201cmoney and the value of all personal property acquired by gift or inheritance.\u201d The Sixteenth Amendment was adopted in 1913. The very first income tax law enacted by Congress after the adoption of the Amendment, provided that the value of property acquired by \u201cgift, bequest, devise or descent\u201d was excluded from net income. Act of 1913, c. 16, \u00a7 IIB, 38 Stat. 114, 167. The same exclusions have existed ever since. For instance, Section 102 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">\u00a7 102. Gifts and inheritances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-12\">(a) General rule.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-13\">Gross income does not include the value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance. [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 (1954)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">The attempt of defendant to include the inheritance (corpus or principal) of the plaintiff in her gross income is directly contrary to such section of the Code. The defendant seeks to avoid this provision of Section 102(a) by pointing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Section 102(b) (2), added in 1954, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">(b) Income. \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">Subsection (a) shall not exclude from gross income\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">* -x- * -X- -x- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">(2) where the gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance is of income from property, the amount of such income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">-x- -x- * Any amount included in the <em>gross income </em>of a beneficiary under subchapter J shall be treated for purposes of paragraph (2) as a gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance of income from property. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">The defendant relies especially on the last paragraph quoted above by arguing that since the corpus of the estate was included by the IRS in the gross income of the plaintiff, at least to the extent of the $217,361, such corpus to that extent became <em>income. </em>I do not agree. The above section of the Code refers to gross income. As will be pointed out below, income is income and not corpus. Income is completely separate and distinct from principal, coxpms, or capital. Even if Congress intended the section to have the meaning defendant attributes to it, Congress had no power to convert corpus into income by merely calling it income. I do not think that Congress intended any such meaning. The section refers to income and not to corpus or principal. If it does mean corpus or principal, then it is unconstitutional as a direct unapportioned tax on principal or capital. Furthermore, it violates the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution which authorizes an income tax <em>only on income.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">The Sixteenth Amendment did not define \u201cincome,\u201d but as has been pointed out by the courts, the term had a well-defined meaning at the time the Amendment was adopted. This meaning was separate, apart, and different from capital, corpus, or principal. In Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. 189, 40 S.Ct. 189, 64 L.Ed. 521 (1920), Mr. Justice Holmes stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-13\">* * * j think that the word \u201cincomes\u201d in the Sixteenth Amendment should be read in \u201ca sense most obvious to the common understanding at the time of its adoption.\u201d * * * [Id. at 219-220, 40 S.Ct. at 197.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-16\">In United States v. Safety Car Heating &amp; Lighting Co., 297 U.S. 88, 56 S.Ct. 353, 80 L.Ed. 500 (1936), Mr. Justice Cardozo said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-17\">Income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment is the fruit that is born of capital, not the potency of fruition. With few exceptions, if any, it is income as the word is known in the common speech of men. <em>[Id. </em>at 99, 56 S.Ct. at 358.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-18\">It is clear that when the Sixteenth Amendment was adopted, the term \u201cincome\u201d had a well-defined meaning that was distinguished from principal or capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-19\">The Supreme Court has held that the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment cannot \u201cbe extended beyond the meaning clearly indicated by the language used.\u201d James v. United States, 366 U.S. 213, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961). In that case, Mr. Justice Whittaker said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-20\">\u25a0x- * * Equally well settled is the principle that the Sixteenth Amendment \u201cis to be taken as written and is not to be extended beyond the meaning clearly indicated by the language used.\u201d Edwards v. Cuba R. Co., 268 U.S. 628, 631, 45 S.Ct. 614, 69 L.Ed. 1124.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-24\">The Sixteenth Amendment authorized Congress to lay and collect taxes on incomes. As shown by the above deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>sions, income was not and is not the same as principal or capital. Consequently, the attempt of defendant in this case to convert principal or corpus of the estate of the deceased into income of the plaintiff is clearly contrary to the Sixteenth Amendment and to Section 102 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\n<em>The Tax Imposed on Plaintiff is not an Indirect Tax on the Receipt of Property that need not be Apportioned</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Defendant makes one last argument which in my opinion has no validity and is completely unrealistic. It argues that in any event the tax imposed on plaintiff is an <em>indirect tax on the receipt of property </em>and it need not be apportioned. This appears to be an exercise in semantics. It is just another way of describing a tax on the transfer of property. An indirect tax is a tax imposed on the <em>transfer </em>of property. The estate or inheritance tax is a good example. The receipt of the corpus of an estate by a beneficiary is an integral part of the transfer of such corpus from the estate. The transfer (estate) taxes had already been paid on the estate of the decedent in the total sum of $18,800,000 before the tax involved here was collected from the plaintiff. If carried to its logical conclusion, defendant\u2019s argument would lead to double taxation on the transfer of the estate. There is no authority in law that authorizes the government to impose any kind of tax, direct or indirect, on the <em>receipt </em>of the corpus of an estate by a beneficiary without apportionment as required by Article I of the Constitution. The argument of defendant to the contrary is purely theoretical and without support in the Constitution, the Internal Revenue Code, or the decisions of the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Defendant\u2019s theory of an indirect tax on the receipt of property would have one of two results, namely (1) a double tax on the transfer of property, or (2) a tax on the ownership of property, which is a direct tax on the principal or corpus and is invalid unless apportioned as required by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Furthermore, Section 1(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 imposes a tax <em>\u201con the taxable income\u201d </em>of every individual. It does not impose a tax on the <em>transfer </em>or <em>receipt </em>of property. The tax here was imposed on the $217,861 included in plaintiff\u2019s <em>taxable income.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">The defendant argues that Congress enacted Section 662(a)(2)(B) in order to eliminate the necessity of \u201ctracing\u201d the source of distributed property and to facilitate bookkeeping and auditing by executors and the IRS. Even though this may be a laudable intent, such purpose does not allow the Congress to circumvent or override the provisions of the Constitution. The Constitution is the source of the powers of the Congress and it defines the boundaries within which Congress can function. In the case before us, Congress has exceeded its powers and gone beyond the boundaries established for its operation by the Constitution. There can be no doubt that there is a limitation on the taxing power conferred upon Congress by the Constitution. When the enforcement and application of a taxing statute is so arbitrary as to amount to the confiscation of a taxpayer\u2019s property, as is the case here, both the statute and the action should be held to be unconstitutional and invalid. <em>See </em>Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U.S. 531, 47 S.Ct. 710, 71 L.Ed. 1184 (1927) and Heiner v. Donnan, 285 U.S. 312, 52 S.Ct. 358, 76 L.Ed. 772 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">The majority opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">\u2022&gt;:- * * [T]he taxpayer will not be allowed to \u201ctrace\u201d in order to show that the source of part of his receipts was in fact not \u201cdistributable net income\u201d but corpus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">This is directly contrary to the decision of the Supreme Court in Heiner v. Donnan, <em>supra, </em>when the court said in commenting upon the statute, involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>in Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, 270 U.S. 230, 46 S.Ct. 260, 70 L.Ed. 557 (1926) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACK\">* * * a statute which imposes a tax upon an assumption of fact <em>which the taxpayer is forbidden to controvert is so arbitrary and unreasonable that it cannot stand under the Fourteenth Amendment. </em>[Emphasis supplied.] <em>lid. </em>at 325, 52 S.Ct. at 361.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The court stated further in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsP\">Nor is it material that the Fourteenth Amendment was involved in the <em>Schlesinger </em>Case, instead of the Fifth Amendment, as here. The restraint imposed upon legislation by the due process clauses of the two amendments is the same. Coolidge v. Long, 282 U.S. 582, 596, 51 S.Ct. 306, 75 L.Ed. 562. That a federal statute passed under the taxing power may be so arbitrary and capricious as to cause it to fall before the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment is settled. Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U.S. 531, 542, 47 S.Ct. 710, 71 L.Ed. 1184; Brushaber v. Union Pac. R. Co., 240 U.S. 1, 24-25, 36 S.Ct. 236, 60 L.Ed. 493; Tyler v. United States, <em>supra, </em>281 U.S. [497], p. 504, 50 S.Ct. 356, 74 L.Ed. 991. <em>[Id. </em>at 326, 52 S.Ct. at 361.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">It appears that the majority opinion, contrary to the above decision of the Supreme Court, is upholding a statute which \u201cassumes as a fact which the taxpayer is forbidden to controvert\u201d that the $217,361 was \u201cincome\u201d and not \u201ccorpus.\u201d The statute, given this meaning, clearly violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The majority opinion holds, in effect, that Section 662(a) (2) (B) creates a <em>con-elusive </em>presumption that distributions subject to the operation of that section are distributions of <em>income, </em>and consequently cannot be rebutted by the taxpayer. We held otherwise in the case of Mott v. United States, 462 F.2d 512, 199 Ct.Cl. - (1972) when we ruled that such a presumption was not conclusive with respect to charitable distributions, and we held that tracing should be allowed to show that the distributions were from corpus and not from income. It is of particular significance that the government in that case argued that such tracing should be allowed, notwithstanding the statute, in order to defeat a charitable deduction, which is exactly contrary to the position it takes in the present case. We agreed with the government in that case that tracing should be allowed in order to prevent injustice and inequity toward the government. Here, equity and justice is on the side of the taxpayer, especially since it is conceded that there was no manipulation of the distribution by the executors to avoid taxes. Yet the majority refuses to make an exception for the taxpayer in this case as we did for the government in the <em>Mott </em>case. As tracing was allowed as an exception in that case, it should be allowed here, although admittedly the facts are different.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Since the majority refuses to face the constitutional issue, an equitable solution of the whole problem would be to interpret the statute in such a way as to hold that it creates a rebuttable presumption that such distributions as we have here are from income, which may be overcome by evidence of the taxpayer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On that basis, the plaintiff would prevail in this case because it is admitted by the government that the distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>tion of $217,361 to the plaintiff on which she was taxed was to that extent corpus and not income of the estate received by plaintiff during the taxable year in question. Such an interpretation of the statute would remove the constitutional question from the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">A solution to this whole problem would be for Congress to amend Section 663(c) of the Internal Revenue Code so as to make it apply to estates. As now written, it only applies to trusts and is known as the \u201cseparate share\u201d rule. In other words, where a trust has more than one beneficiary, the separate shares of the beneficiaries are treated as separate trusts. This '-'prevents a beneficiary who receives corpus from being taxed on an amount in excess of the distributable net income of the trust of his share. If the separate share rule were extended to estates, the problem we have in the present case would not arise.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no logical reason why Section 663(c) should not apply to estates as well as to trusts. This was no doubt an oversight when the statute was drafted.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">When the facts and the arguments of the parties are carefully considered and one arrives at the moment of decision in this case, it is clear that the IRS either taxed the plaintiff on the $217,361 of the income of the estate that she did not receive, or it levied and collected such tax on the corpus of the estate which she did receive under the guise of an income tax. In either case, the tax was unconstitutional and invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">For all of the foregoing reasons, I would hold that Section 662(a)(2)(B) and Section 1.662(a)-3 of the Treasury Regulations as applied to plaintiff in this case are unconstitutional and the collection of the tax from the plaintiff was invalid. Alternatively, I would hold that the statute and the regulations create a rebuttable presumption that distributions such as we have here are from income which might be overcome by the taxpayer by credible evidence, and that the taxpayer has overcome such presumption in this case. In either case, I would enter judgment for the plaintiff for the sum of $248,256.75, plus interest from the date of payment as authorized by law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-10\">.
