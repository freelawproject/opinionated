United States, 136 U.S.App.D.C. 158, 165, 419 F.2d 740, 747 (1969) <em>(en banc). </em>After full hearing the District Court found that the evidence revealed no due process defect in the identifications of these appellants by witnesses at trial.

As to appellant Williams, we find that his conviction also should be affirmed. The lineups in these cases were conducted prior to the decisions of the Supreme Court in Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967); United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967); and Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967). While these lineups would certainly not pass muster today, we cannot say that the <em>Williams </em>lineup,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> considering the time it was held, was so lacking in fundamental fairness as to violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\"> The <em>Williams </em>lineup is described in the concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b621-7\">BAZELON, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AT0\">concurring in part and dissenting in part :</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">These appeals are before us following remand \u201cfor <em>Stovall </em>hearings and appropriate determinations concerning the identification of appellants\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> made by the sole eye-witness to the crime, one Mrs. Neal, at two separate lineups, each involving only one of the appellants. The remand proceedings culminated in a determination that neither lineup violated due process and the majority now affirms both convictions. I agree, with the conclusion reached with respect to appellant Coleman in No. 24,806.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">I think the affirmance of Williams\u2019 conviction in No. 24,805, however, rests (1) on the unwarranted view that Stovall v. Denno<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is without vitality in retroactive application; and (2) on a <em>sub silentio </em>overruling of our unanimous <em>en banc </em>decision in Clemons v. United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a result, a man whose guilt is in the gravest doubt is imprisoned for life. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Because the Court accords such perfunctory treatment to the substantial claims of both appellants, I must discuss the issues at greater length.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\"><em>1. No. 26,805 </em>\u2014 United <em>States v. Williams</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">The Williams lineup was held without the presence of counsel, one week after the crime, and before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wade.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Williams does not assert that the police intentionally indicated to Mrs. Neal that he was the prime suspect. Rather, he claims that the physical characteristics of the lineup\u2019s participants were such that only he met the description of the offender given the police by Mrs. Neal after the crime. The description received by the police stressed only two salient physical characteristics: that the offender was quite short \u2014 only slightly taller than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>witness\u2019s own <em>S'l\" </em>\u2014 and that he was young. An examination of the photograph of the lineup reveals that only two of the six participants could reasonably be characterized as short, and that appellant Williams appears to be some four to six inches shorter 'than the remaining four participants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the only other short man in the lineup appears demonstrably older than appellant. Mrs. Neal\u2019s testimony at both the remand hearing and at trial<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> demonstrates that the differences in physical appearance among the participants in the lineup had the predictable effect of focusing her attention on appellant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>In Stovall,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> however, the Supreme Court did not condemn all suggestive lineups, but only those which are <em>unnecessarily </em>suggestive. Here the Government contends that because the participants in the Williams lineup included all of the individuals left in the cell block at that time, any suggestivity due to the choice of participants, and thus the physical characteristics of the participants, was \u201cnecessary.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The Government seeks to excuse the absence of additional subjects by pointing out that Williams\u2019 lineup took place before the police began the practice of holding regularly scheduled lineups on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, thereby increasing the pool of available participants. On the morning in question, all those in the cell block had been taken from police headquarters to court with the exception of Williams and five other men.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, when it came time to stage the lineup, the police could secure no other short, young subjects, or, for that matter, any other subjects at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">I think it plain that these circumstances do not reflect the kind of ne-eessity which saved the admittedly suggestive one-man showup in <em>Stovall</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>from due process attack. Here the police could have eliminated the entire difficulty by delaying the lineup a few hours. A week had already passed since the occurrence of the crime and there has been absolutely no showing that any prejudice to the legitimate interests of law enforcement would have attended such short delay. In sharp contrast, <em>Stovall </em>was premised on the fact that there delay brought with it the most serious prejudice; the witness was dying and an immediate confrontation was imperative.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The lineup at which Williams was identified was not only suggestive but also unnecessarily so within the meaning of <em>Stovall.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">The conclusion that the lineup was \u201cunnecessarily suggestive does not terminate the inquiry. We also must determine whether, in the language of <em>Stovall v. Denno </em>[it was] so \u2018conducive to irreparable mistaken identification that he was denied due process of law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For <em>pre-Stovall </em>cases this inquiry is controlled by our <em>en banc </em>decision in Clemons v. United States,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>where we held that a suggestive out-of-court identification would not be deemed conducive to irreparable misidentification if a determination could be made that the identification rested upon an independent source.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The standard, however, is not one which allows for mechanical application. This standard requires a prediction: would the witness have identified the defendant absent the impact of the suggestive presentation? And, unlike the superficially analogous prediction required in ascertaining \u201cbut for\u201d cause in tort, the independent source prediction rests not on behavior governed by fixed physical rules, but rather on the still speculative psychology of human perception. What plainly emerges from the relevant case law as a minimal requirement, however, is that the witness have an adequate opportunity to observe the offender.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Without such an opportunity there can be no reliable identification.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There was no such opportunity here.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">Mrs. Neal was already in the store at the time the two offenders entered, and she remained in the store until she became frightened and ran out some two or three minutes later. She testified that she initially noticed the men when the proprietor waited on them first despite her prior entrance. At that point, however, she could see only the face of the taller of the two men (whom she later identified as Coleman). The shorter of the two men (whom she later identified as Williams) was standing off to her right. She testified that she glanced over her shoulder; saw only the shorter man\u2019s profile and that he had a gun; and quickly turned her head back. This glance was the only time Mrs. Neal saw the shorter man\u2019s face and she ran from the store about a minute later.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>In contrast to observations of five, ten or fifteen minutes in prior cases,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Mrs. Neal had but a single over-the-shoulder glance at the alleged gunman.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">This single glance is not enough to support a finding of independent source. Accordingly, since the lineup at which Williams was identified was both unnecessarily suggestive <em>and </em>conducive to irreparable misidentification, the admission of identification testimony derived therefrom was constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">There remains only the question of whether this error was harmless. In addition to the testimony of Mrs. King, the Government\u2019s case consisted of two other witnesses who made in-court identifications of Williams. An examination of their testimony discloses that Mrs. Neal\u2019s identification not only contributed to the verdict, but was central to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">James Newman was employed as a delivery man in the liquor store and testified that on the day of the crime he entered the store to pick up a delivery. He remained in the store for about a minute and recalled noticing two Negro males but did not see their faces. After leaving the store he went into an adjacent alley where his delivery car was parked. At that point he heard a shot and, as he started moving back toward the store, two men ran past in the alley. Mr. Newman estimated that he observed their faces for about five or six seconds. One week later he attended the same lineup as did Mrs. Neal but was unable to identify Williams. He then made an in-court identification of Williams at trial, one year later.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-18\">The second identifying witness was James Wallace, a 12-year-old boy who was riding his bicycle in the vicinity of the robbery. He testified that he saw two men run from the alley, enter a car, and drive away. The boy could not identify Williams at a lineup, and did not testify at the first trial. At the second trial, coming some two years after the robbery, Wallace identified Williams for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-19\">The other evidence here amounts to two identifications which themselves bear many of the indicia of unreliability outlined by the eases and commentary.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Mrs. Neal\u2019s testimony thus the most important element of the Government\u2019s case and under no conceivable standard can its erroneous admission be deemed harmless.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>I do not understand my brethren to say that the Williams lineup was not suggestive; in any case the testimony on remand plainly shows that it was. The record also forecloses the possibility of arguing that the lineup was \u201cnecessarily\u201d suggestive, that there was an independent source, or that the error was harmless. In fact, my brethren <em>concede that the linewp would violate due process if held today. </em>They justify affirmance solely on the ground that the lineup took place before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stovall. </em>The date of the lineup, of course, is not in question. What is in question, however, are the legal consequences which flow from that fact. On this score the majority's decision is completely silent. It overrules <em>sub silentio </em>our unanimous <em>en banc </em>decision in Clemons v. United States which unambiguously resolved the precise issue of <em>Stovall\u2019s </em>retroactivity in a fashion directly and unmistakably at odds with that applied today.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">In <em>Clemons </em>our court recognized that <em>Stovall </em>gave \u201ca significantly new dimension to the due process concept in relation to some police practices which have been long and widely engaged in without constitutional challenge.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> And we gave weight to what the Supreme Court has termed a \u201creliance\u201d interest<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> by prescribing different standards in pre- and <em>post-Stovall </em>cases. For <em>post-Stovall </em>cases, testimony relating to an unnecessarily suggestive pretrial identification is subject to a <em>per se </em>exclusionary rule.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> For <em>pre-Stovall </em>eases, however, we held that the admission of even an unnecessarily suggestive pretrial identification would not be error if there existed an independent source for the identification.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This limited incursion on the retroactivity of <em>Stovall </em>was consistent with the principal concern of <em>Stovall: </em>that where guilt depends upon an identification, the identification must be reliable. An identification based upon an independent source could be such \u201ca reliable indicator of guilt,\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> to alleviate the danger of erroneous identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">The Court today does not even purport to apply the <em>Clemons\u2019 </em>standards. We all agree that the Williams lineup was suggestive and no one has found\u2014 or indeed could find \u2014 an independent source. Thus, where <em>Clemons </em>created an exception to retroactivity where an identification meets <em>Stovall\u2019s </em>principal concern of reliability, the Court extends that exception to cover an identification which, measured either strictly by <em>Stovall, </em>or by the more lenient <em>Clemons\u2019 </em>standards, is patently unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">But the Court\u2019s action not only contravenes controlling authority; it lacks even the comforting thought that there is reliable information that the accused \u2014and not someone else \u2014 committed the crime charged. That we should strain in these circumstances to uphold an imprisonment for life is deeply troubling.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\"><em>II. No. 24,806 </em>\u2014 United <em>States v. Coleman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">Appellant Coleman also challenges the lineup identification of Mrs. Neal. After viewing the Williams lineup, Mrs. Neal was shown four photographs by the police for possible identification of the second man in the robbery.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> She picked out the photograph of appellant Coleman. Ten days later, the Washington police learned that Coleman was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>custody in Baltimore on an unrelated charge. Mrs. Neal was then taken to Baltimore where she identified Coleman at a lineup composed of five Negro men, all of approximately the same height, weight and complexion. Appellant Coleman complains, however, that the other four participants in the lineup wore hats while Coleman was bareheaded; and that Mrs. Neal\u2019s prior description of the taller gunman indicated that he wore no hat.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">I agree with the District Judge\u2019s conclusion on remand that \u201c[t]he showing in a lineup of four individuals wearing hats, along with a fifth, who was the prime suspect in connection with a serious crime and who was bareheaded was clearly improper\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and unnecessarily suggestive. But I also agree that \u201cunder the circumstances of this case, that impropriety [did not] violate due process by creating any substantial likelihood that Coleman was incorrectly identified.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Several factors serve to insure that the improper lineup technique was not \u201cconducive to irreparable misidentification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In contrast to the single over-the-shoulder glance at the man she identified as- Williams, Mrs. Neal had a full view of the taller gunman\u2019s face for almost the entire two to three minutes she was in the store after the gunmen entered. While certainly too short to itself constitute an independent source, it does provide an opportunity to observe which, taken together with other indicia of reliability \u2014 also absent in the Williams\u2019 identification \u2014 is sufficient. The crucial additional element here is that following her lineup identification of Williams, Mrs. Neal was shown four photographs in an attempt to secure a lead as to the identity of the second gunman. She immediately indicated the photograph of Coleman as that of the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Given an adequate opportunity to observe and the spontaneous selection of the suspect\u2019s picture in a properly conducted photo-identification, I cannot say that the improper lineup procedure so tainted the witness\u2019s identification as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of misidentification.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> As such, under the <em>Clemons\u2019 </em>standards applicable to <em>pre-Stovall </em>cases, the admission of Mrs. Neal\u2019s pre-trial identification of appellant Coleman was not error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\">.

It may be argued that if the lineup was suggestive, all the witnesses, rather than only Mrs. Neal, would have been able to make an identification. This contention, however, misconceives the nature of the lineup\u2019s infirmity. We are not faced with a bald attempt to single out a suspect by methods' \u2014 such as presenting one suspect in handcuffs, or having only uniformed officers as the other participants \u2014 which convey their suggestion irrespective of the witnesses\u2019 prior description. Rather, the lineup in question was suggestive because only appellant met the general description provided by Mrs. Neal. While thus suggestive as to her, the lineups impact on the other witnesses would depend on their recollection as to the offender\u2019s salient characteristics. As the Government\u2019s brief points out, the remaining witnesses were not struck by the shortness of the offender.

Thus, the Government contends there was a responsibility to choose participants who conformed to all of the descriptions received by the police from the various witnesses. We certainly agree that the police have such a responsibility. But as the Government itself points out, the participants in the lineup were the <em>only </em>subjects available at that particular time and the absence of other short men was due to this factor rather than the necessity of meeting the descriptions given by the other witnesses. In this regard Officer O\u2019Brien testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-18\">Q. So then no particular effort was made to find others of the same size and shape and age of Mr. Williams?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-19\">A.
