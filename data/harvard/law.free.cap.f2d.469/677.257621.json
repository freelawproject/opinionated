After the district court granted certificate of probable cause and leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis, </em>the cause was docketed in this Court and now comes to us for appropriate disposition under Local Rule 9(c)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-27\">It has come to the attention of this Court that the appellant\u2019s state habeas corpus petition was granted by the Criminal District Court of Dallas County, Texas, that court having jurisdiction over the matter for purpose of conducting an evidentiary hearing on the appellant\u2019s ha-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>beas application pursuant to a venue change from Collin and Grayson Counties. Appellant\u2019s four convictions were set aside and new trials have been ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Since Sloan is no longer incarcerated by virtue of the allegedly unconstitutional convictions, the question of his exhaustion of state remedies is moot. <em>See </em>Merneigh v. Smith, 5th Cir. 1972 [No. 71-2274, February 7, 1972], The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-16\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this <em>pro se </em>case summarily, pursuant to this Court\u2019s Local Rule 9 (c) (2), appellant having failed to file a brief within the time fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
