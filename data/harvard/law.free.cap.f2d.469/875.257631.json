Cause No. 70-H-880 was filed August 17, 1970, and Cause No. 71-H-31 was filed January 13, 1971. Each action alleges, in essence, that Ulcerine is a new drug which may not be shipped in interstate commerce without prior approval of the new drug application required by 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 355. Bentex Pharmaceutical Company, Houston, Texas, intervened and filed claims and answers in both cases. The cases were found to involve common questions of fact and law and were consolidated under Rule 42(a) Fed.R.Civ.P. The matter was tried to the Court on October 18, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">Ulcerine is a prescription drug<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for human use in the treatment of peptic ulcers, owned and distributed by the Ben-tex Pharmaceutical Company. The shipments seized in this action were in interstate commerce.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The formula and labeling<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the drug Ulcerine are the same as the formula and labeling for the drug De-Nol. Ulcerine is merely another trade name for De-Nol. The name Ulcerine has been used by the claimant Bentex Pharmaceutical Company in distributing the drug in the United States since 1968. Prior to 1968 Sharina Phar-macal Company, Memphis, Tennessee, imported and distributed De-Nol for De-Nol Laboratories, Ltd. of Johannesburg, South Africa.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">De-Nol Laboratories, Ltd. is the original owner and source for both De-Nol and Ulcerine.- The claimant pays De-Nol Laboratories a royalty for use of the formula in manufacturing Ulcerine.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">De-Nol was first marketed for the treatment of peptic ulceration in 1946 in South Africa and elsewhere outside the United States. De-Nol was first marketed in the United States in 1953 and has been regularly marketed here since 1959. Prior to October 9, 1962, and thereafter, De-Nol was marketed by the Sharina Pharmaeal Company, Memphis, Tennessee. Since 1968 it has been marketed by the claimant under the trade name Ulcerine.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b957-15\">If Ulcerine is a \u201cnew drug\u201d (as defined in \u00a7 321 (p) of 21 U.S.C.A.), it may not be introduced or shipped in interstate commerce without an approved new drug application required by 21 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 355. In such case plaintiff\u2019s seizure was proper under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334; it is undisputed there is not now, nor has there ever been, an approved new drug application for Ulcerine or for De-Nol.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-16\">Claimant contends (1) that Ulcerine is not a \u201cnew drug\u201d as defined by the Act; and (2) that Ulcerine is entitled to the protection of the \u201cGrandfather Clause\u201d of the 1962 Drug Amendments Act, Section 107(c)(4) of Public Law 87-781. If Ulcerine is an old drug or a \u201cgrandfather\u201d drug, it is entitled to be shipped in interstate commerce without prior approval of a new drug application, and plaintiff\u2019s seizure was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-17\">THE APPLICABLE STATUTES</p>\n<p id=\"b957-18\">A new drug is currently defined in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321 (p) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-19\">\u201c(p) The term \u2018new drug\u2019 means\u2014 \u201c(1) Any drug . . . the composition of which is such that such drug is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by specific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof, except that such a drug not so recognized shall not be deemed to be a \u2018new drug\u2019 if at any time prior to the enactment of this chapter it was subject to the Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, as amended, and if at such time its labeling contained the same representation concerning the conditions of its use; . . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">On October 10, 1962, the Kefauver-Harris Amendments (Public Law 87-781), known as the Drug Amendments Act of 1962, became effective. This legislation changed the pre-existing definition of a new drug by adding the words \u201cand effectiveness\u201d and the words \u201cand effective\u201d to the present definition. Therefore from 1938 to 1962 an \u201cold drug\u201d was one generally recognized by qualified experts as safe for its intended uses. There was no requirement that an old drug generally be regarded as effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">The Drug Amendments Act of 1962 contained a \u201cGrandfather Clause\u201d, which exempted certain drugs from the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d requirement of the new definition, if no new claims of efficacy were made. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-6\">\u201c(4) In the case of any drug which, on the day immediately preceding the enactment date, (A) was commercially used or sold in the United States, (B) was not a new drug as defined by section 201 (p) of the basic Act as then in force (subsec. (p) of this section), and (C) was not covered by an effective application under section 505 of that Act (section 355 of this title), the amendments to section 201 (p) (subsec. (p) of this section) made by this Act shall not apply to such drug when intended solely for use under conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in labeling with respect to such drug on that day.\u201d (Pub.L. 87-781, \u00a7 107(c)(4), 21 U.S. C.A. note following \u00a7 321.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">Thus, if Ulcerine is <em>presently </em>regarded by qualified experts as both <em>safe and effective </em>for its intended uses, it is not a new drug. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321 (p) AMP Inc. v. Gardner, 389 F.2d 825 (2nd Cir. 1968), cert. den. sub nom. AMP Inc. v. Cohen, 393 U.S. 825, 89 S. Ct. 86, 21 L.Ed.2d 95 (1968). If Ulcerine (De-Nol) was generally regarded by qualified experts <em>on October 9, 1962 </em>(the effective date of the \u201cGrandfather Clause\u201d exemption), as <em>safe </em>for its intended uses it is a \u201cgrandfathered\u201d drug and not a new drug. Drug Amendments Act of 1962, Pub.L. 87-871 Section 107(c)(4), 21 U.S.C.A. note following \u00a7 321; Tyler Pharmacal Distributors, Inc. v. U. S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 408 F.2d 95 (7th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">IS ULCERINE A \u201cGRANDFATHERED\u201d DRUG?</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">The government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Ulcerine is a new drug. United States v. Articles of Drug Labeled \u201cQuick-O-Ver\u201d, 274 F.Supp. 443 (D.Md.1967); see also United States v. . . . Unitrol, 325 F.2d 513 (3rd Cir. 1962). However, the \u201cGrandfather Clause\u201d is to be strictly construed against the one who invokes its protection. United States v. Allan Drug Co., 357 F.2d 713 (10th Cir. 1966), cert. den. 385 U.S. 899, 87 S.Ct. 203, 17 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966). The claimant Bentex must prove every essential fact necessary for invocation of the exemption. See: United States v. First City Natl. Bank of Houston, 386 U.S. 361, 87 S.Ct. 1088, 18 L.Ed.2d 151 (1967); Rheem Mfg. Co. v. Rheem, 295 F.2d 473 (9th Cir. 1961); United States v. Bodine Produce Co., 206 F.Supp. 201 (D.Ariz.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">The claimant\u2019s evidence shows De-Nol<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was distributed to only a very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>limited extent before October 9, 1962. Between 1958 and June 30, 1963, a total of only four thousand bottles were imported. This statistic becomes significant when considered in light of the statutory term \u201cgenerally recognized\u201d. As stated in United States v. 7 Cartons . . . Ferro-Lac, 293 F.Supp. 660, 662, 663 (S.D.Ill.1968), modified on other gi\u2019ounds 424 F.2d 1364 (7th Cir. 1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-5\">\u201cThe statute provides a test of general recognition. The rule stated in <em>Merritt </em>[Merritt Corp. v. Folsom, D. C., 165 F.Supp. 418] and subsequent eases would equate the statutory language, \u2018generally recognized\u2019 to \u2018unanimously recognized.\u2019 There is no justification for such equation. There is nothing in the statute to indicate that Congress intended \u2018generally recognized\u2019 in other than its commonly understood meaning. The adverb, \u2018generally,\u2019 is defined, inter alia, to mean, \u2018In general; extensively, though not universally; most frequently, but not without exception; * * *.\u2019 Webster\u2019s New Twentieth Century Dictionary, Unabridged, 2nd Ed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">Claimant\u2019s evidence on this issue is not impressive. At best, it tends to show that the drug was used, prescribed and enthusiastically endorsed by a few physicians in Memphis, Tennessee (including the importer); and sold to no more than perhaps 150 to 200 doctors in some two or three neighboring states.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">Bearing in mind that the test is whether the drug was <em>generally recognized </em>as safe on the date in question (not whether in fact it <em>was </em>safe), AMP Inc. v. Gardner, <em>supra, </em>I am simply unable to find its use or reputation was sufficiently widespread at that time as to qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">IS ULCERINE A \u201cNEW DRUG\u201d ?</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">Again, the question raised is one of general recognition \u2014 is Ulcerine <em>generally recognized </em>by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, as <em>safe and effective </em>for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof. AMP Inc. v. Gardner, <em>supra; </em>Tyler Pharmacal Distributors, Inc. v. U. S. Dept, of Health, Education and Welfare, <em>supra. </em>On this issue the government has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. United States v. Articles of Drug Labeled \u201cQuick-O-Ver,\u201d <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">On this issue the claimant presented a much stronger case. While the matter is not at all free of doubt, again, however, I am of the view and find that the government has the better of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">The claimant\u2019s testimony shows (from the president of claimant corporation, and sales representative of a drug firm) that since 1968 Ulcerine (a) has been sold in all fifty states; (b) has been used and prescribed by about 2,000 separate doctors; (c) sales have averaged about 2,000 bottles per month, which indicates (d) that about 1,000 patients per month have used it.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-14\">Additionally, claimant has presented some six doctors, both physicians and surgeons. The physicians testified essentially that each of them had used the drug when the more accepted and recognized remedies had failed; and that the results had been startling, even dramatic in some cases. Each was an enthusiastic advocate of its virtues. The surgeons testified that they had resorted to surgery with much less frequency than formerly, and attributed their many non-surgieal cures to the Ulcerine treatment. Some of these witnesses were quite impressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-15\">The government, on the other hand, offered a number of doctors with outstanding credentials. Their testimony was essentially to the effect that they had only recently learned of Ulcerine; that the drug had not been the subject of carefully controlled laboratory experimentation, and that there was a dearth of scientific literature on the subject. It had not been widely discussed at medical meetings and gatherings of physicians and scientists. For this reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>they were skeptical of the drug, and would not themselves prescribe it. By reason of these facts they did not consider it generally recognized as \u201csafe and effective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">The government urges strongly that the admitted fact that laboratory testing and experimentation has been very limited and articles appearing in medical journals and periodicals almost non-existent is itself enough to show that the test has not been met. I am not prepared to accept this at face value [United States v. 41 Cases, More or Less, 420 F.2d 1126 (5th Cir. 1970)]. It is, however, persuasive. Certainly it is not unreasonable that if a drug is generally recognized as safe and effective, one would find in the medical literature over a period of years support for this premise from wide experimentation and study.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">I drew the impression from the claimant\u2019s medical witnesses that each considered himself something of a pioneer in his use and advocacy of this medication. Each had talked to his fellow physicians and associates about it, but I drew the impression that until such discussions these associates were unfamiliar with the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Thus, I think it may be said that the claimant\u2019s evidence shows at best that while sales and popularity of the drug have increased rather drastically \u2014while it is advocated by a number of physicians who strongly espouse its use in preference to other more accepted measures, I am of the view that it still falls short of being <em>generally recognized </em>as safe and effective by those qualified in the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">Thus, I am of the view that Uleerine is a new drug within the meaning of the statute and that it is not protected by the \u201cGrandfather Clause\u201d. It, therefore, was subject to forfeiture and condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Counsel for the government will prepare an appropriate order, submit same to opposing counsel for approval as to form, and hand same to the Court promptly. The foregoing shall constitute Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">The clerk will file the Memorandum and Order and furnish true copies hereof to the appropriate parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">Done at Houston, Texas, this 20th day of April, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">BEN C.
