The trunk of the vehicle was opened and was seen to contain two foot lockers. The Government concedes that neither of the lockers was of sufficient size to conceal a human being. The Government\u2019s agents opened the lockers and discovered the marijuana in question. Lujan-Romero\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence was denied, apparently upon the basis of the Government\u2019s argument that the two lockers, if opened at their ends and joined, would have then, together, contained sufficient space to conceal an alien. We cannot accept this argument. The record discloses that the investigating agents might have quite easily, without opening the lockers pushed them apart and ascertained whether or not they were in fact joined together. Our court has held that government agents of the authority such as those here involved are authorized to search only those portions of an automobile or its contents which are reasonably susceptible of concealing aliens. <em>See, e.g., </em>Valenzuela-Garcia v. United States, 425 F.2d 1170 (9th Cir. 1970). The motion to suppress should have been granted. The judgment of conviction is vacated, and upon remand, the indictment will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-15\">Reversed, with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b764-23\">.
