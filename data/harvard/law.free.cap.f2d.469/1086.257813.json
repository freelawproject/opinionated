Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), because he received inadequate warnings during his initial interrogation. However, he was not prejudiced in any way by these inadequate warnings since he gave no confession, made no damaging statements, and, in fact, pleaded guilty at trial. In these circumstances, there is nothing to which the <em>Miranda </em>rule can apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-17\">Uribe also claims that his attorney and the prosecution made a plea bargain which was not kept. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing on this issue. <em>See </em>Macon v. Craven, 457 F.2d 342 (9th Cir. 1972). The record supports the decision of the lower court that no bargain had been struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-18\">Finally, Uribe alleges that he pleaded guilty to and was convicted of a crime other than the one with which he was charged. Upon this claim he has failed to exhaust his available state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
