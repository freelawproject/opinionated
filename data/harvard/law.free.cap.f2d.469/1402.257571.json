He prayed for a declaratory judgment that the defendants had violated the Economic Stabilization Act, the Regulations and Executive Order No. 11627; an order enjoining the defendants from enforcing the judgment of eviction they had obtained from the State court and for damages in the amount of $25,000. The trial court granted a temporary restraining order, but two weeks later vacated that order and dismissed the complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-15\">We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-16\">We are advised that Pollack has vacated the premises which were the subject of the complaint, thus all issues relating to injunctive relief are moot. The dispute out of which this litigation arises developed on or before May 1, 1970 and was the subject of State administrative proceedings long before August 15, 1971, the effective date of Executive Order No. 11627 which established Federal rent controls. Counsel has not demonstrated and we cannot visualize any theory within the facts here presented under which Pollack can claim to be a \u201cperson suffering legal wrong because of any act or practice arising out of [The Economic Stabilization Act] or any order or regulation issued pursuant thereto, . . . \u201d \u00a7 210(a) Economic Stabilization Act, as amended, Public Law 92-210, December 22, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-18\">This case has been assigned to the summary calendar by the Chief Judge pursuant to Rules 24 and 27 of the Rules of this court for summary disposition without oral argument. Counsel have been advised of that calendar assignment. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
