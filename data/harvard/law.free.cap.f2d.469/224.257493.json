(50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-20\">The board made repeated unsuccessful efforts to reach him through the mailing addresses that he furnished. He did inform his board at one time that he was enrolled in Los Angeles City College and that he was an alien. Substantial compliance with Section 462 requires more than giving the board a few clues by which the registrant can be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-21\">The evidence amply sustained the district court\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s failure to keep his board informed of his current address was deliberate. The pattern of appellant\u2019s conduct gave every indication of evasive tactics to avoid receiving mail from the board. The record is unlike Ward v. United States, (1953) 344 U.S. 924, 73 S.Ct. 494, 97 L. Ed. 711. In <em>Ward </em>the registrant furnished his board with his employer\u2019s complete address, and the evidence showed that he received mail at that address. No similar showing was made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
