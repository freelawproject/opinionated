Nixon as President of the United States.\u201d This advertisement,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> comprising 5,100 lines of space and costing $17,850, was paid for by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>\u201cThe National Committee for Impeachment,\u201d listed certain officers and sponsors as well as attorneys for the executive committee, and contained two contributions coupons at the end. About half of the advertisement and its central portion was occupied by a reprint of a House Resolution, H.R. 976, 92nd Cong. 2d Sess. (1972), introduced by five Representatives on May 10, 1972, alleging among other things that the President has unconstitutionally \u201carrogated to himself the power to declare war and the power \u2018to make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval forces,\u2019 which are committed by article I, section 8, clauses 11 and 14 of the Constitution solely to the Congress . . . .,\u201d and essentially calling for his impeachment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the grounds of his Vietnam war policies. The remainder of the advertisement contains language which, the- Government urges and the trial court found, makes the National Committee for Impeachment (hereinafter the \u201cNational Committee\u201d) a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d under section 301(f) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (1972 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, p. 13) (hereinafter \u201cFECA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d). As such, the National Committee and its two principal officers have been enjoined<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from \u201cperforming the functions of a political committee . . . including the acceptance of contributions and the disbursement of monies . . ., unless it first files statements and reports required by sections 303, 304 and 306 of the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Na-' tional Committee and its two principal officers have appealed, urging inapplicability of this new regulatory statute to the Committee, as well as the unconstitutionality of Titles I and III of FECA on their face and as applied in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The injunction below is also claimed to be excessively broad and a prior restraint on free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-12\">Appellants argue that FECA should be narrowly construed to avoid infringing their first amendment rights, by requiring the Government to show a closer nexus between the Committee and a specific candidate than is revealed in the newspaper advertisement which is the basis of this suit and to make a showing that the principal aim or thrust of the organization or its questioned advertisement is to influence an election. We need not reach the constitutional issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>raised by the Act here since we agree with appellants that solely on the strength of this one advertisement and contributions made in response to it the Act is inapplicable to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">The Act applies only if the National Committee is a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d within the FECA, and more particularly \u00a7 301(f) thereof. The Government advances two reasons for urging what it calls the Act\u2019s \u201cobvious\u201d applicability. The first is that the National Committee \u201chas attempted to influence the outcome of various Congressional primary and general elections\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Brief at 4) in that the advertisement states that the National Committee has placed on its \u201cHonor Roll\u201d in addition to the five original sponsors of the impeachment resolution three congressmen who signed the resolution as co-sponsors and Rep. Paul N. McCloskey, Jr., as the first person who stated publicly that President Nixon should be threatened with impeachment. The advertisement goes on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-5\">The National Committee for Impeachment will devote its resources in funds and publicity in aid of any new candidate for election to the House of Representatives or re-election of an incumbent Member, whether in a primary contest or the actual election contest, whether Republican, Democrat, Independent, or a new party, in the order in which their names are officially printed in The Congressional Record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1218-6\">The second ground urged by the Government in its brief and supporting papers for our declaring the National Committee to be a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d is that by this advertisement and the contributions made in .response to it, the Committee has attempted to influence \u201cthe outcome of the 1972 Presidential and Vice Presidential elections.\u201d (Affidavit of T. Gorman Reilly at \u00b6 3.) While the Government\u2019s brief does not-fully articulate a third ground, in the affidavit supporting the motion for a preliminary injunction, as well as on oral argument, it is urged that because the advertisement is derogatory to the President\u2019s stand on the Vietnam war, the President is a candidate for re-election, and the war is a campaign issue,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the advertisement was an attempt to influence the presidential election. <em>{Id. </em>at \u00b6 8.) The Brief on the other hand (4-5) relies on the language of the advertisement reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-9\">If said majority [of the House of Representatives to pass an impeachment resolution] is not obtained by a certain deadline to be set by the Executive Committee of the National Committee for Impeachment, it will seek to establish, if possible, pursuant to the appropriate legal methods in each of the 50 States of the Nation, a new political party for the nomination and election of a new President and Vice-President of the United States, and of new or incumbent members of the House of Representatives, known as the Puritan Party of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1218-10\">The Government also notes (Brief at 18-19) that the text of the advertisement concludes with an exhortation \u201cto help finance our work by a contribution of $1 or more,\u201d with the above mentioned contribution coupons available to be clipped.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-11\">The statute in question provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmIK\">Section 301. When used in this title\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>(d) \u201cpolitical committee\u201d means any committee, association, or organization which accepts contributions or makes expenditures during a calendar year in an aggregate amount exceeding $1,000;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-4\">(e) \u201ccontribution\u201d means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-5\">(1) a gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value, made for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any person to Federal office or as a presidential or vice-presidential elector ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-6\">(f) \u201cexpenditure\u201d means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-7\">(1) a purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value, made for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any person to Federal office, or as a presidential and vice-presidential elector ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">The Senate Report, S.Rep.No. 92-96, 92nd Cong. 2d Sess., 1972, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, p. 45 et seq., which is particularly important because the Senate Bill was the one passed in lieu of the House bills, may be searched in vain for any passage which throws further light upon the meaning of \u201cpolitical committee\u201d or \u201cmade for the purpose of influencing.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here as elsewhere Congress \u201chas voiced its wishes in muted strains and left it to the courts to discern the theme in the cacophony of political understanding.\u201d Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397, 412, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 1218, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970). Our chief resources in this undertaking include not only the words of the statute and, in the words of <em>Rosado, supra </em>at 412, 90 S.Ct. at 1218, \u201cthose common-sense assumptions that must be made in determining direction without a compass,\u201d but some fundamental principles of freedom of expression in our democratic form of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-13\">We deal first with the point of the Government in respect to the \u201cHonor Roll\u201d of Congressmen, noting that in the case of each of the Congressmen named there was no authorization or approval on his or her part in respect to the advertisement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, there is no evidence of any advance knowledge of the advertisement on the part of any of the Congressmen or of any connection between any of them and the National Committee or that any money received by the National Committee has been expended on behalf of any of them in any way. The Government says it is enough that the advertisement was published and sought money, since publication alone is said to have been an \u201cobvious\u201d political activity that was intended to further the candidacies of the Congressmen so \u201chonored.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-14\">The words of the Act themselves point toward some more definite connection between candidate and committee than was here involved. Section 303(b) (6) (1972) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, p. 15), for example, includes within the organizational statement required to be filed by a political committee</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-15\">the name, address, office sought, and party affiliation of (A) each candidate whom the committee is supporting, and (B) any other individual, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>any, whom the committee is supporting for nomination for election, or election, to any public office whatever; or, if the committee is supporting the entire ticket of any party, the name of the party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">While dealing with reports required to be filed by a political committee, the Act relates specifically to election campaigns, including within the scope of contributions that have to be reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-5\">the total amount of proceeds from (A) the sale of tickets to each dinner, luncheon, rally, and other fund-raising event; (B) mass collections made at such events; and (C) sales of items such as political campaign pins, buttons, badges, flags, emblems, hats, banners, literature, and similar materials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJX\">\u00a7 304(b)(6), 1972 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, p. 17. Thus, the words of the Act seem to indicate that Congress\u2019 concern was primarily with groups organized or at least authorized by a particular candidate and whose principal focus is a specific campaign. The central theme of the advertisement at issue here relates to impeachment of the President, not specific election campaigns or candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">The statement in the ad that the Committee will use its \u201cfunds and publicity\u201d in aid of any new candidate for election or re-election of an incumbent looks toward the future, but does not imply that the Congressmen named have agreed to such use. It is made, moreover, in the context that an impeachment resolution requires for passage under art. I, \u00a7 2, \u00b6 5 of the Constitution a vote of 218 of the 435 members of the House of Representatives. We reiterate: the basic thrust of the advertisement is toward impeachment and war-policy condemnation, not toward the election of Congressmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-12\">As much or more can be said of the language of the advertisement looking rather vaguely in the future<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> toward the creation of a new party to nominate and elect a President and Vice President and new or incumbent members of the House, contingent upon the National Committee\u2019s failure by a \u201cdeadline to be set\u201d to secure the majority of House members necessary to pass an impeachment resolution. Again, the central theme is impeachment, not the seeking of funds. Qualitatively, as well as quantitatively, the advertisement seeks support of an impeachment resolution, not the election of political candidates. As such, the purpose of the advertisement as we construe it was at most only incidentally to support candidates and engage in \u201cpolitical activity\u201d within the FECA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-13\"> Given that conclusion, we think that the publication of this advertisement alone did not make the National Committee a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d within the FECA. Were we to think otherwise Title III of the Act would raise serious constitutional issues, on which we express no opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 262, 265, 266, 88 S.Ct. 419, 19 L.Ed.2d 508 (1967) (statutes impinging on first amendment rights must be narrowly drawn); Mills v. Alabama, 384 U.S. 214, 86 S.Ct. 1434, 16 L.Ed.2d 484 (1966) (first amendment invalidates state statute prohibiting <em>election day </em>editorials);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> NAACP v. Ala-</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>bama, 357 U.S. 449, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed. 2d 1488 (1958) (court-ordered disclosure of names of members of controversial group held an unconstitutional interference with the right of free association) ;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Opinions of the Justices, 284 N.E.2d 919 (Sup.Jud.Ct.Mass., 1972) (proposed Massachusetts statute regulating political advertising declared unconstitutionally vague).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-4\">We thus construe the words (\u201cmade for the purpose of influencing\u201d in Section 301(e) and (f)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to mean an <em>I </em>expenditure made with the authorization I or consent, express or implied, or under | the control, direct or indirect, of a candidate or his agents. For, in the words of Professor Emerson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1221-5\">[Regulations confined to candidates and election campaigns are directed to a limited end and deal with a limited situation. Hence they can be formulated with some objectivity and avoid the dangers of abuse in administration. This cannot be done with regulations . . . addressed to the innumerable different kinds of people seeking to express themselves for different purposes throughout the whole system of free expression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">The System of Freedom of Expression 640 (Vintage ed. 1970). We also construe the Act to apply only to commit- [ tees soliciting contributions or making ! expenditures the major purpose of which j is the nomination or election of candidates. Here neither statutory test is met: any authorization or control by any candidate \u2014 indeed any connection whatsoever between the National Committee and any candidate \u2014 is missing and the major purpose of the advertisement was to promote the impeachment movement and to condemn governmental policy on the Vietnam war, not to elect candidates. In <em>ho </em>saying, we need not determine whether, if one statutory test were met, the statute would be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-10\">In thus narrowly construing the Act we follow United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 73 S.Ct. 543, 97 L.Ed. 770 (1953), where the Court gave a limited construction to the phrase \u201clobbying activities\u201d \u201cin the candid service\u201d in Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s words \u201cof avoiding a serious constitutional doubt.\u201d 345 U.S. at 47, 73 S.Ct. at 546. <em>See also </em>Pipefitters Local Union No. 562 v. United States, 407 U.S. 385, 92 S.Ct. 2247, 33 L.Ed.2d 11 (1972) (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 610 interpreted so as not to prohibit political expenditures from voluntarily-financed union political funds); United States v. Painters Local Union No. 481, 172 F.2d 854 (2d Cir. 1949) (statute interpreted so as not to prohibit union advertisements in a newspaper of general circulation). <em>Accord, </em>United States v. CIO, 335 U.S. 106, 121, 68 S.Ct. 1349, 92 L.Ed. 1849 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-11\">Such a construction is, we think, also consistent with the principal purpose of the Act. <em>See </em>United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 622-623, 74 S. Ct. 808, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954). That principal purpose, the Commerce Committee report indicates, related to \u201cthe problem of political campaign reform and excessively high campaign costs.\u201d Sen. Rep. No. 92-96, <em>supra, </em>1972 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News, p. 58. Congressional concern was with political campaign financing, not with the funding of move<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>ments dealing with national policy. Admittedly, under this interpretation, enforcement of the Act may be made somewhat more burdensome, as the supervisory officials will be forced to glean the principal or major purpose of the organizations they seek to have comply with the Act. The broad administrative discretion which the Government\u2019s construction of the Act would allow, however, would itself be incompatible with the first amendment which requires that administrative standards regulating free expression be precisely drawn. <em>See, e. g., </em>Kunz v. New York, 340 U.S. 290, 71 S.Ct. 312, 95 L.Ed. 280 (1951); Saia v. New York, 334 U.S. 558, 68 S.Ct. 1148, 92 L.Ed. 1574 (1948); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">We dispose more readily of the Government\u2019s suggestion that the Act applies to the National Committee because \u2014 quoting from the affidavit supporting its motion for a preliminary injunction \u2014 \u201cwith respect to the upcoming election for President and Vice-President of the United States, the National Committee derogates President Nixon\u2019s stand on a principal campaign issue \u2014 the Vietnam war.\u201d On this basis every position on any issue, major or minor, taken by anyone would be a campaign issue and- any comment upon it in, say, a newspaper editorial or an advertisement<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> would be subject to proscription unless the registration and disclosure regulations of the Act in question were complied with. Such a result would, we think, be abhorrent; the Government fails to point to a shred of evidence in the legislative history of the Act that would tend to indicate Congress meant to go so far. Any organization would be wary of expressing any viewpoint lest under the Act it be required to register, file reports, disclose its contributors, or the like. On the Government\u2019s thesis every little Audubon Society chapter would be a \u201cpolitical committee,\u201d for \u201cenvironment\u201d is an issue in one campaign after another. On this basis, too, a Boy Scout troop advertising for membership to combat \u201cjuvenile delinquency\u201d or a Golden Age Club promoting \u201csenior citizens\u2019 rights\u201d would fall under the Act. The dampening effect on first amendment rights and the potential for arbitrary administrative action that would result from such a situation would be intolerable. The suggestion in the Government\u2019s supporting affidavit and on oral . argument is inconsistent with what Judge Learned Hand so eloquently described as \u201cthe spirit of liberty\u201d and which he so beautifully defined as \u201cthe spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; that there may be a kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.\u201d L. Hand, The Spirit of Liberty 190 (I. Dilliard ed. 1952). We reject the suggestion for we believe Congress had no intention of regulating the expression of opinion on fundamental issues of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">The granting of a preliminary injunction is therefore reversed, and the cause remanded for a hearing on the merits at which the Government may, \u2019 of course, seek to adduce proof that the statutory standards here enunciated were met in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1216-26\">.
