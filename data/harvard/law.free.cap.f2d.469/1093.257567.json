Brown, Pittsburgh, Pa., of counsel), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1173-17\">Before SEITZ, Chief Judge, and HASTIE and HUNTER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1173-18\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b1173-19\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1173-20\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the district court denying appellant Si-ders\u2019 claim for \u201cmaintenance and cure.\u201d The district court, in a well-written opinion, 351 F.Supp. 987, held that appellant did not prove that he had become mentally or physically ill in any substantial way while on appellee\u2019s ship. The court found alternatively that appellant could be denied recovery because during his pre-employment physical, he wilfully concealed information about his prior poor health.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-22\">Appellant presents three grounds for reversal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-23\">1) the district court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law are clearly erroneous as to what appellant had to prove to recover maintenance and cure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-24\">2) the district court applied the wrong legal standard as to what eon-constitutes wilful misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-25\">3) appellant was denied a right to a jury trial because his \u201cmaintenance and cure\u201d claim was joined with a claim based on the Jones Act under which he had a right to a jury trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1173-26\">Appellant\u2019s arguments are without merit: He has presented nothing to give us \u201cthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d that is necessary to hold that a district court\u2019s findings of fact were \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 394-395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). For the reasons set forth in its opinion, we hold that the district court correctly applied the law to these facts. It also used the proper standard to determine what constitutes wilful misrepresentation. McCorpen v. Central Gulf Steamship Corporation, 396 F.2d 547 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-28\">Appellant was entitled to a trial by jury on both his Jones Act and maintenance and cure claims if he presented a request for one. Fitzgerald v. U. S. Lines Co., 374 U.S. 16, 83 S.Ct. 1646, 10 L.Ed.2d 720 (1962). It does not appear that he made such a request. There is not one in his complaint; there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>is no showing that he objected to a non-jury trial; he did not list this argument as a grounds for error in his motion for a new trial, and he raises it for the first time on appeal. He has clearly waived his right to a jury trial. <em>See, e. g., </em>Main Line Theatres, Inc., v. Paramount Film Distrib. Corp., 298 F.2d 801 (3d Cir. 1962); 5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 38.43. Additionally, the record supports a conclusion that his maintenance and cure claim was severed from his Jones Act claim (which carried the right to trial by jury) at appellant\u2019s request so as to permit an expedited trial of the former claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
