Appellant asserted below that it had widely publicized the trademark ROCKS IN THE BOTTLE. On this appeal it, for the first time, asserts prior rights in the mark ON THE ROCKS based upon an application for alcohol label approval allegedly granted by \u201cthe Federal Government on March 29, I960.!\u2019 Neither contention finds any support in the record in the form of competent evidence and will not be considered by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-22\">Appellant\u2019s evidence comprises a copy of its registration and an advertisement by Neiman Marcus, a department store, for a variety of men\u2019s toilet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>ries including one designated GRAVEL SUTTER\u2019S CREEK A MAN\u2019S PERFUME which appeared in the December 13, 1962 edition of the \u201cDallas Morning News.\u201d Appellant asserts that this advertisement, introduced under Trademark Rule 2.123(c) \u201cevidences use by opposer of a bottle of its \u2018GRAVEL\u2019, cologne containing rocks or stones.\u201d With reference to this advertisement, the board took the position, correctly we think, that since it was introduced and relied upon for the truth of what it revealed, it constituted no more than hearsay. Its evidentiary scope and effect was to show no more than the promotion of the cologne \u201cunder the particular mark in that newspaper on the particular day the said newspaper issued.\u201d In material part, the testimony adduced by appellee indicates that it was incorporated in 1966 and thereafter sold men\u2019s cologne and after-shave lotion in bottles containing simulated ice cubes of plastic under the mark ON THE ROCKS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-4\">The goods of the parties are identical, and appellant has clearly established prior use. The single issue calling for resolution here is whether appellee\u2019s mark ON THE ROCKS so resembles appellant\u2019s previously registered mark GRAVEL as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake or deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-5\">We adopt the board\u2019s succinct and proper resolution of this issue stating and holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1478-6\">Opposer contends that \u201cROCKS\u201d and \u201cGRAVEL\u201d are substantially identical in meaning but applicant\u2019s mark is not \u201cROCKS\u201d, it is \u201cON THE ROCKS\u201d, a term having specific meanings which do not relate to the term \u201cGRAVEL\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1478-7\">The term \u201con the rocks\u201d is defined in \u201cWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\u201d, 1965, as meaning:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1478-8\">a) \u201cin or into a state of destruction or wreckage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1478-9\">b) \u201cin or into a state of bankruptcy or destitution.\u201d c) \u201con ice cubes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1478-11\">It is apparent that applicant\u2019s mark is intended to suggest the last stated definition since simulated ice cubes form part of the package for its cologne.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-12\">The marks \u201cGRAVEL\u201d and \u201cON THE ROCKS\u201d have no similarities whatsoever and we conclude that there is no likelihood of confusion or mistake or deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-13\">The decision of the board is affirmed. Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1477-23\">. Serial No. 245,713 filed September 19, 1966.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"avl-dedup-0\">. Reg.
