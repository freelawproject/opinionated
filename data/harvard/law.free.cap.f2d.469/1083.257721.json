Appellant claims that his plea of guilty was void because a requested and ordered psychiatric examination was never held. He also contends that he was not adequately admonished as to the consequences of his plea as required by F.R.Cr.P. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-28\">His contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-29\">The petitioner filed an earlier 2255 motion which was denied upon the merits. The instant one was denied as a mere duplication of the first. Petitioner in several letters written to the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>trict Court Judge admitted that the claimed deprivation of the psychiatric examination was merely a device to enable the judge to vacate petitioner\u2019s original sentence and impose a lower one based on prison rehabilitation. The District Court properly refused to utilize 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 for such a purpose. United States v. Marchese, 341 F.2d 782, 788 (9th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">We agree that the first motion was frivolous as was that portion of the second motion which was repetition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">One claim newly asserted in the second petition \u2014 failure to comply with F.R.Cr.P. 11 in accepting the guilty plea \u25a0 \u2014 is without merit. The transcript of the proceeding shows full compliance. Williams v. United States, 466 F.2d 672 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
