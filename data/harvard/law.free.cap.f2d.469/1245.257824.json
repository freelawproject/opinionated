The court also ruled that Witmer\u2019s failure to perfect his security interest subordinated it to the perfected security interest of the Small Business Administration. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-21\">A brief recital of the facts will put the issue in perspective. Pursuant to the \u201cContract of Sale and Agreement\u201d set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Witmer deliv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>ered a walk-in food freezer to Wit-Mor Foods. Witmer agreed to sell, and Wit-Mor Foods to buy, the equipment for $6,000. The purchase price could be paid in any of three ways: first, the full amount could be paid immediately; second, Wit-Mor Foods could defer pay-meht for six months and have its monthly \u201crent\u201d of $30 credited against the purchase price; third, if payment were deferred for more than six months, no credits would be given. The agreement also provided that Witmer was to retain title to the equipment until the purchase price was paid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">Witmer did not file a financing statement covering the equipment. Although Wit-Mor Foods paid all monthly charges that came due, it never paid the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">Several months after delivery of the freezer, Wit-Mor Foods applied for an SBA Loan, listing the freezer among its assets. The SBA lent Wit-Mor Foods $25,000 and filed a financing statement covering all of the company\u2019s equipment and fixtures. About two and one-half years later, Wit-Mor Foods defaulted on the loan, and the SBA sold the assets securing the indebtedness. Before the sale Witmer claimed he owned the freezer, but the SBA insisted its security interest was superior. Witmer then purchased the freezer for $3,800 at the foreclosure sale and brought this action to obtain reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-8\">Witmer contends that the agreement should be construed as a lease with an option to purchase. He relies on the undisputed proposition that a financing statement need not be filed for a true lease in order to protect leased property in possession of a tenant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, he concludes, the absence of a financing statement did not afford the SBA a superior right to the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-9\">The government contends that the transaction was a conditional sale. Alternatively, it asserts that even if the transaction were a lease, it was intended as security.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under either of these interpretations, the government claims, Witmer\u2019s unperfeeted security interest was subordinate to the perfected security interest of the SBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>Though Wit-Mor Foods, Inc. is owned by Witmer\u2019s brother, the SBA and Wit-mer concede that the transaction was conducted at arm\u2019s length. Neither party presented any evidence about a prior course of dealing. Consequently, the meaning of the agreement must be determined by the language the contracting parties used when read in the light of commercial practices.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Applying this standard, we conclude that the parties did not intend a lease. Instead, as the following factors indicate, they intended a sale and delivery of the freezer with retention of title to secure the purchase price:</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">If The paper itself is described as a \u201cContract of Sale and Agreement,\u201d not as a lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">If The parties termed themselves buyer and seller, not lessee and lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">If They expressed a desire to consummate a sale of the freezer; there is no mention of any desire to lease it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">|f Witmer agreed to sell, and Wit-Mor Foods to buy, the freezer for a price of $6,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-8\">If Although the contract uses the term \u201crent\u201d to describe the monthly payments Wit-Mor Foods was to make if it deferred paying the purchase price, there is no evidence from which it can be inferred that, dealing at arm\u2019s length, the owner of a $6,000 piece of equipment would rent it for $30 a month\u2014 $360 a year; a more reasonable interpretation is that Wit-Mor Foods\u2019 monthly payments were in reality interest on the deferred purchase price at the rate of 6 per cent per annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-9\">If The absence of any provision for the expiration or termination of the monthly payments, other than by purchase, buttresses the conclusion that the parties did not intend a lease of the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-19\">If Payment of the \u201crent\u201d did not expressly convert the agreement into a lease, nor did it discharge Wit-Mor Foods\u2019 unequivocal obligation to purchase the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-20\">If Witmer\u2019s retention of title until he received the purchase price in full is a common commercial device typical of conditional sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-21\"> Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, dealing with secured transactions, applies \u201cto any transaction (regardless of its form) which is intended to create a security interest in personal property or fixtures . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Code defines security interest as \u201can interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment ... of an obligation.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Examination of Wit-mer\u2019s contract indicates that the parties intended that his retention of title would secure Wit-Mor Foods\u2019 payment of the purchase price. Article 2 of the Code, governing sales, specifically limits retention of title in delivered goods to a reservation of a security interest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court, therefore, properly held the contract created a security interest. This interpretation accords with the policy of including all consensual secured transactions involving personal property within the scope of Article 9.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because Witmer never filed a financing statement to perfect his security interest,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the perfected security interest of the SBA had priority.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-23\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1326-9\">.
