Jameson, Senior United States District Judge, District of Montana, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b768-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b768-23\">A search incident to an arrest for robbery of the Citizens Valley Bank, Shedd, Oregon, revealed $369.00 cash on Welp\u2019s immediate person. Welp was subsequently tried and convicted of that bank robbery, and we affirmed. United States v. Welp, 446 F.2d 867 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-24\">The money in question was turned over to the said bank. Appellant filed a petition with the District Court seeking the return of the money to him. After a hearing, the District Court dismissed appellant\u2019s petition, having found that the $369.00 was a product of the bank rob-ery, and belonged to the bank. Welp appeals from this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-25\">Questions of fact determined by the trial judge must be upheld on review unless \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Campbell v. United States, 373 U.S. 487, 493, 83 S.Ct. 1356, 10 L.Ed.2d 501 (1963); United States v. Page, 302 F.2d 81, 85 (9th Cir. 1962). A \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that a mistake was committed below is a prerequisite to appellate reversal. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-27\">Applying these standards we hold that under the facts of this case the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-28\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
