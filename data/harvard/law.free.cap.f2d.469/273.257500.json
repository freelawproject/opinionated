The evidence that formed the basis for his conviction was discovered during a warrant-less search of appellant\u2019s prison cell at Terminal Island Correctional Institution where he was already incarcerated. The search of Palmateer\u2019s cell followed a \u201cskin search\u201d of appellant\u2019s person near the prison commissary during which a prison official had found a $5.00 bill, which is contraband in a prison, and a magazine that the official considered to be \u201cpornographic.\u201d As a result of these violations of prison regulations, Palma-teer\u2019s cell was searched in an effort to discover any additional contraband. Six capsules of secobarbital, a narcotic, were discovered in a crumpled cigarette package in Palmateer\u2019s locker. Appellant contends that this search violated his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-15\">Prior to his trial, Palmateer failed to move under Rule 41(e),'F.R.Crim. P. to suppress the evidence obtained during the search of his cell. Nor did he move to suppress the evidence when it was introduced during trial. His failure to make any motion to suppress the evidence appears to have been a conscious part of Palmateer\u2019s trial strategy. He apparently hoped to convince the jury that someone else had placed the drugs in his cell. Under these circumstances, it has been held that there is a waiver of the Fourth Amendment claim. Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 85 S.Ct. 564, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965); Hill v. Nelson, 423 F.2d 167 (9th Cir. 1970); Evans v. Cupp, 415 F.2d 844 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-16\">However, even if the merits of Palmateer\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim were reached, his conviction must also be affirmed. We recently decided in United States v. Hitchcock, 467 F.2d 1107 (9th Cir. 1972) that a warrantless search of a prisoner\u2019s cell is reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Furthermore, the need to maintain security and discipline provides another basis for dispensing with the warrant requirement in this case. Stroud v. United States, 251 U.S. 15, 40 S.Ct. 50, 64 L.Ed. 103 (1919); United States v. Wilson, 447 F.2d 1 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
