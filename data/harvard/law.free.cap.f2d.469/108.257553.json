In a complaint seeking attorney fees, plaintiffs-appellants, G. S. Leonard, S. Clammer, and A. G. Flues, d/b/a Leonard, Clam-mer, Flues &amp; Redmon, lawyers practicing in Washington, D. C., allege that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>they were retained by BHJK to assist \u201cin arranging for the financing and sale\u201d of real property in Maryland known as Falconhurst, payment \u201cto be contingent\u201d upon their success \u201cin making arrangements for the disposition of the property\u201d acceptable to the four stockholders of defendant. They allege that they brought the defendant Ted Lingo, a licensed real estate broker in Maryland and the District of Columbia, \u201cinto contact with the stockholders of BHJK Corporation for direct negotiations between them\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and through Lingo a sale was consummated, and that plaintiffs were \u201cthe procuring cause of the sale\u201d and their \u201cservices under the retainer * * * were of an agreed price or reasonable value of $50,000.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In granting summary judgment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court held that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that plaintiffs were seeking to recover \u201ca real estate commission under the guise of a claim for attorney fees\u201d and had no \u201creal estate license in the state of Maryland or in the District of Columbia.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Summary judgment of course is proper only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. Rule 56 (c) F.R.Civ.P. The movant has the burden of clearly demonstrating the absence of any genuine issues as to all the material facts applicable under his theory of the law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and a party opposing summary judgment is entitled to the benefit of all favorable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court may not weigh or resolve issues.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In Harl v. Acacia Mutual Life Insurance Company, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 166, 317 F. 2d 577, 580 (1962), this court quoted with approval the holding of the Eighth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-14\">\u201cThat one reasonably may surmise that the plaintiff is unlikely to prevail upon a trial, is not a sufficient basis for refusing him his day in court with respect to issues which are not shown to be sham, frivolous, or so unsubstantial - that it would obviously be futile to try them.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">Two questions are presented on this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-16\">(1) Whether there are any genuine issues of any material facts with respect to (a) the representation of appellee by appellants, (b) the nature of any \u201cretainer\u201d agreement, (c) the nature of any services performed by appellants; and (d) whether appellants were the \u201cprocuring cause\u201d of the sale; and</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>(2) If the first question is answered in the affirmative, whether viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellant-attorneys they may maintain this action for services performed in connection with the sale of real property located in the State of Maryland, since admittedly they were not licensed real estate brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Appellee contends first that under the undisputed facts .appellants were never retained as attorneys, but \u201cwere contacted by a stockholder of defendant, as principals interested in either purchasing or syndicating the property.\u201d This stockholder, Louis Battistone, so testified, stating that initially he considered Clammer (or his wife) as a potential purchaser and subsequently as a member of a group interested in purchasing the property. He denied discussing any fee or commission arrangement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">On the other hand, each of the appellants testified that appellants\u2019 firm was retained by Battistone on a contingency basis to find a purchaser for the property, and then do whatever work was necessary to perfect the sale.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They testified that they had discussed a contingency fee arrangement of $80,000 with Battistone, to be decreased if the sale price decreased.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Mrs. Elizabeth P. Weisiger, a saleswoman for Lingo, testified that she understood that appellants were acting as counsel for ap-pellee.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-16\">In specifying the work to be performed pursuant to the \u201cretainer\u201d arrangement and subsequent. discussions with Battistone, appellants testified that they were to find a buyer for the property and prepare the property for sale. The preparation would depend upon the buyer, the price and the terms, but would involve obtaining extension of mortgages,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> resolving sewage problems,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> negotiating a settlement of a dispute with a paving contractor,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and arranging for rezoning from two acre to one acre and half acre lots.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-17\">As to the work actually performed, appellants testified that they arranged for an extension of a mortgage (held by the estate of one of the stockholders of <em>BHJK);</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>put Lingo in contact with appellee, who subsequently sold the property to Kiplinger Editors, Inc., with Lingo acting as agent and broker;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> held a number of conferences with Battistone and prospective purchasers of the property, with whom they discussed financing possibilities;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and took a number of prospective purchasers to view the property.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Clammer and Flues testified that they were asked by Battistone to comment on the proposed contract with Kiplinger and that they had received a copy of the contract from Battistone.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Battistone denied (or could not recall) this incident.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Flues testified further that he was informed by Dr. Clarence Jarboe, president of BHJK, that \u201cthey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>would not sign any contracts\u201d without appellants\u2019 approval.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Appellants admitted that they prepared no written documents or instruments and performed no actual services in connection with rezoning and sewage problems,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> although counsel in oral argument contended that appellants had studied these problems even though they had not yet contacted any officials. Flues testified that before finding a buyer these services would be premature<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Flues\u2019 time sheet was produced, showing the time he devoted to conferences, telephone calls, and inspection of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Lingo collected a commission of $50,-000 on the sale of the property. It was recognized by all parties prior to the consummation of the sale that appellants claimed compensation for their services, and Lingo executed an agreement to indemnify the seller and purchaser from all claims for commissions and fees made \u201cby Messrs. Clammer and Flues, or any person or persons claiming under or through them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">It is undisputed, as appellee argues, that the named plaintiffs were not admitted to practice law in Maryland. It does appear, however, from Clammer\u2019s deposition that \u201can associate\u201d of the firm was admitted to practice in Maryland, and it is recited in the brief in the district court that the \u201ccustomary listing of plaintiffs shows that they had associated with them for representation in Maryland matters, Daniel H. Crowley, who is licensed to practice law in Maryland.\u201d Crowley participated in this litigation as an attorney for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">It is clear from an examination of all of the depositions in their entirety that there were genuine issues of material facts as to the representation of appellee by appellants, the nature of the agreement between them, and the services actually performed by appellants.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It is obvious from appellants\u2019 own testimony, however, that the strictly legal services to be performed under the \u201cretainer\u201d were limited in scope, and those actually performed were meager and would not in themselves justify a substantial recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">Accepting appellants\u2019 own testimony, it is apparent that their primary function under their \u201cretainer\u201d was to find a purchaser for the property \u2014 the function of a real estate broker, and that any legal services were somewhat incidental. Whether appellants will be able to show that they were the \u201cprocuring cause\u201d of the sale,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> as they contend, is yet to be determined, but, as noted <em>supra, </em>no surmisal as to the result of the trial is a sufficient basis for refusing a party his day in court. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the depositions to raise an issue of fact as to whether appellants were the procuring cause of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">Appellee contends that even though the factual issues and services performed should be resolved in appellants\u2019 favor, they are still precluded from maintaining this action for \u201cnon-legal\u201d services since they are not licensed real estate brokers in either the District of Columbia or State of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-14\"> Licensing of real estate brokers is required by D.C.Code Title 45, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\u00a7 1401, and licensing is a prerequisite for maintaining an action for services under \u00a7 1407. Section 1402, however, provides that these provisions \u201cshall not apply to * * * attorneys at law in the ordinary practice of their profession * * *\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Article 56, Section 212, Maryland Code, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">\u201c[\u00a7] Exceptions. \u2014 The terms \u2018real estate broker\u2019 and \u2018real estate salesman\u201d shall not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">\u201c6. Attorneys at law who are not regularly engaged in the real estate business and who do not hold themselves out by sign, advertisement or otherwise as offering to the general public the services authorized by this subtitle to be performed by real estate brokers; * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Appellee argues that Maryland law is controlling and that this exception is inapplicable because the three named plaintiffs are not licensed to practice law in the State of Maryland. Appellee relies on an opinion of the Attorney General of Maryland that the provisions of Section 212 apply only to attorneys licensed to practice in Maryland.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As noted <em>supra, </em>however, there is evidence that one of the associates of appellants\u2019 firm is licensed to practice in Maryland. Moreover, apparently all conferences among the parties were held in the District of Columbia, although the property was located in Maryland and appellants went there to show the property. We think the District of Columbia Law, the exception under \u00a7 1402, governs.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-16\">The resolution of the legal issues relative to the applicable law and appellants\u2019 claim for compensation for non-legal services under the exceptions in the real estate brokers\u2019 licensing statutes depends largely upon the findings of the court or jury on the factual issues. Accordingly we deem it premature to rule now upon these legal issues.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-17\">Whatever the ultimate merits of appellants\u2019 case, we conclude that the testimony in their depositions raised issues of material facts. Viewing the conflicting evidence in the light most favorable to appellants we cannot say that appellee is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"AQZ\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-5\">. It was alleged further that Lingo stated to plaintiffs that he was representing a syndicate of which he was a member which would be interested in acquiring. Falconhurst and that he would handle \u201cany necessary formalities of the transfer\u201d and arrange for his own compensation, and on the basis of these representations plaintiffs brought Lingo into contact with BI-IJK.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-6\">. Plaintiffs allege that they \u201cmade various efforts to interest individuals and syndicates in the purchase of Falconhurst, and considered with the officials of BHJK Corporation and others questions relating to the refinancing of the existing loans * * payment of road improvements, prospective sewer lines, and the possibility\u201d of rezoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b190-9\">.

We agree with appellee that in view of the depositions appellants may \u201cnot rest upon the mere allegations and denials\u201d of their pleadings to support their contention that there are genuine issues of fact. Rule 56(e) F.R.Civ.P. as amended in 1963. Here, however, the testimony of appellants in their depositions fully support the allegations of their complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b192-16\">.

Moreover, if the court or jury should find, as appellee contends, that BHJK dealt with appellants as prospective purchasers and did not retain them as attorneys, there would be no right of recovery.
