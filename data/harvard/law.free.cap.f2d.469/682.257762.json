Skepil, Jr., United States District Judge for the District of Oregon, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b763-18\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b763-19\">Appellant drove an automobile through the customs barrier at the port of entry at San Ysidro, California, and fled the scene when directed to proceed to the secondary inspection area. His abandoned automobile was later found to contain marijuana residues. He appeals from a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952, 960 and 963, of conspiracy and illegal importation of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">Of the numerous assignments of error, the only one that requires discussion concerns the latitude of the cross-examination of a character witness. The prosecutor asked a witness who had known appellant only eighteen months if he was \u201caware that\u201d appellant had been arrested in 1961 for armed robbery. The question was objected to as too remote, and prejudicial as to form.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">Although the procedures recommended in Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 484-485, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948), were not followed literally, the appellant\u2019s rights were protected by the district judge\u2019s inquiry of the prosecutor in chambers and by appropriate limiting instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
