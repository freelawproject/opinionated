The Board substantially adopted the findings of its trial examiner and found that respondent had violated sections 8(a)(1), (3) and (5) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">The respondent is a common carrier of interstate freight operating a number of terminals including one at Murray, Kentucky, the only installation involved in this proceeding. In February, 1970, several of respondent\u2019s employees began soliciting authorization cards for the Teamsters and Chauffeurs Local Union No. 236, affiliated with The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America. From the respondent\u2019s conduct toward its employees during the months of February, March and the first part of April, the Board found that the respondent violated section 8(a) (1) of the Act by threatening its employees with a loss of benefits because of their union activities, by creating the impression that the employees\u2019 union activities were under surveillance, and by interrogating employees about their union activities. The Board also found that the Company violated section 8(a) (3) of the Act by discriminatorily discharging employees Driver, Overcast, Windsor, Stone and Payne because of their union pursuits. Further, the Board found that section 8(a)(5) of the Act was violated by the respondent\u2019s refusal to recognize and bargain with the Union. [190 NLRB No. 108 (1970)].</p>\n<p id=\"b155-17\"> The only issue presented in this case is a factual one; whether each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>alleged violation is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e). The Supreme Court has defined \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Consolidated Edison Co. of New York v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938). \u201c[I]t must be enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury.\u201d NLRB v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., 306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 505, 83 L. Ed. 660 (1939). \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Commission, 383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 1026, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966); Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). In reviewing the credibility findings and the inferences drawn by the Board from the evidence, the test for a reviewing court is whether the conclusions are reasonable in light of the proven facts. Thus, this Court may not substitute its judgment on the question whether the inference drawn is the correct one or whether a different inference would be better supported, but is limited to the determination of reasonableness \u2014 not rightness. NLRB v. Nevada Consolidated Copper Corp., 316 U.S. 105, 106, 62 S.Ct. 960, 86 L.Ed. 1305 (1942); Radio Officers\u2019 Union v. NLRB, 347 U.S. 17, 48-50, 74 S.Ct. 323, 98 L.Ed. 455 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"> After reviewing the whole record we cannot say that the Board\u2019s findings, with one exception, are unreasonable, although we would have reached a contrary conclusion in each instance if the choice were ours. We find the Board\u2019s conclusion that section 8(a)(1) of the Act was violated by the two incidents of respondent\u2019s interrogation of employees Mott and Payne is not supported by substantial evidence. Interrogation of employees is not per se unlawful. NLRB v. Dale Industries, Inc., 355 F.2d 851 (6th Cir. 1966). To be unlawful, interrogation must be coercive and interfere with or restrain the employees and the burden of proof rests upon General Counsel to prove that the interrogation violated the Act. Hughes &amp; Hatcher, Inc. v. NLRB, 393 F.2d 557 (6th Cir. 1968). This is not shown in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is granted except as to the finding of illegal interrogation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
