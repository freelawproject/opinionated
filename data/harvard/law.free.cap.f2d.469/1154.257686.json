The district court denied the writ. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-22\">Petitioner contends that the new search restrictions announced on June 23, 1969 in Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685, should be applied to this ease since on that date his conviction was still on direct appeal in the state courts of Florida.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Court in Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971), decided that this new rule should not be applied retroactively to searches occurring prior to June 23, 1969. As this latter decision makes clear, it is the date of the <em>search, </em>not the date of the completion of direct appeal, which governs the applicability of <em>Chimel. See also </em>Lyon v. United States, 416 F.2d 91 (5th Cir. 1969), cert. denied 396 U.S. 1023, 90 S.Ct. 597, 24 L.Ed.2d 516 (1970). Since Scarpati\u2019s search occurred prior to <em>Chimel, </em>it does not affect his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-23\">The district court held that Scarpati\u2019s search was constitutional under the principles of United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653 (1950) and Harris v. United States, 331 U.S. 145, 67 S.Ct. 1098, 91 L.Ed. 1399 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>(1947). We find no error in this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-5\">The denial of the writ of habeas corpus is</p>\n<p id=\"AZf\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1234-16\">. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, Third District of Florida, on June 17, 1969, Scarpati v. State, 224 So.2d 335 (Fla.App.1969), rehearing denied July 19, 1969. The Florida Supreme Court denied certiorari November 10, 1969.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
