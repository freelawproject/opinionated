The Board\u2019s initial decision is reported at 171 N.L.R.B. 1580 (1968). In the subsequent enforcement proceeding before this court, NLRB v. Falls Dodge, Inc., 431 F.2d 33 (6th Cir. 1970), this court found substantial evidence on the whole record to support enforcement of the Board\u2019s order requiring the automobile agency to cease and desist from unfair labor practices, to rehire discharged union committeeman, and to bargain with the union involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-16\">In that same opinion, however, the court noted that the Board had made no finding as to whether a strike of salesmen had been legal or illegal under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(1)(B) (1970). The court thereupon remanded the ease to the Board for specific findings of fact and Board decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-17\">The additional findings of fact have now been made after subsequent proceedings. The Board\u2019s second supplemental decision and order is reported at 196 N.L.R.B. 95 (1972). On review of the record in this second enforcement proceeding, we find ample evidence in the supplemented record to support the conclusion that the March 1967 strike was a legal, unfair labor practice strike, and not an attempt to coerce the company to select the Automobile Dealers Association as its bargaining representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-18\">Enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
