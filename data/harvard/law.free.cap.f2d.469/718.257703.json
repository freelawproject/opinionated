App. \u00a7 462(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-21\">Maciel registered with his local board in Reno, Nevada, in 1967, and the board classified him I-A in December, 1968. The Armed Forces Entrance Examining Station (AFEES) examined Maciel on April 8, 1969, and gave him special hearing tests in September, 1969. AFEES found Maciel physically fit for induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-22\">On October 10, 1969, Maciel\u2019s physician sent President Nixon two letters saying that Maciel had hearing problems and was under medication. The physician recommended that Maciel be excused from the draft because loud noises might deafen him. These letters were forwarded to the State Director of Ne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>vada and, on October 30, 1969, to the local board. The State Director wrote the physician and the local board that Maciel\u2019s claims had already been reviewed and, in any event, AFEES would reexamine Maciel if the board decided to induct him.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">In November, 1969, Maciel applied for a conscientious objector (I-O) deferment. After a personal interview, the board voted to retain him in class I-A. The board notified Maciel of his right to appeal this decision, but he chose not to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">In January, 1970, Maciel became interested in the Holy Order of Mans (the Order), which is a religious organization incorporated in California in 1968 as a non-profit, religious corporation. On February 16, 1970, Maciel took the Order\u2019s \u201cfirst vows\u201d, which included a vow of total obedience to the superiors of the Order. Maciel asserts that he did not appeal the board\u2019s decision on his I-O claim because his superiors told him not to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">On March 21, 1970, the board mailed Maciel an order to report for induction on April 20. On April 21, Maciel took another AFEES physical, but his induction was postponed while AFEES processed a moral waiver because of Maciel\u2019s criminal record. On June 4, AFEES found Maciel morally and physically qualified for induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">. The board rescheduled Maciel\u2019s induction for July 21, 1970. On July 13, Maciel requested a ministerial (IY-D) deferment because he was preparing to become a priest in the Order. The board postponed Maciel\u2019s induction until the August call to investigate his claim. Later, the State Director extended the postponement to the September call.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">On August 13, 1970, the State Director sent the local board a letter in which he expressed his opinion that members of the Order could not receive IV-D deferments, but he directed the board to make the final decision itself. After a courtesy interview on August 25, 1970, the board refused to reopen Maciel\u2019s case and ordered him to report for induction on September 22, 1970. On September 22, the board granted Maciel\u2019s request for a transfer of induction from Reno, Nevada, to San Francisco, California. On October 26, 1970, the local board in San Francisco ordered Maciel to report for induction on November 18. Maciel took lifetime vows and became a full Brother in the Order on November 1, 1970. He reported to the Armed Forces Induction Center on November 18, but he refused to submit to induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">First, Maciel contends that his I-A classification was wrong because neither the board nor AFEES properly evaluated his hearing problems. He asserts that no one reviewed the letters of October 10, 1969, from his physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">Before the board received the letters, the government gave Maciel a pre-induction physical and special audiometric tests. When Maciel took these tests, he had already presented one letter from the same physician saying that Maciel had imperfect hearing, that he suffered from tinnitus, and that loud noises would further impair his hearing. AFEES considered this letter before it found Maciel physically fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">The October 10 letters added little, if any, new information about appellant\u2019s hearing, and we do not agree that either AFEES or the board did not consider these letters. In addition to the presumption that everything raised by Maciel was considered, Skinner v. United States, 215 F.2d 767 (9th Cir. 1954), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 981, 75 S.Ct. 572, 99 L.Ed. 763 (1955), the medical form for Maciel\u2019s April 21, 1970, physical contains a notation of his microcirculatory problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">Maciel next attacks the board\u2019s denial of his I-O claim. The trial court ruled that Maciel could not raise this defense because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by failing to appeal the board\u2019s decision. Lockhart v. United States, 420 F.2d 1143 (9th Cir. 1969) (en banc). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Maciel contends that the exhaustion rule should not apply to him because his religious convictions prevented him from appealing. He asserts that he \u201ctotally subjugated his will to that of the Order . . . and that his superiors told him not to appeal. The First Amendment does not protect Maciel\u2019s secular conduct even though he acted in response to the command of the Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Appellant relies on cases like Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963), and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972), but neither is in point. <em>Sherbert </em>held that a state could not take unemployment compensation away from a person because he refused to work on his Sabbath. <em>Yoder </em>held that a state could not compel Amish children to attend regular schools because this would destroy the Amish religion and way of life. Maciel\u2019s conduct has no such relation to religious values.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Maciel next contends that the board mishandled his IY-D claim. First, he alleges that the board erred when it refused to reopen his case to reconsider the claim. And, second, he alleges that the board in fact did reopen his case and that he was entitled to an administrative appeal on the basis of United States v. Miller, 455 F.2d 358 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">For either argument to succeed, Maciel must show that he was entitled to a reopening. Otherwise there was no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">Maciel\u2019s request for a IV-D deferment came after the board mailed him an order to report for induction. The board had no authority to reopen Maciel\u2019s case because there was no \u201cchange in [his] status resulting from circumstances over which [he] had no control.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2. Ehlert v. United States, 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (1971), held that a conscientious objector claim which arose after an induction order was not beyond a registrant\u2019s control. Maeiel\u2019s decision to become a minister was equally within his control.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">Maciel next contends that the trial court erred when it did not allow him to introduce evidence that his religious convictions prevented him from appealing the board\u2019s decision on his 1-0 claim. There is no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">Finally, Maciel challenges the jury instruction on the meaning of \u201cwillfulness.\u201d The trial court properly denied Maciel\u2019s request to include in the instruction a phrase like \u201cevil motive\u201d or \u201cbad faith.\u201d United States v. Couming, 445 F.2d 555 (1st Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 949, 92 S.Ct. 291, 30 L.Ed.2d 266 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">Affirmed..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
