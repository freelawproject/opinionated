App. \u00a7 462.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-17\">Juarez held a I-A-0 classification from' November, 1968 until October, 1969, when he was reclassified II-S after enrolling as a full time student in a two-year program at Solano Junior College, Vallejo, California. On March 9, 1970, while he was still attending school, Juarez was reclassified I-A-0 for failure to \u201csatisfactorily pursue a full-time course of instruction\u201d pursuant to 32 C.F.R. 1622.25.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-20\">Juarez did not request a personal appearance nor did he appeal his reclassification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He appeals his conviction on the ground that the board could not reclassify him until the end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>academic year, September, 1970, and argues that this is a legal question that does not require exhaustion of administrative remedies. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">In the fall of 1969, Juarez enrolled for 13.5 units of study,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but completed only 10.5 units. (Selective Service File (SSF) at 38-39) In the second semester he enrolled for 15 units (SSF at 39). On March 9, 1970, with this information supplied by the college, the board reopened Juarez\u2019s classification and reclassified him I-A-O.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (SSF at 11, 40)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">A II-S deferment is not discretionary. A registrant who qualifies for a student deferment may lose his deferred status only upon his failure to comply with one of the conditions specified in 32 C.F.R. 1622.25, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">\u201cWhether a student is \u2018satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction\u2019 is a question of fact.\u201d United States v. Olson, 447 F.2d 1362, 1364 (9 Cir. 1971). While the board \u201cnecessarily relies heavily upon information furnished by the school\u201d, it is not limited to information provided by the school and must make the ultimate determination whether the registrant meets the requirements of the Act and regulations. United States v. Jenson, 450 F.2d 1258, 1262 (9 Cir. 1971). On the other hand, \u201c(s)o long as a college certifies that a registrant is expected to graduate on time, and it appears reasonably probable that he can do so, he should be entitled to retain his II-S classification.\u201d Coleman v. Tolson, 435 F.2d 1062,1064 (4 Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-15\"> There is no requirement that a reclassification may be made only at the close of an academic year. In a proper case it may be made during the academic year.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There must of course be a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for the board\u2019s finding that a registrant is not \u201csatisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">It is unnecessary to determine whether the board had a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for its reclassification of Juarez, since we conclude that the conviction must be affirmed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under McGee v. United States, 402 U.S. 479, 91 S.Ct. 1565, 29 L.Ed.2d 47 (1971). As in McGee, Juarez\u2019s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies either by requesting a personal appearance or seeking an appeal served to \u201cjeopardize the interest in full administrative fact gathering and utilization of agency expertise * * *.\u201d 402 U.S. at 486, 91 S.Ct. at 1569.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-18\">Through a personal appearance or appeal Juarez would have had an opportunity to demonstrate that he was in fact \u201csatisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction\u201d and entitled to a continuing II-S deferment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>States v. Brooks, 415 F.2d 502, 506 (6 Cir. 1969). His failure to do so precludes judicial review. McGee v. United States, <em>supra-, </em>Lockhart v. United States, 420 F.2d 1143 (9 Cir. 1969) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-11\">. He was first ordered to report for induction on May 5, 1970, failed to report, and was reordered to report on August 19, 1970, when he again failed to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-12\">. This regulation provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-13\">\u201c(a) In Class II-S shall be placed any registrant who has requested such deferment and who is satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college, university, or similar institution of learning, such deferment to continue until such registrant completes the requirement for his baccalaureate degree, fails to pursue satisfactorily a full-time course of instruction, or attains the twenty-fourth anniversary of the date of his birth, whichever occurs first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-14\">\u201c(b) In determining eligibility for deferment in Class II-S, a student\u2019s \u2018academic year\u2019 shall include the 12-month period following the beginning of his course of study.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-15\">\u201c(c) A student shall be deemed to be \u2018satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction\u2019 when, during his academic year, he has earned, as a minimum, credits toward his degree which, when added to any credits earned during prior academic years, represent a proportion which the number of academic years completed bears to the normal number of years established by the school to obtain such degree. For example, a student pursuing a four-year course should have earned 25% of the credits required for his baccalaureate degree at the end of his first academic year, 50% at the end of his second academic year, and 75% at the end of his third academic year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-22\">\u201c(d) It shall be the registrant\u2019s duty to provide the local board each year with evidence that he is satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction at a college, university, or similar institution of learning.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b851-23\">. Advice of Right to Personal Appearance and Appeal (SSS Form 217) was mailed March 9, 1970, with the Notice of Reclassification. Juarez had taken an appeal from a prior classification in 1968.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b852-9\">. On September 30, 1969 the board received a certificate from Solano College reciting, <em>inter alia, that </em>Juarez was \u201csatisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction,\u201d which commenced September 10, 1969, and was expected to receive a degree in June, 1971 (SSF 38).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b852-10\">. This information was furnished by So-lano College in a letter received February 27, 1970. (SSF 39) The only other notations of communications from the college (aside from the initial certificate) were: a letter received April 7, 1970 stating that Juarez was carrying 9 units as of April 3 (SSF 41) ; and a certificate received July 1, 1970 reciting that Juarez had completed 10.5 units in the fall of 1969 and 3 units in the spring of 1970 for a total of 13.5 units. (SSF 45) That portion of the certificate reciting that the student was satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of study was not completed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b852-20\">.

Feldman, 437 F.2d 888, 889 (9 Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b852-21\">. In a number of cases midyear reclassification of II-S deferments have been recognized as proper where it appears impossible for the registrant to graduate on time. <em>/See </em>United States v. Olson, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Jenson, <em>supra; </em>Coleman v. Tolson, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b852-22\">. Appellant argues that as of March 9, 1970, the date Juarez was reclassified, he was deficient only 4.5 units and a sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>mer session was available to make up this deficiency. There is nothing in the Selective Service Pile to indicate that Juarez intended to attend a summer session or that one was available at Solano College. At the trial it was stipulated that a summer session was available. (Rep.Trans. at 43-44)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
