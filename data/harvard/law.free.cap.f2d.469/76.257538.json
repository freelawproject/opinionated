The testimony sought would have incriminated the codefendant beyond the charge to which he had pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">With respect to appellant\u2019s contention that he was denied the right to comment to the jury on his codefendant\u2019s failure to testify, there is no indication in the record that he requested such a right.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">It was not error to instruct the jury on aiding and abetting in the light of the evidence introduced. Wilke v. United States, 422 F.2d 1298 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-18\">It was not error to fail to instruct respecting statements of appellant\u2019s accomplice. There is no evidence that such statements were received in evidence. There was no request for such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-19\">We find no error in denial of appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-20\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
