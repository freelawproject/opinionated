We affirm the ruling below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-24\">The appellant has alleged that the attorney did not accord effective legal representation in several enumerated respects, as the result of which Nelson was convicted of a felony in a Texas state court. Nelson further alleges that the attorney was retained for him by his former employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-25\">The district court held that the complaint failed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, since a retained counsel is not acting under color of state law within the purview of the statute. We agree. United States ex rel. Gittlemacker v. Commonwealth of Pa., E.D. Pa.1968, 281 F.Supp. 175, affirmed 3rd Cir. 1969, 413 F.2d 84, cert. denied 396 U.S. 1046, 90 S.Ct. 696, 24 L.Ed.2d 691. Our statement in O\u2019Brien v. Colbath, 5th Cir. 1972, 465 F.2d 358, [1972] that \u201cin our opinion [\u00a7 1983] was never intended as a vehicle for prosecuting malpractice suits against court-appointed attorneys\u201d is all the more applicable to suits against one\u2019s former privately-retained counsel. The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1235-27\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
