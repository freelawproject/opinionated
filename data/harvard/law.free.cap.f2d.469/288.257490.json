The trial court held that the wife had no such claim and accordingly dismissed the action. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-21\">In her amended complaint, Katherine Anderson, hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff, initially alleged that \u201cthis action involves an injury arising under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act\u201d and went on to allege that her husband, one A. C. Anderson, an employee of the Burlington Northern, Inc., was negligently injured by one of Burlington\u2019s agents acting within the course and scope of his employment and that in connection therewith Burlington had paid A. C. Anderson, plaintiff\u2019s husband, for his injuries thus sustained but had refused to pay her anything. In her first count, plaintiff prayed for damages in the sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>of $50,000 for her loss of consortium and support from her husband. In a second count, plaintiff prayed for an additional $50,000 for nursing services rendered by her to her disabled husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In response to the amended complaint, Burlington filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, alleging that the amended complaint showed on its face that plaintiff was attempting to recover damages arising from an incident which was covered by the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, \u00a7 1 et seq., 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51 et seq. In this regard, it is Burlington\u2019s basic position that the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act provides the exclusive remedy for the injured employee and accordingly precludes the maintenance of an action of the type here asserted by plaintiff. It was on this state of the record that the trial court sustained Burlington\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In our view, New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad Company v. Tonsellito, 244 U.S. 360, 37 S.Ct. 620, 61 L.Ed. 1194 (1917), is dispositive of the present controversy. There, a seventeen-year-old infant, relying upon the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, recovered judgment for personal injuries suffered while employed by a railroad engaged in interstate commerce. Thereafter, the infant\u2019s father also recovered damages against the railroad for himself on account of expenses incurred by him for medical attention to his son and for loss of the latter\u2019s services. In reversing, the Supreme Court made the following pertinent comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\u201cThe court of errors and appeals ruled, and it is now maintained, that the right of action asserted by the father existed at common law and was not taken away by the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act. But the contrary view, we think, is clearly settled by our recent opinions in New York C. R. Co. v. Winfield, 244 U.S. 147, 61 L.Ed. [1045], 37 Sup.Ct.Rep. 556 [1917], and Erie Railroad Co. v. Win-field, 244 U.S. 170, 61 L.Ed. [1057] 37 Sup.Ct.Rep. 556, (decided May 21, 1917). There we held the act \u2018is comprehensive and also exclusive\u2019 in respect of a railroad\u2019s liability for injuries suffered by its employees while engaging in interstate commerce. \u2018It establishes a rule or regulation which is intended to operate uniformly in all the states as respects interstate commerce, and in that field it is both paramount and exclusive.\u2019 Congress having declared when, how far, and to whom carriers shall be liable on account of accidents in the specified class, such liability can neither be extended nor abridged by common or statutory laws of the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The purport of New York Central Railroad Company v. Winfield, <em>supra, </em>and Erie Railroad Company v. Winfield, <em>supra, </em>both of which are cited in, and form the basis for, <em>Tonsellito, </em>is that the liability of an interstate railroad carrier to its employees for personal injuries sustained while engaged in interstate commerce is regulated inclusively and exclusively by the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act and that because Congress fully covered the subject, no room exists for state regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\"><em>See also, </em>Jess v. Great Northern Railway Company, 401 F.2d 535 (9th Cir. 1968), where a wife\u2019s claim for loss of consortium resulting from injuries sustained by her husband within the scope of Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act was rejected. In so holding, it was declared that the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act not only provides the exclusive remedy for recovery by the injured employee, but \u201calso governs the recovery by others for damages resulting from such injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">To the same general effect, <em>see </em>Smither and Company, Inc. v. Coles, 100 U.S. App.D.C. 68, 242 F.2d 220 (1957), cert. denied, 354 U.S. 914, 77 S.Ct. 1299, 1 L. Ed.2d 1129 (1957), which involved a claim for loss of consortium and the District of Columbia\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, which adopts as the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>pensation law for the District of Columbia the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act, 44 Stat. 1424 (1927), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq.; <em>see also </em>Underwood v. United States, 207 F.2d 862 (10th Cir. 1953), which involved a claim for loss of consortium and the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, \u00a7 1 et seq., 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 751 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">In dismissing the action, the trial court \u201cassumed\u201d a third count, though none, as such, was pleaded, based on diversity jurisdiction and the Wyoming law regarding the right of a wife to maintain an action for the loss of her husband\u2019s consortium. In this connection, the trial court, relying on Bates v. Donnafield, 481 P.2d 347 (Wyo.1971), held that in Wyoming the wife had no cause of action for loss of consortium, though the husband did, and on this basis dismissed the \u201cthird\u201d count. It is urged that such was error for the reason that denying a wife the right to sue for loss of consortium, while permitting the husband to maintain such an action, would deny the wife\u2019s right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. In support of the foregoing proposition, counsel cites such cases as Owen v. Illinois Baking Corporation, 260 F. Supp. 820 (W.D.Mich.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In our view, we need not here consider whether such a rule as announced by the Wyoming Supreme Court in Bates v. Donnafield, <em>supra, </em>runs afoul of Fourteenth Amendment rights. Disposition of this particular contention is again governed by <em>Tonsellito. </em>As set forth above, it was there stated that by the enactment of Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, Congress declared the extent of liability on the part of an interstate carrier for injuries to its employees and that \u201csuch liability can neither be extended nor abridged by common or statutory laws of the state.\u201d So, assuming arguendo that under Wyoming law plaintiff somehow does have a cause of action for loss of consortium, such would not give her a claim for loss of consortium arising out of an accident covered by Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act. In this area the Federal law is paramount and exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
