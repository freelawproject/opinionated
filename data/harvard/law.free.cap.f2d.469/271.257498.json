Powell, United States District Judge, Eastern District of Washington, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>EUGENE A. WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">In a trial to the court without a jury, appellant Sosa was convicted of illegal importation of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952, 960 and 963. Prior to trial, Sosa moved to suppress evidence obtained in a body cavity search. Following an evidentiary hearing, the motion was denied. Sosa then waived a jury trial and submitted the case on the transcript of the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">As he crossed the border on foot, appellant appeared to customs officers to be under the influence of narcotics.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A skin search was conducted and it revealed a greasy substance on Sosa\u2019s buttocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">A physician was then summoned. He observed the needle marks on Sosa\u2019s arms, the lethargic attitude, and the constriction of the eyes. He concluded that appellant was under the influence of drugs and that a body cavity search should be made. His rectal probe revealed \u201cat least one packet.\u201d When Sosa was advised to cooperate, he expelled three packets of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-19\">To justify a skin search, sometimes called a strip search, a real suspicion, directed specifically to the person being searched, is required. Such \u201creal suspicion\u201d has been defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-20\">\u201c . . . subjective suspicion supported by objective, articulable facts that would reasonably lead an experienced, prudent customs official to suspect that a particular person seeking to cross our border is concealing something on his body for the purpose of transporting it into the United States contrary to law.\u201d United States v. Guadalupe-Garza, 421 F.2d 876, 879 (9th Cir. 1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-22\">Clearly, there was such real suspicion here, considering all the factors listed in the footnote.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-23\"> A body cavity search, however, requires more. There must be a \u201cclear indication or plain suggestion\u201d that contraband may be located in a body cavity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Henderson v. United States, 390 F.2d 805 (9th Cir. 1967). Rivas v. United States, 368 F.2d 703 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. denied 386 U.S. 945, 87 S.Ct. 980, 17 L.Ed.2d 875 (1967). Appellant\u2019s contention that a warrant is required for a body cavity search has been considered and rejected by this circuit. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Castle, 409 F.2d 1347 (1969), cert. denied 396 U.S. 975, 90 S.Ct. 443, 24 L.Ed.2d 443 (1969), rehearing denied 396 U.S. 1063, 90 S.Ct. 760, 24 L.Ed.2d 757 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">We have said that nervousness, pinpointed eyes, fresh needle marks on the arms, possession of three rolled cotton balls of a kind frequently employed by narcotic users, plus the sight of a foreign material in the suspect\u2019s rectum constituted \u201cclear indication or plain suggestion.\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Here, there were no cotton balls, but appellant admitted that he was an addict; no foreign material was observed, but a greasy substance was. We see no distinction between this case and <em>Summerfield.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Appellant also contends that a visual search of the anal region cannot be conducted without cause sufficient to justify a body cavity search. However, we have held that inspection of the surface of the body in the anal area is permissible in a skin search. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Shields, 453 F.2d 1235 (9th Cir.), cert. denied 406 U.S. 910, 92 S.Ct. 1615, 31 L.Ed.2d 821 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Sosa\u2019s reliance on Huguez v. United States, 406 F.2d 366 (9th Cir. 1968) is misplaced. There, we held improper a brutal and painful rectal probe because the information obtained from an earlier strip search was not passed on to the officers who conducted the body cavity search. Here, all facts were passed along.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">Appellant\u2019s claim of a Fifth Amendment violation is without merit. He argues that his statement in the customs office, given without prior warning, should have been suppressed. Our rule in border cases is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">\u201c . . . [T]he warning requirement in <em>Miranda, </em>need not be given to one who is entering the United States unless and until the questioning agents have probable cause to believe that the person questioned has committed an offense, or the person questioned has been arrested, whether with or without probable cause. It is at this point, in border cases, that the investigation has \u2018focused\u2019 in the <em>Mirranda </em>sense.\u201d Chavez-Martinez v. United States, 407 F.2d 535, 539 (9th Cir. 1969), cert. denied 396 U.S. 858, 90 S.Ct. 124, 24 L.Ed.2d 109 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a1e-dedup-0\">The inspector\u2019s questions of Sosa at the customs counter were routine inquiries of one returning to the United States and are clearly permissible under the <em>Chavez-Martinez </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Appellant\u2019s other contentions have been considered and are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AEq\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\">.
