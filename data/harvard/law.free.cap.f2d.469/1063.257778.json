Appellant Caccavaro was and is president and owner of International Fiberglass Company, Inc. (\u201cFiberglass\u201d) and of its successor corporation, the appellant International Boat Co., Inc. (\u201cBoat\u201d). In 1971, AMF sued Fiberglass for trademark infringement and unfair competition, its claim arising from Fiberglass\u2019 having made and sold, under the name \u201cFunfish\u201d, a sailboat which resembled the Sunfish.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">AMF\u2019s suit against Fiberglass was terminated by the entry of a final decree on December 23, 1971 to which all parties consented.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">On May 10, 1972, AMF filed a contempt petition against Caccavaro and Fiberglass, and, later (when it learned that Boat had succeeded Fiberglass) against Boat, charging violations of the consent decree. After hearing, the district court found the appellants to be in contempt. It ordered Fiberglass and Boat, jointly and severally, to pay a fine of $1,000, and Caccavaro to pay a fine of $500, to AMF, to recompense it for loss of goodwill and costs of the proceeding. Caccavaro and Boat, but not Fiberglass, have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-14\">We affirm. The record fully supports the district court\u2019s findings that appellants had engaged in conduct which violated the terms of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-15\">There was evidence of advertising and representations associating appellants\u2019 boat (named, since entry of the decree, a \u201cViking\u201d) with the Sunfish.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Viking was listed in a dealer\u2019s advertisement as a \u201cSunfish Class Sailboat\u201d. An ad, under the name of Boat, pictured a sailboat with the caption, \u201cOurs is a Fish too!\u201d Signs at the boat shows in New York and Boston read, \u201cWhat\u2019s the price of Fish? High Priced Fish $4.10 lb. Our Fish $2.87 lb.\u201d Cac-cavaro said at a boat show that the Viking and Sunfish were identical and had interchangeable sails, and that the Sunfish people \u201chave had a hard time finding the difference. . . . \u201d A dealer advertised, \u201cCompare the new Viking with other identical well known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>sailboards.\u201d There was evidence from which the district court could reasonably infer appellants\u2019 responsibility for dealers\u2019 .advertisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">The district court could conclude that such representations of identity and interchangeability of parts, and use of the words \u201cfish\u201d and \u201csunfish class\u201d, were intended and were likely to cause confusion and a dilution of the distinctive quality of the Sunfish trademark. They also violated express prohibitions in paragraphs (3) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">While \u201cfish\u201d is a generic term, its use here was not innocent as appellants contend. Having been forbidden to use \u201cFunfish\u201d, appellants can reasonably be found to have selected \u201cfish\u201d to convince buyers that the boat was still in essence a Sunfish at bargain prices. A party under injunction \u201cmust do more than see how close [it] can come with safety to that which [it was] enjoined from doing.\u201d Eskay Drugs, Inc. v. Smith, Kline &amp; French Laboratories, 188 F.2d 430, 432 (5th Cir. 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">That appellants were representing the Viking boat to be exactly like the Sunfish \u2014 in violation of paragraphs (3) and (4) of the decree \u2014 was further shown by Caccavaro\u2019s letter to dealers, on Boat\u2019s letterhead, representing that Boat \u201cbegan making the same boat\u201d as a sailboat called \u201cSunfish\u201d and that its price was \u201cmuch less\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-8\">The evidence also supports the district court\u2019s finding that by advertising bogus \u201cdiscounts\u201d the appellants violated provisions of the decree relating to pricing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-9\">The appellants may not-, of course, now attack the terms of the decree. United States ex rel. Shell Oil Co. v. Banco Corp., 430 F.2d 998, 1001 (8th Cir. 1970); Hopp Press, Inc. v. Joseph Freeman <em>&amp; </em>Co., 323 F.2d 636, 637 (2nd Cir. 1963); Kiwi Coders Corp. v. Arco Tool &amp; Die Works, 250 F.2d 562, 568 (7th Cir. 1957). <em>See alsv </em>Maggio v. Zeitz, 333 U.S. 56, 68, 68 S.Ct. 401, 92 L.Ed. 476 (1948). They were bound to obey until the court modified the decree. Their afterthoughts about its wording are particularly inappropriate where they had consented to the terms. <em>See </em>United States v. Armour &amp; Co., 402 U.S. 673, 681-682, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-11\">Since the district court\u2019s findings are plainly supported in the record, we prefer to express no opinion on the merits of appellee\u2019s rather refined argument that Boat\u2019s appeal is moot in the absence of Fiberglass as a co-party appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-12\">Affirmed. Double costs in favor of the appellee.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1144-8\">. The decree said, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-9\">IT IS ORDERED that defendant, its agents, officers, servants, employees and attorneys and all persons in active concert or participation with them or any of them be and they are hereby permanently enjoined and restrained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-10\">(1) from applying to or using in connection with the sale, advertisement or offering for sale of any boat or related product the notation FUNFISH or any other notation so similar to plaintiff\u2019s trademark SUNFISH as to be likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-11\">(2) from applying to or using in connection with the sale, advertisement or offering for sale of any boat or related product the notation FUNFISH or any other notation so similar to plaintiff\u2019s trademark SUNFISH as to be likely to cause dilution of the distinctive quality of said trademark;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-12\">(3) from making any representation, expressly or by implication that plaintiffs\u2019 price for its said boat is supported under the fair trade laws or that the list price of defendant\u2019s boat is anything other than the price at which defendant sells it or that defendant\u2019s boat is exactly like or of the same quality as plaintiff\u2019s, or any other similar representation, and from making any other false representation whatsoever with respect to plaintiff\u2019s or defendant\u2019s boat;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1144-18\">(4) from referring in any manner to plaintiff\u2019s trademark SUNFISH in any advertising, promoting or selling of defendant\u2019s boat, except to identify plaintiff\u2019s boat without in any way describing defendant\u2019s boat as being of a SUNFISH class or being constructed like a SUNFISH.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1144-19\">. In a Boston Sunday newspaper, Fiberglass was on two successive weeks listed as exhibiting the FUNFISH at Suffolk Downs. Appellants denied any connec- . tion with the advertisement, which would, of course, be an open and shut violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
