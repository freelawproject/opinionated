The only evidence offered at the trial was a certified and exemplified copy of appellant\u2019s Selective Service file.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-23\">Perdue registered with his local board on January 20, 1964. In his initial Classification Questionnaire (Form SSS 100) he did not indicate any conscientious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>objector claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was classified II-S until the summer of 1966, when he was classified I-A, although he continued to attend college until the spring of 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">On August 31, 1967 the local board mailed Perdue a \u201cStatement of Acceptability\u201d (D.D. Form 62) reciting that he had been found \u201cfully acceptable for induction into the armed forces.\u201d On the same date the board mailed a \u201cCurrent Information Questionnaire,\u201d (SSS Form 127) which Perdue completed and signed on September 5, 1967. On September 23, 1967, after enrolling in college for the fall term, he mailed the board SSS Form 104 requesting a student deferment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">On October 25, 1967, before the board had ruled on the request for a student deferment, Perdue wrote a letter to the local board which forms the primary basis for his conscientious objector claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The letter reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-7\">\u201cAfter studying, searching, and praying for the sake of peace, I have chosen the position of non-cooperation with the Selective Service System. Recognizing the full implication of the consequences of this position has been painful in light of the fact that I have taken this position out of a deep commitment to the Democratic and humane ideals for which America stands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-8\">\u201cI take this action in an attitude of truth as an affirmation of the brotherhood of all men and of service to my country, which means service to all men everywhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-9\">\u201cMethods of compulsory conscription include pressure, impersonalization, discrimination, and violence, all of which continue to lead men, as they have in the past, to organized murder in the name of \u2018service to one\u2019s country.\u2019 As long as the youth of this country continue to be \u2018channelled\u2019 and compulsed by American militarism, America will continue to wage unjust wars. I seek to build a new community in America based upon the simple freedom of life. Thus the values which I hold, and indeed those which are in our Declaration of Independence and Constitution, are incompatible with those practiced by the war machine in this country. I can no longer live in complicity with the system upon which the very existence of the military depends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-13\">\u201cThe reality of this demands a response with my total being. A person seeking to build a new way of life in America cannot submit with the context of his life to those forms of corruption which he is trying to eliminate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-14\">\u201cThe present war in Vietnam is a manifestation of the sickness of our society at home. The war in Vietnam, I believe, is illegal and morally unjustifiable. My response to it comes from my allegiance to God, the highest authority in my life and thus as the dictate of my conscience. At Nuremberg we affirmed the principle that a man must follow the dictates of his conscience when, standing before God and fellow man, the demands of his state conflict with those of his conscience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-15\">\u201cI will not let the government use me in pursuing it\u2019s unjust and immoral actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-16\">\u201cAs an affirmation of a new way of life in which men are free to act upon belief and discover the liberation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>moral commitment ... I prefer to resist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1278-4\">\u201cYours in Peace and Freedom,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayo-dedup-0\">The \u201cMinutes of Actions by Local Board * * * \u201d contain an entry on November 16, 1967, reading, \u201cReviewed &amp; not Reopened\u201d, and an entry on November 20, 1967, \u201cForm C-140 mailed.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There are no entries in the minutes between August 31, 1967, when DD Form 62 and SSS Form 127 were mailed, and the entry on November 16, 1967. It cannot accordingly be determined whether the October 25, 1967 letter was considered by the board since the only formal request for reopening and reclassification was the \u201cRequest for Undergraduate Student Deferment.\u201d This is immaterial unless the letter constituted a prima facie conscientious objector claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-6\">On November 24, 1967 an induction order was issued with a reporting date of December 7, 1967.\u00ae Perdue wrote the board on November 29,1967:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1278-7\">\u201cI received your notification of induction. Thank you. In the interest of communication and the possibility of justice, I wish to remind you that you have in my file, a letter, which you acknowledged and considered, stating my position regarding these matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1278-8\">\u201cConcisely and unequivocally stated again: firstly, I am bound by my conscience, and secondly, it is my patriotic duty, to this country in particular, under God, to resist and refuse compliance with the military system. I therefore inform you that I will not be present for induction on December 7, 1967.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1278-15\">On April 12, 1969 Perdue wrote the board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1278-17\">\u201c * * * While I do not recognize the legitimacy of a draft board, or Selective Service, in any society, I do recognize the need to communicate with people, however immorally conceived in such a body, who intend on considering certain actions with regards to my life or any other life. Therefore I think it necessary to let you know some of my present attitudes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1278-19\">\u201cFirstly, I consider all draft refusal cases, and in particular, mine, to have a relevance to all peoples of the world. That is to say, my induction refusal was a stand against the raping and pillaging of Vietnam by the U.S.A. and against U.S. Imperialism worldwide. Secondly, I do not intend to stand idly by and watch those who have joined me in RESISTING the draft, be unjustly sent to prison in the name of an idiotic Draft law, Draft board, or any of the inane patriotic rhetoric of nationalism and righteousness. I demand equal <em>unjust </em>treatment!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1278-20\">\u201cFinally, since I last communicated with you (Dec. 1967) my stand has come to mean much more than a simple moral stand on my conscience, against the draft and Vietnam. It is my present feeling that for the future well being of all mankind, ecologically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>politically, economically, socially, etc., America must radically change its posture and actions throughout the world.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-5\">\u201cYou and I must become Brothers together with all people. We must get together and plan a decent life with and for all people.\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">On October 6, 1969 Perdue wrote the board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-8\">\u201cI received today from your headquarters of death and oppression, the enclosed documents,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which I would burn a thousand times if it were not more effective politically to return them to you. I have no sense for their meaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-9\">\u201cI have changed addresses, married, had several occupations, and forgotten about a SS number. On top of that, I refused induction willfully on Dec. 7, 1967, almost two months after having taken the position of total non-cooperation with the Draft, U.S. Imperialism, and the oppressive nature of present U.S. foreign and domestic policies, and furthermore I consciously counsel all young men to not submit to the Selective <em>Service </em>\u2014 and you know I do. You know my position with your existence. It is therefore, almost beyond belief and certainly my understanding why you would bother to send me any of the \u2018papers\u2019 you did, when my Brothers in Resistance are in jail for the same thing. I have said before that I condemn your playing games with my life \u2014 and I demand equal \u2014 illegal and immoral and unjust treatment under the present fascist laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-11\"><em>\u201c </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-15\">\u201cPlease do contact me \u2014 with something besides your mindless form letters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-16\">\u201cIn fact, I beg you to reconsider your actions as individuals and as a branch of the U.S.A.\u2019s global imperialism with its use of violence. I would ask you to resign your positions as the only consciencable (sic) action available to anyone who takes part in killing and other forms of destructive violence.\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1279-17\">Finally, on December 2, 1969, in acknowledging receipt of another induction order,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Perdue wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1279-18\">\u201cYour communication I received with much surprise. I am keeping the actual induction notice for a souvenir. (I have another from Dec. 7, 1967 which I also have kept). My previous response has been well recorded with your organization; and since my response to my latest induction is going to be the same \u2014 except with more inner peace and strength on my part \u2014 I refer you to <em>all </em>my previous communications with your organization and the \u2018Justice Department.\u2019 That should be enough evidence for you to determine that you can not restrict my human rights with your \u2018Selective Service Official Notifications.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1279-19\">Appellant contends that the letter of October 25, 1967 \u201cpresents a prima facie case for conscientious objector status\u201d and that the subsequent letters indicate more clearly Perdue\u2019s opposition to all war. The Government argues that the letters, taken together, simply \u201cevidence a conscious choice of resistance to the draft.\u201d The district court was \u201cunable to find in the registrant\u2019s letters to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>board expressing his dissatisfaction on political and moral grounds to the war and the Selective Service System anything that could be fairly construed as a prima facie conscientious objector claim.\u201d (Reporter\u2019s Transcript at 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">It is clear that Perdue did not at any time either execute or request Form-150; nor did he request reclassification as a conscientious objector or in express terms advise his local board that he claimed to be a conscientious objector. While Form 150 is not a precondition to consideration of a conscientious objector claim and under Local Board Memorandum No. 41<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a local board must \u201cconsider for possible [conscientious objector] exemption all those who file some written statement claiming that status\u201d, this \u201cdoes not change the general rule * * * that the burden is on the registrant to apprise the local board of <em>facts </em>which warrant a classification other than I-A.\u201d (emphasis in original) United States v. Enslow, 426 F.2d 544, 546 (9 Cir. 1970). Perdue had the burden of showing that he was entitled to classification as a conscientious objector. United States v. Weaver, 423 F.2d 1126, 1127 (9 Cir. 1970); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1621.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-10\">\u201cIt is well established that when the local board is presented with nonfrivolous facts, which, if true, would constitute a prima facie claim for exemption or deferment, the board must reopen and reconsider the registrant\u2019s classification. Mulloy v. United States, 398 U.S. 410, 90 S.Ct. 1766, 26 L.Ed.2d 362 (1970). <em>See also </em>32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In order to qualify for conscientious objector status, the facts presented must clearly establish that the registrant has brought himself within the three basic tests recognized by the Supreme Court in recent decisions. First, he must show that he is conscientiously opposed to war in any form, not selectively to some wars.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> * * * Second, he must show that his opposition is grounded upon religious training and belief, as construed by the Court in recent decisions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> * * * Third, and finally, he must show evidence of sincerity.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> United States v. McKinley, 447 F.2d 962, 963 (9 Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-11\">It is clear that the phrase, \u201cconscientiously opposed to participation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>war in any form\u201d means \u201cthat conscientious scruples relating to war and military service must amount to conscientious opposition to participating personally in any war and all war.\u201d Gillette v. United States, <em>supra, </em>401 U.S. at 443, 91 S.Ct. at 832. Cognizant of the hard choice where principle of conscience and religious duty conflict with the secular state, Congress recognized a \u201cclaim of conscience running against war as such.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446, 91 S.Ct. at 834. It does not permit a registrant to choose between \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cunjust\u201d wars. \u201c* * Congress intended to exempt persons who oppose participating in all war \u2014 \u2018participation in war in any form\u2019 \u2014and * * * persons who object solely to participation in a particular war are not within the purview of the exempting section, even though the latter objection may have such roots in a claimant\u2019s conscience and personality that it is \u2018religious\u2019 in character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447, 91 S.Ct. at 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">Counsel have not cited, nor have we found, any case precisely in point factually. A somewhat comparable situation was considered by the First Circuit in United States v. Stoppelman, 406 F.2d 127 (1969), where the registrant turned in his Notice of Classification and Registration Certificate. At the same time he delivered a letter to the clerk of the board declaring that \u201cmy first allegiance is to my human citizenship,\u201d referring to the Vietnam war as \u201ccriminal\u201d and to the Selective Service System as providing the \u201cresources for this action and other suppressions of self-determination in the world,\u201d and stating that he would not cooperate with the Selective Service Board or accept any classification or deferment \u201cwhich implies my consent to its right to function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129. The letter was never brought to the attention of the local board. While the court felt that the clerk might well have done so, it concluded that under the circumstances this was not required since the letter was \u201call too clear that no reopening of classification was sought but that complete rejection of the system was the only course consistent with appellant\u2019s stated views. This was corroborated in the most convincing way by appellant\u2019s act of turning in his Registration Certificate and \u25a0 Notice of Classification.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-9\">On the other hand, the following information in a letter to a local draft board was held to create a duty in the board to furnish the registrant with a Form 150:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1281-10\">\u201cIt is with deep sorrow that I must return my draft card to my local board in protest over the war in Vietnam. I hope that you understand that this act of civil disobedience is because of my moral convictions which say to me that man should not be forced to kill another human being.\u201d United States v. Moyer, 307 F.Supp. 613, 614 (S.D.N.Y.1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1281-11\">The court found that the letter was, \u201cin effect, a request for a Form 150,\u201d and that the local board\u2019s failure to consider it as such, and failure to .provide a Form 150, constituted a \u201cblatant violation of the constitutional guarantee of procedural due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-12\">Between October 25, 1967 and December 2, 1969 Perdue wrote five letters to his local draft board. In no one of them did he state in express terms that he claimed exemption as a conscientious objector or that he was \u201cconscientiously opposed to war in any form.\u201d Nor did he at any time expressly request reclassification as a conscientious objector, although he had requested a student deferment in September, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-13\"> A registrant \u201chas the burden of seeking reclassification.\u201d Palmer v.United States, 401 F.2d 226 (9 Cir. 1968). Ordinarily where the registrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>fails to state that he claims conscientious objector status or to ask for Form 150, there is no obligation on the part of the board to reopen or send the form,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> although there may be a duty to reopen and send Form 150 when it is clear that the registrant has otherwise made a pri-ma facie case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">Perdue began his initial letter of October 25, 1967 with the statement that he had \u201cchosen the position of non-cooperation with the Selective Service System.\u201d In this and subsequent letters he made it clear that he was \u201cresisting the draft\u201d and opposed the Vietnam war and other \u201cunjust wars\u201d waged by the United States. His letter of April 29, 1967, after stating that his \u201cinduction refusal was a stand against the raping and pillaging of Vietnam by the U.S.A. and against U.S. Imperialism world wide\u201d, demands \u201cequal unjust treatment\u201d with others who joined him in \u201cresisting the draft\u201d and who were \u201cunjustly sent to prison in the name of an idiotic Draft law.\u201d In his letter of October 6, 1969 returning various notices from the draft board, he stated that he had \u201crefused induction on December 7, 1967 almost two months after having taken the position of total non-cooperation with the draft, U.S. Imperialism, and the oppressive nature of present United States foreign and domestic policies \u201cand that he \u2018consciously counsel(s)\u2019 all young men to not submit to the Selective Service.\u201d These letters clarify Perdue\u2019s purpose in writing the letter of October 25, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">From a careful review of appellant\u2019s Selective Service file, and particularly all of the letters he wrote his draft board, we conclude that the district court was correct in holding that he failed to sustain his burden of establishing a prima facie conscientious objector claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-14\"> Appellant next argues that his letter of October 6, 1969 (quoted <em>supra) </em>constitutes an appeal under 32 C.F.R. 1626.11(a).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We recognize that \u201c(Registrants are not to be treated as though they were engaged in formal litigation assisted by counsel,\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and that a letter may be treated as an appeal where the \u201conly possible message (a registrant) could have meant to convey was that he was dissatisfied with the board\u2019s order rejecting\u201d his claim for reclassification and \u201cthat he wished to have it reviewed.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The letter of October 6, 1969 does not, however, manifest a desire to appeal the classification but rather conveys a \u201cmessage\u201d of resistance to the draft. As the district court found, \u201cit manifests, as do all the defendant\u2019s communications with the board, a posture of complete non-cooperation.\u201d (Rep.Trans, at 5) Even under the most liberal reading, it may not be construed as an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-15\">Perdue contends that his induction order of March 24, 1970 was the result of a declaration of delinquency and so invalid. Appellant recognizes that the delinquency was removed prior to the induction notice, but argues that its presence prevented consideration of Perdue's deferment based on two claims pending before the board \u2014 -his conscientious objector claim, already discussed, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>medical claim concerning a \u201clow back pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-4\">The only reference to \u201clow back pain\u201d is a physician\u2019s notation on a \u201cReport of Medical History\u201d dated August 9, 1967 reading \u201clow back pain \u2014 mild.\u201d (SSF 44) The \u201cReport of Medical Examination\u201d of the same date found Perdue \u201cacceptable\u201d. There is no reference to \u201clow back pain\u201d or any other medical claim in any of Perdue\u2019s communications with the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">It is clear, as appellant argues, that a registrant entitled to exemption or deferment may not be deprived of them by being declared delinquent.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It is equally clear, however, that a person not entitled to an exemption or deferment is not \u201cdeprived\u201d of them by a declaration of delinquency.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Perdue had presented no prima facie conscientious objector claim and no medical basis for deferment;</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">Moreover, the board reviewed Per-due\u2019s file on September 18, 1969, removed the declaration of delinquency, retained him in I-A and declared a new delinquency. The second delinquency was removed on February 5, 1970. On March 6, 1970, after allowing Perdue\u2019s appeal time to run, the board ordered his induction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-11\">Finally, Perdue contends that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he did not report for induction on March 24, 1970, arguing that the entry on the minutes of the board, \u201cFailed to Report for Induction\u201d (SSF 10) is \u201cunreliable and not sufficient evidence to support a conviction for failure to <em>report </em>for induction.\u201d (emphasis in original, Appellant\u2019s Br. at 27)</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-12\">This contention is without merit. Perdue\u2019s Selective Service file was properly admitted. It contains an entry showing that the induction order (SSS Form 252) was mailed to Perdue and that he failed to report for induction. (SSF 10, 112) The order was sent to the address given by Perdue in his letter of October 6, 1969. He had received other communications at that address. There was a rebuttable presumption that he received the order.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> There was no evidence that he had not received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-13\">Moreover, Perdue did not raise this issue at the trial and cannot properly raise it for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-10\">\u201c(a) It is the local board\u2019s responsibility to decide, subject to appeal, the classification in which each registrant shall be placed. Each registrant will be considered as available for military service until his eligibility for deferment or exemption from military service is clearly established to the satisfaction of the local board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1276-24\">.

Following an anti-draft demonstration on October 16, 1967 Purdue had delivered his original Registration Certificate to the office of the United States Attorney in San Francisco, but this fact was not known by his local board until March 6, 1968 when the card was returned to the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1278-9\">.

The clerk in fact (presumably through inadvertence, as the Government claims) mailed Form 0-140 L notifying Perdue that reopening or reclassification of his case was not warranted because the board \u201cdid not specifically find that there had been a change in circumstances over which (he) had no control.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1278-12\">. On August 14, 1969 Selective Service recognized that Perdue was not delinquent for failure to report on December 7, 1967 since he was pursuing a full time undergraduate course when this induction order was issued.

The parties rely upon this and three subsequent letters as a clarification of Per-due\u2019s belief and intent in writing the letter of October 25, 1967.

Each was returned with \u201cResist the Draft\u201d written over the face of the document. (Selective Service File (SSF) at 95-102)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1279-20\">. Perdue was ordered to report on December 8, 1969. On February 5, 1970 his delinquency for failure to report was \u201cremoved\u201d and Perdue so notified on February 6, 1970. He was mailed a third induction order on March 6, 1970 with a reporting date of March 24, 1970.
