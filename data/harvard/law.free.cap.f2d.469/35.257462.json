The fidelity bond, issued by the Insurer in 1968, obligated it to indemnify the Bank up to the sum of $5,000,000 against</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">\u201cAny loss through any dishonest, fraudulent or criminal act of any of the Employees, committed anywhere and whether committed alone or in collusion with others, including loss of Property through any such act of any of the Employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">In a trial before Judge Pollack the jury awarded the Bank damages in the sum of $2,045,932, to which prejudgment interest in the sum of $171,205 was added. The Insurer appeals from the judgment in the total amount of $2,217,137, entered on December 27, 1971, and from the district court\u2019s denial of its post-trial motion, claiming that errors on the part of the trial judge, principally in his evidentiary rulings, entitle it to a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Bank, reveals that from mid-1969 to April 1970 the Manager of the Securities Department of the Bank\u2019s branch in Chiasso, Switzerland, Louis Gerard Salerian, fraudulently used funds of the Bank and of its customers to engage in a series of unauthorized securities transactions with a view to keeping any profits for himself. Unfortunately for him and for the Bank and its customers his talents apparently did not lie in securities investment, for he selected for these fraudulent transactions a series of stocks which declined sharply (e. g., I.O.S. Management, Ltd. and Four Seasons Nursing Homes), resulting in a loss of over $2,000,000 of the Bank\u2019s funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Perpetration of such a colossal fraud by Salerian was possible because Swiss banks not only offer their customers the usual services performed by banks in this country but are also permitted to act as stockbrokers. As the Manager of the Securities Department of the Bank\u2019s Chiasso branch, Salerian was authorized to execute customers\u2019 orders by buying and selling securities through other banks and brokerage firms, to carry out arbitrage transactions and, with the branch Manager\u2019s prior approval, to trade for the branch\u2019s own account. Without any authority from the management or any knowledge on its part, however, he made hundreds of purchases of securities, using the Bank\u2019s funds. Although the Bank maintained a typically detailed record-keeping system for authorized securities transactions, these purchases were either not registered on the Bank\u2019s records at all or they were falsely entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">When the market value of some of the securities dropped sharply Salerian, afraid that the decline would continue, sold many of the securities at heavy losses. In order to conceal his fraud and the resulting losses, he made hundreds of false and irregular entries in various customers\u2019 accounts. In many instances he entered unauthorized transactions in customers\u2019 accounts long after they had taken place, even though authorized purchases and sales would have been recorded within a few.days. The devices used by Salerian to mask his fraudulent activities and resulting losses were many and varied. They included the recording of fictitious transactions on the Bank\u2019s records, the recording of real transactions at fictitious prices, the allocation of transactions to various customers\u2019 accounts long after the event at prices different from the actual transaction prices, the transmittal to customers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>of false valuations of their securities portfolios, and the making of fictitious entries in the Bank\u2019s internal records of its accounts with other banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In the fall of 1969 Giorgio Campono-vo, the Assistant Manager of the Bank\u2019s Chiasso branch, who was Salerian\u2019s immediate supervisor, discovered in the Bank\u2019s internal records some of Saleri-an\u2019s fictitious entries with respect to transactions in I.O.S. When he called the discrepancies to Salerian\u2019s attention, the latter confided that he had lost some $200,000 as a result of his transactions but assured Camponovo that the loss would be absorbed over the next few months by customers who had benefited in the past from similar operations. Instead of reporting Salerian\u2019s dishonesty to Albert Benezra, then the Manager of the Chiasso branch, Camponovo remained silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Salerian\u2019s fraud, and Camponovo\u2019s complicity in it, were finally discovered by the Bank\u2019s management in April 1970. In the course of a sharp stock market drop in the first quarter of 1970, in which I.O.S. Management shares were hard hit, the Bank\u2019s management, located at the head office in Geneva, investigated a rumor that its Chiasso branch owned a large block of I.O.S. stock. Upon checking Chiasso customers\u2019 files the new Manager of the Chiasso branch, Albert Benezra, discovered suspicious entries. He then confronted Salerian and Camponovo, both of whom confessed in a series of statements given between April 20 and 24, 1970. Although Saleri-an first stated that the current loss was only $30,000, he gradually furnished more information with respect to his fraudulent activities, which indicated the total loss to be many times that amount. In handwritten statements dated April 20 and 24, 1970, Salerian summarized his dishonesty as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\u201cI hereby declare that from July 1969 to August 1969, without having been authorized by the Management, I maintained a securities position on 7000 IOS Management shares, the purchase price for which was $70 per share.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">\u201cAs the security dropped between $38 and $40 and being afraid that there would be a further drop, I proceeded to liquidate this position by selling off these same securities at prices ranging from $38 to $40.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">\u201cInasmuch as I did not want to cause the Bank to sustain such a size-able loss, panic-stricken, I debited the accounts of clients, a list of which is attached hereto, with different amounts representing the counter-val-use of the IOS stock, so as to compensate for the amount lost on the 7000 shares.\u201d (Confession dated April 20, 1970.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">\u201cI hereby declare that I kept these statements in my own hands for the following purpose: that if the market declined, I would enter them into the Bank\u2019s account, and if the market rose, I would keep them for my own account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-11\">\u201cI acknowledge that everything that I kept in a suspense account was for the same use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-12\">\u201cI acted without anyone\u2019s authorization, and was full [sic] aware that I did not have the right to do so.\u201d (Confession dated April 24,1970.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">The Insurer was promptly notified. It conducted its own investigation. Two outside auditing firms (Peat Marwick &amp; Fides S.A. and Societe Fidueiaire Ro-mande Ofor S.A.) were retained by the Bank to review and straighten out the records. Their reports, which were completed in August 1970, confirmed generally that Salerian had made fraudulent securities transactions and false entries concealing them. Copies of the reports were promptly furnished to the Insurer, and the Bank also notified customers whose accounts had been falsified. These customers then filed claims against the Bank for losses suffered by reason of Salerian\u2019s fraudulent activities. The claims were subsequently settled by the Bank\u2019s payment of $819,520 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>after the Insurer declined an offer to assist in handling threatened litigation and to participate in the settlement negotiations. This lawsuit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">At trial the Insurer did not seriously dispute Salerian\u2019s dishonesty. Its principal defense was that the Manager of the Chiasso branch, Albert Benezra, had learned or should have learned of Salerian\u2019s conduct many months prior to April 1970 but had failed to avert the loss or to give timely notice to the Insurer as required by the fidelity bond.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Benezra testified at trial that he had no knowledge of Salerian\u2019s fraud until April 20, 1970. The issue was submitted to the jury, which resolved it against the Insurer. The jury\u2019s verdict, being supported by substantial evidence, must stand in the absence of error warranting reversal. The Insurer further contended that it was not responsible for losses arising out of securities transactions allocated by Salerian to certain customers\u2019 accounts because the transactions had been authorized or tacitly consented to by those customers, either personally or through their representative, one Angelo Luzzani. This defense was also argued to the jury, which resolved it against the Insurer by including in its verdict an award for these losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">\n<em>The Refusal to Order Disclosure of the Identity of the Swiss Bank\u2019s Customers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">The Insurer contends on appeal that the trial judge committed several errors requiring reversal. The first of these is the district court\u2019s refusal to order the Bank to disclose the identity of customers whose accounts were misused by Salerian to conceal his fraudulent transactions by use of false entries. In the course of pretrial disclosure and depositions the Bank furnished to the Insurer thousands of records in its possession or control which were requested by the Insurer\u2019s counsel as possibly relevant to the issues, including transcripts of customers\u2019 accounts, auditors\u2019 work sheets, brokers\u2019 slips and Bank records underlying the alleged fraudulent transactions. It refused to furnish the identity of customers, however, on the ground that to do so would violate the Swiss bank secrecy law, \u00a7 47(b) of the Swiss Federal Bank Act, a criminal statute which provides that a violation shall be punishable by a fine of up to 50,000 francs or by imprisonment up to six months, or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>both.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In pretrial proceedings Judge Pollack upheld the Bank\u2019s position on the ground that there was \u201cneither compelling necessity for this information nor potential prejudice to defendant from nondisclosure at this stage of the proceedings,\u201d since the transcripts of the customers\u2019 accounts and the other records giving details as to the transactions about which the Insurer had inquired were adequate to enable it to prepare for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">At trial the parties took issue as to whether the Swiss bank secrecy law did bar disclosure of the customers\u2019 identities in a trial in a federal court in New York, with both sides offering testimony of Swiss law experts on the subject. Judge Pollack concluded that the Swiss law did prohibit such disclosure and decided that as a matter of comity he would therefore not require the Bank to identify the customers whose accounts were involved, particularly since in his view the identity was not essential to the issue on trial, which was whether securities transactions had been entered by Salerian in certain customers\u2019 accounts in furtherance of his fraudulent scheme. He ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">\u201cBut whether the account is known as x or 8044 or John Jones has nothing at all to do with whether the bonded employee has stolen something or acted dishonestly or fraudulently in connection with that account. The identity of that person is not a relevant issue in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">On the basis of our reivew <em>de novo </em>of the expert testimony and authorities offered by the parties, we are satisfied that the criminal sanctions of Article 47(b) of the Swiss Federal Bank Act apply to the disclosures sought in this proceeding. On its face the statute is Delphian in its generality. It simply provides that any bank officer or employee who violates the \u201cduty of secrecy\u201d or reveals a professional secret entrusted to him is punishable. However, the preponderance of opinion, given in testimony by well qualified Swiss law experts, was unequivocally to the effect that disclosure by the Bank, even at the direction of the United States District Court, would constitute a violation of the law. The principal bank secrecy issue at trial was whether Article 204 of the Code of Civil Procedure in the Swiss Canton of Ticino (where the Bank\u2019s Chiasso branch is located) superseded Article 47(b) of the Swiss Federal Bank Act. Article 204, as part of the procedural code of Ticino, enumerates the persons entitled to refuse testimony on the ground of professional secrecy (e.g., priests, lawyers, doctors) but does not include bankers. Although there is strong support for the view that such a procedural rule of a Swiss canton overrules the Swiss Federal Bank Act in a proceeding in the Canton itself, Mueller, The Swiss Banking Secret From a Legal View, 18 Int. <em>&amp; </em>Comp.L.Q. 360, 366-67 (1969); Meyer, The Banking Secret and Economic Espionage in Switzerland, 23 Geo.Wash.L.Rev. 284, 292 (1955), all experts at trial agreed that it would not apply to a proceeding in a United States court.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">There remains the question of whether the district court erred in not ordering the Bank, assuming its disclosure of customers\u2019 names would violate \u00a7 47(b) of the Swiss Federal Bank Act, to make a good faith effort to obtain a waiver of that restriction from the customers involved. Unquestionably the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>court had the power to do so, see, e.g., Societe Internationale, etc. v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197, 78 S.Ct. 1087, 2 L.Ed.2d 1255 (1958), and that power might appropriately have been exercised in a case such as this, where a foreign domiciliary seeking to avail itself of the processes of our courts to enforce its claim invokes the law of its country as the basis for non-disclosure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, although the idea of seeking waivers was mentioned in the course of pretrial depositions (Benezra, p. 180), the Insurer never asked the court for an order directing the Bank to seek waivers from clients whose accounts had allegedly been misused. Under the circumstances the district court was entitled in its discretion, after balancing the interests involved, to defer to Swiss law, Societe Internationale, etc. v. Rogers, <em>supra, </em>at 213, 78 S.Ct. 1087; United States v. First National City Bank, 396 F.2d 897, 901 (2d Cir.1968); Restatement (Second) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 40 (1965), and to define the scope of pretrial disclosure, In re Surety Ass\u2019n of America, 388 F.2d 412, 414 (2d Cir. 1967). In addition to the factors that ordinarily must be considered by the court in deciding whether to order a disclosure prohibited by the law of another state (e.g., the effect on the national interests of the states affected, the nationality of the party against whom disclosure is sought, and the extent to which the court\u2019s order can expect to be enforced), the relative unimportance of the information as to the clients\u2019 identity in the present proceeding was entitled to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Upon the record before us we fail to find any abuse of discretion on the part of Judge Pollack, who has had more than the usual degree of experience in this particular field<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and who lived at length with this ease, which was assigned to him for all purposes,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in not ordering the Bank to seek waivers. Salerian\u2019s falsification of the Bank\u2019s records is not disputed. All records falsified by him were made available, except for the names of customers, to the Insurer. It is unlikely that the customers would have furnished evidence helpful to the Insurer. Indeed, they were claiming through their representative Dr. Angelo Luzzani to have been victimized by Salerian\u2019s fraud. Although the Insurer contended that Dr. Luzzani, whose identity was known to it, had acted as the authorized agent for approximately 18 of the customers in giving instructions to Salerian with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>purchase and sale of securities for their accounts, it failed to depose him or to offer him as a witness at trial. In short, no sound basis is offered for disturbing the trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion, which appears to have been based on a careful analysis and balancing of all relevant interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\n<em>The Proof of Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The Insurer next contends that the judgment should be set aside for the reason that there was a failure of proof of damages. We disagree. The Bank introduced extensive documentary and oral proof of nine different categories of loss suffered by it as a result of Salerian\u2019s dishonesty, including damages suffered by reason of his use of Bank money to make unauthorized purchases or short sales of securities later disposed of at a net loss, funds paid to independent auditors to straighten out the Bank\u2019s books following Salerian\u2019s falsification of them, losses resulting from unauthorized purchases of securities which Salerian fraudulently allocated to customers, and payments made by the Bank in settlement of customers\u2019 claims based on Salerian\u2019s conduct. While the tangled affairs of Salerian did not lend themselves to easy reconstruction, the schedules offered by the Bank were founded on record evidence. Thus there was ample evidence to support by a fair preponderance the finding that the Bank suffered losses in the sum of $2,045,932 (before interest) by reason of Salerian\u2019s dishonesty, and the Insurer, except to the extent of its cross-examination of witnesses offered by the Bank, failed to introduce any contrary schedule or analysis of the financial records.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\n<em>The Exclusion of Salerian\u2019s Exculpatory Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">A more serious question is posed by the Insurer\u2019s contention that the trial judge erred in excluding a seven-page written exculpatory statement made by Salerian on October 28, 1970, more than six months after the series of written confessions given by him in April 1970. Although his earlier confessions were hearsay, they were properly admitted in evidence under the well-recognized exception made for declarations aginst interest. Oscar Gruss &amp; Son v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 422 F.2d 1278, 1282-1283 (2d Cir. 1970); Gichner v. Antonio Troiano Tile &amp; Marble Co., 133 U.S. App.D.C. 250, 410 F.2d 238, 241-243 (1969); Alexander Grant\u2019s Sons v. Phoenix Assur. Co., 25 A.D.2d 93, 267 N.Y.S.2d 220 (4th Dept. 1966). See generally C. McCormick, Evidence Ch. 27 (2d ed. 1972). Indeed it is difficult to conceive of a better qualified \u201cdeclaration against interest\u201d than these confessions, which satisfy all of the requirements for the admission of such declarations. Salerian\u2019s statements admitted participation in fraudulent and dishonest acts, were patently against his pecuniary and proprietary interest and exposed him to the risk of criminal prosecution ; he does not appear to have had any motive to falsely incriminate himself, C. McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 279 (2d ed. 1972); and since he was outside the jurisdiction, his unavailability to testify at trial was not disputed. The Insurer contends that these self-incriminatory statements were obtained by threats on the part of superior Bank officials. This contention, however, is unsupported by any competent proof and it is illogical to assume that Salerian and Camponovo would have been induced by any such pressure to make self-incriminatory admissions that would obviously have jeopardized their careers and their liberty. On the contrary, if indeed they were innocent they would have had every reason to deny any wrongdoing. \u201cIt is not likely that [an employee] would admit to a theft merely to accommodate his employer.\u201d Oscar Gruss &amp; Son v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., <em>supra, </em>422 F.2d at 1283 (2d Cir. 1970) (quoting from Letendre v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., 21 N.Y.2d 518 at 523, 289 N.Y.S.2d 183 at 187, 236 N.E.2d 467 at 469 (1968) ). But even accepting <em>arguendo </em>the Insurer\u2019s contention, the decision to admit the confessions as dec\u00eda-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>rations against interest rested within the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">During the course of the trial the Insurer\u2019s counsel for the first time showed to counsel for the Bank two documents which were thereupon offered in evidence. The first was a seven-page typed narrative dated October 28, 1970, bearing Salerian\u2019s signature, addressed to the Swiss Examining Magistrate in charge of the investigation which followed the Bank\u2019s criminal complaint, still pending, against Salerian and Cam-ponovo. The gist of this statement, which describes in confusing detail many securities transactions and false entries made by Salerian, is that the transactions were authorized by Angelo Luzzani as the attorney in fact for a group of customers, that the delayed entry on the Bank\u2019s books of sales of I.O. S. shares at a loss of approximately $420,000 was at the instance of Luzzani who did not wish to disclose the loss to his customers, that Camponovo agreed to this procedure, and that Benezra, the then Manager of the Chiasso branch, knew of and verified the transactions. The statement avers, among many other things, that Salerian\u2019s earlier confessions given in April 1970 were untrue and extorted from him by Bank officials \u201cunder threat of notifying the Police if I did not sign them.\u201d The second document was a one-page statement bearing Salerian\u2019s signature, dated November 20, 1971 (during the period when both parties were still actively engaged in taking depositions of various witnesses in Switzerland and only 23 days before the commencement of trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Since the two later Salerian statements were hearsay and the Insurer\u2019s counsel made no effort to justify their admission under an exception to the hearsay rule, the trial judge properly excluded them. The statements certainly could not qualify as admissions against interest. Indeed, Salerian might reasonably be suspected of seeking, because of the intervening Swiss criminal investigation of himself, to place the blame on others.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The surrounding circumstances, including the Insurer\u2019s failure to notify the Bank prior to trial that it proposed to offer the statements, Sal-erian\u2019s apparent unwillingness to submit to cross-examination by the Bank\u2019s counsel, the impending criminal proceeding against Salerian in Switzerland, and the long delay in his furnishing the statements (one being given on the eve of trial), render them highly suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The Insurer now urges for the first time on appeal that Salerian\u2019s subsequent statements, although hearsay, were admissible to impeach his earlier April 1970 confessions introduced into evidence by the Bank. Our attention has been directed to the rule, with which we do not disagree, that hearsay evidence may be received to impeach previously-admitted hearsay statements of an absent witness, and that since the witness is unavailable it is unecessary in such a case to lay a foundation by first inquiring of the witness whether he made the statements. McConney v. United States, 421 F.2d 248, 251 (9th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 821, 91 S.Ct. 39, 27 L.Ed.2d 49, reh. denied, 400 U.S. 961, 91 S.Ct. 351, 27 L.Ed.2d 270 (1970); Bunge Corp. v. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., 65 Misc.2d 829, 318 N.Y.S.2d 819, 834 (N.Y. County), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 37 A.D.2d 409, 325 N. Y.S.2d 983 (1st Dept. 1971); see People v. Conde, 16 A.D.2d 327, 228 N.Y.S.2d 69, 71-72 (3d Dept. 1962), aff\u2019d., 13 N. Y.2d 939, 244 N.Y.S.2d 314, 194 N.E.2d 130 (1963); Martorella v. Prudential Ins. Co., 238 A.D. 532, 264 N.Y.S. 751, 753 (4th Dept. 1933), affd., 268 N.Y. 586, 198 N.E. 417 (1935); C. McCormick, <em>Supra </em>\u00a7 37, at 74; 3A Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1033 (3d ed. 1940); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Prince, Admissibility of Contradictory Statements to Impeach Unavailable Witness; New York Rule, 10 Brooklyn L. Rev. 133 (1940). Had Salerian\u2019s subsequent statements amounted to nothing more than impeachment of his earlier confessions, it would have been reversible error to have excluded them, especially since the Bank\u2019s case depended heavily upon the confessions. The statements offered by the Insurer, however, went far beyond impeachment, retraction, or contradiction of the earlier confessions. For the most part they were devoted to a detailed history which, if believed, would implicate Benezra, Luz-zani and Camponovo on the basis of their authorization or knowledge of the fraudulent transactions and thus show that the Bank failed to give timely notice of the wrongdoing to the Insurer. These portions, which constituted the major part of the documents, were properly excludable as hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Having presented the court with a \u201cmixed-bag\u201d or potpourri, most of which was inadmissible hearsay, the Insurer\u2019s counsel owed a duty to court and opposing counsel to point out or segregate those portions which might properly be offered as impeachment of Salerian\u2019s earlier confessions. Edward Valves, Inc. v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc., 286 F.2d 933, 939 (5th Cir. 1961); High Voltage Engineering Corp. v. Pierce, 359 F.2d 33, 39 (10th Cir. 1966). \u201c[It] is for the proponent to sever the good and the bad parts,\u201d 1 Wigmore, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 17, at 320. See Rule 46, F.R.Civ. P. At the very least counsel should, when objection was properly taken, have informed the court of the purpose of the offer, especially when it had not furnished an advance copy to the Bank\u2019s counsel or advised it of the proposed offer. Bowman v. Kaufman, 387 F.2d 582, 588 (2d Cir. 1967). See 5A Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 46.02 (2d ed. 1971); Reek v. Pacific-Atlantic S. S. Co., 180 F.2d 866, 870 (2d Cir. 1950). If such steps had been taken the court could have edited out the inadmissible portions and admitted a redated document containing only the impeachment or retraction. Having deprived the court of that opportunity, the Insurer cannot now raise the evidentiary point.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\n<em>The Admission of Unsigned Deposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ai\">\n<em>Transcripts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The Insurer next contends that the judgment should be set aside and a new trial ordered on the ground that Judge Pollack erroneously permitted the Bank to introduce over the Insurer\u2019s objection transcripts of depositions of three witnesses taken in Switzerland which did not bear their notarized signatures. These witnesses were Jean Jacques Lar-pin, the Bank\u2019s chief bookkeeper, Bernard Chapuis, a Swiss CPA associated with the accounting firm of Societe Fi-duciaire Romande Ofor S. A. (\u201cOfor\u201d) and Claudio Muollo, a Milan CPA associated with the accounting firm of Peat Marwick &amp; Fides S. A. Larpin had been asked by his superiors in late April 1970 to check entries in certain of the Bank\u2019s records for the purpose of determining whether there were irregularities as reported by Salerian to Benezra. Chapuis and Muollo headed teams of independent auditors called in by the Bank, after Salerian confessed to his making of numerous false entries, to make an audit in which they would determine the nature and extent of the irregularities revealed by the Bank\u2019s records and report their findings and recommendations as to how the accounts should be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">There is no suggestion that the Insurer did not have a full opportunity to cross-examine the three witnesses when their depositions were taken in Switzerland. Indeed the depositions of two of them (Larpin and Muollo) were taken in mid-November 1971, at the instance of the Insurer. Although the Insurer had notice of the taking of the deposition of the third (Chapuis) in Geneva on November 22, 1971, as originally scheduled, its counsel chose not to attend. Nor is it contended that the transcripts of the depositions did not accurately reflect the witnesses\u2019 testimony. The transcripts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>were certified as accurate by the reporter, a member of the staff of the Southern District Court Reporters who had been brought by the parties to Switzerland for the purpose of making a steno-type recording of the testimony. The sole objection is that each of the transcripts fails to bear the notarized signature of the witness in accordance with a stipulation and oral order of the court. The reason for the Bank\u2019s failure to obtain the witnesses\u2019 signatures was that due to a strike of transcribing personnel of the office of Southern District Court Reporters the depositions, which were taken in November 1971 in Switzerland, could not be transcribed and copies delivered to counsel for the parties until December 8, 1971, five days before trial began.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">We agree with the Insurer that a timely objection to a deposition transcript on the ground that it fails to show that the witness was sworn, or fails to comply with requirements stipulated to by the parties in lieu of an oath (in this ease that the transcript would bear the notarized signature of the witness), should be sustained and the transcript excluded. See Rule 32(b), F.R. Civ.P., 6 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1824 (3d ed. 1940). Here, however, after initially indicating that it would not object, the Insurer interposed an objection at a time when it was too late for the Bank to cure the irregularity. Furthermore, any error in admitting the depositions was harmless, since the witnesses\u2019 testimony merely duplicated the substance of regular business records that were properly received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Upon the commencement of trial on December 13, 1971, the Insurer\u2019s counsel, who had received unsigned transcripts of the depositions, pointed out to the court that he had \u201cnot received back from the plaintiff (Bank) the signed and sworn to depositions of any witness whose depositions we took in Switzerland.\u201d The court responded: \u201cThe Court: Signatures will be ordered waived, if that\u2019s your only concern because a mechanical delivery hasn\u2019t been made yet.\u201d The Insurer\u2019s counsel replied \u201cMr. Hart: 7 <em>wouldn\u2019t raise a fuss about that, your Honor.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). This response could reasonably be construed as indicating that the Insurer would not insist that the Bank forward the transcripts to Switzerland for signature and return before the end of the trial, then in progress. Valdez v. United States, 326 F.2d 598 (9th Cir. 1963). Having made this statement, the Insurer\u2019s counsel owed a duty to correct the impression thus conveyed and, if he desired to enforce his client\u2019s rights under Rule 32(b), F.R.Civ.P., to move promptly to suppress the depositions in accordance with Rule 32(d)(4).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead he waited until the first of the deposition transcripts was offered on December 16, 1971, whereupon he did indeed \u201craise a fuss,\u201d objecting to the depositions on the ground that they had not been signed and sworn to by the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">If the Insurer had indicated on December 13, 1971, that it would object to the transcripts unless they were signed and sworn to by the witnesses, the Bank could possibly have taken the steps necessary to forward the depositions to Switzerland for signature, notarization and return by December 22, 1971, when it rested. By the time the objection was interposed, however, it was too late to take such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-15\">Even if the Insurer had not waived its right to object to the failure of the dep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>ositions to bear the witnesses\u2019 notarized signatures, we are satisfied, upon our independent review of the record, that any error or defect in receiving their testimony would not have affected the parties\u2019 substantial rights and would therefore have been harmless. Rule 61, F.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111. With minor exceptions their testimony amounted to nothing more than descriptions of information contained in underlying Bank records made available well in advance of trial to the Insurer and introduced into evidence. For instance, Larpin, the chief bookkeeper, described the nature of his investigation of the Bank\u2019s records, which he made in late April 1970 at the instance of his superiors to determine whether there were irregularities, and what he found. Similarly Muollo, the Peat Marwick auditor, and Chapuis, the Ofor auditor, explained the scope of their investigations, the procedures followed by them and their staffs in making their audits of the Bank\u2019s records, their findings (which were summarized in written reports furnished to the Insurer over one year prior to trial) and their recommendations as to what changes should be made in the accounts to correct the misinformation contained in them. Their testimony was to a great extent merely duplicative of the underlying records in evidence or that had been available to the Insurer prior to trial. Since their reports could be verified by reference to the underlying records, their credibility was not a substantial factor in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\n<em>Other Contentions of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">We have examined the Insurer\u2019s other contentions of error and find them to be without merit. Its argument that because Salerian did not succeed in his fraudulent scheme the Insurer should be excused from liability for resulting losses to the Bank defies logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Although it would have been preferable for the Bank to have furnished to the Insurer a copy of the IBM listing used in the preparation of one Schedule (Ex. 18, Settlement with 18 Numbered Accounts) used at trial, it appears that the underlying information had been furnished or made available to the Insurer. The claim that the witness Muollo was in New York on December 16, 1971, when his deposition was used at trial was not established. He apparently arrived two days later. When the Insurer\u2019s counsel did see him in the courtroom on December 22, 1971, after both sides had rested and were preparing to sum up to the jury, no effort was made to reopen the trial, which is not surprising, in view of the substance of his deposition testimony, already described. The denial of the Insurer\u2019s post-trial motion was well within the district court\u2019s permissible discretion. Welden v. Grace Line, Inc., 404 F.2d 76, 79 (2d Cir. 1968). There was also no abuse of discretion in allowing the Bank at the beginning of trial to amend its complaint to add an additional claim of $45,765 for the services of independent auditors in investigating the false and fraudulent entries made by Salerian and recommending steps to restore the integrity of the Bank\u2019s records. See Rule 15(a), F.R.Civ.P. Since the Insurer\u2019s counsel had been advised one month before trial of the Bank\u2019s intention to seek the amendment and thereafter examined the auditors at length upon taking their depositions (except for Muollo, whom the Bank offered to make available for further examination), no prejudice is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-5\">.

With the client's consent the bank may of course reveal the client\u2019s identity without violating \u00a7 47 (b). Here the Bank, on October 19, 1971, agreed to pay $772,600 in settlement of claims asserted by 18 numbered accounts because of Salerian\u2019s fraud. Since the Insurer had previously demanded the identity of the clients, the district court, had a timely request been made by the Insurer, could have directed tlie Bank to obtain waivers at the time of settlement. Apprehension on the part of the Bank\u2019s clients that the information as to their identities would be misused could have been minimized by a protective order prohibiting the parties from disclosing the information to third persons or using it for any purpose other than the pending suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b121-11\">.

Indeed, even in the later statements Salerian does not portray himself as completely blameless.
