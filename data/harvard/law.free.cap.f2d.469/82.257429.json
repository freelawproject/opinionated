[1] The District Court entered extensive findings of fact pertaining to the violations of said Act, which findings of fact on review of this record we certainly cannot hold to be clearly erroneous. This record is replete with evidence which supports the District Judge\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-21\">Appellants also contend that the District Judge\u2019s order requiring payment of approximately $8,000 to the Secretary of Labor for distribution to the employees concerned was unauthorized by \u00a7 17 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 217 (1970). On review of the language of the Act and its legislative history, we hold that this order is consistent with both the letter of the Act and the congressional intention involved in its adoption. Hodgson v. Wheaton Glass Co., 446 F.2d 527, 529-534 (3d Cir. 1971); Shultz v. Mistletoe Express Service, Inc., 434 F.2d 1267 (10th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-22\">Further, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the District Judge in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>his rulings on the admission of evidence or in the modification of his pretrial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
