The verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">The consent to the telephone conversation between Brooms and appellant with respect to the second transaction was willingly given by Brooms. He had the <em>motive </em>to help himself, but no proof of coercion exists, and the trier of fact so found. The case of Weiss v. United States, 308 U.S. 321, 60 S.Ct. 269, 84 L.Ed. 298 (1939) differs on its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">The appellant was not entrapped. That defense was not raised below, and cannot now be raised on appeal. United States v. Priest, 419 F.2d 570 (10th Cir. 1970). Defendant never admitted during the trial he passed or transferred the counterfeit -money. United States v. Hendricks, 456 F.2d 167 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
