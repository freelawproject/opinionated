He moved to suppress certain handguns which had been seized at his home at the time of his arrest. During the hearing on his motion he asked that the motion be modified to include a request for the suppression of three inculpatory statements (two oral and one written) which he had made on the morning of his arrest. The district court entered an order suppressing the handguns and the defendant\u2019s written confession. The United States appeals pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">I. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">Candella was arrested at his home at approximately 7:30 on the morning of February 17, 1971, by agents Wessler, D\u2019Atri and Dugan of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of the United States Treasury Department. After Candella had been given the Miranda warnings he was asked whether he had any of the firearms he was accused of purchasing in Maryland and transporting to New York. According to the undisputed findings of fact of the district court, Candella said, \u201c \u2018Some of them are there,\u2019 pointing to a carton about five feet or so from where he was standing, and Mr. Wessler with Mr. Dugan looked into the box and saw that it did have guns, which Mr. Duggan [sic] then took under his control, and Mr. Wessler turned back to Mr. Candella and asked whether he had any others, and Mr. Can-della, half turning, indicated a desk or other piece of furniture some five,Jeet away from him in another direction, and Mr. D\u2019Atri went there and opened a drawer and found additional firearms in it. 29 firearms or thereabouts were found, all told. Apparently 10 or so in the desk and 19 or so in the carton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-17\">At approximately 8 :30 A.M. Candella was taken in a Government vehicle to the A.T.F. office. There, after some discussion of the facts, Candella signed the statement which the district court ordered suppressed. Candella was then taken to the office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York where he arrived at approximately 11:00 A.M. Counsel was then obtained for him and he was arraigned at approximately 11:30 A.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-18\">II. <em>The Suppression of the Handguns</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-19\">Candella\u2019s conduct when he was arrested constituted consent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>seizure of the handguns. See United States v. Rothberg, 460 F.2d 223 (2d Cir. 1972);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> United States v. Gaines, 441 F.2d 1122 (2d Cir.), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 404 U.S. 878, 92 S.Ct. 223, 30 L.Ed.2d 159 (1971). Candella, after being informed of his rights, pointed to the exact spots where the guns were located and told the officers where they were. Here, as in <em>Roth-berg, </em>there is \u201cno evidence ... of coercion or other circumstances that would render the consent invalid.\u201d 460 F.2d at 224. Consent was \u201cfreely and voluntarily given.\u201d See Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 548, 88 S. Ct. 1788, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968); United States v. Fernandez, 456 F.2d 638 (2d Cir. 1972). \u201c[T]he mere fact that a suspect is under arrest does not negate the possibility of a voluntary consent. Neither does the suspect\u2019s knowledge that the search will almost certainly demonstrate his guilt.\u201d United States ex rel. Lundergan v. McMann, 417 F.2d 519, 521 (2d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">In addition to the factor of consent to the seizure of the guns, they should have been held admissible because in practical effect they were in \u201cplain view\u201d of the agents. The agents were legally in Candella\u2019s home for the purpose of making an arrest for which they had a valid arrest warrant. Their attention was directed by Candella to the very spot where the guns were situated. If the containers had been open there would be no doubt about the propriety of the seizure. Candella\u2019s statement that the guns were in the containers was the equivalent of his opening the containers for the agents\u2019 inspection. \u201cWhere . . . the arresting officer inadvertently comes within plain view of a piece of evidence, <em>not concealed, </em>although outside of the area under the immediate control of the arrestee, the officer may seize it, so long as the plain view was obtained in the course of an appropriately limited search of the arrestee.\u201d Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 465-466, n. 24, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2038, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971) (emphasis added). Here, once the appellee told the agents where the guns were, they were no longer \u201cconcealed\u201d and it was reasonable for the agents to seize them. The evidence was, in effect, in the \u201cplain view\u201d of the agents. See United States v. Titus, 445 F.2d 577 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 957, 92 S.Ct. 323, 30 L.Ed.2d 274 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">The contrary holding of the district court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">III. <em>The Suppression of the Confession.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">The district court ordered the suppression of the last of three statements made by Candella on the morning of his arrest. That statement was a written confession which merely reiterated Candella\u2019s previous oral admissions. The court believed that the delay in bringing the defendant before a magistrate for arraignment was violative of Rule 5(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which mandates that \u201c[a]n officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint ... shall take the arrested person without <em>unnecessary </em>delay before the nearest available commissioner or before any other nearby officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 5(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">We hold that the time that elapsed between arrest and arraignment was not unreasonably long. See United States v. Price, 345 F.2d 256 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 382 U.S. 949, 86 S.Ct. 404, 15 L. Ed.2d 357 (1965). The delay of less than four hours was for the proper purposes of routine processing such as allowing Candella to get dressed, traveling to the A.T.F. office, and fingerprint- __ ing and photographing him, and of re- <em>\\ </em>ducing Candella\u2019s prior oral admissions : <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>to writing. These activities were not '\u201cunnecessary\u201d within the meaning of Rule 5(a). See United States v. Collins, 462 F.2d 792, 795-796 (2d Cir. 1972); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We hold that both the handguns seized in the defendant\u2019s apartment and his written confession are admissible into evidence at trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-5\">. Because our decision in the <em>Rotliberg </em>case was handed down three months after the hearing in the instant case it is understandable that it played no part in the decision below.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b256-6\">OAKES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ANL\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">I am forced to dissent from a portion of the majority opinion and would affirm the district judge\u2019s orders to suppress the handguns. It is necessary to state some additional facts to crystallize the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">First, official investigation of Can-della was based upon information obtained from his brother-in-law in August, 1970. This information specifically included the fact that Candella had illegally purchased guns and had those guns in his residence. The federal agents did not obtain an arrest warrant for Candella until February 10, 1971. This was based partly upon the information previously supplied by Candella\u2019s brother-in-law. The arrest warrant was not executed until one week after it was obtained, February 17, 1971, amply supporting the district court\u2019s finding that \u201cthis case was not at any time one that could be called urgent or exigent or one that called for sudden action or precipitous action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Second, Candella\u2019s vision is very much impaired and he is unable to read. While Candella was read a card purporting to explain his <em>Miranda, </em>rights, the district court raised a question as to whether or not the statement read adequately explained that the appellee had a right to have an attorney present during questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">The majority finds that the search was consented to even though the issue was not presented to the district court. Indeed, the United States Attorney said, \u201cYour Honor, we are not advocating a consent search here.\u201d While the district court did make a full fact-finding on the circumstances of the seizure, it never has been given an opportunity to consider the inferences to be drawn from the facts on the question of consent. Judge Mansfield objected in dissent in United States v. Rothberg, 460 F.2d 223, 225 (2d Cir. 1972), to this court\u2019s substituting its findings of fact for those of the district court even though the district court\u2019s findings are not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Here, the intrusion on the sphere of the district court seems even more serious as that court has not had an opportunity to pass upon the issue at all. There might be additional inquiries made or facts found on the consent issue had the Government presented its claim below. Here an appellate court based solely on the \u201ccold transcript,\u201d United States v. Rothberg, <em>supra </em>at 225 (dissenting opinion), is making a finding on the issue of consent without benefit of the district court\u2019s consideration of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">The Government justifies its failure to raise the issue below on the basis that <em>Rothberg </em>had not yet been decided. But even if <em>Rothberg </em>were directly in point there were many cases which dealt with the doctrine of consent in this circuit that predated it. <em>E. g., </em>United States ex rel. Lundergan v. McMann, 417 F.2d 519 (2d Cir. 1969); United States v. Smith, 308 F.2d 657 (2d Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 906, 83 S.Ct. 717, 9 L.Ed.2d 716 (1963). Thus the Government was certainly not unaware that a consent claim could be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">Even assuming that the consent issue were properly before the court, it should be noted that the burden is on the prosecutor to show the consent was \u201cfreely and voluntarily given.\u201d Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 548, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968). Otherwise we would undermine the general requirement that the police obtain a warrant and interpose the judgment of an impartial magistrate before they invade a person\u2019s privacy. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 454-455, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Here the specific <em>Miranda </em>warnings given to the appellee were of questionable utility in making him aware that he had legal rights under the circumstances. He was surely frightened by the presence of three strangers in his house, whose credentials he could not check, claiming authority to arrest him. While it is true that the fact of arrest has been held not to negate the possibility of voluntary consent, United States ex rel. Lundergan v. McMann, <em>supra, </em>417 F.2d at 521, the fear and confusion of an individual, particularly of a nearly blind person, that results from being confronted with authority must be taken into account. Indeed, it might be argued that a warrantless search cannot be validated by consent absent a specific warning to the individual that he has a right not to have his premises searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In United States v. Rothberg, <em>supra, </em>the court found that a defendant consented to a search of his basement. There was testimony in that case, however, which to be sure the trial court rejected but the appellate court apparently credited, that the defendant asked the police to go to the basement and get his jacket because it was cold outside. <em>See </em>460 F.2d at 224. In other words, <em>Roth-berg </em>can be limited to the circumstance where the defendant, without any police prompting, authorizes the invasion of his privacy. Here, the appellee\u2019s gestures pointing to the location of the guns was done at the behest of the arresting officers. To find consent when the defendant acts with police solicitation would encourage the police not to obtain search warrants and to rely on trying to coax frightened and handicapped individuals in a perplexing situation to waive their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Here, the grounds for not obtaining a search warrant will not withstand scrutiny. As the district court found, there was no emergency or other exigent circumstance. The agents knew that they were looking for illegally-purchased guns and that the guns were likely to be in appellee\u2019s apartment. The principal justification offered by the Government for not obtaining a warrant was that the seven-month-old information from Can-deila\u2019s brother-in-law was too stale to support it. <em>See, e. g., </em>Schoeneman v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 110, 317 F.2d 173, 177 (1963) (107-day-old information held too stale). But the information was paradoxically not too stale to justify an arrest warrant. What the Government tried to do was convert the stale information on which the arrest warrant was based into a search warrant it apparently thought it could not otherwise obtain. No good reason appears why the Government did not simply try to update the information from Candel-la\u2019s brother-in-law. There was no showing, for example, that they did not know the brother-in-law\u2019s whereabouts. The Government should not be rewarded for sloppy detective work by the admission of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">As indicated above, the agents did not have a good reason for not obtaining a search warrant. I think under <em>Coolidge </em>such a justification is a prerequisite to the \u201cplain view\u201d exception applied by the majority here. Exceptions to the warrant requirement of the fourth amendment are \u201cjealously and carefully drawn,\u201d and there must be a showing of exigent circumstances to justify a war-rantless search. 403 U.S. at 455, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564. There are none here.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">The same argument can be reformulated another way. Under <em>Coolidge, </em>a \u201cplain view\u201d seizure must be \u201cinadvertent\u201d to be justified. If \u201cthe discovery is anticipated,\u201d and \u201cthe police know in advance the location of the evidence and intend to seize it,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 470, 91 S.Ct. at 2040, the discovery is not inadvertent. Here, the agents had information the guns were in Candella\u2019s apartment and intended to seize them if they came upon them. Thus the discovery of the guns was not inadvertent and the agents should have obtained a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">The district court\u2019s suppression order as to the handguns should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
