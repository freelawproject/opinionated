Now it is argued that it is possible the persons transported were dual citizens of Mexico and of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-25\">On the facts here, we conclude that the testimony was properly received, was sufficient to support the verdict, and that it was not necessary for the government to negative all possible situations that could have impaired the status. It is noted there was no cross examination.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
