Leave was granted to file a new complaint in compliance with that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">Shortly thereafter appellant filed another complaint which, while somewhat shorter than the first, was equally prolix and for the most part incomprehensible. On April 11, 1972, Judge Cooper granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the second complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b) (6), this time without leave to amend. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-12\">Having in mind that the court\u2019s jurisdiction must first be determined, Ar-rowsmith v. United Press International, 320 F.2d 219 (2d Cir. 1963) (en banc), we note that the complaint does assert various jurisdictional bases, including 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (federal question) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) (federal civil rights action), which, when construed favorably toward this <em>pro se </em>pleader, see Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594,-30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), are probably sufficient to pass jurisdictional muster at this stage. However, applying the same liberal standard, we find that the complaint fails, for the reasons stated by Judge Cooper, to state facts amounting to a claim upon which relief may be granted. Accordingly the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
