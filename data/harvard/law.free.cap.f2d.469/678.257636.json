The complaint was dismissed because Jones failed to state sufficient facts to entitle him to relief under the Civil Rights Act 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">A dismissal of a complaint without dismissing the action is not a final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 because the complaint is still open to amendment. The complaint was deficient because it contained only unsupported conclusionary allegations. No \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d here indicate that the complaint could not be cured by amendment. Hurst v. State of California, 451 F.2d 350 (9th Cir. 1971). Therefore, the order appealed from is not an appealable order. Jackson v. Nelson, 405 F.2d 872, 873 (9th Cir. 1968). Accordingly the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hemstreet v. Schade, 459 F.2d 49 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-13\">. In so far as this court might be said to have jurisdiction because part of the district court\u2019s order denied injunctive relief from a \u201ccontinuing false imprisonment,\u201d it is clear that release from custody is not available in a civil rights action. Peinado v. Adult Authority, 405 F.2d 1185 (9th Cir. 1969). The complaint alleges no exhaustion of state remedies and therefore the action could not be considered ns one brought for a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
