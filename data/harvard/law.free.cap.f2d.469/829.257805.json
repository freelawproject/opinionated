After a hearing, the District Court, 338 F.Supp. 990, entered a preliminary injunction on September 1, 1971, ordering defendants to reinstate Mrs. Duke as a teaching assistant. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Mrs. Duke received notice of her termination as well as the reasons for termination in a letter dated August 25, 1970, from the Acting President of the University, John L. Carter, Jr. The letter gave her an opportunity for an administrative hearing before the President\u2019s Cabinet, which consisted of Mr. Carter and three vice presidents of the University. She took advantage of the opportunity. At the hearing held on September 23, 1970, Mrs. Duke was present and represented by counsel and the University was represented by an Assistant Attorney General of the State of Texas. The parties presented evidence and cross-examined witnesses. Following the hearing, the President\u2019s Cabinet decided not to rehire Mrs. Duke and entered written findings as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">\u201cOn the evenings of July 30, 1970, and August 3, 1970, Mrs. Elizabeth Duke appeared before and made an address to an unauthorized and unsponsored group meeting in the park on the campus of North Texas State University. Mrs. Elizabeth Duke participated in the organization of such meetings and in distributing leaflets announcing such meetings which were a planned effort to bring a subculture group into the official orientation program of the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">\u201cThe audience which Mrs. Elizabeth Duke addressed upon these two occasions included persons who had been enrolled as students in prior semesters at the University as well as persons who would be freshmen students at the fall semester of 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">\u201cDuring the course of her address to the crowd on both occasions Mrs. Elizabeth Duke used profane and obscene language. Her statements discredited the University administration and the governing board of the University and were critical of the manner in which the University is operated and maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">\u201cThe withdrawal of the offer to employ Mrs. Elizabeth Duke as a teaching assistant for the academic year beginning in September of 1970 is sustained by the President\u2019s Cabinet for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">1. By assisting in organizing and appearing upon the program at the meetings held in violation of the rules and regulations of the University upon the campus of North Texas State University on the evenings of July 30, 1970, and August 3, 1970, Mrs. Elizabeth Duke demonstrated an unwillingness on her part to respect and abide by the rules and regulations of the University and further encouraged and caused members of the student body to violate such rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">2. The actions and statements of Mrs. Elizabeth Duke demonstrate a lack of academic responsibility required by Section II of the Statement on Academic Freedom at North Texas State University, in that: (a) her actions and statements before a group of students and her participation in meetings which violates the rules and regulations of the University impair her efficiency as a teacher and her judgment as a scholar, and (b) by her actions and statements upon the occasions in question, Mrs. Elizabeth Duke failed to recognize and appreciate that the public will judge North Texas State University and its teaching faculty by such statements and actions, thereby demonstrating the lack of professional integrity required of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>teaching faculty at North Texas State University.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">3. The fact that Mrs. Elizabeth Duke did not enroll for at least six semester hours at the fall semester of 1970 at North Texas State University fails to comply with the requirements of North Texas State University concerning teaching assistant positions, as was set forth in the written offer to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">\u201cThe President\u2019s Cabinet fully recognizes and appreciates the right of freedom of speech and of association which is accorded to Mrs. Elizabeth Duke by the Constitution of the United States. However, her rights of speech and association must be balanced against the interest of the University in promoting and maintaining an efficient university and a faculty which commands the respect of the student body and the community. The record before the President\u2019s Cabinet demonstrates that Mrs. Elizabeth Duke has exercised her rights of speech and association in a manner and to an extent such as to seriously impair, if not destroy, her effectiveness as an instructor in the organized academic program at North Texas State University.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">\u201cThe President\u2019s Cabinet considers each of the foregoing, considered separately and apart, as sufficient cause for the withdrawal of the offer to Mrs. Elizabeth Duke to be a teaching assistant at North Texas State University for the academic year commencing September, 1970.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Mrs. Duke appealed the decision of the President\u2019s Cabinet to the Board of Regents, the governing body of the University. On February 26, 1971, the Board reviewed the decision of the Cabinet. Mrs. Duke spoke to the Board on her own behalf; in addition, her attorney argued orally and submitted a brief of legal authority. When the Board sustained the findings and action of the Cabinet, Mrs. Duke prosecuted this action in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\"> In Ferguson v. Thomas, 5 Cir., 1970, 430 F.2d 852, 856,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we held that a teacher with an expectancy of reemployment is entitled to certain minimal procedural guarantees, including the availability of \u201ca tribunal that both possesses some academic expertise and has an apparent impartiality toward the charges. (Note the dictum in Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, [at 578, n. 2,] 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968).\u201d In the present case the District Judge concluded that \u201cthe University satisfied each minimal procedural standard except the standard requiring the reviewing tribunal to possess an apparent impartiality toward the charges.\u201d The District Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-13\">\u201cActing President Carter in his letter of August 25, 1970, informing plaintiff of her dismissal, stated that he was acting at the direction of the Board of Regents. Thus the Board had already made its position in the Duke affair known prior to the September 23 hearing before the President\u2019s Cabinet. It is, of course, possible that one in the position of Acting President Carter would be free, contrary to the expressed wishes of his employer, to act as his conscience directed after hearing plaintiff\u2019s presentation of her case; but such is not the common understanding of such situations. At any rate, the atmosphere of apparent impartiality is far from being preserved. Acting President Carter\u2019s presence on the Cabinet would alone be enough to violate procedural due process, but it also appears that the remaining three members of the cabinet were, like Mr. Carter, University administrative officers directly responsible to the Board of Regents. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Under these circumstances, the court cannot rule that the Cabinet possessed apparent impartiality toward the charges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">(Appendix, pp. 50, 51.) The record does not demonstrate actual partiality on the part of the President\u2019s Cabinet or any of its individual members despite Mrs. Duke\u2019s reference to the testimony of Clovis Clyde Morrisson, Jr., a Professor of Political Science. Professor Morris-son testified that his promotion from associate to full professor, as he understood it, was denied by the Board of Regents for reasons which bore in part a relation to his activities in the Duke matter. The promotion was denied despite the recommendation by his department, his Dean, and the Academic Vice President. Mrs. Duke argues that on the basis of the reprisal, \u201cIt thus becomes apparent that those under the employ of the Board of Regents at NTSU who go against the wishes of the Board can expect to be dealt with without mercy.\u201d In our view plaintiff\u2019s evidence relative to lack of impartiality of the President\u2019s Cabinet is inconclusive. The President\u2019s Cabinet cannot be deemed biased simply because the Board of Regents passed over Professor Morrisson for promotion. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we must assume therefore that the Acting President and vice presidents acted independently and properly in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">We decline to establish a <em>per se </em>rule that would disqualify administrative hearing bodies such as the President\u2019s Cabinet from hearing internal university matters solely for the reason that the members are employees' of the Board and because some of them participated in the initial investigation of the incident and initiation of the cause under consideration. See Federal Trade Comm\u2019n. v. Cement Institute, 333 U.S. 683, 702, 68 S.Ct. 793, 804, 92 L.Ed. 1010 (1948) (no denial of due process when commission expressed a view on the issue in advance of the case); French v. Bashful, 5 Cir., 1970, 425 F.2d 182, 184; Wasson v. Trowbridge, 2 Cir., 1967, 382 F.2d 807, 813; Jones v. State Bd. of Educ., M.D.Tenn., 1968, 279 F.Supp. 190, 200 (\u201climited combination by a school administrative body of prosecutorial and judicatory functions is not fundamentally unfair in the absence of a showing of other circumstances, such as malice or personal interest in the outcome of a case\u201d). Alleged prejudice of university hearing bodies must be based on more than mere speculation and tenuous inferences. As Judge Bell stated in his concurring opinion to Palmer v. Thompson, 5 Cir., 1970, 419 F.2d 1222, 1229, \u201cCourts, including federal courts, must travel on proof and there was a failure of proof in this case on the part of plaintiffs.\u201d We are satisfied that the record here clearly demonstrates that Mrs. Duke received procedural due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">\u201cIf no federal right has been violated in the procedures followed, then the court should next look to the record as developed before the academic agency to determine whether there was substantial evidence before the agency to support the action taken, with due care taken to judge the constitutionality of the school\u2019s action on the basis of the facts that were before the agency, and on the logic applied by it.\u201d Ferguson v. Thomas, 5 Cir., 1970, 430 F.2d 852, 858. A transcript was prepared of the testimony taken at the hearing before the President\u2019s Cabinet. This transcript, together with the record of the district court\u2019s hearing, shows that Mrs. Duke had been employed as a teaching assistant in the Department of English for the two academic years of 1967-68 and 1968-69. This position involved teaching English composition to freshmen students while she pursued a doctorate in English. During the Spring of 1970, she received an invitation from the English Department to teach for the academic year of 1970-71, which she accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">During the summer prior to the beginning of the 1970-71 academic year, the University scheduled a series of orientation sessions for incoming freshmen. These sessions lasted for two days and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>two nights each, during which the students lived in the dormitories. The University gave tours around the campus and provided peer and academic counselors to help explain what to expect from campus life; how to determine what they would select as a \u201cmajor\u201d; what courses in which to enroll; and numerous other matters. Parents were invited to meet with the counselors and with representatives of the administrative branches of the University, such as the Dean of Students. The last act of the orientation program was registration for the forthcoming term. The freshmen then left the campus to return when the regular academic year commenced. Associate Registrar John H. Brown testified before the Cabinet that the purpose of the orientation program was to help the students make the transition from high school to college in a manner which would least hurt the individual: \u201cThe student has a difficult time making a transition from high school to college in most cases, especially one as large as North Texas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The University scheduled freshmen orientation activities for July 30, 1970 and August 3, 1970, including a mixer dance on the evenings of those dates. A group of students decided to conduct their own \u201corientation\u201d program by holding \u201crock concerts\u201d and \u201crap sessions\u201d in a park located on the University\u2019s campus at the same time as the University\u2019s orientation activities. The concerts were announced in a leaflet<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mrs. Duke helped to prepare, and the leaflet was distributed by her and others. The leaflet was initially distributed at a fresh men orientation meeting in the auditorium of the Music Building. The group was asked to leave the building, and police were summoned. Subsequently, the leaflet was distributed on a sidewalk outside the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">On the evening of July 30, Mrs. Duke spoke during intermission of the concert announced in the leaflet. In her motion for a preliminary injunction she described the substance of her address as \u201ccaustically\u201d critical of the Board of Regents and administration of the University. Testimony indicates she additionally criticized the faculty, students, and American society in general. Mrs. Duke said in District Court that her comments were in the same tenor as an article she wrote for Denton\u2019s New World Press, February 17 \u2014 March 2, 1971, set out in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>A rock concert was also held on the evening of August 3, but was terminated by the University\u2019s security police, acting on instructions from Vice President <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>Lindley, because it was not properly sponsored. Mrs. Duke spoke after it was closed and gave another version of why it was closed down in a brief statement, the content of which is a matter of dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The evidence taken before the Cabinet showed that Mrs. Duke used profanity on both occasions. Exactly what she said was in dispute, and the testimony conflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Security Guard Fletcher testified before the Cabinet that on July 30 she spoke about different aspects of college life and used profane language over the loud speaker system. He was sure that Mrs. Duke referred to the Board of Regents as a \u201cstupid bunch of m-f-s\u201d and that she stated that the girls would be locked up in the dorms like a bunch of whores. Mrs. Duke and other students denied using such language. Another security guard testified that Mrs. Duke urged the girls to violate dorm regulations as to hours. Again, this was denied. Student Gary Don Bessire, called by Mrs. Duke, testified that \u201cShe used words that commonly are thought of, what do they say, as profanity,\u201d and that she used the word \u201cf-\u201d with reference \u201cto how the system f-s over the student, how the system f--s over us as people.\u201d She herself testified that while she didn\u2019t refer to the Board as a \u201cstupid bunch of m-f-s, she did say that the system as represented on the local level at the University \u201cf-s over\u201d people and talked about the Board of Regents as an example of people who have power on the local level.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-17\">\u201cFreedom of speech . [is] among the fundamental personal rights and liberties which are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action,\u201d Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303 U.S. 444, 450, 58 S.Ct. 666, <em>668, 82 L.Ed. 949 (1938), </em>and <em>the Fourteenth </em>Amendment protects the citizen against all the creatures of the state\u2014 universities not excepted. West Virginia Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 637, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 1185, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943). Neither teachers nor students may be compelled to relinquish First Amendment rights they would otherwise enjoy as ordinary citizens to comment on matters of public interests concerning the operation of public schools in which they work. Pickering v. Board of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1734, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). See also Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503, 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 736, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-20\">\u201cOur Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom, which is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the teachers concerned. That freedom is therefore a special concern of the First Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.\u201d Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 603, 87 S.Ct. 675, 683, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967). There is \u201cno room for the view that, because of the acknowledged need for order, First Amendment protections should apply with less force on college campuses than in the community at large,\u201d Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2346, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972), and \u201cnonrenewal of a nontenured public school teacher\u2019s one-year contract may not be predicated on his exercise of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights,\u201d Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 599, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2698, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-21\">\u201cWhen a violation of First Amendment rights is alleged, the reasons for dismissal or for nonrenewal of an employment contract must be examined to see if the reasons given are only a cloak for activity or attitudes protected by the Constitution.\u201d Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 582, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2711, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972) (Justice Douglas dissenting). But \u201cFirst <em>Amendment </em>rights must always be applied \u2018in light of the special circumstances of the . . . environment\u2019 [Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503, 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 736, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969)] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>in the particular case,\u201d Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2345, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972), and \u201c[t]he constitutionally protected right of a public schoolteacher to criticize the school administration and to comment on matters of public concern is a limited right, a right which must be balanced against the need for orderly school administration. . . . Whether the activities of the school employee are protected under the First Amendment depends upon a weighing of the asserted interests.\u201d Moore v. Winfield City Bd. of Educ., 5 Cir., 1971, 452 F.2d 726, 728. A balance must be struck \u201cbetween the interests of the teacher as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\u201d Pickering v. Board of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1735, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). As Judge Clark noted in <em>Ferguson, </em>\u201cThe college had no right to control [Ferguson\u2019s] speech or to curtail his freedom of association, but they did have a right to terminate his employment as a classroom instructor at the point where the exercise of his constitutional privileges clearly over-balanced his usefulness as an instructor.\u201d Ferguson v. Thomas, 5 Cir., 1970, 430 F.2d 852, 859. See also Fluker v. Alabama State Bd. of Educ., 5 Cir., 1971, 441 F.2d 201, 207; Pred v. Board of Public Instruction of Dade County, Fla., 5 Cir., 1969, 415 F.2d 851, 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">To effectuate the balancing of these competing interests, established by <em>Pickering, </em>this Court in <em>Ferguson, supra, </em>430 F.2d at 859, said that fact findings by academic agencies, \u201cwhen reached by correct procedures and supported by substantial evidence, are entitled to great weight, and the court should never lightly substitute its judgment for that of the board.\u201d \u201cThat courts should not interfere with the day-to-day operations of schools is a platitudinous but eminently sound maxim which this court has reaffirmed on many occasions.\u201d Shanley v. Northeast Ind. School Dist., 5 Cir., 1972, 462 F.2d 960. Courts are not equipped by either training or experience to select initially the faculty and staff for colleges and universities, and to enjoin a university to hire or rehire a member of its faculty goes beyond mere redress of constitutional rights of an individual. We \u201cshould interfere only where there is a clear case of constitutional infringement.\u201d Esteban v. Central Missouri State College, 8 Cir., 1969, 415 F.2d 1077, 1090 (per then Judge, .now Justice Blackmun).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">The District Court here rejected each of the three numbered reasons given by the President\u2019s Cabinet for withdrawing the offer of employment. See pages 832-833 <em>supra. </em>With regard to reason number two, i. e., that Mrs. Duke\u2019s actions and statements demonstrated a lack of academic responsibility, the trial judge held that \u201cthe dismissal of plaintiff on the basis of the substantive content of the speeches would be to seriously violate her right of freedom of speech\u201d; he added that the Constitution protected her use of profanity here, because \u201c[t]o prohibit particular words substantially increases the risk that ideas will also be suppressed in the process.\u201d While the District Court did not specifically allude to the University\u2019s conclusion, which was couched in the language of <em>Ferguson, supra, </em>430 F.2d at 859, that \u201cMrs. Elizabeth Duke has exercised her rights of speech and association in a manner and to an extent such as to seriously impair, if not destroy, her effectiveness as an instructor in the organized academic program at North Texas State University,\u201d the Court did conclude that \u201call the evidence tends to establish that plaintiff was a competent teacher,\u201d and that the University did not \u201cproduce any persuasive evidence concerning the scope of its interests or concerning the manner in which its interests had been infringed.\u201d To take advantage of Pickering v. Board of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 569, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1735, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). Mrs. Duke argued that her statements were not directed toward any person with whom ap-pellee would be in contact in the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>of her daily work as a teacher. The District Court agreed that Mrs. Duke \u201cdid not occupy a position requiring a close working relationship with any of those she criticized.\u201d The Court\u2019s fact finding on reason number two is not supported by the record for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Professor Howard A. Key testified before the Cabinet that he supervised Mrs. Duke\u2019s preparation for her master\u2019s thesis and had her in classes. He said she was an excellent student and recommended her to the selection committee as an instructor of English. However, Key testified that he would not recommend Mrs. Duke as a teaching fellow in the English Department following the incidents of July 30 and August 3. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-6\">\u201cI would say that if she knew she were talking to students and used language of this kind that she was lowering the dignity of the teaching profession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-7\">\u201cWell, I think it shows a lack of judgment to use four letter words to any group of people, I don\u2019t care what, for a teacher to do that, I don\u2019t care what their level of communication is. I think it is not the place of a teacher to try to get down on the lowest level of the lowest student and use the lowest kind of words he can find to communicate with that student. I think it is up to the teacher, to set an example in the use of language and I think that a teacher who does not realize that and will not do it should not teach.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">Key, a teacher since 1947, said that whether a student could respect a teacher who used language of the kind in question depended almost entirely on the student and his background, but that a majority of students would be \u201caffected, possibly adversely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Professor Clifton, Chairman of the English Department, testified: \u201cWell, I could not conceive of myself as having used language reputedly used by the Plaintiff, and would have considered myself ill fit for my profession.\u201d Professor Hall of the English Department testified in District Court that Mrs. Duke spoke with him and said she had used obscene language at a speech on a previous occasion. Hall testified that he considered Mrs. Duke\u2019s statements to east an adverse reflection on him as a faculty member and that it was \u201cirresponsible, unwise and unreasonable behavior, which I think reflects on all teachers at North Texas.\u201d After reviewing the leaflet prepared by Mrs. Duke, see n. 5 <em>supra </em>(setting out the leaflet), he testified that he did not think that it was in keeping with the responsibilities of a member of the teaching staff at North Texas to engage and participate in the preparation and distribution of the leaflet to a group of prospective students. He believed that Mrs. Duke\u2019s action \u201cexhibits a complete lack of common sense and judgment, showing what seems to me, as nearly as I am able and qualified to judge, a complete metamorphosis in character. . . . \u201d President Carter, who testified in District Court, particularly objected to the leaflet being handed out to freshmen during orientation, whose parents were on campus with them, because he thought, it maligned his faculty and made comments that were not true, such as the definition of \u201cwhore\u201d as \u201cselling your soul for a grade or degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">The District Court concluded that \u201c[n] either in the Cabinet hearing nor in the hearing before this court did the University produce any persuasive evidence concerning the scope of its interests or concerning the manner in which its interests had been infringed.\u201d The fallacy of this conclusion is apparent since it is evident that the interests the University sought to protect were to maintain a competent faculty and to perpetuate public confidence in the educational institution. That these interests of the University were infringed was made clear from the testimony from Professors Clifton and Hall, outlined above concerning the loss of respect for Mrs. Duke among the faculty and students, and in view of the testimony by Acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>President Carter about the adverse publicity in the newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Because reason two is adequate to support the Cabinet\u2019s withdrawal of the offer, we need not dwell on the Cabinet\u2019s first and third reasons. We note that the District Judge declared the University\u2019s rules on the use of university facilities to be unconstitutional. In our view this holding was erroneous and unnecessary to the decision in this case; further, plaintiff did not plead uneonsti-tutionality nor did defendants therefore have an opportunity to rebut the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">We should be mindful of the admonition of Chief Justice Burger: \u201cThe relatively placid life of the college campus of the past has not prepared either the administrators or students for their respective responsibilities in maintaining an atmosphere in which divergent views can be asserted vigorously, 'but civilly, to the end that those who seek to be heard accord the same right to all others.\u201d Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 195, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2353 (1972) (concurring). See also Rosenfeld v. New Jersey, 408 U.S. 901, 92 S.Ct. 2479, 33 L.Ed.2d 321 (1972) (Justice Powell dissenting); Rosenfeld v. New Jersey, 408 U.S. 901, 92 S.Ct. 2483, 33 L.Ed.2d 321 (1972) (Chief Justice Burger dissenting). As a past and prospective instructor, Mrs. Duke owed the University a minimal duty of loyalty and civility to refrain from extremely disrespectful and grossly offensive remarks aimed at the administrators of the University. By her breach of this duty, the interests of the University outweighed her claim for protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The dissent herein contains several errors and unsupported conclusions to which we believe a response is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">It is contended in the dissent that the question of the competency of the President\u2019s Cabinet to hear Mrs. Duke\u2019s case has not been directly considered by the majority opinion; that the opinion errs in failing to hold that the Board of Regents likewise was disqualified from reviewing Mrs. Duke\u2019s appeal from the President\u2019s Cabinet. The dissent, therefore, appears to be grounded on alleged lack of procedural due process by the University. Consideration of the merits and reasons for Mrs. Duke\u2019s dismissal is totally ignored \u2014 in fact, not even reached in the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">It can hardly be said that the majority opinion does not consider the competency of the President\u2019s Cabinet to try Mrs. Duke\u2019s case. As has been pointed out in this opinion, we decline to establish a rule that would <em>per se </em>disqualify the President\u2019s Cabinet composed of the President and two Vice Presidents of the University, from conducting a hearing pertaining to the dismissal of one of its employees, a part-time teacher, merely because the teacher involved has made a broadside attack on the administration of the University, though in terms which are to say the least, vulgar and profane. This is especially true when the record fails to disclose actual bias or prejudice against Mrs. Duke on the part of any member of the President\u2019s Cabinet, and likewise of any member of the Board of Regents. The offending statements of Mrs. Duke were directed against the University administration in general, not against particular members thereof. She publicly expressed her remarks, threatened confidence in the institution and displayed her incompetence by the words she used. To get attention she used the Board of Regents as scapegoats though she did not single out any member of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">The dissent cites Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, 400 U.S. 455, 91 S.Ct. 499, 27 L.Ed.2d 532 (1971), where the Supreme Court held that a trial judge could not adjudicate and punish contempt by a contemnor who had in his presence in open court called him a \u201cdirty sonofabitch\u201d and a \u201cdirty tyrannical old dog,\u201d as well as other strong epithets. The distinction between this case and <em>May-berry </em>is immediately apparent. The judge himself was the object of a personal attack during a judicial proceeding and was obviously disqualified. But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>dissent builds from the <em>Pickering </em>footnote cited in <em>Ferguson, supra, </em>its own ipse dixit that no University administrator, Cabinet or Board may try a teacher in a dismissal proceeding, if the offending statements by the teacher include an attack on the University administration and its Board. This would make it too easy for a teacher to disqualify University authorities from controlling personnel in the University. Under Texas law the Board of Regents is charged with the duty of controlling and managing the University. Vernon\u2019s Ann.Rev.Civ.Stat. of Texas art. 2651a, \u00a7 2 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Though the dissent states that under Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972), recently decided, the University did not owe Mrs. Duke a hearing, it nevertheless contends that since she was accorded one, procedural due process was lacking because the hearing was before the wrong tribunal, that instead of being accorded a hearing by the President\u2019s Cabinet she should have had a hearing by the University Tenure Committee, composed of members of the faculty of the University. We find this reasoning difficult to follow. It has never been established that Mrs. Duke, a teaching assistant, was a member of the faculty. She was employed only for one year, part-time, and obviously had no tenure as the dissent concedes. The suspicion which the dissent attempts to place upon the President\u2019s Cabinet as an ad hoc tribunal for the hearing of Mrs. Duke\u2019s case, is unwarranted and not supported by the record. It is true that members of the President\u2019s Cabinet, at the request of the Board, investigated the facts and dismissed Mrs. Duke. But the Board of Regents instructed University authorities to dismiss Mrs. Duke only if an investigation of the facts showed that this course of action was necessary and proper under the circumstances. Mrs. Duke did not at any time during the administrative proceedings object to the hearing being held by the President\u2019s Cabinet or about review of her appeal being made by the Board of Regents, nor did she contend that the Cabinet and Board were incompetent to try her by virtue of bias or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">The dissent takes exception to the circulation by President Carter to the Board of Regents, prior to their review of the transcript of the hearing, of an extract from an issue of \u201cDenton\u2019s New World Press\u201d containing an article admittedly written by Mrs. Duke in which she again attacked the University administration and Board. The material in Mrs. Duke\u2019s article was intended for public consumption and was actually published. It did not introduce any new element in the ease but corroborated testimony already given at the hearing as to Mrs. Duke\u2019s public statements about the Board. In her testimony in the trial court Mrs. Duke confirmed that the overall tenor of the article was the same as that in her earlier speeches which formed the basis for her dismissal. This is confirmed by an examination of the text of the article. (See footnote 6 ante.) We see no impropriety in President Carter sending copies of Mrs. Duke\u2019s article to members of the Board. The Board does not function like a court. Whereas a judge sits in a case, an administrator works on a case. See W. Gelhorn and C. Byse, Administrative Law Cases and Comments, p. 876 (1960). The Board should no more be disqualified here because it received the article from President Carter which appeared in the \u201cDen-ton\u2019s New World Press\u201d than if they read it in a daily newspaper. Careful consideration of the reasons set forth in the dissent reenforces our own view that reversal of the District Court decision in this case is required by both the law and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\">.

Duke Tries Regents</p>\n<p id=\"b915-23\">After stalling for four months, the Board of Regents has finally scheduled my hearing for the last week in February. I was fired from my job as teaching assistant at NTSU in September for \u201cobscene language\u201d and \u201cimproper conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AdRF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>I would like to use the occasion of my hearing to place the Board of Regents on trial before the people. This board is composed of nine memb\u2019ers \u2014 all white, all men, all rich. The average annual income of regents and trustees is $41,000 not including assets. This places them in the top % of 1 per cent of all people in the U. S. These men \u2014 directors of banks, insurance companies, investment companies, and other corporations \u2014 are members of the ruling class, the class which is responsible for the exploitation of poor and colored peoples all over the world. The regents run the university as they and their class run the world\u2014 to maintain their own vested interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">In the first place, they run the university as a training center for forces who will keep the nation\u2019s economy running smoothly. The university not only supplies a force of people for building the empire but for defending it. The armed forces, which protect the business interests of the ruling class in Viet Nam, Laos, Cambodia, and all over the world, could not survive without the junior officers and career military personnel supplied by the ROTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">The - university also perpetuates a competitive, class society. Students are forced to step on each other to make it to the top, and students are brainwashed with the idea that they are superior to working class people and to black and brown people who do not attend the university.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">The university also institutionalizes racism. Black, brown, red, and yellow people do not have proportional representation on the faculty and administration. The gifts of the history and culture of colored peoples are not emphasized. It is more difficult for a black person than a white person to enter the university because of screening devices which are geared to the type of education received primarily by white middle class people.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">The university functions as a reinforeer of sexist attitudes. Women are led to believe that they are not as capable of making decisions as men are. Someone else decides for them where they will live and what time they have to come in. This type of brainwashing prepares them to live the life of a housewife who makes no important decisions about shaping the world. She provides her husband with sex and cheap labor, and she fills the role of consumer of unnecessary goods. Women attend a university which is run by males who benefit economically and psychologically from maintaining a male-supremacist society.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">The university teaches people to fear revolutionary change and to maintain the status-quo. Those who allow themselves to be brainwashed in this way are soon to become fossils of history.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">The regents are indeed guilty of immoral acts. They are criminals, and their crimes are far more serious than motherfucking. They insist on maintaining an imperialistic, militaristic, racist, sexist system which causes % of the people to go to bed hungry every night. The Board of Regents turns students at NTSU into robots, like themselves, whose fate is to become managers of a system which is already doomed to extinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">These criminals find it necessary to engage in severe repression when their system is threatened. I was fired because I am part of an emerging movement which endangers the established way of life of the regents. Those in power became even more repressive when they were confronted by 1,000 students on the steps of the administration building on September 23. The administrators were so frightened that they sought to control us by calling in the Denton police \u2014 fully equipped with guns. They taught us a lesson all right. They taught us that political power comes out of the barrel of a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">The repression will increase as we become more effective. What can we do in the face of it? Well, for one thing we can stop playing their game. We have to stop begging for freedom, asking for favors, shaking an angry fist, reacting against their moves, asking them to change the system. We have to take power. Huey P. Newton says that \u201cpower is the ability to define phenomena and make them act in the desired manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">We have already begun to define ourselves and the world we live in. We know that we are fucked over, yet we are not victims. We affirm life! We want to live! We know that we are all one and that we are responsible for the entire universe. We know that we must create a free society in which all of the people will share the resources, power, and wisdom. We know that we will defend what we create.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">Live the revolution!</p>\n<p id=\"b916-17\">All power to the people!</p>\n<p id=\"b916-18\">\u25a0 \u2014 Betty Anne Duke</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b921-10\">GODBOLD, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AHO_\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">The District Court made a specific finding of fact, supported by a large body of evidence, that the President\u2019s Cabinet did not possess the \u201capparent impartiality\u201d toward the charges which Ferguson v. Thomas, 430 F.2d 852, 856 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>(5th Cir. 1970), requires of an administrative hearing tribunal. This requirement is but a way of pointing out that to be qualified to hear the case the designated hearing body must be detached from the core of the controversy. The statement in <em>Ferguson </em>was based expressly upon a dictum of the Supreme Court in Pickering v. Board of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 578 n. 2, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1740, 20 L.Ed.2d 811, 823 n. 2 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGDn\">In the present case the trier of fact was the same body that was also both the victim of appellant\u2019s statements and the prosecutor that brought the charges aimed at securing his dismissal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">In this case our concern is with competence to sit, and not whether the body acted in a partial manner in the conduct of its business or in its decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">My brothers hold the actions of the President\u2019s Cabinet valid on the sole basis (ground 2) of appellant\u2019s actions and statements at the meetings of July 30 and August 3. In so doing they do not directly address themselves to the matter of the competency of the President\u2019s Cabinet to hear her case. Rather they explicitly assume that the Cabinet <em>acted </em>impartially and conclude that the plaintiff failed to produce evidence of <em>actual </em>partiality sufficient to override that assumption. If they mean that as a factual matter the President\u2019s Cabinet was sufficiently removed from the controversy that it was competent to conduct the hearing, they fail to comply with Rule 52, Fed.R.Civ.P., which protects findings of fact made by the district judge unless plainly erroneous, and, in addition, they simply ignore the evidence. If they mean that the decision of an administrative body not qualified to sit because of its connection with the controversy is valid unless it can be proved that it <em>acted </em>in a partial manner, they employ a erroneous legal standard. The District Judge recognized the necessity of the hearing body\u2019s detachment from the subject matter, and found it to be lacking. That decision should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">The majority opinion appears to me incorrect for another reason as well. Under the correct legal standard the Board of Regents, which exercised administrative appellate review, did not meet the qualifications required of an administrative body participating in consideration of plaintiff\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\"><em>Ferguson </em>sets out in simple and brief language a set of guiding principles for institutional hearings. In the phrase \u201capparent impartiality\u201d the key word \u201capparent\u201d is not a mere gratuitous redundancy. It is used advisedly as a warning to the administrative body and those who designate it that, at the threshold, they must be alert to determine whether the tribunal is competent. Judicial bodies have the benefit of established principles and traditions, and knowledge of their proper application, to guide them in situations where they have interests adverse to the litigants and must determine whether disqualification may be required or recusal appropriate. The usual institutional hearing body will possess neither these traditional criteria nor specialized knowledge of their applicability. Also judicial bodies have the advantages of history, of established status and the trappings of office which, in addition to their decisions, assist them in creating their own image and aura and engendering public confidence in and respect for what they do. The institutional hearing body within a university lacks these collateral means for creating the confidence and support of those who are to utilize it. The viable institutional remedy must present a recognizable face of justice as well as dispense the fact of justice \u2014 what the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>trict Judge in this ease described as \u201cthe atmosphere of impartiality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The lash of Mrs. Duke\u2019s crude and offensive remarks was directed in general at the university administration (as distinguished from faculty and students)\u2014 \u201ccaustically critical\u201d as the majority note \u2014 and in particular at the Board of Regents. The responsive action of which she complains came at the direction of the Regents and with the concurrence of the administration. I do not imply that either administrators or Regents were not high minded and honorable people. But it simply will not do that the speaker whose words have flayed, and who has been penalized for what she has said, is to have her objections to the penalty, and her appeal therefrom, at the hands of the persons who are her victims, accusers, investigators, prosecutors, and authors of the penalty as well. This is not judicial ivory towerism but common sense and everyday fairness in relationships between human beings.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Disqualification of the victim of verbal abuse to try his assailant is an established principle. Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, 400 U.S. 455, 91 S.Ct. 499, 27 L.Ed.2d 532 (1971), requires that a trial judge reviled by a contemnor must, if he waits until the trial\u2019s end to mete out contempt punishment, defer to another judge. In <em>Mayberry, </em>the trial judge had been called a \u201cdirty sonofabitch,\u201d a \u201cdirty tyrannical old dog\u201d and other strong epithets. The Court concluded that \u201c[n]o one so cruelly slandered is likely to maintain that calm detachment necessary for fair adjudication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465, 91 S.Ct. 505, 27 L.Ed.2d at 540.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">In early August 1970, having just become Acting President of North Texas State University, Mr. John Carter learned of Mrs. Duke\u2019s actions of July 30 and August 3 and directed that an investigation be made. He reported the results of the investigation to a meeting of the Board of Regents on August 19, and the Regents instructed him to conduct additional investigation and to satisfy himself whether what appeared to be the facts was true, and if so to \u201cdismiss\u201d her. President Carter investigated further and on August 25 wrote Mrs. Duke that at the direction of the Board of Regents the offer previously made to her to serve as part-time instructor was withdrawn. The letter proffered her a right to appeal by requesting within three days a hearing before the President\u2019s Cabinet, which consisted of President Carter and his three Vice-Presidents, Lindsley, Spurlock and Rogers. On August 27 Mrs. Duke accepted the offer of appellate review procedures. The hearing before the Cabinet was scheduled for September 23, and Mrs. Duke was notified that the University would be represented by an Assistant Attorney General of the State of Texas. The hearing took place as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">These specific points must be cata-logued :</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">(1) It is not clear who made the decision that the President\u2019s Cabinet be the hearing body. But it is revealed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>President Carter, who had been with the university 16 years, that he had never before heard of the procedure employed in this case being used with reference to any teacher or teaching assistant nor had he ever heard of the Board of Regents, which he considered to be a hiring and not a firing body, dismissing any faculty member. The procedure employed in this case was an <em>ad hoc </em>procedure which by-passed administrative machinery established for handling cases such as this one (if not this very one). By approval of the faculty, the President and the Board of Regents, the university previously' had adopted and had in force a detailed \u201cStatement on Academic Freedom, Faculty Responsibility and Tenure of the Faculty, Administration and Board of Regents,\u201d based upon a similar document adopted by the Coordinating Board of the Texas Colleges and University System. This document prescribes administrative procedures for faculty dismissals where reason arises to question the fitness of a faculty member, that encompass several steps. They begin with a conference with the department head, followed by an inquiry by a tenure committee of the department. If the faculty member desires a hearing, it is conducted by the University Tenure Committee under prescribed standards for right to counsel, examination of witnesses, and other rights of procedural due process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Review of the decision of the University Tenure Committee is by the Board of Regents, who, if they do not sustain the Committee\u2019s decision, are required to return the case to the Committee for reconsideration and if necessary further evidence, and only after that reconsideration can the Regents overrule the Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Since Mrs. Duke was without tenure, and her appointment for the preceding term had expired, the university proceeded on the basis that the procedure prescribed by the \u201cStatement on Academic Freedom\u201d did not govern her case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While the District Court did not need to reach the point, it is not clear that the university\u2019s assumption was even correct. By its terms <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the statement appears to be applicable under some circumstances to a teacher without tenure, whose appointment has expired, and whose contract is not renewed. This was precisely the situation of Mrs. Duke. However, whether Mrs. Duke fell within or without the formalized procedures is not determinative. The purposes of a hearing, and, if offered, and held, the necessity for its complying with pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>cedural due process, are the same whether the teacher has contractual status or, like Mrs. Duke, lacks that status. Contractual status goes to entitlement to a hearing, but once entitlement exists, whether by operation of law or by grace, the differences are at an end. Thus, even if the university was not required to adhere to the \u201cStatement,\u201d it was a source of suspicion from the beginning that with an established procedure available in which the faculty participated, the administration chose instead to follow an <em>ad hoc </em>procedural scheme never before employed that excluded faculty and placed the ease in the hands of administrators. It was this exclusion of the faculty rather than any contention that the \u201cStatement\u201d governed which, from the beginning, caused the university\u2019s chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) to take the position that procedural due process was not being employed. Summarizing, I do not say that the hearing was <em>required </em>to be before the Tenure Committee. I do say, first, that there is a serious question of whether the university was correct in assuming that the hearing was <em>not required </em>to be before the Tenure Committee; and, second, even if the assumption was correct, the decision to bypass the available and approved hearing system in favor of an <em>ad hoc </em>procedure never before employed and wholly excluding faculty participation, contributed to the lack of the essential apparent impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">(2) Mrs. Duke conferred with the local chapter of AAUP, which appointed a committee of university faculty members chaired by Dr. Clovis Morrisson, a lawyer, a former practicing attorney, member of the political science department, and faculty advisor to pre-law students. At no time did the AAUP Committee take a position on the merits of Mrs. Duke\u2019s case or approve of her views or her language, but dealt with only the procedures under which the case should be handled.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The AAUP Committee requested of Dr. Carter that the hearing body be the Tenure Committee rather than the Cabinet. Carter agreed to, and did, relay that request to the Chairman of the Board of Regents. It was rejected. No explanation was then offered other than the fact that Mrs. Duke lacked tenure (and was between appointments). In the District Court an additional explanation was offered, that the date, physical arrangements and court reporter for a hearing already were arranged for.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">(3) The AAUP Committee then asked to be allowed merely to attend the hearing. This too was denied. No reason was then or is now given for excluding from the hearing local faculty members representing the established and traditional organization of the university teaching profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">In this case one need not speculate about the absence of apparent impartiality. The position of AAUP that the Cabinet was the wrong tribunal, that the Tenure Committee was an appropriate tribunal, that in no event should the hearing be before a group composed solely of administrators and from which faculty members were excluded, and that the hearing should not be closed, is the \u201cproof of the pudding.\u201d Drawn from the class to whom the \u201cappearance\u201d of impartiality was directed, and by virtue of their committee membership having their attention sharply focused on the situation, this committee was unable to perceive \u201capparentness\u201d to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">(4) As already pointed out, the Cabinet consisted of Acting President Carter and Vice-Presidents Lindsley, Spurlock and Rogers. In early August, Carter had instructed Lindsley to investigate the actions of Mrs. Duke which are the subject of this suit, and Lindsley had done so. Spurlock also had taken some part in the investigation. When President Carter reported the results of the investigation to the meeting of the Regents, Lindsley and Spurlock were pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>ent. The Regents did not unequivocally direct President Carter to withdraw the offer to Mrs. Duke. Rather they instructed him to investigate further the \u201cfacts\u201d as reported to them and to satisfy himself whether they were \u201ctrue facts,\u201d and, if they were, then to \u201cdismiss\u201d her. President Carter made further investigation, satisfied himself, and on August 25 took action as he had been directed. A month later he sat as senior and presiding member of the hearing body which, on conflicting testimony, decided the same general issues as those previously submitted to him for one-man decision and then determined by him to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">(5) Following the hearing before the Cabinet, proposed findings were prepared by the Assistant Attorney General serving as counsel for the university and forwarded to Mr. Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">(6) On October 30, five weeks after the hearing, no decision having been handed down, Mrs. Duke\u2019s counsel wrote the President, asking a prompt decision. The Cabinet released its decision November 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">(7) Mrs. Duke noted an appeal to the Board of Regents on November 11 and requested a prompt decision. On January 12, after waiting two months for a hearing to be scheduled, her counsel again asked a prompt hearing/ On January 23 the Regents for the first time proposed a hearing date, in late February. The hearing eventually took place on February 26, and purportedly consisted of a review of the transcript of the Cabinet hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On March 1 the Regents upheld the Cabinet decision. Thus an institutional remedy, one of whose purposes is prompt amelioration or decision within the university community of strains and conflicts, had consumed from beginning to final decision more than six months. During that time Mrs. Duke, a divorced woman with two small children and nominal income, was without employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">(8) One of the most disturbing aspects of this case is what I now discuss. Mrs. Duke was notified that the appeal before the Regents would consist of a review of the transcript and that there would be no evidence or witnesses. But, on February 19, by letters marked \u201cPersonal and Confidential,\u201d President Carter mailed to each member of the Board of Regents an extract from the February 17-March 2 issue of \u201cDenton\u2019s New World Press,\u201d purporting to be an article written by Mrs. Duke. It appears as footnote 6 of the majority opinion. The article attacks the university administration in general. More specifically, it bitterly assails the Regents for \u201cstalling\u201d in Mrs. Duke\u2019s case. It describes them as \u201call white, all men, all rich,\u201d and accuses them of \u201crun[ning] the university as they and their class run the world.\u201d Most significantly, the article says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-10\">The regents are indeed guilty of immoral acts. They are criminals and their crimes are far more serious than m_ f__They insist on maintaining an imperialistic, militaristic, racist, sexist system which causes % of the people to go to bed hungry every night. The Board of Regents turns students at NTSU into robots, like themselves, whose fate is to become managers of a system which is already doomed to extinction. These criminals find it necessary to engage in severe repression when their system is threatened ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">It was egregiously wrong that, within two or three days of the hearing at which the Regents were to consider the appeal, they should be, ex parte and without notice to or knowledge of the appellant, furnished this inflammatory document that had been published months after the Cabinet hearing. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>asks too much of the Regents, in reviewing a record in which there was a conflict in testimony as to what Mrs. Duke had said of them and of the university administration in general, that they should be able to divorce what the record said and what the article said, or that they maintain requisite impartiality in the face of the remarks directed at them in the article. Though the judicial mind is trained to be more nearly capable of straining out what should not be considered, no panel of this court would sit in judgment in like circumstances. Certainly we would not entertain being privately furnished with such a document. This is not to say that institutional hearing bodies are expected to perform with the same carefully attuned responses as do courts. The point is that what happened demonstrates the necessity of separating those who were the victims of Mrs. Duke\u2019s remarks from the function of trying and reviewing her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">(9) The plaintiff contends that the Regents took punitive action against Dr. Morrisson because of his participation in Mrs. Duke\u2019s case, thereby demonstrating that the Cabinet, as a subordinate body, and President Carter, could not act free of domination or fear of \u2019'reprisal. The same point goes, of course, to the issue of the Board\u2019s disqualification to act as reviewing body. The conclusion of my brothers that the Cabinet cannot be deemed biased because the Board of Regents passed over Dr. Morrisson for promotion misses the point that the Regents too were required to be free of actual bias and possessed of apparent impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">In addition to his actions already described, Dr. Morrisson had an audience with the Chairman of the Regents in mid-October. In February, having learned that the Regents would conduct their hearing later that month, he wrote the Chairman expressing ACLU\u2019s continuing interest in the due process aspects of her ease but stating it would not ask that a representative attend. On April 2, after the Regents had upheld the Cabinet, he made a formal report of the Committee to the AAUP chapter of the university, sending a copy to President Carter. It stated that a serious breach of academic due process had occurred and that exclusion of the faculty from the matter had not been justified. On April 7 Dr. Carter sent a copy of the report to each Regent and suggested it be discussed at the next meeting. The April 2 report and other correspondence, requests and reports of the Morrisson Committee are in the record. They are models of discretion, courtesy and deference. They are dignified, reasonable and restrained in tone and in no way offensive or inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Less than a month later the Regents passed over Dr. Morrisson for promotion from Associate Professor to full professor. Dr. Morrisson testified in the District Court that the promotion was recommended by his department, his dean and in some fashion at least by the Academic Vice-President but \u201cwas denied by the Board of Regents for reasons which, according to Acting President Carter, bore in part a direct relation to this case and my activities in it.\u201d President Carter testified at the trial in this case. Dr. Morrisson\u2019s testimony stands unrefuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">The evidence reveals that after the Regents declined promotion to Dr. Mor-risson, he met with President Carter. At Carter\u2019s suggestion he submitted specific written comment upon certain of his activities of the past year. Two of the matters upon which comment was suggested, and given, were Dr. Morrison\u2019s appearances in federal and state courts, under subpoena, as a witness in proceedings involving Mrs. Duke, and his identification with the AAUP Committee report of April 2. It is hardly reasonable to suppose that his comments upon these matters would have been invited had they had not been factors in the decision of the Regents to deny him promotion. Dr. Morrisson\u2019s comments are somewhat tangential. But they are like a breath of fresh air in this complex of responsibilities misunderstood by both sides, and they deserve repetition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>3.

At no time did we express agreement with Mrs. Duke\u2019s views on society or her actions. You asked me during our initial discussion of this case, in September, if I endorsed Mrs. Duke\u2019s views, as expressed in her speeches. I told you then that I did not, I testified in Judge Scofield\u2019s court that I did not, and I tell you here again that I do not. I only support her right to have those views and to have what AAUP clearly considers a fair hearing to determine if her expression of those views had prejudiced her continued effectiveness in the classroom. That position of AAUP is a national one, it has been carefully worked out by the organization, and AAUP\u2019s 1940 Statement on Academic Freedom has been endorsed by virtually every organization having anything to do with higher education.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-7\">* * X X X X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-8\">Thank you again, John, for our discussion of yesterday, and for agreeing to consider asking the Regents to reconsider their decision.

The District Court, because it found the President\u2019s Cabinet disqualified as a hearing tribunal, did not need to consider the disqualification of the Board of Regents as reviewing body. In this court the majority, having rejected the decision as to the Cabinet, do not mention the patent disqualification of the Board of Regents to sit in appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b923-7\">. The citation in <em>Ferguson </em>of the <em>Pickering </em>footnote implies that an apparently impartial tribunal is at least one that has not been the subject of the statements by the dismissed teacher giving rise to the punitive action that is in question. AVhether that would be so in every instance we need not decide \u2014 the issue for us is whether the administration and the Board of Regents of this particular university had been \u201cso cruelly slandered [as to be] likely to maintain that calm detachment necessary for fair adjudication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">In Woodbury v. McKinnon, 447 F.2d 839 (5th Cir. 1971), we held that a hospital medical staff which stripped a physician of his surgical privileges was not disqualified to consider his qualifications merely because it had considered them on a previous occasion. In Fluker v. Alabama State Bd. of Educ., 441 F.2d 201 (5th Cir. 1971), nontenured teachers whose contracts were not renewed were granted hearings before the university\u2019s Advisory Committee on Faculty Personnel, composed of three professors elected by the faculty to consider faculty grievances. We did not reach the contention that the hearing body was not properly constituted because nontenured teachers were excluded from it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b924-4\">. The composition of the University Tenure Committee is not stated.

Under Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972), decided while this appeal has been pending, and changing the rule in the Fifth Circuit, the university would not have been required to give Mrs. Duke a hearing. This does not, however, dispose of the issue of whether, having offered her a hearing and appeal as parts of its administrative procedures for handling her claim, requirements of due process were met in the administrative process at both levels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b924-6\">.

If he <em>has </em>tenure or an unexpired appointment extending beyond the period of the proposed dismissal, the burden of proof is upon The Administration to show adequate cause why he should be dismissed.
