The bonds were executed by Ramirez, a bail bondsman, on behalf of Resolute Insurance Co., the surety. These cases arise out of the bond forfeitures. The appeals of Eskew and Resolute were pursued, and will be discussed, separately. We affirm each judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">I. The Eskew Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Eskew asserts that under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(c) the trial judge erred by failing to inform him that his nonappearance would result in forfeiture of his bail. Eskew\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 3146(e) is misplaced. Section 3146(c), which requires a judicial officer to inform a person of the penalties for violation of the conditions of release, \u201crefer[s] to special conditions authorized by [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3146(a) such as placing restrictions with respect to travel, association, custody and supervision.\u201d United States v. DePugh, 434 F.2d 548, 552 (8th Cir. 1970), cert. denied 401 U.S. 978, 91 S.Ct. 1208, 28 L.Ed.2d 328 (1971).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Eskew next asserts that the trial judge improperly decided the question whether his absence was willful. This contention was previously considered and rejected in the direct appeal of Eskew\u2019s criminal convictions, United States v. Eskew, 460 F.2d 1028 (9th Cir. 1972). We decline to reconsider that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">II. The Resolute Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">To meet the $15,000.00 bail set for Eskew\u2019s release, Ramirez, the bail bondsman, executed two separate court appearance bonds totaling $15,000.00 and presented them to the Clerk of the District Court on December 5, 1969. Bail power of attorney \u201cZ No. 48381,\u201d which limited Ramirez\u2019s authority to $12,-500.00, was attached to a bond for $12,-500.00. This power was executed by Resolute on November 11, 1968 and was to expire \u201cunless used before December 31, 1969.\u201d A separate bail power of attorney \u201cZ No. 63938,\u201d which limited Ramirez\u2019s authority to $6,600.00, was attached to a second bond for $2,500.00. This power was executed by Resolute on June 23, 1969 and was to expire \u201cunless used before June 30, 1970.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">Resolute says that Ramirez\u2019s actual authority was limited to $12,500.00 and asks that \u201cso much of the judgment [of forfeiture] * * * as exceeds $12,-500.00 be reversed.\u201d To support its position, Resolute argues that \u201cthe language of limitation [of authority] contained in the power of attorney was sufficient to create a duty of inquiry on the part of the clerk of the Court * * * to ascertain the true extent of the bondsman\u2019s authority.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">Two separate and distinct powers of attorney \u2014 each valid on its face \u2014 were presented by Ramirez to the clerk. Each power stated: \u201cSeparate power-of-attorney must be attached to each bond executed.\u201d Neither power of attorney said that it could not be used in combination with another separate and distinct power executed by Resolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-18\">The terms of the two separate, distinct, and valid powers were not sufficient to alert the clerk that the bondsman might be exceeding his authority. The clerk\u2019s belief in Ramirez\u2019s authority to execute two separate bonds totaling $15,000.00 was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-19\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\">. Eskew does not contend that lie did not have actual notice that his failure to appear would result in forfeiture of his bail bonds. It is clear from the appearance bonds signed by Eskew that he had such notice. Each bond provides: \u201cThe condition of this bond is that defendant is to appear in the United States District Court * * * if the defendant fails to perform this condition, payment of the amount of the bond shall be due forthwith.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
