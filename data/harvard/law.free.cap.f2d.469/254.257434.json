MeAnulty asserted that the sentencing judge had given explicit consideration to three pri- or felony convictions which were allegedly invalid under Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), because they rested upon un-counselled guilty pleas. The judge also allegedly considered incorrect information that appellant had suffered a 1957 burglary conviction. Judge Meredith, who was both the sentencing judge and the judge on this \u00a7 2255 motion, denied MeAnulty relief and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">In ruling adversely on the motion, Judge Meredith specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-17\">In the instant case, this judge (who was the sentencing judge) was and still is of the opinion that regardless of any invalidity or absence of previous convictions, under the facts and circumstances of this case, six years was the appropriate sentence for this conviction which provided for a maximum imprisonment of ten years. Thus, no prior convictions or materially false assumptions enhanced petitioner\u2019s sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-18\">In light of this statement, appellant\u2019s reliance on United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972), is not well taken. In <em>Tucker, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that where constitutionally invalid convictions may have enhanced the sentence in a federal prosecution, the case must be remanded to the trial court for reconsideration of the sentence. The Court, in rejecting the government\u2019s argument that resentencing would amount to useless procedure, commented, \u201cWe cannot agree with the government that a re-evaluation of the respondent\u2019s sentence by the District Court even at this late date will be either \u2018artificial\u2019 or \u2018unrealistic.\u2019 \" <em>Id. </em>at 448-449, 92 S.Ct. at 592. In a footnote the Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-19\">* * * [T]he respondent\u2019s guilt of that offense [bank robbery] hardly \u201ctranslates\u201d into an \u201cinescapable\u201d assumption that the trial judge would have imposed a maximum 25-year prison sentence if he had known that the respondent had already been unconstitutionally imprisoned for more than 10 years. It would be equally callous to assume, now that the constitutional invalidity of the respondent\u2019s previous convictions is clear, that the trial judge will upon reconsideration \u201cundoubted<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ly\u201d impose the same sentence he imposed in 1953. <em>[Id. </em>at 449 n. 8, 92 S. Ct. at 592.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Here, Judge Meredith has expressly stated that the six-year sentence is appropriate regardless of the invalidity or absence of prior convictions, and thus even if petitioner\u2019s allegations are true, a remand would be pointless.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-20\">. The district court\u2019s opinion is reported at 341 F.Supp. 927 (E.D.Mo.1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
