It is a class action on behalf of herself and \u201call individual juveniles under the age of 18 who are residents of California or who are other juveniles under 18 who may be subject to arrest by any law enforcement agency acting under and pursuant to the laws of the State of California.\u201d [C.T. at 2].</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-18\">The action was filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. Jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>was invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. The action attacks the constitutionality of portions of the California Welfare and Institutions Code relating to the detention of minors taken into custody by state officials.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jurisdiction here rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"ahv-dedup-0\">Three issues were raised below: first, that juveniles may be detained up to 72 hours or more without a judicial hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>ing in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; second, that juveniles are afforded less protection than that guaranteed them under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; and, third, that the denial of the right to post money bail, subsequent to a hearing and a decision to detain, denies the juvenile equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment. [C.T., pp. 38-39].</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">The Complaint seeks injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, and the convening of a three-judge district court pursuant to 28 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a72281 and 2284.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">The district court dismissed the action, holding: (1) that the California juvenile detention statutes are \u201cconstitutional on their face beyond any substantial question;\u201d (2) that \u201cno substantial question of the constitutionality of the application of the challenged provisions to the plaintiff [had] been raised;\u201d (3) that \u201cthe periods of temporary custody provided for are reasonable and that the California Juvenile Court Law provides for alternate release procedures which are an adequate substitute for bail;\u201d and (4) that the plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. [C.T., pp. 124, 125]. The instant appeal is from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-7\">Rosa Rivera was taken into temporary custody at 7:30 p. m. on Wednesday, September 16, 1970, by Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriffs on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon. Later that same evening she was placed in the custody of certain appellees, officials of the Los Angeles County Probation Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-14\">In the early morning of September 17, 1970, the appellant\u2019s mother unsuccessfully attempted to secure the appellant\u2019s release. In a second attempt the appellees told her that the appellant would be held \u201cin temporary custody\u201d pending a detention hearing on the following Monday morning, September 21, 1970. No hearing at that time, was held, however. The appellees investigated the case, and upon review, they released appellant on the afternoon of Friday, September 18, 1970. The complaint was filed on her behalf in the United States District Court prior to her release. On November 4, 1970, the ap-pellees filed a petition in the Juvenile Court of Los Angeles County against appellant relating to the charge of assault with a deadly weapon. Hearings were held on the matter and the petition was sustained. A brief of Amicus Curiae, National Juvenile Law Center, has been filed and considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-15\">This case presents substantial questions relating to a juvenile\u2019s right to bail in a juvenile proceeding and to a detention hearing. Before moving to the merits of these issues, however, the court must first determine whether this case is a proper one for judicial resolution. We hold it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-16\">MOOTNESS: Appellees first contend that the case is moot, and thus deny the power of the district court to adjudicate the merits of the case. The limited jurisdiction of all federal courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>requires, preliminarily, that there be a \"case\u201d or \u201ccontroversy\u201d in existence. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). The ab-sehce of either denies a federal court the power to hear a matter otherwise before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">Appellees suggest that since appellant was released from custody within forty-eight hours of her incarceration, there was no \u201ccontinuing or collateral injury,\u201d and none \u201ccould have resulted.\u201d They rely upon \u00a7 827 of the California Welfare and Institutions Code, which provides for limited disclosure of juvenile records to \u201c. court personnel, the minor who is the subject of the proceeding, his parents or guardian, the attorneys for such parties, and such other persons as may be designated by court order . . and \u00a7 781, which provides for sealing of the records of a juvenile after a period of \u201c. . . five years or more after the jurisdiction of the juvenile court has terminated as to the person . . .\u201d Appellees conclude that a juvenile would be free of any stigma resulting from state action pursuant to the California Juvenile Court Law. <em>See </em>Comment, 1961 California Juvenile Court Law: Effective Uniform Standards for Juvenile Court Procedure, 51 Calif.L.Rev. 421, 445-447 (1963). <em>Cf. </em>T.N.G. v. Superior Court, 4 Cal.3d 767, 94 Cal.Rptr. 813, 484 P.2d 981 (1971). This argument, however, relates to whether or not the appellant\u2019s civil rights were violated. It therefore goes to the merits of the case, and is not proper grounds for a claim of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-9\">Any basis for mooting the case as to appellant Rosa Rivera, however, will not preclude the continuing jurisdiction of the district court as to others of her original class, nor bar her litigating the issue in their behalf. This is a class action and recent eases (including a three judge case from this circuit), have held that \u201c[t]he mooting out of the representative of a class in a class action does not bar his litigating the issues, despite his lack of remaining personal stake.\u201d Gatling v. Butler, 52 F.R.D. 389, 395 (D.Conn.1971).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-12\">STANDING: Appellees further contend that the case at bar is non justiciable because appellant lacks standing to sue. The complaint alleges that appellant\u2019s civil rights were violated by statutes which provide for detention of 72 hours or more. Appellees argue that since appellant was detained for only 43 hours, her rights were not violated and she cannot, therefore, challenge the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-13\">At the time of the filing of the complaint, however, appellant, as minor, was subject to the Juvenile Court law and the challenged provisions therein. Although in retrospect she suffered no further detention without a hearing, the possibility of it was very real. She therefore had standing to bring this action, having alleged the two nexuses supporting her claim of standing. <em>Cf. </em>Flast v. Cohen, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-14\">ABSTENTION: Appellees would have the court abstain from deciding the merits of this case. They rely, principally, upon Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971) and Kinney v. Lenon, 447 F.2d 596 (9th Cir. 1971). Younger v. Harris concerned an action to stay a state court criminal proceeding on the grounds that the subject penal statute was in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Supreme Court held that abstention was proper, reversing a lower court injunction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>\u201c. . . [T]he possible unconstitutionality of a statute \u2018on its face' does not in itself justify an injunction against good-faith attempts to enforce it . The appellant must . . make [a] showing of bad faith, harassment, or . other unusual circumstance that would call for equitable relief.\u201d 401 U.S. at 54, 91 S.Ct. at 755.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-8\">In Kinney v. Lenon, <em>supra, </em>this court applied the rule of Younger v. Harris to a state juvenile court proceeding. <em>Kinney, </em>at 598-601.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See generally: Note, 72 Colum.L.Rev. 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">In applying <em>Harris </em>and <em>Kinney </em>to the case at bar the threshold question is whether this action was an attempt to stay state court proceedings. 401 U. S. at 41, 91 S.Ct. 746. Amicus presents the interesting argument that <em>Harris </em>does not apply because the substance of the attack here was not to stay state court proceedings, but to attack a \u201cprocedural incident related to such prosecutions.\u201d (Amicus\u2019 brief at 15. Appellant-makes a similar distinction in her reply brief at 29.) This argument, however, was prepared prior to our ruling in <em>Kinney. </em>Although appellant herein was released from custody, and Kinney was not, the facts are not materially different. Therefore, based on our decision in <em>Kinney, </em>the rule in <em>Harris </em>must apply to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-10\"><em>Harris </em>holds that \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d must be shown before a federal court may \u201cstay or enjoin pending state court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The same policy requirement has been made for declaratory relief (Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 91 S.Ct. 764, 27 L.Ed.2d 688 (1971)), and for relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 243, 92 S.Ct. 2151, 32 L.Ed.2d 705 (1972); and <em>Kinney, supra, </em>447 F.2d 602-603)). In addition, there must be no adequate remedy at law before a federal court, as a court of equity, may act. <em>Harris, supra, </em>401 U.S. at 43, 91 S.Ct. 746. These requirements are in the conjunctive, and therefore place a heavy burden of proof on the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-13\">The <em>Harris </em>Court defined the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d requirement as a showing of irreparable injury which is \u201cboth great and immediate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46, 91 S.Ct. 746, relying on Fenner v. Boykin, 271 U.S. 240, 46 S.Ct. 492, 70 L.Ed. 927 (1926).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-14\">\u201cThe accused should first set up and rely upon his defense in the state courts, even though this involves a challenge of the validity of some statute, unless it plainly appears that this course would not afford adequate protection.\u201d Fenner v. Boykin, at 244, 46 S.Ct. at 493.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-15\">The test for determining whether the state court proceeding would \u201cafford adequate protection\u201d is whether \u201cthe threat to the plaintiff\u2019s federally protected rights . . . [is] one that cannot be eliminated by his defense against a single criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Harris, supra, </em>401 U.S. at 46, 91 S.Ct. at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-17\">Appellant has not alleged bad faith or harassment, as found in Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965). The narrow question, then, is whether the Constitutional claims could have been properly raised in the state court. <em>Harris, supra, </em>401 U.S. at 49, 91 S.Ct. 746. It was held they could have been properly raised in both <em>Harris </em>and <em>Kinney.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-18\">Appellant and appellees appear to be in accord that the constitutional question of bail in California juvenile court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>proceedings has been decided by the California courts, <em>i. e., </em>no bail is allowed, but provision for release to parents without bail, is among other proceedings, adequate protection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They rely upon In re Castro, 243 Cal.2d 402, 52 Cal.Rptr. 469 (1966), and In re William M., 3 Cal.3rd 16, 89 Cal.Rptr. 33, 473 P.2d 737 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\"><em>In re Castro </em>was a decision rendered by a California intermediate appellate court. Although the case turned on an evidentiary ruling, the question of bail was raised by the parties and avoided by the court. 52 Cal.Rptr. at 475. It was held that the bail issue would have been properly raised \u201c. . . by a writ of habeas corpus or other appropriate writ before judgment at the time of the court\u2019s refusal to release the minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In re William M. was a recent unanimous decision by the California Supreme Court. It concerned the procedures to be followed in a detention hearing, not a juvenile\u2019s right to bail. In note 17 the court addressed the issue of bail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1245-12\">\u201cThe California Juvenile Court Law, as properly administered, provides an adequate system for the prehearing release of juveniles without the requirement of posting bail. (Citations.) Hence, we decline to consider whether juveniles are constitutionally entitled to bail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1245-13\">In view of these cases, we conclude that the question of whether a juvenile has a right to bail under the Constitution has not been decided by the California state courts. There is no showing that the state courts are inadequate or unfair, or will not meet the issue when that issue is properly presented to them. Therefore, by virtue of the longstanding policies of comity and federalism, we affirm the decision of the district court dismissing the action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">.
