The complaint was dismissed on motion upon the ground that the city is not a \u201cperson\u201d and cannot be sued under the Civil Rights Act. An amended pleading based upon the same statute against the same defendant was again dismissed and this appeal taken.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-26\">It is abundantly clear that a municipal corporation is not a \u201cperson\u201d subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. 1983.
