Jones and his wife, Julia A., brought trover against said Morgan to recover certain slaves, or their value and hire. Francis M. had died, and the action was pending in the name of the said Julia A., as survivor. In January, 1869, when the cause was called for trial, defendant\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss it, upon the ground that the Court was forbidden by the 1st clause of the 17th Section of Article V of the Constitution of Georgia, adopted the 11th of March, 1868, to try or give judgment on, or enforce any debt, the consideration of which was a slave or slaves or the hire thereof. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel resisted the motion upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the grounds, that the parties, with notice of the fee of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, had fraudulently settled the cause, and contended that it should be tried, that said fee might be saved; that the conversion occurred in 1850, prior to the emancipation of the slaves, and it could not excuse the defendant, and that said prohibition of the Constitution did not cover actions <em>ex delicto. </em>There was no denial of the facts stated by plaintiff\u2019s counsel. The cause was dismissed, and that is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-5\">Hawkins &amp; Burke, N. A.

According to my individual views upon the question of jurisdiction in this case, I have no difficulty in maintaining it, for the reasons expressed in my dissenting opinions, in the cases of <em>White vs. Hart and Davis, and Berry vs. the Montgomery and West Point </em>Railroad, decided during the present term of the Court. This Court, however, <em>eonaurs </em>in this case in holding, that the counsel for the plaintiff had the right to prosecute the suit against the defendant to recover the amount due him for his fees; provided the plaintiff in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>his action is entitled upon the trial thereof, to recover any thing from the defendant, and that the Court below erred in dismissing the case. See <em>Gray vs. Lawson, 36th Ga. R., </em>629. Let the judgment of the Court below reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
