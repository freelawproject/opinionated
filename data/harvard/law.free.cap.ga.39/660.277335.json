The party moved for a new trial on the ground that he did not know at the trial that a person was on the jury,- who was the relative of a person interested in the question, not a party to the record.

Relief. Before Judge Alexander. In Lowndes Superior Court. May Term, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-12\">Williams sued Gibson on two promissory notes. Against one of them Gibson plead <em>non est faotum. </em>These notes were given to one Boyd, and were once owned by one Clyatt. Clyatt testified that he asked Gibson for the money on the note in question, stating its amount, and Gibson made some promise as to paying it. Boyd testified that he sold Gibson some cotton and differing as to the amount which the cotton at the price came to, Gibson\u2019s wife was asked to make the calculation. She did so, wrote the note sued on for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>amount and signed Gibson\u2019s name to it, brought it out and handed it to Gibson, who said it was right and then delivered it to Boyd. Another witness testified the same as to the making and delivery of said note. It was shown also that.Gibson had paid orders to others, written in the same handwriting as was the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-4\">Gibson swore that he did not sign said note nor authorize any one else to sign his name to it, and that he had lost about $18,000 \u201cby the results of the war.\u201d The jury were charged and found for Williams the principal of the notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-5\">Gibson moved for a new trial upon the grounds, that the verdict was contrary to law and the evidence; because he wished to use his wife as a witness, having learned since the trial that she was competent; and because of the relationship of certain jurors to the parties and the enmity of others of them to him. In support of this last ground, Gibson made an affidavit that Swilly, one of the jury, was Boyd\u2019s nephew, and that Rodney, another juror, was a brother-in-law of Clyatt, and that he did not know these facts till after the trial. Upon this showing the new trial was refused, and that is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b669-6\">Baker &amp; Hammond, for plaintiff in error, made no appearance.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b669-7\">R.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">1. We are very clear that the new trial in this case was properly refused. Concede the competency of defendant\u2019s wife as a witness and it cannot avail him. He must have known what she would testify, and it was his duty to have informed his counsel, and inquired of them whether she was competent before the trial. Having failed to do so, this Court will not relieve him against his own neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">2. The evidence does not show that the juror was related to the party, nor does the degree of relationship appear to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the Court in the motion for a new <em>trial; </em>nor was it shown that the counsel of the defendant did not know of the existence of the relationship at the trial. The affidavit of the defendant shows that he did not know that Francis Swilly was on the jury at the trial. But, if it were material, it is not clearly stated that he did not know of the relationship of the juror to the payee of the note. It was his duty to know who was on the jury at the trial. The law charges him with notice of that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">3. This Court has decided at the last Term that proof by the defendant that he lost property during the war, without connecting the plaintiff with the loss, is not sufficient to authorize the jury to reduce the plaintiff\u2019s debt. We do not think this a case where it is our duty to allow damages. We are not satisfied that the case was brought here for the purpose of delay only.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
