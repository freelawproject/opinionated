The plaintiff then moved the Court to amend the judgment, upon the ground that it was rendered upon a note signed by the defendant in his individual capacity, but in the body thereof promised to pay the plaintiff the amount specified in the note \u201cas guardian,\u201d without stating for <em>whom, </em>he was guardian. The Court refused the motion to amend the judgment, and non-suited the plaintiff\u2019s case upon the evidence offered to charge the guardian and his security in a suit upon his guardianes bond for the amount of the judgment claimed by the plaintiff: <em>Held, </em>that the guardian could not, by any contract, bind the estate of his ward so as to render his security liable therefor, other than such as are specially allowed by law, as provided by the Code, and that there was no error in the refusal of the Court to allow the judgment to be amended, and in granting the non-suit, upon the statement of facts contained in the record.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b138-6\">Suit on guardian\u2019s bond.

Simpson and Louisa J. Simpson.\u201d Smith\u2019s attorney confessed judgment to the plaintiff, and Lovelace\u2019s attorney entered up judgment as follows: \u201c Whereupon it is considered by the Court that the plaintiff do recover of the defendant the sum of four hundred and ninety-six dollars and sixty cents, for his principal debt; the further sum of twenty-eight dollars and ninety-one cents for his interest, and the sum of six dollars for his costs of suit in this behalf laid out and expended, and defendant in mercy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-9\">Subsequently, an action against Smith and Wm. E. Far<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>ley was brought, in the name of the Ordinary, for the use of Lovelace, averring that Smith, in December, 1860, with Earley as his security, gave a guardian\u2019s bond, to be void if Smith should do and perforin all the duties of guardianship for the person and property of said Simpsons, as the law required of him, (the bond is set out in <em>hcee </em>verba;) that Lovelace had obtained his said judgment \u201cagainst the defendant, Charles A. Smith, upon three promissory notes, given in his representative character, and that said Smith, as guardian, etc., refuses and has failed to pay said judgment, and that said defendant is wholly insolvent,\u201d and therefore was guilty of a breach of said bond, etc. Its conclusion is in the usual form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\">When this last cause came on for trial, counsel for Lovelace moved to amend said judgment, so as to make it bind the estate of said wards in Smith\u2019s hands, the avowed object being to use it, when so amended, as evidence in the cause on trial. The Judge refused to allow the amendment, and no other evidence was offered.

When the judgment was offered in evidence, it appeared to have been rendered against the defendant therein, in his <em>individual </em>capacity, and not as <em>guardian. </em>Objection having been made to the introduction of the judgment in evidence, for the purpose of charging tire guardian and his security in a suit upon the bond, for a breach thereof, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel then made a motion to the Court for leave to amend the judgment, upon the ground that it was rendered upon a note signed by the defendant, Smith, in his individual capacity, but, in the body thereof, promised to pay the plaintiff the sum of money specified therein, <em>\u201c </em>as guardian,\u201d without stating for <em>whom </em>he Avas guardian. The Court refused the motion to amend the judgment, and then non-suited the plaintiff\u2019s case upon the evidence offered, as contained in the judgment, to charge the guardian and his security in a suit upon the bond, to recover the amount of such judgment as claimed by the plaintiff. The judgment offered in evidence Avas rendered against Smith, in his individual capacity, and <em>the </em>question is, Avhether it could'have been amended so as to be entered up against Smith, as guardian, upon the statement of facts disclosed by the record. The notes on which the judgment was rendered read as follows: \u201c I, as guardian, promise to pay John H. Lovelace or bearer, etc.,\u201d and were signed <em>\u201c </em>Charles A. Smith.\u201d Story on Promissory Notes, states the rule in- such cases to be, that, \u201c As to trustees, guardian\u2019s, executors, and administrators, and other persons acting <em>en autre droit: </em>they are, by our law, generally held <em>personally </em>liable on promissory notes, because they have no authority to bind <em>ex directo </em>the persons for whom, or for whose benefit, or for whose estate they act, and hence, to give any validity to the note, they must be deemed <em>personally </em>bound as makers. It is true, that they may exempt themselves from personal responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>by using clear and explicit words to show that intention; but in the absence of such words, the law will hold them bound. Thus, if an executor, or administrator should <em>malee </em>or indorse a note, in his own name, adding thereto the words \u201c as executor,\u201d or \u201c as administrator,\u201d he would be <em>personally </em>responsible thereon. If he means to <em>limit </em>his responsibility, he should confine his stipulation to <em>pay out of the estate f\u2019 </em>Story on Promissory Notes, sec. 63. A promise to pay, \u201c as guardian,\u201d comes within the same principle. The more especially is this so, under the special provisions of the Eevised Code. By the 1821 section, it is declared that \u201cguardians may make contracts for labor or services with persons of color, or with white persons, for the benefit of the estates of their wards, upon such terms as they may deem best; and all such contracts, made in good faith, shall be a charge upon and bind said estate, <em>whenever </em>the same are <em>approved </em>by the Ordinary of the county.\u201d The 1828 section of the Code declares that \u201c the guardian cannot borrow money and bind his wards therefor, nor can he, by <em>any contract </em>other than those <em>specially allowed by lato, </em>bind his ward\u2019s property, or create any lien thereon.\u201d The object sought to be accomplished here is, to bind the ward\u2019s estate, (that is to say, some ward\u2019s estate, for the <em>name </em>of the ward is not stated in the notes,) by the individual contract of Smith, which, in our judgment, cannot be done in view of the facts of this case. There was no error, therefore, in the refusal of the Court to allow the judgment to be amended so as to bind the ward\u2019s estate, nor in granting the non-suit for the want of evidence to entitle the plaintiff to recover the amount of the judgment in a suit therefor, on the guardian\u2019s bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Let the judgment of the Court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
