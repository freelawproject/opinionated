Decided by Judge Clark. Dougherty Superior Court. June Term, 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-12\">One Holly rented from Seabrook, as administrator of Dawson, a plantation in Dougherty county, known as the Dawson place, and employed Toler as his overseer for 1867, agreeing to furinsh his family supplies, etc., and pay him $600 GO.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-13\">Afterwards, on the 3rd of May, 1867, Holly agreed to let Bray &amp; Clemmons take said place, and they rented it from Seabrook, as such administrator. In writing, it was agreed that they should take the place and stock and utensils for the balance of the year, and return them in good order, saving the usual wear and tear, at the end of the term, and they stipulated in these words: \u201cto pay, as rent, for the use of said plantation and the stock and other property upon it, thirty-five bage of cotton weighing five hundred pounds, to be delivered at Eust &amp; Johnson\u2019s warehouse in Albany, Georgia; (this cotton to be sound, merchantable cotton, of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>average quality, made of the crop of this year, on the-said place,) and also five hundred bushels of sound corn, and we agree that these two items of rent shall be the first lien on said crops, and to be first taken from the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-5\">On the 31st of May, 1867, Bray &amp; Clemmons, \u201cin consideration of advances of provisions made and to be made by R. N. Reed <em>&amp; </em>Co., for the purpose of assisting them to make a crop,\u201d pledged to R. N. Reed <em>&amp; </em>Co., their entire crop of cotton to be made that year, to be shipped as fast as it could be picked out, to said R. N. Reed &amp; Co., for sale on commission, and that all advances made by R, N. Reed &amp; Co., should be first paid out of the net sale of said cotton. On the 1st of June, 1867, Bray &amp; Clemmons took Toler as their overseer on said plantation, upon the terms of his contract with Holly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-6\">Bray &amp; Clemmons made but twenty-one bales of cotton and five hundred bushels of corn on said plantation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-7\">Eour of these bales of cotton had been sent to Albany, to be shipped to said R. N. Reed &amp; Co. Upon learning this, Seabrook, as administrator, sued out a distress-warrant, and levied on said four bales, and the balance of the corn and cotton at the plantation. This balance of the cotton had been loaded on the wagons at mid-night, and the sheriff found it near the plantation. The record does not show the affidavit upon which this warrant issued. But it was admitted that it was sued out sometime in December, 1867, and that it did not state that Bray &amp; Clemmons were seeking to remove these goods from the premises. Toler, in January, 1868, levied an attachment on said property, but had no judgment at the date of this decision. The agent of the Ereedmen\u2019s Bureau took the cotton and corn from the sheriff, and had it sold privately to pay off the wages of the negroes who raised the crop. After that was done, about $890 00 was left, and a motion was made, in said Court, to distribute that sum according to law. Toler claimed his wages, and for meal twice furnished to the hands, (but no sum was specified for this,) none of which had been paid. R. N. Reed &amp; Co. showed that, on said 31st of May, 186 T, they had advanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Bray <em>&amp; </em>Clemmons, in cash, $2,257 81, and in supplies, etc., for said plantation, from that time to the 2nd of November, 1867, other sums, making a total of $3,322 35, all of which. Avas advanced under their said contract, and that they had legally foreclosed their lien, but since the levies by Seabrook\u2019s distress-warrant, and of Toler\u2019s attachment. Seabrook, as administrator, claimed said rent under his said contract. And each claimant contended that he. should be paid before either of the others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-5\">The Judge decided that Seabrook\u2019s claim took priority to the exclusion of the others. Toler and R. N. Reed <em>&amp; Co. </em>assigned this ruling as erroneous, saying that the Court erred because the affidavit did not state that Bi\u2019ay <em>&amp; </em>Clemmons were seeking to remove the goods from the premises, because the affidavit did not show such a state of facts as entitled Seabrook, as administrator, to the process of distress, (what it showed does not appear by the record,) because a distress-warrant will not lie for rent reserved in <em>products, </em>because Seabrook\u2019s claim is an unliquidated demand, and its amount cannot be ascertained in such an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding, because the landlord\u2019s lien attach only from the time of levying his distress-Avarrant, because the rent reserved Avas more than half of the crop raised, and, if good at all, is only good to the extent of half the crop raised, as against other liens and claims.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-6\">Strozier &amp; Smith and John A. Davis, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-7\">Hines &amp; Hobbs, for defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5\">cited the Code, secs. 2260, 2259, 2263, 4010; Smith vs. Glenn, 34 Ga. R., 181, Code, secs. 3224, 3255, 1977, 1968.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b24-8\">McCay, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">This fund, $890 00, balance of the proceeds of Bray &amp; Clemmons\u2019 crop, is in the hands of the Court for distribution, and is claimed by three parties. First, by Toler, who was the overseer on the plantation. Secondly, by R. N. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Reed <em>&amp; </em>Co., factors, who made advances during the year, of provisions, etc., to make the crop, and took a lien under section 1977 of the Code. (This lien was dated 31st May, 1867. Proceedings were begun under it 25th May, 1868.) Thirdly, by Seabrook, administrator of Dawson, who owned the land, and who claimed, as rent, the value of thirty-five bags of cotton and five hundred bushels of corn. This amount, as appears by written agreement, dated 3rd May, 1867, Bray &amp; Clemmons agreed to pay to Seabrook, for <em>\u201c </em>rent of the land, (eleven hundred acres,) together with the mules, stock, farming utensils and gear belonging to Seabrook, now on said place.\u201d These two items of rent to be the <em>\u201cfirst lien on the </em>crops, and to be first <em>taken from the same.\u201d </em>No specific day was fixed for the payment of the rent. A distress-warrant was obtained by Seabrook. It was issued sometime in December, 1867, and in the affidavit, there was no charge that the defendants were moving the property from the place, though the evidence showed that such was the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">We see no ground for the interference of Toler. True, he has attached, but it is clear his claim would yield to the others, as they both have written liens, while he has none. His claim, it will be observed, is before the adoption of the present Constitution, providing that laborers shall have a lien, and no question, therefore, arises in this case under that provision. At common law, and by previous statutes, he had no lien or preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The dispute is really, here between Seabrook, the landlord, and Reed &amp; Co., the factors; both have liens as provided by law, and both have reduced their liens to writing. Which has the preference ?</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">1. We think it clear that, by the Code, sections 2260 and 2263, the lien of the landlord, <em>upon the crop, </em>is superior to all other liens. As to other property than the crop, the lien only attaches from the levy of the warrant, but as to the crop, it lias a preference over all other liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">In this case, the landlord has reduced his lien to writing and it is older than Reed\u2019s lien by a week or two.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>2. Reed\u2019s lien dates from the time it was given. It arises under the Act of 1866. Code, sec. 1977. Several questions have been made in this case under this Act, as to notice, and the general effect of the liens there provided for. But, as we hold the landlord\u2019s lien of higher dignity than any other, so far, at least, as the crop made is concerned, we do not decide these questions, except to say that this (Reed\u2019s) lien, by a fair construction of the statute, attaches from the advance. What is its effect as to preference, and how far it must be notified to the world, to make it notice, we do not decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">3. It is, however, objected to the landlord\u2019s claim in this case, 1st, that, being payable in specifics, a distress-warrant will not lie for its collection. 2nd, that, having been issued before the rent was due, it is irregular. 3rd, that the thirty-five bales of cotton and five hundred bushels of corn, being for the use not only of the land, but for the mules, stock and farming utensils on the place, it is not properly <em>rent, </em>and a distress-warrant is not the proper remedy. We do not think any of these objections good.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">By the common law, it is not necessary that the rent shall be payable in money, to sustain a distress-warrant; anything certain is sufficient. Taylor\u2019s Landlord and Tenant, section 369. It may be money, labor, chattels, etc. Our statute, Code section 4010, makes no restriction. If the plaintiff can swear to the sum due, that is sufficient. In this case, the agreement is for a specific number of pounds of cotton of a certain description, and five hundred bushels of corn. Nothing is to be supplied but the price of the articles, and we see no l\u2019eason why the plaintiff may not distress for what it is worth. If he claims too much, the defendant can replevy. Code, section 4012.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">4. Nor is the fact matei\u2019ial that the defendant was to have not only the use of the land, but the mules, utensils, etc., on the place.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">There is hardly ever a contract of writing, in which the use of some personal property is not included. The main thing is the rent, the use of the other things ai\u2019e mere inci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>dents. It is still rent, and a distress-warrant will lie. Taylor, sections 17 and 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">5. Was the distress-warrant issued prematurely ? There was no fixed day for the payment of the corn and cotton agreed upon. It <em>was </em>agreed, however, that it was to be paid out of the crop \u2014 to be a superior lien, and to be <em>first taken from the same. </em>We think a fair construction of the agreement is, that the rent was due in a reasonable time after the crop was gathered. As it was to be first taken from the crop, it would be due as soon as the crop was in a condition to take it. This warrant was issued in December, 1867. At that time, as the proof shows, the crop was gathered ; it was not, therefore, too soon.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">6. It was further contended, in this case, that, as the proof showed, the rent reserved of thirty-five bags of cotton and five hundred bushels of corn, was, in fact, more than half the crop actually made, the lien of the landlord did not obtain, and section 2263 of the Code is invoked to support this position. We do not say what would be the effect on the dignity of the landlord\u2019s lien, of a rent reserved in kind of a share more than half the crop. It is sufficient, now, to say this is not such a case. This is not a renting for a part of the crop. Clearly that section refers to cases where the landlord is to receive a <em>share </em>of the crop \u2014 a certain proportion \u2014 an uncertain amount. This is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">On the whole, we think the Court below was right, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
