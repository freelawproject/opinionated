Johnston, administrator of Eliab Jones, deceased, late of the county of Dooly, in said State, by his bill made the following averments : Said intestate was, in his life-time, possessed of considerable estate, both real and personal, consisting of certain lands, negroes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>stock, growing crops, furniture and farming utensils, of the value of twenty-five thousand dollars, as will more fully appear by copy-deeds and bill of particulars attached, in his own right and title, and was indebted but a small amount, if anything, and no judgments, liens, or mortgages or other incumbrances, or if any, but a small sum, were hanging over his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\">In July, 1849, it was alleged and charged that Jones was guilty of a crime that would subject him to a great trouble and expense, and perhaps to pains and penalties, if not to the penitentiary. \"While he was the subject of the terror and fears which the charges made against him produced upon, his mind, and was thus wholly disqualified from transacting any business and laboring under great mental anguish and distress and desirous of leaving the State, he applied to several persons for the purpose of procuring necessary funds for doing so, as well as to'arrange for the payment of the several amounts of debts he owed, to protect his family from being harrassed, and his property from being attached or levied on after his absence, and while thus situated, he was induced by one Ezekiel H. Adams, of the county of Macon, in said State, under the pretence of great friendship and sympathy for Jones and his family, but with the real intent and desire to defraud him, to make and execute certain deeds and titles to said Adams, to the following lots and parcels of land, as will fully appear by the copy-deeds attached, to wit: Lots Nos. 98, 126 and 127, each lot containing two hundred and two and one-half acres, and ninety-six and one-half acres of lot No. 129, and seventeen nine-tenths acres of lot No. 130, all in the first district of said Dooly county, said lots and fractional lots containing, in the aggregate, seven hundred and twenty-one and nine-tenths acres of valuable and well-improved land, together with the growing crops of cotton, corn, wheat, oats, etc., on said land. Said intestate had purchased of one William W. McLendon, of the county of Dooly, lot of land No. 128, in the first district of Dooly, containing two hundred and two and one-half acres, at and for the price of seven hundred dollars, and held the bond for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>titles to said last mentioned lot, and had paid said McLendon one hundred dollars in part of the purchase price, and said intestate was induced at the same time, and under the same mental excitement, and same promises of said Adams, to transfer said bond for titles to said last mentioned lot of land to said Adams, and said McLendon, on the 20th of September, 1849, in accordance with the said bond, and the transfer thereon, made and executed to said Adams, \u00e1 deed in fee simple to said lot of land. Said intestate, on the said 16 th of July, 1849, did also sell and convey to said Ezekiel H. Adams the following negroes, to wit: Ann, a woman, then about nineteen years of age, and her child, of the value of oxie thousand two hundred dollars, and Meranda, a girl, aged about eighteen yeai\u2019s, and of the value of one thousand dollars. The crop of cotton made in the year 1849, on the said land, was of the value of one thousand dollai\u2019s, the corn ci\u2019op was of the value of three hundred dollars, there were seventy bushels of wheat, of the value of one hundred dollars, seventy head of sheep, the value of one hundred dollars, seventy head of hogs, of the value of three hundred dollars, secretary, tables and furniture, of the value of thx'ee hundred dollars, plantation tools, of the value of fifty dollars, one lot of carpenter\u2019s tools, of the value of fifty dollars, two mai\u2019es, of the value of fifty dollars each, a yoke of oxen and cart, of the value of sixty dollar\u2019s, sixty head of cattle, of the value of four hundred and eighty dollars, and large amount of notes, accounts and claims against various persons, the amount and parties unknown to complainant, but amounting to two thousand dollars, or other large sum. The value of land, crop and stock, and fux\u2019niture and negx\u2019oes, together with the land, was of the aggregate value of sixteen thousand three hundred and thirty dollars, which the said Adams, operating upon the fears and anxieties of said Jones, as well as through false and fraudulent representations, that the said criminal charge did greatly endanger the said Jones, as well as under the false pretence of assisting the faxnily of said Jones, by these false, fraudulent and wicked devices, which said Adams so well knew how to manage, did induce said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Jones, for the inadequate sum of one thousand dollars cash advanced to the said Jones, to convey the right and title to the whole of the property and effects above set forth, to said Adams, under the false- and deceptive promise, on the part of said Adams, that if Jones would leave the State, he, Adams, would pay the debts of Jones, amounting to five or six hundred dollars, reimburse himself the amount of one thousand dollars, which he had advanced to Jones, and then sell and dispose of all the property set forth and described in this bill, and pay over the same to Jones and his family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">Said conveyances, sales and transfer of all the above described property, by J ones to Adams, were made without any other consideration than that set forth and described, and for no other purpose than to enable Jones to leave the State, as he was persuaded and urged to do by said Adams.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-6\">Adams, better to conceal his purposes, induced and persuaded Jones to remove to his (Adams\u2019) house, used every artifice which his tact could suggest, and device which his ingenuity could invent, to exaggerate the crime with which Jones was charged, to magnify the excitement against him, and to increase his fears and excite his apprehensions in every possible way, by keeping Jones concealed from his, the said (Adams\u2019) family, by refusing the visits of any of the family of Jones, by calling in legal counsel under the pretence of consulting for the benefit of Jones.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-7\">Adams advised and persuaded Jones to make and execute to him absolute and unconditional deeds and bills of sale to all the above property set forth and <em>described under </em>the false and fraudulent pretence that it would enable the said Adams the better to sell and dispose of the said property for the use and benefit of J ones and his family. But for the great confidence reposed by Jones in Adams, and his repeated promises and assurances that he, (Adams,) would sell the property, and after paying the just debts of said Jones, and reimbursing himself the amount advanced to J ones, and the interest thereon, would faithfully, fairly and honestly turn over all assets arising from the sale of said property, of every kind whatsoever, to the said Jones, and but for this promise, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the part of Adams, and the great and controlling influence Adams exercised over the mind and feelings of Jones at the time, Jones never would have executed the said deeds ,and bills of sale, nor turned over or delivered to Adams the negroes, stock, furniture, crops and provisions. -It never was agreed to or understood by and between Adams and Jones, that said sale and conveyance was made or executed upon any other terms, or for any other purpose than as above set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-5\">Jones, in his lifetime did, and since his death, complainant has repeatedly applied to Adams to come to a full and fair settlement, and after deducting his expenses and trouble, the debts of Jones, and the amounts due, which Adams had advanced to Jones, and the interest thereon, to account to and with complainant for the balance of the assets in his, Adams\u2019, hands. Adams absolutely refuses to comply with such request, and at times pretends that said sale and conveyance was absolute and unconditional, at other times that he has accounted to and with Jones, pertaining to all the matters and things set forth, at other times that the whole of the assets were absorbed in the payment of the debts of Jones, at other times pretending that Jones is not dead, and that he is ready to account to and with Jones, all matters and things pertaining to said sale and delivery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">There were interrogatories as to each of the foregoing statements with a prayer that each be fully answered, and besides the prayer for <em>subpoena </em>and general relief, a prayer that said defendant answer the premises, and that an account may be taken of what is due to said defendant in respect of the loan of one thousand dollars or other sum, and the interest due thereon, and of the debts of Jones paid by Adams, and the interest due thereon, and that upon the payment of the said several sums, said defendant be decreed to account for the annual rents of the land, the hire of the negroes, and the proceeds and value of the personal and perishable property that went into his hands belonging to Jones, to reconvey to complainant the said lands and negroes so bargained .and sold by Jones to Adams, or that Adams be decreed to account to and pay over to him the present value of the lands and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>negroes, together with the rents of the lands and hire of the negroes, and value of the other property, sold and conveyed by Jones to Adams, after deducting therefrom the amount loaned by Adams to Jones, and the interest thereon, and the debts paid by Adams outstanding against Jones, and the interest thereon,, and that Adams be allowed to retain such reasonable compensation as shall seem proper for his expense and trouble in managing said property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">Attached to the bill as exhibits, were a copy of a deed from Jones to Adams for said first mentioned lots, dated the 16th of July, 1849, for the expressed consideration of $2,500 00, and a deed from McLendon to Adams for lot Number 128, dated the 20th of September, 1849, for the expressed consideration of $625 00, both in the usual form, and a statement of the personalty sold by Jones to Adams as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">Value of Cotton Crop....................................$1,000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\">Value of Corn.......................................... 200 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-8\">70 Bushels Wheat....................................... 100 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-9\">60 Head of Cattle........................................ 480 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-10\">70 Head of Sheep................................. 100 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-11\">70 Head of Hogs..............................\u2022.......... 300 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-12\">Secretary, Tables and Furniture....................... 300 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-13\">Plantation Tools.......................................... 50 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-14\">Lot of Carpenters\u2019 Tools................................. 50 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-15\"><em>2 </em>Mares................................ 100 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-16\">Negro Woman, Ann, and child........................ 1,200 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-17\">Negro Woman, Meranda................... 1,000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-18\">Oxen and Cart........................................... 50 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-19\">$4,930 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-20\">The defendant plead that he had been in the peaceable, quiet, uninterrupted possession of said lands and slaves continuously and adversely since the 16th of July, 1849, controlling them as his own, and complainant was thereby barred. He also at the same time filed his answer, in which was a demurrer to the bill. Subsequently, he filed a separate demurrer on the same grounds, to-wit: because there was no . equity therein; because it does not appear therein that Jones <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>is dead or, if he be, when he died; because, by its face, complainant is barred by lapse of time; because said conveyances were absolute, and for the considerations therein expressed. No action appears to have been taken on this demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-5\">He answered that he did not know whether Jones was dead, and insisted on proof of the death and its date. He admitted that Eliab Jones, on the 16th of July, 1849, owned suqh property as was described in the bill, in Dooly county, but said it was not worth $25,000 00, or any such large sum. He said Jones was considerably embarrassed, suits were pending against him, and he could not pay his debts without selling his property. He admitted that Jones was charged with a crime of the troublesome and dangerous character charged, but denied that Jones was thereby disqualified from attending to any business. He admitted that Jones wished to leave the State, and averred that he applied to several persons for funds necessary for that purpose, as well as to pay his debts, protect his property from attachments, and to protect his family in his absence; that Jones voluntarily applied to him twice or thrice to get him to buy his property; that fearing Jones was in debt overwhelmingly he refused at first, but finally, at Jones\u2019 solicitation, he absolutely bought said property, for the consideration recited in said deed, etc., which was actually paid; that he paid Jones $100 00 for the crop; that he paid him $100 00 which he had paid McLendon, took the bond, paid $625 00, balance due to McLendon, and took from him said deed. He said he bought Ann, about nineteen years old, and her child, and Melinda, (called Meranda in the bill,) about eighteen or twenty years old, the woman and Ann\u2019s child, then worth $1,000 00 or $1,200 00, and paid Jones therefor $1,000 00. He denied that the cotton crop was worth $1,000 00 or the corn crop $300 00, or that there were seventy bushels of wheat, admitted he'got seventy sheep worth $70 00, about forty hogs worth $80 00, about forty cattle worth $135 00, furniture worth $50 00, and plantation tools worth $10 00, and a yoke of oxen worth $50 00, and a note for $100 00, and collected it. He denied getting any carpen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>ter\u2019s tools except a saw, plane and square, all old, and of but little value. He denied getting the mares, said there was one mare and colt, which Jones\u2019 son took. He said he paid Jones for all these things except as stated hereafter; that property was then low, and all of said property was, at the date of the sale, worth not more than $6,000 00 or $7,000 00. He said that Jones was of sound mind and capacity, and the trading was <em>dona fide </em>and made without any of the fraudulent practices or purposes charged, and in this wise: Jones urged and solicited Adams to advance to him $1,050 00, a horse and buggy to be taken in part payment of the $1,050, and to pay his, Jones\u2019 debts, which he, Jones, then and there represented to be not more than from $3,300 00 to $3,500 00 dollars, and agreed, in case Adams would advance to him the $1,050 00 as aforesaid, and pay $3,300 00 of his debts, to make absolute sale and deed to Adams to the lots and fractional lots of land first mentioned in said bill, and transfer said McLendon\u2019s bond to the other lot of land, and deliver <em>to </em>Adams as his own property, the <em>negro </em>woman Ann and her child, and the woman Melinda, and to sell and convey to him his stock of cattle, sheep, hogs, corn, cotton, potatoes, furniture, farming utensils and all fixtures, and secretary, oxen and cart, etc., except as hereinafter excepted; and at the urgent request and solicitation of Jones, he did accept said offer, and advanced to him, Jones, $1,050 00, and did agree to pay not exceeding $3,300 00 of his said debts, and he took a deed to his land first mentioned in said bill, a transfer of McLendon\u2019s bond as aforesaid, and afterwards, on the 20th of September, 1849, paid McLendon $625 00, or the balance of the purchase-money as before stated, and obtained a deed to said last mentioned land in the bill, and also took receipts for stock, corn, cotton, furniture, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-6\">He said he had actually paid Jones\u2019 debts to the amount of $3,413 00, besides advances to Jones\u2019 family, and other expenses. He denied urging Jones to leave the State, denied the charges as to concealing him or keeping his family from him, admitting that Jones came to his house, but said that Jones went to and fro at his pleasure for two or three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>days before he left. He denied any promise to pay Jones\u2019 family, or Jones, the proceeds of the sale of the property after paying the debts, averring that he bought all absolutely and without any trust or liability to account to any one, except a part of the household and kitchen furniture, which he returned to Jones\u2019 family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\">He said, Jones had never called on him for an account, admitting that complainant had, before the date of his letters of administration, without stating what he wanted, or what account, or from what source. He admitted a trust as follows: On the 16th of July, 1849, in addition to from $3,300 to $3,500, just debts which he, Jones, admitted he owed, there was existing against him and one J. <em>A'. </em>Shine, as partners, a large mercantile, Charleston, debt, which Jones was afraid would devolve upon him, and' in consequence of said debt, Jones agreed to put into the bill of sale along with the said woman Ann, and her child Jane, and the woman Melinda (which were absolutely and unconditionally sold and conveyed), three other negroes, viz.: Eliza, about, then, thirty-\u00f1ve years of age, a boy about twenty yeai\u2019s old, named Green, and a girl Harriet, sixteen years of age, then, upon the parol understanding and agreement, that if the said Charleston debt came against Jones, the three last mentioned negroes were to go to pay it off, and if anything was left, the surplus was to go back to Jones or his family. And under said understanding and agreement, Jones did, on the day and year last aforesaid, execute to Adams, an absolute bill of sale to Ann and Jane, and Melinda, as of his own absolute right and property, and also included in the said absolute bill of sale, said Eliza, and Green, and Harriet, with the parol understanding aforesaid, as to these last three negroes. And there were a wagon and six mules, and some portions of the household furniture which he received in trust, to account to said Jones and family, and which are not set up in said \u2018bill, except as to the portion of furniture which Adams was to keep, and which three negroes, Eliza, Green and Harriet, he returned to said Jones, said Charleston debt never having devolved on Jones for payment, and also re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>turned, pursuant to said trust as to said property, the six mules, wagon, and said portion of household furniture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-5\">He said, the land was worth (when he answered) $10 per acre, and $250 <em>per annum </em>for rent; that he had not gotten over $100 worth of timber from it; that Ann was diseased, and died in 1857, leaving three children; that her annual hire was not worth over $30; that Jane, her child, was eleven years old, and worth $600, and her third child was worth $400; that Melinda was a runaway, in chains, when he bought her, and that he soon sold her; she was barren. He said, that when he took possession, the crop was full of grass, etc.; and, while he did not remember the amount or value of the crop of that year, he put the cotton at $150, and the corn at two hundred bushels, worth $100; said, the amounts of other property were too largely stated by the exhibits to the bill. He said, he did not believe Jones was dead; and insisted that the letters of administration granted in Dooly county were void, because Jones was not shown to have died in Dooly county, or to have had <em>bona notabilia </em>there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-6\">To this answer was attached an exhibit of said conveyances, and a statement of the debts paid by him for Jones.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-7\">He also exhibited copies of notes and accounts against Jones, paid off by him, to-wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-8\">One note for $316 40J, due 1st January, 1850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-9\">One note for $200 00, due 1st January, 1848.

The name of said negro was Melinda. He also owed sixty-five dollars to William Jones for a yoke of steers, which were afterwards also sold by Adams, who paid that debt. He also owed Henry Powell sixty-five dollars, which was afterwards paid by said Adams with a mare belonging to said Jones.

My only acquaintance with him was in Macon county, Alabama. The last I saw of him was in the summer of 1849, in Macon county, Alabama. I can say that he did not act as a rational man when I saw him. He took a vial of laudanum at my own house, which he acknowledged he took to kill himself with, and would set for hours under a shade tree in my yard, looking up the wagon road, Avith a knife in his hand, and said he AAmuld kill himself if any one came after him. He came to my house in July or' August, 1849, and left the last of August or first of September, 1849. I have never heard of him since he left. The only property that I knew him to have at my house in Alabama was a horse and buggy, and the negro boy Reuben. It was a deep bay horse, and I think he had him at my house in the winter; he Avas in possession of Eliab Jones. He sold me the horse and buggy for one hundred and eighty dollars, and he sold the boy Reuben for five hundred and fifty dollars, to get money to go away upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-6\">Cross-examined, he said: I live in Macon county, Alabama, at the same place where Eliab Jones was, at my house.

Adams for the above sum, in the presence of Nathan M. Massey, and he sold the fodder to said Adams for eight dollars. Adams told him that the property was left with him (Adams) by witness\u2019 father, to pay his (Jones) debts and to turn over the balance of it to his father\u2019s family after the debts were paid; that his father was confined at Adams\u2019 house for several days before he went away, and that Adams promised him he should see him before he left. Adams told him and his mother that he would bring him to see them,- but he did not do it. Afterwards, when Adams came for Jones\u2019 clothes and things, witness reminded him of his promise, but he put him off. Witness tried to get him to carry a letter to his father, which he declined. Adams told witness\u2019 mother that, if she would go to Alabama, he would go to Alabama and purchase for her a better plantation than Jones had turned over to him. When Jones\u2019 family left Georgia in December, 1849, Adams turned over to them three negroes, to-wit: Green, Eliza and Harriet, the wagon and six mules, and some household furniture. There were on the plantation, when Jones left it, some five or six hundred bushels of corn, and a considerable quantity of fodder. The crop had been well cultivated, and Adams took some of the hands off, and worked them on his own farm; there was plenty of bacon on the place to supply the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-6\">Cross-examined.

McLendon, in behalf of complainant, testified : That he sold Jones one of the lots of land purchased of him (Jones) by Adams, for six hundred or seven hundred dollars, and gave Jones his bond for titles of the same. Previous to his departure, Jones paid one hundred dollars'of the purchase money. After he left, the bond was in Adams\u2019 hands, who paid him the balance of the purchase money, and he made a deed to the land to Adams. Witness made some one or two hundred dollars on the land trade with Jones, including some hogs sold with the land to Jones. Just before or jus't after Jones went away, he is under the impression that lands rose greatly in <em>value; </em>if this rise took place before Jones left, (of which he is doubtful,) the settlement of land conveyed to Adams was worth eight or nine dollars per acre. If lands advanced subsequently, it was not then worth more than three or four dollars per acre. The notes exhibited in the exhibit to defendant\u2019s answer, payable to witness, and signed by Eliab Jones, were the only claim held by witness against Jones at the time he left, and they were paid by Adams.

Jones said nothing to him about the criminal charge; both asked him about conveyances of property ; they (Jones and Adams) would retire to the horse lot and other places about the premises, and have long private interviews, and then return and consult him again. Sometimes Adams went by Jones\u2019 invitation, but as frequently Jones went by Adams\u2019.

Jones any amount of money whatever for cotton, or any other thing, at the time mentioned by said Jones, or at any other time. Witness (Massey) cultivated the Jones\u2019 place in co-partnership with Adams in 1850, and when he took possession, which was early in that year, the 14th day of January, he found only some four or five hundred bushels of corn on the place, and thinks there were some eight or ten bales of cotton made there the previous year, and this he concludes from the quantity of cotton seed found there and used by him on the place in 1850.

Witness was present when Eliab Jones\u2019 family, about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Christmas, 1849, left this State for Alabama. Ezekiel H. Adams turned over to Mrs. Jones, (the wife of said.

She commenced crying, and asked Ezekiel H. Adams if that was all he was going to let her have to carry her clear to Alabama, when he replied that she had gotten all the property to which her husband was entitled, and he had given her, as a present, the one hundred dollars, that he did not owe her anything. The crop of 1849, on the Jones\u2019 place, was badly cultivated, and after Adams came into possession of it, he had to work it out with his own hands. It was overrun with grass and weeds and water melon vines. There were not more than eight light bales of cotton made on the place, and some four or five hundred bushels of corn, with some small amount of fodder, not exceeding sixty or seventy dollars worth.

He saw Jones at Adams\u2019 house for several days previous to his leaving; he did not appear to be attempting to conceal himself, or be concealed by Adams. Did not know when or how he left. Understood he drove off his own horse to Adams\u2019 buggy. Knew nothing of Adams exciting Jones\u2019 fears. Did not know the exact date of making said trade. It was made some time during the year 1849. Knew none of the circumstances under which it was made. Jones\u2019 son drove the wagon and team previous to its sale to Adams. Did not recollect to have seen him drive it afterwards, nor did he know that it was run at all after the trade until Jones\u2019 family moved. Knew that Adams paid some of Jones\u2019 debts. Did not know that he shaved any of them, or had any transferred to himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-5\">Defendants tendered and read in evidence the interrogatories and answers thereto of Ansel Hagins, who testified, in September, 1867, that he knew the parties; was acquainted with Ezekiel H. Adams, and had seen Eliab Jones; that he lived with Adams (Ezekiel H.) in 1849. The^crops on the Jones place that year were sorry, not more than eight or nine bales of cotton, and four hundred and fifty bushels of corn were made. He (witness) gathered said crops with Adams\u2019 negroes. Adams\u2019 hands worked on the Jones place in 1849. They plowed and hoed the cotton one time and gathered the crop. The trade took place between Jones and Adams in June or July, 1849, and Jones left about the time it was made. Does not know when Jones\u2019 family left, or what property they carried off with them, or what became of the wagon and team. There was a mare and colt on the Jones' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>place, claimed by Ben. Jones. Adams said she belonged to Ben. Jones.

Such is substantially the ease made by the complainant. The bill prayed for an account and decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>against Adams. The answer of the defendant denied the fraud charged in the complainant\u2019s bill, and claimed an absolute title to the property conveyed by Jones to Adams by the written deeds executed, and delivered by Jones to him, discharged of any trust expressed or implied. It further appeared from the record that Jones had not been heard of after leaving the State, for more than seven years, and that administration had been granted on his estate to the complainant by the Ordinary of Dooly county, in which the land and other property was located at the time of making the title deeds therefor, by Jones to Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">1. There were several questions raised and discussed on the argument of this case, but we shall confine our judgment to the points made, which must control it. In our judgment, the allegations in the complainant\u2019s bill made a case of <em>fraud </em>on the trial of which parol evidence was admissible to prove the fraud, and thereby raise an <em>implied </em>trust in favor of Jones and his family. Revised Code, sections 2290, 2291, 3121, 2648.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">2. The son of Jones and his alleged widow, Mrs. Jones, were competent witnesses for the complainant on the trial of the cause under the provisions of the 3798 section o\u00ed the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">3. On the trial of an equity cause in the discretion of the Chancellor, compound interest may be charged on a final settlement with an implied trustee, who <em>fraudulently </em>obtains possession of the property as well as against a trustee appointed, who <em>rightfully </em>obtains possession of trust property as provided by the 2562 section of the Code; the <em>former </em>comes within the reason of the rule prescribed for the <em>latter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">4. The seven years absence of Jones, without being heard of, was presumptive evidence of his death, and authorized the Ordinary of Dooly county to grant letters of administration on his estate; and although that presumption might have been rebutted on the trial, still the letters of administration were conclusive on the trial of this case as to that fact, in <em>the absence of any evidence </em>rebutting that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">5. In view of the facts'of this case as contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>record, the defendant is not protected by the statute of limitations, nor by the equitable bar of lapse of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">6. The Court below charged the jury, that \u201cwhen the answer is contradictory in itself, or contradicted by other evidence, the jury are not <em>bound </em>to give credit to <em>any portion of it.\u201d </em>In our judgment this charge was too broad, in the latter portion of it, especially. The Court should have left it to the jury to determine what credit they would give to the answer, or to any part thereof, without any intimation from the Court; they were the exclusive judges as to the <em>credit </em>to be given to the answer of the defendant in view of the facts contained and stated therein. In my judgment, however, a new trial ought not to be granted in this case for this error in the charge of the Court to the jury. Although the verdict may have been somewhat too large under the evidence, still, I should not myself be disposed to disturb it under the previous rulings of this Court upon that question; yet as the majority of the Court are of the opinion the judgment of the Court below should be reversed, unless the complainant shall write off from the verdict the sum of $3,621 61, leaving the verdict to stand for $5,000 00, I concur in the judgment of the Court to that'effect. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Let the judgment of the Court be entered reversing the judgment of the Court below upon the terms stated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
