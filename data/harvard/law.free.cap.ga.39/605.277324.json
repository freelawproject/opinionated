Dodd sued Mayson, in the Justice\u2019s Court, for the price of a barrel of sugar. Mayson obtained a verdict, and an appeal was entered. On the appeal trial, Mr. Howell, one of plaintiff\u2019s clerks, testified to the sale of the sugar, its price and the date of the sale. What the date was, does not .appear. Mayson then testified, that at said time he bought the sugar and a barrel of flour, but upon second thought concluded not to take the flour, had it put back, and then went to the railing enclosing the' book-keeper\u2019s desk, and saying, \u201chere, I will pay you for the sugar,\u201d laid down the money on the railing and walked out; that a few days after-wards Howell presented plaintiff\u2019s \u00e1ccount against him, which had stood for some time, but because it was not full, had no items, credit, etc., he did not pay it, but asked Howell to have the book-keeper make it out in full; after that, he went to the store and the book-keeper presented his account: \u201c To balance on merchandize to date, 18th April, 1867, $12 70,\u201d and he paid it and toifeit receipted ; he said he did not remember who was in\u00e1HFsaid railing at the time of the first payment, though sevWal men were there, nor could he swear that the attention of any one of them yvas given to his leaving the money there. Said receipt was read in evidence. In rebuttal the book-keeper testified that Mayson did not pay him, that the receipt was for entries from the ledger, and that the sugar was not in it, because it had not been posted from the blotter into the ledger. They then offered in evidence the blotter and ledger. The ledger was allowed but the blotter was rejected. This blotter showed on the date of said sale a barrel of flour and one of sugar charged to Mayson with an erasure of the flour, and plaintiff offered to show by the bookkeeper that he made these entries and this erasure on the blotter at the time of the sale, and made the erasure because Howell told him Mayson would not take the flour. This evidence was rejected. Said plaintiffs and each of their other clerks testified that Mayson never paid either of them for the sugar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-6\">The Justice charged the jury, that Mayson\u2019s putting the money on the railing, would be no payment unless he gave the money to plaintiffs, or one of their clerks or agents, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>such a way that such person saw the money, and understood that it was in payment. The jury found for the defendant. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel sued out a <em>certiorari, </em>averring that the Justice erred in rejecting said evidence, and because the verdict was strongly and decidedly against the weight of the evidence. The Judge below, after argument had, dismissed the <em>certiorari, </em>and that is assigned as- error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b615-4\">Hillyer &amp; Brother, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqB\">cited 25th Ga.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">1. It is a well settled rule of law that a receipt in full of a merchant\u2019s account is not conclusive, but it may be rebutted by evidence which satisfies the Court and jury that an item of the account was left out by accident, mistake, or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">2. It was not denied in this case that the receipt in full was genuine, and was given by the book-keeper of the plaintiffs. But it was insisted that it was given under a misapprehension of the facts, and that a barrel of sugar which was not embraced in the account, to which the receipt was intended to apply, was left out by mistake, growing out of the fact that the entries upon the blotter of the day on which the sugar was delivered had not been transferred to the ledger. The defendant swore that when he got the sugar, he went to the railing around the book-keeper\u2019s desk, near the door, and saying, <em>\u201c </em>here, I will pay you for the sugar,\u201d he laid the money on the railing and came out. On cross-examination he stated that he could not remember who were there at the book-keeper\u2019s desk when he laid the money on the railing; there wei\u2019e several men inside the railing, near the desk. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>but he could not name one of them, and could not swear positively that the attention of any man connected with the house of plaintiffs was called to the money when he laid it on the railing.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">To rebut this evidence of payment, as well as the receipt, each of the partners of the firm, and all their clerks, were sworn as witnesses for plaintiff, and each testified that defendant did not pay him for the barrel of sugar. The bookkeeper (Mr. Ford) swore that the items in the receipted account were taken from the ledger, and that the reason the item of one barrel of sugar did not appear on the account was, because that item had not been posted from the blotter to the ledger. The ledger was then tendered in evidence to show that at the time the receipt was given to defendant the sales of the day on which the barrel of sugar was shown to have been bought, had not been posted from the blotter to the ledger. The correctness of the entries being sworn to by Ford, the book-keeper, the Court permitted the ledger to go in evidence to the jury. Plaintiffs then offered in evidence the blotter to show that on the day on which the barrel of sugar was shown to have been bought, there was upon it an entry of a barrel of sugar and a barrel of flour, and that the item of one barrel of flour was erased with red ink, and offered to prove by Ford that the entry was made <em>at the time </em>the goods were purchased; that he first entered the two items, the barrel of flour, and the barrel of sugar, that a moment or two after he made the entry, Howell, the salesman, told him the barrel of flour had been returned, and he immediately drew 'a red ink mark across the item, \u201cone barrel of flour.\u201d The Court ruled out, both the blotter and this evidence of Ford, as to the time when the entry was made, and refused to permit the jury to consider either. We think this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">No objection had been made to the introduction of the ledger, on the ground that plaintiffs had'not shown that they kept correct books, and it had gone in evidence to the jury. The blotter was the book of \u201coriginal entries,\u201d and we can see no reason why the ledger should have been admitted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>the blotter excluded. Indeed, we thiqk both should have gone to the jury, together with the evidence of all the witnesses who had been sworn, and that Ford should have been permitted to testify as to the time when the entry was made upon the blotter and the circumstances under which it was made, in connection with his statement that he did not receive payment for the barrel of sugar at that or any other time. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">As the question in dispute in this case was, whether the sugar was paid for on delivery, and the evidence was in conflict, I see no reason why the entry made by the bookkeeper upon the blotter <em>at the time of the purchase </em>was not admissible in corroboration of the evidence of the salesman and book-keeper, as part of the <em>res gestes. </em>In any event, we are all agreed that the Justice\u2019s Court erred in rejecting the evidence, and the Superior Court erred in dismissing the <em>certiorari. We </em>therefore reverse the judgment of the Superior Court, and direct that a new trial be ordered in the Justice\u2019s Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
