By the common law, jurors must be <em>omni exoeptione majares, </em>and it was a principal cause of challenge that one had formerly been a juror in the same cause: 3rd Bl. Com., 363. This principle of the common law was recognized and affirmed by this Court, in the case of <em>The Mayor, etc., of Columbus, </em>vs. <em>Goetchins, </em>7 <em>Ga. R., </em>139. The defendant was ignorant of the fact that the two jurors were disqualified, until <em>after the trial. </em>In our judgment, there was no error in the Court below in granting a new trial in this case, and this Court will not interfere with the exercise of its discretion in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Let the judgment of the Court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
