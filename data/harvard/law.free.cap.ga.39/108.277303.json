Sims and Charles W. Sims against the persons herein named, filed in September, 1861, made the following case: John Sims, of said county, died on the -day of-, intestate, and complainants became his administrators, and, as such, took possession of his estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>His heirs and next of kin are Martha Sims, his widow, Isham J. Sims, William G. Sims, Salina Arnold, daughter of intestate and wife of George W. Arnold, three minor children of John M. Sims, deceased, and complainants. But one difficulty in the distribution of the estate is presented. It is this: Intestate, before his death, made advancements of certain property to certain of his children, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\">To Isham J.

No value was affixed by intestate upon any of the advanced property. Charles W. Sims and Martha Sims, having received no advancements, claim that they are entitled to be made fully equal to the other children before any distribution of the estate, and that those who received said riegroes, so advanced, should account for their value at the dates of the respective advancements. The children who received the advancements, insist that because of emancipation of the slaves they should not account for the advanced slaves, and that Charles W. and Martha should be made equal to them only as to the other property so advanced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-6\">They prayed that the contesting heirs should interplead and settle this dispute so that complainants might know how to distribute the estate.

Sims answered that the statements, in the bill, were strictly true, with this addition: Martha Sims was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>third wife of the intestate, and by her, the intestate had no children. The negroes owned by her at the date of his said marriage, were kept, by intestate, separate and apart from his own, on the lands of said Martha, and he intended that said Martha should have them at his death, as George R. understood. The advancements, especially of negroes, were intended to be in kind, and not according to value. His scheme was to make his children equal by advancements in kind, and he reserved slave for those children to whom he had not made any advancements, out of whom they might take their equal shares of negroes, and testator had these negroes, as slaves, at his death. Since testator\u2019s death, all other things advanced by intestate, have been paid in equal portions to the unadvaneed heirs, and, in fact, all the heirs have received equal portions of the estate, and if the advanced heirs shall have to account for the advanced slaves, at the dates of the advancements, the unadvanced heirs will get so much as to make an unequal distribution of the estate. This defendant insists that, because of emancipation, the advancements of slaves should not be counted, and, if the slaves must be brought into hotchpot, they should be put in with all the other slaves of intestate, and the whole estate should be valued at the date of intestate\u2019s death, which was before emancipation, and the slaves owned by the intestate, at his death, should be set apart to the unadvanced heirs, till they are equal with the others as to negroes, and then the, remnant of the estate should be divided equally. This defendant is informed and believes that intestate told Charles W. Sims he might take his portion of the negroes home, and put them to work. That his scheme was to divide in kind, and that it was so understood, is evidenced by certain receipts on intestate\u2019s book of advancements, as follows: \u201cI, Charles <em>W. </em>Sims, hereby acknowledge that I have received my thousand acres of land from the estate of John Sims, to make me equal in land advanced by said dec\u2019d to his elder children. This 5th of April, 1867.\u201d Said land was received in 1862, during intestate\u2019s life. \u201c Received of G. R. Sims <em>&amp; </em>C. W. Sims, administrators on the estate of John Sims, late of Oglethorpe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>county, one thousand acres of land, making me equal to the other legatees in land given off in said John Sims\u2019 lifetime. The said land being given by commissioners appointed by the Court of Ordinary, for the purpose of making Martha Sims equal in lands. Also five thousand dollars in cash, to make Martha Sims equal in money given to the other legatees or children in John Sims\u2019 lifetime. Also two beds and furniture, one horse, bridle and saddle, two cows and calves, one thousand pounds of pork. All of the above received by G. R. Sims and C. W.

Our Code, s\u00e9ctions 2538 to 2542, settles, with precision, that a child, who has received advancements, shall account for them if he proposes to come in as a distributee, and that advancements shall be estimated at their <em>value at the time they were received, </em>unless there was a value fixed at the time, by agreement. The fact that an advancement has become valueless, by destruction, or death, or emancipation, since it was received, or that it has, by growth, or by appreciation, become more valuable, has nothing to do with it. Indeed, it would seem to be the express intent of the statute to settle this very matter, as it does, by enacting that the value of the advancement, at the time of its reception, is the criterion: Code, sec. 2542. We see no difference between the loss of a slave by death, or his depreciation in value, so as to be worth less from sickness, and his loss by the act of the government\u2014 by emancipation. It is true that the sudden emancipation of the slaves of the State, by the results of the late war, has, as to this kind of property, made the law of the Code, perhaps, an unjust one. The whole advancement has been lost, and the estate out of which the heirs are to get their portions, has suffered in the same way. So that it now often occurs that an advanced child has to account for an advancement, while those who have not been advanced, and who have lost their share of an estate by emancipation, gets compensation in other property. Several such cases, as well as the present, have come under my observation. We are inclined to think that this rule, prescribed by the Code, needs some modification, to meet the extraordinary circumstances in which we now find ourselves. But this modification is not the business of the Courts. The Code is plain and positive, and, as a general rule, experience proves that it is wise and just. And if the anomalous state of things produced by emancipation, has, as we think, in the main, true, made the rule, to some extent, unjust and inequitable, the remedy is with the Legislature, and not with the Judiciary. A Court has no power to mould the rules of law to suit the changed circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>of the country. We, therefore, are constrained to obey the law, although in this, and, perhaps, in many other instances of advancements of \u00a7laves, it is not strictly equitable. If a remedy is needed, it is for the Legislature to supply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">2. If one die without a will, the law provides how his estate shall be distributed, and nothing is a will that does not comply with the requirements of the statute. A memoorandum of the intestate, no matter how clearly proven, his dying words, in the presence of all his family, no matter how just, unless it can be proven as a will, can receive no notice from the Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">To allow these memoranda, kept by the testator, perhaps with great care and fairness, to point out how his estate shall be distributed, would be to repeal the whole law on the subject of wills and the distribution of estates. The deceased died testate, or intestate. If the former, his will must be probated according to law. If the latter, then the law points out the mode of distribution, and his wishes have nothing to do with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Suppose the book kept by him had said in express language, \u201c I wish my children to be equal at my death, and that my estate shall be divided in kind, giving each of the heirs not advanced, specific articles, such as the advanced children have gotten, and this without regard to the value of the articles.\u201d This would clearly be a will. It would dispose 6f his property differently from the disposition made by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Shall we do, by inference, that which we could not do, had the testator directed, in words, not executed as a will? Clearly not. The statute prescribes the effect of these memoranda of advancements. 1st. They are evidence of the fact of the advancement. 2nd. They are <em>prima faeie </em>evidence of its value. But they are not a will,\u2019and they can have no force as a will, because not executed as the law requires: Code, 2539.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">3. The Code, section 2542, provides that the advancements shall bear interest from the time of the first distribution. This is directed to take place in twelve months from the administration. Clearly, therefore, the first distribution is the time fixed by law for estimated the value of the advance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>ments, and the value of the estate. What the estate is worth, at that time, after paying the debts, added to the advancements brought in, and the whole divided by the number of distributees, is the share of each.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
