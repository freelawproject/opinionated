Laws 1909, c. 2, \u00a7 74, provides that, where a bank or banker charges a greater rate of interest than 6 per cent., the person paying the same, or his representative, may recover twice the amount of interest paid, if such action is brought within two1 years from the time the excess of interest is taken. It also provides that the true intent of the section is to place and continue banks and private individual bankers on an equality in the matters referred to with national banks organized under the federal laws. Under the federal statute applying to national banks, which gives the same right of recovery as the state law, the party entitled to maintain the action has been held entitled to recover twice the amount paid for usury within two years prior to the commencement Of the action, whether the amount was paid in one or several payments. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff, in an action under the state law to recover the double liability, was entitled to recover twice the amount of all usurious interest paid within two years prior to the bringing of the action, and his complaint charging several separate and distinct violations within the two years was improperly dismissed as an action for cumulative penalties.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b986-11\">[Ed.
