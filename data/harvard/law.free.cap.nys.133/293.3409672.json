She asks an injunction and an accounting. The demurrer states three grounds, to wit, that there is a misjoinder of causes of action, that there is a defect of parties plaintiff, and that the complaint states no cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> So far as concerns the objection that there is a misjoinder of causes of action, that question has already been before us on appeal from an order denying a motion to compel plaintiff to separately state her causes of action; the defendant\u2019s claim being that -plaintiff was attempting to intermingle a number of unrelated and independent causes of action based upon separate acts of the several defendants. That may be what the plaintiff seeks, but it is not what her complaint says. As was remarked by the learned justice at Special Term, who heard the motion to separately state the causes of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-12\">\u201cThe complaint sets forth a single cause of action for equitable relief, founded upon the <em>joint </em>acts of the defendants in appropriating plaintiff\u2019s proprietary rights in a dramatic composition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">The complaint does not allege separate acts of appropriation committed by the several defendants separately, and proof of such acts would not tend to establish the facts as pleaded. On other grounds, however, the demurrer' must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-14\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The plaintiff does not claim to be the sole owner of the play and the rights of production. According to her complaint she is the owner of only a one-half interest. This necessarily implies that there is in existence a co-owner or co-owners. Her allegation that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>production of the play by defendants is \u201cunlawful\u201d is, of course, merely her own conclusion, and is not the allegation of a fact. The complaint fails to point out wherein the defendant\u2019s acts are unlawful. That they produced the play without plaintiff\u2019s consent and against her objection is not sufficient, for non constat they may have acted by authority of her co-owner or co-owners, or, indeed, they or some of them may themselves be co-owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> It is settled that, with regard to property of this nature, one tenant in common has as good a right to use it, or to license third persons to use it, as has the other tenant in common, and neither can come into a court of equity and assert a superior right, unless it has been created by some contract modifying the rights which belong to the tenants in common as such. De Witt v. Elmira Nobles Mfg. Co., 66 N. Y. 459, 23 Am. Rep. 73; Clum v. Brewer, 2 Curt. 506, Fed. Cas. No. 2,909. The complaint, as it is drawn, fails to state facts showing that defendants\u2019 use of the play is unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> We are also of opinion that plaintiff\u2019s co-owner or co-owners should be made parties to the action. It is plain upon the face of the complaint that a complete determination of the controversy cannot be had in their absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to overrule the demurrer, denied, with $10 costs, with leave to plaintiff to amend her complaint within 20 days upon payment of costs in this court and at Special Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">INGRAHAM, P. J\u201e and LAUGHLJN and MILLER, JJ., concur. CLARKE, J., concurs solely upon the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
