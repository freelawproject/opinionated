The amount remaining unpaid on the judgment was $39.31, and this amount, together with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>the sum of $30 costs in the proceeding, was imposed as a fine upon the judgment debtor. Provision was made in said order for the imprisonment of the judgment debtor for 30 days in the Kings county jail, in the event that he failed to pay the fine so imposed upon him. The motion to punish the judgment debtor for contempt was based upon the examination taken in the supplementary proceedings, and the particular complaint made against him was that in answering some questions that were put to him he disclaimed knowledge or recollection of the matters covered by these questions. The order contains a recital as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">\u201cIt appearing to my satisfaction that the testimony given by the judgment debtor shows a willful and deliberate attempt to frustrate the purposes of the examination and to prevent the' ascertainment of the truth, and it appearing that the judgment debtor, Henry B. Feldberg, was willfully evading the questions by a disclaimer of knowledge or recollection of matters concerning which it is incredible that he should have wholly forgotten of personal transactions and facts that must have been within his knowledge, and it appearing to my satisfaction that such testimony was calculated to and did impair, impede, prejudice, delay, and defeat the rights and remedies of the judgment creditors herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The order then proceeds to direct the granting of the motion and contains a formal adjudication as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">\u201cAnd the judgment debtor, Henry B. Feldberg, is hereby adjudged guilty of a contempt of this court, and is hereby fined the sum of $69.31.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">I think this order is fatally defective, in that it does not contain any adjudication as to the specific facts which the county judge deemed to be a contempt of court. . If the recital in the order which has been quoted above can be deemed to be an adjudication, yet it is not an adjudication of the particular circumstances of the relator\u2019s offense, as it is but a general description of the court\u2019s impression of the whole examination of the judgment debtor. Under the rule laid down in People ex rel. Barnes v. Court of Sessions, 147 N. Y. 290, 41 N. E. 700, and People ex rel. Palmieri v. Marean, 86 App. Div. 278, 83 N. E. 843, the order from which the judgment debtor appeals seems fatally defectivq.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">The determination should be annulled, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
