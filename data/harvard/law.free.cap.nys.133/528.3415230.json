The employment of plaintiff\u2019s assignor was by the appellant Poerschke. There is no evidence that he was authorized by the owner to employ the broker, or that the owner knew, or had been informed at any time prior to the sale, that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor had been employed as a broker, or had been instrumental in effecting a sale. The owner cannot be held liable to a broker for commissions on mere proof of the fact that the broker was instrumental in procuring a purchaser for the premises, where there is no evidence of employment, and the purchaser comes to the owner through another person, with whom all of the negotiations, so far as the owner is concerned, were had. It does not appear what interest, if any, the appellant Poerschke had in the premises; but the evidence tends to show an employment by him of plaintiff\u2019s assignor as if he were the owner, and that plaintiff\u2019s assignor obtained a purchaser for the premises on his terms, and that is sufficient to sustain the verdict against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The judgment and order appealed from, therefore, as to the defendant Poerschke, should be affirmed, with costs to the respondent. For the reasons already assigned, however, the judgment and order must be reversed as to the appellant Fuchs, and a new trial granted, with costs to her to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
