Proc. \u00a7 820. From an order of the County Court of Kings county substituting William Kolmel as defendant in this action, and discharging the present defendant from liability to either plaintiff or said Kolmel, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-21\"><bracketnum>[1-3]</bracketnum> The order cannot be sustained, for three reasons: First. No notice was given to said Kolmel of this application. This is essential. Bullowa v. Provident Life &amp; Trust Co., 125 App. Div. 545, 109 N. Y. Supp. 1058. The order contains a recital that it was made upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Kolmel\u2019s consent. There is no evidence thereof. Second. The affidavit fails to show that Kolmel\u2019s claim to the boat is \u201cwithout collusion.\u201d There is neither express assertion to that effect nor a statement of facts and circumstances from which such conclusion can be reasonably drawn. This is also essential. Boskowitz v. Boskowitz, 124 App. Div. 849, 109 N. Y. Supp. 490; Helene v. Corn Exchange Bank, 96 App. Div. 392, 89 N. Y. Supp. 310. Third. The order contains no provision for the delivery of the property or of its value by defendant to such person as the court directs. The moving affidavit asserts that Kolmel, and not defendant, has possession of the boat, and has had since August 2, 1911. Direction for the actual delivery thereof could not, therefore, be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> But an action of replevin will lie against one who has voluntarily and wrongfully transferred- the possession of property of another which upon demand he is bound to deliver. Sinnott v. Feiock, 165 N. Y. 444, 59 N. E. 265, 53 L. R. A. 565, 80 Am. St. Rep. 736; Nichols v. Michael, 23 N. Y. 264, 80 Am. Dec. 259; Barnett v. Selling, 70 N. Y. 492. In such case the alternative provision of the statute, that the value of the property which is the subject of the litigation must be delivered to such person as the court directs, becomes applicable. This defect is likewise fatal. Mason v. Rice, 85 App. Div. 315, 82 N. Y. Supp. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs, without prejudice to an application to the county court to renew the motion upon sufficient papers and upon such terms as may be just. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
