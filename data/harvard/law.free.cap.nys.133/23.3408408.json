The contract, after reciting the retainer of the attorney, provided for his compensation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">\u201cIn consideration of Ms services (I) agree to pay and assign to said attorney twenty per cent, of any amount that may be awarded for said property over and above the city expert\u2019s lowest appraisal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">It is not denied that the attorney faithfully rendered the services for which he was employed, and that his client benefited thereby. By virtue of the provisions of the Greater New York charter and the appropriate resolution by the board of estimate and apportionment, title to the property vested in the city of New York on April' 1, 1909, but the report of the commissioners of estimate was not filed until June 15, 1911.' By the terms of section 990 of the Greater New York charter (Laws 1901, c. 466), in cases in which title to property acquired vests in the city before the report of the commissioners is filed, it is provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">\u201cInterest at the legal rate upon the sum or sums to which the owners, lessees, parties or persons are justly entitled upon the date of vesting title in the city of New York as aforesaid, from said date to the date of the report of the commissioners of estimate shall be allowed by the commissioners as part of the compensation to which such owners, lessees, parties or persons are entitled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The commissioners in the case at bar awarded to the property owner as the sum to which he was justly entitled upon the date of vesting of title in the city the sum of $49,000, to which they added, under the terms of the statute above quoted, legal interest to the date of filing their report amounting to $6,492.50, making a total award of $55,492.50, which then constituted the total award to the property owner. The city called but one expert witness as to value, and he estimated the value of the property at $45,738. The attorney claims, and the Special Term has upheld him, that what he is entitled to is 20 per cent, of the difference between the foregoing valuation by the city\u2019s expert, and the total award made to his client, including the interest. The client contends that the attorney is only entitled to 20 per cent, of the difference between the city\u2019s valuation and the estimate of value made by the commissioners as of the date on which the city acquired title, plus interest upon that 20 per cent, from the date of the vesting of title to the date of filing of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Although it is not so stated in the moving papers, it is undoubtedly the fact that the agreement for compensation was prepared by the attorney. \u2018Assuming this to be so, the instrument, if capable of more than one construction, is to be construed most strongly in favor of the client. Hitchings v. Van Brunt, 38 N. Y. 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is true that under the terms of the statute interest upon the value fixed upon the property as at the date of the acquisition of title is included in the term \u201ccompensation,\u201d but that fact does not, as it seems to us, conclusively establish the effect to be given to the contract \"of employment. What the client. contracted for was the skill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>labor, and experience of the attorney in procuring as large an award from the commissioners as possible. Such service could only affect the matter which lay within the judgment of the commissioners which was limited to the determination of the value of the property at the date upon which the city acquired title. That having been determined, interest followed automatically. The best <em>efforts </em>of the attorney could affect only the determination arrived at by the commissioners as to the value of the property, at the time title vested. Whatever testimony they took must have been as to the value at that time, and the evidence of the city\u2019s expert as to value must have had reference to the same time. If the commissioners had accepted the valuation of the city\u2019s expert, the attorney\u2019s efforts to procure a larger award would have been fruitless, yet interest upon the amount- would have followed as a matter of course, and would have been included in the award as compensation. In that case it would certainly not have been within the reasonable contemplation of the parties that the attorney should receive 20 per cent, of the interest. When the attorney agreed to base his fee upon a comparison between the amount awarded for the property and the lowest estimate made by the city\u2019s expert, the reasonable construction of the contract is that he was to receive 20 per cent, of the amount his client gained by reason of his services, over the award he would have gained if the city\u2019s lowest appraisal had been accepted, and the attorney had rendered no services in the matter. In other words, the client was to pay 20 per cent, of the advantage which accrued to him in consequence of the attorney\u2019s employment. It is not without significance that the contract does not use the word \u201ccompensation.\u201d What is to determine the fee is the lowest appraisal by the city\u2019s expert, and \u201cany amount which may be awarded for said property.\u201d The amount awarded for the property by the commissioners was $49,000, the balance of the final award was added by force of the statute, and included in the total compensation not because the commissioners awarded, it but because the statute added it to their award. In our opinion the construction of the contract contended for by the appellant is the proper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\">The order appealed from will therefore be modified so as to direct the payment to the attorney of the sum of $738.73, with interest from June 15, 1911, and, as modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">INGRAHAM, P.
