Both sides appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The propriety and usefulness of the new Code provision permitting motions for several kinds of relief are demonstrated by these papers. It is quite evident, upon the face of the complaint and from the affidavits of the moving party, which sets up that defendants were mere middlemen, that, the first transaction having occurred over eight years ago and the mutual dealings having extended over a number of years and involved a large number of separate shipments, the defendant is entitled to some one of the reliefs asked for. I think that it is apparent that a large number of causes of action have been united in one allegation, and that there could not have been .one sale, or one set of fraudulent misrepresentations. The defendants claim that they are entitled to set up against many of these causes of action the statute of limitations and against others the defense of accord and satisfaction; that this they are quite unable to do, unless the complaint is put in proper shape.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> If I am right, and a series of separate transactions are embraced within the allegations of this complaint, then undoubtedly each such transaction constitutes a separate cause of action, and the motion of the defendant to compel the plaintiff to separately state and number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>such causes of action should have been granted. If, on the other hand, the plaintiff intends to claim that there was but one transaction, and that the delivery of this enormous quantity of material of upwards-of 30,000,000 pounds, which extended over a period of upwards of four years, was the result of one sale, preceded or accompanied by false and fraudulent representations, why then the motion to make the complaint more definite and certain, so as to clearly allege said claim, should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> A bill of particulars is rarely granted before answer, and only under special and unusual circumstances. The complaint should certainly be made more definite and certain. If it should then appear that separate contracts of purchase and sale are sued upon, they must be separately stated and numbered, and will contain the particulars required by the motion made for that purpose, and there will be no need for a bill of particulars in addition thereto before answer. . If, however, the complaint, when made more definite and certain, should clearly show that but one contract is sued upon, then we are of opinion that the transaction is of that peculiar and unusual character which warrants the granting of an order for a bill of particulars. As both parties have appealed, this court is enabled to apply the new remedy provided in the amended section of the Code referred to supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The order appealed from should be modified, to provide that the plaintiff make its complaint more definite and certain in the respects referred to, and, if there be more than one contract sued on, to separately state and number its several causes of action, and, as so modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the defendant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
