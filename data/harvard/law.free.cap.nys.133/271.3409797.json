The defendant sets up a counterclaim for damages sustained by the plaintiff\u2019s negligence, inattention, and want of skill, and asserts that, by reason thereof, the costs of satisfying said liens and charges and of completing the building was $115,-000, whereas it should have been only $90,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The plaintiff must prove performance of his contract, and, of course, should not be permitted to limit the defendant\u2019s proof on that issue. He was therefore not entitled to the particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence and failure to perform his agreement. However, it will be exceedingly difficult for the plaintiff to prepare to meet the defendant\u2019s claim for damages unless apprised of the particulars thereof. That claim is based upon the alleged excess in the cost of completing an apartment house and in satisfying various liens and charges thereon over what should have been expended. It may involve the claims of one or of any number of materialmen and contractors. If the defendant is able to support his claim with proof, he should be able to furnish the plaintiff the particulars of it, whereas the plaintiff will be at a great disadvantage, unless he knows the items making up the defendant\u2019s claims. \u25a0 While it is not often practicable to furnish the items of a claim for general damages and for that reason such particulars are not usually required (Oliver Refining Company v. Aspegren, 140 App. Div. 549, 125 N. Y. Supp. 796), we think this case does not fall within that rule. The damages claimed in this case are, in a sense, special damages. The defendant will have to prove the specific items of excess cost, caused by the plaintiff\u2019s negligence, inattention, or failure to perform his contract, and should therefore be required to furnish the plaintiff those items. Hopper v. Weber, 84 App. Div. 266, 82 N. Y. Supp. 567; Kelly v. St. Michael\u2019s Roman Catholic Church, 124 App. Div. 505, 108 N. Y. Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>927. Upon critical examination, the cases relied upoii by th\u00e9 learned justice at Special Term and by the respondent on this motion will be found to support the conclusion we have reached. See Reitmayer v. Crombie, 94 App. Div. 303, 87 N. Y. Supp. 973; O\u2019Rourke v. United States Mortgage &amp; Trust Co., 95 App. Div. 518, 88 N. Y. Supp. 926; Brandt v. City of New York, 99 App. Div. 260, 90 N. Y. Supp. 929; Radcliffe v. New York Cab Co., 134 App. Div. 450, 119 N. Y. Supp. 251. In the first case cited the counterclaim was only for the sum of $350, and the court reversed an order requiring the defendant to specify the respects in which the plaintiff had failed to perform the contract. In Brandt v. City of New York, the defendant had not set up a counterclaim, but in that and the two other cases cited particulars were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The order 'Should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, requiring the defendant to furnish particulars of the items making up the sum of $25,000 in excess of the amount which the defendant claims was the reasonable cost of completing the building and satisfying liens and charges thereon, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
