The plaintiff\u2019s testimony sufficiently shows that he was authorized to sell the plant originally for $9,000, payable during a period of three years; that in the course of negotiations which he conducted between defendant and a prospective buyer, defendant reduced the price to $8,500, payable $500 down, $2,000 on delivery of the plant, and $500 every three months thereafter. On these terms plaintiff brought a buyer, who was ready, able, and willing to purchase, to the defendant, and, after the terms were stated, the buyer, having looked through the plant, said that he was satisfied, and the parties shook hands on it. It appears that some hitch occurred through defendant\u2019s demands in regard to a chattel mortgage, which he made after consultation with his lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">The learned trial judge dismissed the complaint on the theory that although, as he said, \u201cthe plaintiff had made out a very go.od case,\u201d he had not shown why the transaction was not carried out. \u201cHe was employed to procure a customer. He did procure a customer. The customer is ready, willing, and able to carry out the contract. Now, the burden is not on the defendant\u2014it is not for the defendant now to prove\u2014that it was not his fault that the contract was not carried out. The burden is on you [plaintiff] in the first instance to show why it was not carried out.\u201d This, however, is not a correct statement of the law applicable to this case. No such burden is imposed upon the plaintiff. On the very statement of the learned judge, plaintiff had mad'e out a prima facie case, and it was error to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
