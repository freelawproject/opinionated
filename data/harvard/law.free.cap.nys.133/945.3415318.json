The complaint was dismissed, apparently because no architect\u2019s certificate was furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Plaintiff alleged that the requirement of the contract that an architect\u2019s certificate be furnished before each payment was waived. The architect testified that he gave no certificate, because his work was finished when he drew the plans and specifications; that he refused to supervise the work; that he never examined it; that he could not issue a certificate without going to the job, and unless he was paid for doing so; and that he would not do it, because it was a small job, and he did not care to look after a lot of small contractors he knew nothing about. The agreement contemplated that defendant should employ an architect, whose duty it would be to pass upon the question whether the work was performed according to contract. When an owner fails to employ such architect, the contractor is not obliged to furnish a certificate. Thomas v. Fleury, 26 N. Y. 26-34; Haden v. Coleman, 73 N. Y. 567, 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Judgment -reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
