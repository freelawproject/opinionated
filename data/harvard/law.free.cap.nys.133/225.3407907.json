The answer substantially denies the performance of the contract by the plaintiff and sets up two counterclaims for damages. The order directs an examination of defendant\u2019s president, who verified the answer, and its treasurer. In the affidavit upon which the order was granted, it was stated that the examination is \u201cmaterial and necessary to enable plaintiff to properly prepare for the trial of the above-entitled action,\u201d for the reason, in substance, that two counterclaims were set up, and that the examination was desired for the purpose of \u201cavoiding and properly defending these two counterclaims.\u201d The affidavit then proceeds to state the facts which the plaintiff expects to prove by the examination. Those statements of fact are precisely the opposite of the statements of fact contained in the defendant\u2019s verified answer. It seems to us manifest that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>examination was not applied for in good faith in the expectation that material and necessary testimony for the plaintiff would be elicited, and the rule is now definitely settled that an examination of an adverse party before trial is only allowed to enable the party applying for the examination to obtain testimony to establish his case or defense, as the case may be, or to meet and overcome the case or defense of the other party. The purpose of the examination is not to enable one party to pry into the case or defense of his adversary. No reasonable ground is shown to believe that the defendant\u2019s president will swear directly to the contrary of what he has sworn in the answer. See Weeks v. Whitney, 131 N. Y. Supp. 408. If orders Jor examination of adverse parties are to be granted upon applications like this, the effect will be virtually to amend the Code of Civil Procedure, so as to permit either party to. examine his adversary at will. While that might be desirable, the Legislature has not as yet so provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
