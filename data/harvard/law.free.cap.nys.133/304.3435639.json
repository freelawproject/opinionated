Greater New York Charter (Laws 1901, c. 466) \u00a7 406, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-14\">\u201cEach superintendent of buildings within the limits of his appropriation shall have power to appoint * * * such chief inspector of buildings * * * as in his judgment may be necessary and proper. * * * Each superintendent of buildings may designate a chief inspector of buildings who, during the absence or inability of such superintendent shall possess all the powers and perform all his duties so far as they relate to buildings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">A reading of the entire section makes it clear that the duties of the superintendent of buildings as therein defined may be divided into two categories: (1) To enforce rules, regulations, ordinances, ami charter provisions relating to buildings; and (2) to appoint, discipline, and remove subordinates. It is only to the first category that the power of the acting superintendent extends; nor is this a strange limitation, for the classes of acts therein required to be performed are such as call for prompt, and often immediate, action upon the part of the superintendent, and it is to secure such action that he is allowed to name a chief inspector, who takes his place in that regard during his absence or disability; while it would be anomalous to permit him to change the personnel of the subordinates by removal and appointment during the merely temporary absence of the superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>That this is the proper construction to be given to the language employed is confirmed by a consideration of the prior statutory provisions in this respect. Under Consolidation Act (Laws 1882, c. 410) \u00a7 514, as amended by Laws 1887, c. 566, \u00a7 37, it was provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">\u201cThe deputy superintendent of buildings, to be designated by the superintendent, shall act as superintendent of buildings in case of the absence of the superintendent from his office, and shall while so acting possess all the powers in this title vested in or imposed upon the superintendent of buildings.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">By the Greater New York charter of 1897 it was provided (section 648):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">\u201cEach commissioner may designate a superintendent of buildings, who, during the absence or inability of such commissioner, shall possess all the power and perform all the duties of such commissioner.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The provision in its present form was first introduced into the charter in 1901. Having in mind the significant language used, and the imposition of a limitation not contained in the earlier enactments, it seems plain that the acting superintendent has no power to remove subordinates in the building department.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The order appealed from must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs, and the motion for a peremptory writ of mandamus granted, with $10 costs, in so far as it seeks a direction for the reinstatement of the relator to his position. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
