The threat is obvious in its purpose to injure. There was an unlawful demand of money to be delivered at a definite time and place, with a statement that, if Caruso failed, the night would not pass. There is no doubt of the menace in the words, which, though intended to be lurking, is plain. The night would pass, but it would not pass for the intended victim. The threat to kill is not lost in the grandiloquence of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> The more practical and useful discussion relates to the sufficiency of the indictment. I consider that it was unnecessary to allege the letters in extenso, but Did the indictment legally charge the crime of attempted extortion in view of the fact that it was attempted by writings ? Extortion as defined by section 850 of the penal law may be committed by either written or oral threat. Section 851, Penal Law. So attempted extortion may be by written or oral threat, but, if the threat be written, the offense is a felony. If oral, it was at the time a misdemeanor. Section 857, Penal Law. So the law remained until section 851 was amended by chapter 121, Laws of 1911. The offense is in either case extortion, but extortion by oral threat was made exceptional by section 857, in that it was graded as a mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>demeanor. If the indictment would charge extortion, it is sufficient to set it out as the statute defines it, and so now as to an attempt to commit it. People v. Weldon, 111 N. Y. 569, 574, 19 N. E. 279. While section 857 remained applicable to 851, attempt by oral threats was made a crime of a lesser degree. But this did not require that the indictment should specially plead that an attempt was in writing to bring it under sections 850-852 and 261, as it fell within the purview of the sections, and its connection therewith was' not disturbed by the disconnection of verbal attempts from section 852. In People ex rel. Perry v. Gillette, 200 N. Y. 275, 93 N. E. 953, the indictment showed the oral threats, and it was decided that the defendant was triable by the Police Court, and that he was not legally held to answer to the indictment. But the present discussion does not concern an oral threat, which, for purposes of grading it, is made an exception to the principal offense. A case already within the body of a statute and pleadable as such would not be disturbed by the withdrawal from the statute of a class of cases to which it does not belong. The indictment charges the crime, and the acts that constitute it. It was not necessary to describe that the offense was a felony and not a misdemeanor by negativing the latter and affirming the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The judgment of conviction should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
