The complaint alleges that the plaintiff is a foreign corporation; but neither the complaint nor the answer alleges that the plaintiff was doing business in this state, or that the goods were sold or delivered within the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-10\">The contract sued on, to deliver goods \u201cf. o. b.\u201d in Illinois, was an Illinois contract. See 35 Cyc. 174; Cahen v. Platt, 69 N. Y. 348, 25 Am. Rep. 212. The learned trial judge dismissed the complaint, on the ground that the plaintiff corporation was doing business within the state, and had not obtained a certificate as required by section 15 of the General Corporation Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 23). There was\u2019 no evidence on which to base the finding, and the dismissal of the complaint was error. See Bremer v. Ring, 146 App. Div. 724, 131 N. Y. Supp. 487; Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Foster, 133 N. Y. Supp. 1072 (Appellate Term, February, 1912); Acorn Brass Mfg. Co. v. Rutenberg, 132 N. Y.
