There is no dispute about the employment, but it is claimed by defendant that the plaintiff was employed to eiject a particular thing, namely, to make plans which would be approved by the bureau of buildings, and providing for such construction as would not be a violation of any other person\u2019s rights and would accord with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-20\">The learned court below, in deciding the case, said that plaintiff himself had testified that by his plan at least eight inches of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>struction proposed by him encroached on the adjoining lot. From an examination of the plans and testimony, it is apparent that this was a mistake, in view of the evidence. The projection of eight inches was in the rear of the building and entirely on defendant\u2019s lot. The plans drawn by plaintiff showed a flue within a party wall, which is a lawful use of a party wall. De Baun v. Moore, 32 App. Div. 397, 52 N. Y. Supp. 1092, affirmed 167 N. Y. 598, 60 N. E. 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Because of this misapprehension of the testimony in a material particular, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
