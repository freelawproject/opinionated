J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ask\">At the beginning of trial the Special Term granted a motion made by those defendants who were the owners of the realty, to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The complaint comprises two counts: First, for the foreclosure of a mechanic\u2019s lien; and, second, for a personal judgment against the defendant Johnstone upon his writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> In the first count the plaintiff declares as a subcontractor, but fails to allege that at the time the lien was filed or thereafter any sum of money was due from the owners to the contractor. I think that this was a fatal defect. Ball &amp; Wood Company v. Clark &amp; Sons Co., 31 App. Div. 356, 52 N. Y. Supp. 443; Brainard v. County of Kings, 155 N. Y. 538 at page 545, 50 N. E. 263; Maneely v. City of New York, 119 App. Div. 376-378, 105 N. Y. Supp. 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> But the motion as made and when made is regarded practically as a demurrer and should not have been granted unless it appeared after admission of all the facts alleged \u201cno cause of action whatever\u201d was pleaded. Abbott v. Easton, 195 N. Y. 372, 88 N. E. 572. I am inclined to the view that despite the keen and justifiable criticism of the learned counsel for the respondents, there was a cause of action stated against the defendant Johnstone.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The skeleton of the plea is as follows: Prior to April 29th, the- plaintiff contracted with the Builders &amp; Craftsmen Company, with the knowledge and consent of defendants Johnstone and White, for certain materials for the construction of a building upon the specified premises of the defendants. Pursuant thereto the plaintiff supplied material, a part of the price was paid, on November 9, 1909, the plaintiff demanded payment of the specified balance then due, and the said company executed a written order upon Johnstone for $1,600, which Johnstone accepted and agreed to pay. The order set forth was addressed to Johnstone, dated November 9, 1909, and read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-12\">\u201cPlease reserve and deduct from the final payment due us under the contract with you for erecting residence at Manhasset, L. I., the sum of sixteen hundred dollars ($1,600.00) and' pay the same to the Wood Mfg. and Realty Company of Long Island on account of goods delivered and to be delivered by them on\" said job, \u201cand when so paid the foregoing shall act as your receipt, * * * and we shall receive credit for same from the said Wood Mfg. &amp; Realty Company of Long Island. Builders &amp; Craftsmen Company. Accepted: G. L. Johnstone.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">The order was accepted, thereafter filed by the plaintiff and docketed in the lien book, and Johnstone promised and agreed to pay the plaintiffs the amount of said order. The plaintiff then pleads upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>information and belief .that a!t' the time of the making and acceptance ;of'sTaid order\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\">\u201csome contractual relationship existed between'the Builders &amp; Craftsmen Company and- the defendants Johnstone and' White, and that by reason thereof the said defendant Gilbert <em>L. </em>Johnstohe. had in his possession 'moneys belonging to the Builders &amp; Craftsmen Company, and that\" by reason thereof promised and agreed to pay the amount expressed in'the said order and did by his acceptance thereof obligate himself to the payment; of the* same, and induced this plaintiff to rely upon the .credit of the same and, continue in furnishing said material; that as this plaintiff is now informed and \"verily believes that the said moneys are still in the\u00bb hands of the said Johnstone applicable to the payment of the amount expressed in the said&lt; order, and the whole amount thereof is now due, owing, and payable from thejs\u00e1id defendant to this plaintiff.\u201d .; \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 . \"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The criticism of the respondents is that the order is payable out of a particular fund, and that there is no allegation that the fund ever became due. It is said that the \u201csaid moneys\u201d refers back to the moneys' described in the first part of-the ple\u00e1, alleged to have been due when' the order was given; that the words \u201capplicable to the payment of the said order\u201d are a mere conclusion of law; that \u201cit appears affirmatively that <em>said moneys' </em>which plaintiff alleges were due were some intermediate payment, for they were alleged to be due at the time of giving the order when there still remained work to be done\u201d; that there may have been funds from other sources in John-stone\u2019s hands, and that whether these were applicable was a conclusion of law. Money \u201capplicable\u201d has been construed to mean money which one was entitled to have applied in payment.. Webster v. Am. Bible Society, 50 Ohio St. 1, 33 N. E. 297: \u201cAn allegation that a sum is- due, if by the context it appears to mean merely that a person is indebted, is a mere conclusion,- and bad on demurrer except where sanctioned by statute; but where facts constituting indebted-ness are substantially alleged, \u2018\u2018due\u2019 may be understood to mean payable, and is an allegation of fact sufficient to show maturity of' the debt.\u201d Abbott\u2019s Brief on the Pleadings, 238. See, too, Buehler v. Pierce, 175 N. Y. at page 266, 67 N. E. 573. I think, reading the entire count, that we may construe the final allegations thereof that .the moneys were \u201capplicable, due, owing, and payable\u201d as sufficient to \u2019 charge the existence of the specific fund against which the order Was directed. Smith v. Milton, 133 Mass. 369; and see generally Williamson v. Wager, 90 App. Div. at page 189, 86 N. Y. Supp. 684, citing Bliss on Code Pleading, 213; Rochester Ry. Co. v. Robinson, 133 N. Y. 246, 30 N. E. 1008. If the conclusions were to be regarded of fact, and the defendant desired definiteness and certainty, the remedy was a motion for that purpose. Eppley v. Kennedy, 198 N. Y. at page 351, 91 N. E. 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Further, if the complaint contained allegations sufficient to constitute a cause of action for goods sold and delivered, a personal judgment may be gained as in an action on a contract. Abbott v. Easton, 195 N. Y. at page 376, 88 N. E. 572. While the pleading is not to be '.commended, I am inclined to the view that it contains enough to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>port assumpsit. The prayer is sufficient. Jensen on Mechanics\u2019 Liens, 213, and authorities gited.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The judgment should be reversed, without costs, and a new trial should be granted, costs to abide the final award of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
