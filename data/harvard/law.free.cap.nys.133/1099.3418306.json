The appellant\u2019s brief on the motion to set aside the judgment is mainly taken up with a discussion of the weight of evidence as to whether or not a contract was actually made between plaintiff and defendant. On this point the verdict of the jury might well be taken as conclusive, but for erroneous rulings excluding relevant testimony bearing upon this question at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-15\">Plaintiff testified as to an oral contract made with the defendant, whereby plaintiff agreed to furnish defendant, and defendant employed plaintiff to furnish him, with the necessary materials and labor for concrete footing and rubble foundation walls for a new building to be erected by defendant at the agreed price of $675. Plaintiff testified that, pursuant to said agreement, he commenced work, expended moneys, and hired help, but was prevented by defendant from completing the contract, whereby plaintiff was damaged in the sum of $156. Defendant contended that the conversation with plaintiff did not result in the making of a contract, but was merely a preliminary discussion of terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-16\">The evidence shows that the defendant, following such preliminary discussion, prepared a written contract, which was never signed by the plaintiff, but upon which it was proven that plaintiff made numerous corrections. Defendant\u2019s counsel, with a view to showing there was no meeting of the minds of plaintiff and defendant as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>the essentials of a contract, asked the plaintiff numerous questions based upon the written contract and upon plaintiff\u2019s written corrections thereof. This evidence was excluded, on the ground that such contract was not signed by, and did not bind, the plaintiff. The questions which were excluded, however, were clearly permissible and relevant on cross-examination,' as going to the probabilities of plaintiff\u2019s testimony that an oral contract had been entered into between himself and the defendant. The exclusion of this evidence was, therefore, prejudicial to the defendant, and constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
