Section 16, Tenement House Law (chapter 9, Laws 1909 [Con-sol. Laws 1909, c. 61]). However, it may be possible that the attachment of the clothes dryer to the fire escape in such a manner that a person using it might fall through the opening, was either itself negligence or presented a situation calling upon the defendant to exercise some care to prevent such a casualty. It is impossible to determine that question without knowing precisely what the situation was, and it may be that under the averments of negligence above quoted the plaintiff may be able to prove some act or omission constituting negligence. The authorities bearing upon the question as to what constitutes a sufficient averment of negligence are collated, and the rule to be deduced from them is plainly stated, by Mr. Justice Thomas in Pagnillo v. Mack Paving &amp; Construction Company, 142 App. Div. 491, 127 N. Y. Supp. 72. The learned counsel for the appellant virtually concedes that the averments of negligence are sufficient. He states in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">\u201cThe question is not whether defendant was guilty of negligence in the construction or maintenance of fire escapes or clothes dryers on the premises, but whether the complaint alleges facts showing that defendant was under any imposed duty to plaintiff\u2019s intestate to exercise care in the construction or maintenance of the fire escapes or dryers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is undoubtedly the rule that, where a violation of duty is claimed, the existence of the duty or obligation must be shown. It was therefore necessary for the plaintiff to plead facts from which it could be inferred that the defendant owed the plaintiff\u2019s intestate some duty with respect to the maintenance of the clothes dryer and fire escape. A general averment that the defendant owed a particular duty, or that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was lawfully on the defendant\u2019s premises, would not suffice. City of Buffalo v. Holloway, 7 N. Y. 493, 57 Am. Dec. 550; Petty v. Emery, 96 App. Div. 35, 88 N. Y. Supp. 823. It is averred that the clothes dryer was used in common by the tenants of the rear apartments. It doubtless might be inferred from that averment that the defendant owed a duty to those tenants and their servants to maintain it in a reasonably safe condition. But the complaint nowhere alleges that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was a tenant of one of the rear apartments, or the servant of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>of such tenants. The plaintiff asks us to infer that his intestate was a servant of the tenant in the front of whose apartment the dryer was attached; but there is no fact stated from which that fact is to be inferred, unless we indulge in supposition. If it was the fact, it could easily have been stated; and, while pleadings are liberally construed, it is still necessary that all the essential ultimate facts be stated, so that the court may determine whether, if the statements are true, the plaintiff has a cause of action, and the defendant may be informed of what he is to meet. We cannot supply an essential fact by supposition or guesswork. If the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was a mere licensee, the facts stated are insufficient to show that the defendant omitted to perform any duty which he owed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
