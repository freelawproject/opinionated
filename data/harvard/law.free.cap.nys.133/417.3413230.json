No motion to amend the pleadings was made by the defendant, and the court granted the motion for judgment oh the .pleadings. The motion for judgment was made under section. 547 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Apart from the question as to whether or not such a motion could properly be made in' the Municipal Court (see Maune v. Unity Press, 139 App. Div. 740, 124 N. Y. Supp. 504), we are of the opinio,n that the judgment appealed from should be reversed. :..</p>\n<p id=\"b459-24\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> In so far as the facts alleged in the .answer were pleaded as a defense to the action,, - they were properly held to be insufficient by the learned court below.

The partial eviction of the defendant by the plaintiff was a violation of this covenant, which gave rise to an independent cause of action on the part of the tenant. It was, therefore, a cause of action arising out of the contract or transaction set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and consequently was the proper subject of a counterclaim in this action. Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 501, subd. 1; Mayor v. Mabie, 13 N. Y. 151, 64 Am. Dec. 538; Zbarazer Realty Co. v. Brandstein, 61 Misc. Rep. 623, 625, 113 N. Y. Supp. 1078; O\u2019Gorman v.
