We agree with the learned trial court that, upon the theory upon which the case was tried and has been presented upon the appeal, the payment was made in violation of the statute. There is evidence in the record which might afford ground for the contention that the Gotham Hotel Company was operating the hotel as agent of its landlord, and that the payment to appellant by the Gotham Hotel Company was made by it as agent of the Fifty-Fifth Street Company; but, since that point is not taken by appellant, we express no opinion thereon. We are of opinion, however, that, even on the theory that the Hotel Gotham Company was operating the hotel in its own right, the recovery against appellant is excessive. It is true that he admitted by Iiis answer that he received the $5,000 to his own use; but upon the trial he was permitted, without objection and exception, to give evidence tending to prove that on or about the same day he returned to \u2022the company $1,100 of the $5,000 for rent of rooms occupied by his family and himself and for their board during the time he was living at the hotel as manager, and that under the agreement by which he was employed he was entitled to the free use of the rooms and to board, and to the $5,000, in addition thereto. This evidence was not controverted. The learned counsel for the respondent contends that the appellant was not entitled to a deduction on account of this payment for the reason that he did not plead the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The parties by mutual consent, in effect, modified the plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>ings, and therefore the rights of the appellant must be determined on the appeal as if the answer had been duly amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Moreover, if, as the evidence tends to show, it was contemplated'by the appellant\u2019s employment that he should not be charged for such accommodations dnd board, it would not have been a violation of the statute to have allowed him the use of looms and the board; and, if that were the agreement, there could have been no recovery by the receiver of the hotel company therefor under the statute in question if appellant had not paid over the money. We cannot, therefore, adopt respondent\u2019s theory that the appellant should be left to present his claim to the receiver for the payment made under a mistake or misapprehension, either with respect to the law or the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">The findings are insufficient to warrant this court in modifying the judgment, and therefore it should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event, unless the respondent stipulates- to reduce the recovery by the sum of $1,100, and interest thereon from said 8th day of May, 1908, and, if so stipulated, the judgment is modified accordingly and affirmed, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
