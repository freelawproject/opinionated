The designer of the defendant\u2019s label certainly displayed great ingenuity in producing a label which would closely resemble, without actually copying, plaintiff\u2019s label; but, to justify the interposition of equity, it is not necessary that a label should be copied. It is sufficient that the resemblance is such that it is calculated to deceive the ordinary purchaser, under the conditions generally prevailing in the particular traffic to which the controversy relates. Vulcan v. Mayers, 139 N. Y. 364, 34 N. E. 904; Fischer v. Blank, 138 N. Y. 244, 33 N. E. 1040; Anargyros v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>Egyptian Cigarette Co., 54 App. Div. 345, 66 N. Y. Supp. 626; Dutton &amp; Co. v. Cupples, 117 App. Div. 172, 102 N. Y. Supp. 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">There is so little doubt about the defendant\u2019s label that its use should be enjoined at once, without awaiting the result of a trial. The other features of defendant\u2019s bottle of which complaint is made are not so obviously unlawful as is the label, and the question of enjoining the use of them, or any of them, may well be left to be determined upon the trial. If the use of the label be discontinued, the other features, standing alone, may not be found to be objectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for an injunction pendente lite granted, to the extent above indicated. Settle order on notice. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
