The purpose of the statute was to prevent a plaintiff from harassing a defendant by prosecuting different suits for causes of action which could be joined.\u201d Miller v. Baillard, 124 App. Div. 555, 108 N. Y. Supp. 973. The imposing of terms upon defendant was therefore improper; also the provision that, if successful, the plaintiff should be entitled to tax costs in all four actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">The order should therefore be modified, by striking out that part of the order appealed from, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs, but with disbursements to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
