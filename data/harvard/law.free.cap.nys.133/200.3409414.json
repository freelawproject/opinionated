Plaintiff obtained an order for the examination of the defendant before trial. The order for the bill of particulars gave plaintiff 10 days after the conclusion of the examination of the defendant within which to comply with it. After the close of the examination, plaintiff served the bill of particulars which the defendant claims is not a compliance with the order. It is so manifest that the bill of particulars served is not a compliance with the order that we do not deem it necessary to set out in detail the provisions of the order or the particulars served, and point out- in each instance the omission. One or two items will fairly illustrate the manner in which the plaintiff has failed to comply with the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The order required that the plaintiff state the names of its representatives to whom it is claimed defendant made false and fraudulent statements, giving the times and places and the substance of each statement. The bill of particulars gives the names of three individuals and the place as plaintiff\u2019s bank, and 24 dates; and with respect to the substance of each of the false and fraudulent' statements the bill of particulars merely states that some were verbal and some were in writing, that the written statements were retained by defendant and plaintiff has no copy, and that each was to the effect \u201cthat there had been earned at said time under the plaintiff\u2019s contract a sum of money largely in excess of the sum of money then demanded and provided to be paid at that time,\u201d and that the statements on January 7, 1908, were verbal and in writing, and those in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>writing related to \u201cthe contract price of the several subcontracts, as to the amount of labor, and as to the amount of the incidental bills,\u201d and that \u201call other details of the work were there represented as true and correct,\u201d and plaintiff relying thereon paid out $19,866 \u201cadditionally and in excess of the amount already paid out in excess of the amounts due at that time.\u201d The order also required the plaintiff to give an exact statement of the items of cost or value of materials and labor as claimed to have been represented by the defendant to the plaintiff. The only attempt to comply with this requirement is a schedule of many dates with figures under the dollar sign opposite prefaced by the following: \u201cAt the following dates the amount of cost or value of materials and labor was stated to be in excess of the sums set opposite thereto.\u201d And that between January 7 and 15, 1908, \u201cthe amount of contracts,\u201d \u201cthe amount of the labor account,\u201d \u201cthe amount of incidental bills,\u201d and the amount of the defendant\u2019s commissions, were stated at sums specified in the bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">[ 1 ] The plaintiff having acquiesced in the order for the bill of. particulars, and not having been relieved therefrom on appeal or otherwise, the only question presented fo'r decision is whether or not the bill of particulars served is a substantial compliance with the or- \u2019 der. We deem it quite clear that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"A2b\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The court by the order for the bill of particulars decided, ar@ong other things, that defendant was entitled to know what false representations plaintiff will claim he made with respect to the. amounts demanded being more than defendant had paid or was to pay, or more than the reasonable value of the work or labor for which he was asking pay or reimbursement, and yet this\" bill of particulars jumbles labor, materials, and superintendence together and fails to specify a single item concerning which a false representation was made. If the plaintiff has any basis for its action, other than suspicion, it would seem that it should be able, particularly after having exhaustively examined the defendant, to furnish a bill of particulars that will enable defendant to prepare for trial and limit its proof upon the trial as contemplated by the order; and, if it cannot or does not, it subjects itself to having its proof limited by its failure to comply with the order, as provided in section 531 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">It follows that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. .All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
