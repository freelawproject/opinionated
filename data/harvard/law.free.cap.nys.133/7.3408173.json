It may be that under ordinary circumstances a cotenant, paying taxes for the benefit of himself as well as of his cotenants, would not be entitled to charge his cotenants with interest; but the circumstances here were extraordinary, in that the appellant\u2019s ownership was virtually conceded by all parties when the taxes were paid. Under these circumstances it would be inequitable to charge appellants- with interest on the award paid to them by the city, and to refuse interest on the taxes paid by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-17\">In this respect the judgment appealed from is modified, and, as modified, affirmed, with costs in this court, payable out of the fund, to all parties who have separately appeared and filed briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-18\">Settle order on notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-19\">INGRAHAM, P.
