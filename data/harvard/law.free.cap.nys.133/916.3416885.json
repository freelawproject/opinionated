Under these circumstances, we do not feel that we are justified in reversing a judgment, which involves determining the value of the services otherwise than upon the evidence submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">SEABURY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b959-9\">GUY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACM\">(dissenting). Defendant appeals from a judgment for $500, rendered by the court, without a jury, in favor of plaintiff, in an action to recover the value of professional services as an attorney at law. The answer denies the employment of plaintiff by the defendant corporation; but the evidence is sufficient to establish such employment, as well as subsequent ratification thereof. The defendant appellant also claims that the judgment is grossly excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">The evidence shows that the services rendered by plaintiff were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">(1) Services rendered in a foreclosure proceeding, wherein plaintiff visited the county clerk\u2019s office in Kings county and there examined certain papers which were on file, for which he charged $75. In my opinion, $25 would have been a sufficient charge for this item of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">(2) For services rendered in a surplus proceeding involving only $280, in which plaintiff appeared for defendant, and, after a number of conferences, consented to payments being made to a number of creditors of Fitzhugh Smith individually; Smith being the president of the defendant corporation. For this service, plaintiff charged $250. One hundred dollars would seem to be very large compensation for this service.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">(3) Services rendered in a certain foreclosure proceeding, in which plaintiff, after a number of consultations, drafted the complaint and subsequently consented to an order of substitution. For this he charged $100. In my judgment, $50 would have been ample for this service.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-14\">(4) A charge of $75 for additional advice given to the defendant company. On all the evidence, I am of the opinion that $250 would be full compensation for all services rendered by plaintiff to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-15\">Judgment should be reversed, unless plaintiff files a written stipulation within 10 days that the judgment shall be reduced to $250 and costs; otherwise, the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
