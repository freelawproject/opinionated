That section in brief makes a person guilty of a misdemeanor who, without giving, offering, or promising a bribe, incites or attempts to procure another to commit perjury, or to give false testimony as a witness, although the latter do neither, or to withhold true' testimony. The information among other things charges that defendant attempted to bribe Meyer, the owner of a truck that had been stolen, to procure his servant, the driver thereof, when subpoenaed as a witness, to commit perjury, and to fail to identify at the examination before the magistrate one Katz, who had been seen with the truck and pointed out to the police by the driver, and arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The evidence of Meyer was sufficient to show that the defendant did offer Meyer $250 if he would induce the driver in court before the magistrate to say that he was not sure that \u201cthem is the two prisoners.\u201d Meyer\u2019s two sons testified, one that the defendant offered to give the money \u201cproviding they could fix the case up,\u201d and the other that he would give that sum \u201cto instruct your driver to drop the case.\u201d This was an attempt to bribe Meyer to get Gottlieb to do something to help Katz, but what does not appear very clearly. Although it does appear in the record that Katz had been arrested, and that his case did in fact come up the next morning after the conversation between Meyer and defendant, there is no evidence that Gottlieb had any knowledge of the larceny, or that, if he had testified that he was not sure \u201cthem is the two prisoners,\u201d he thereby would have committed perjury or otherwise violated the statute, or that the defendant\u2019s suggestion to Meyer involved such violation. The evidence does not support the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> But is the information well laid under that section? Is it an offense thereunder if A. solicit B. to entice C. or attempt to procure C. to do or not to do the things stated in the section? If A. solicit B. to entice C. to give false evidence and B. does so entice him, A. is equally guilty with B. If A. solicit B. to commit a crime, it is indictable at common law, as where one advises a servant to rob his master (The King v. Higgins, 2 East, 5), or one requests another to set fire to a third person\u2019s building, later furnishing him a match for the purpose (People v. Bush, 4 Hill, 133). But I meet no decision that if A. solicit B. to solicit C. to do a criminal act, for example to burn his master\u2019s barn, A. is guilty of soliciting C. to so burn the barn, although A. would be guilty of soliciting B. to do a criminal act. Hence helpful principles should be considered. The act need not be proximate in time to the crime committed to implicate the actor; but it must be causatively proximate. Bishop\u2019s New Criminal Law, \u00a7 764, subd. 2. The act indicating the attempt should be such that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>if the crime had been committed, it was apparently adapted to effect the result (Bishop\u2019s New Criminal Law, \u00a7 765), and was 'intended for that purpose. Moreover, the act in time and place must be in \u201cthe direct movement toward the commission\u201d of the crime. People v. Murray, 14 Cal. 159, 160. In People v. Bush, supra, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">\u201cAn attempt may be immediate\u2014an assault, for instance\u2014but it very commonly means a remote effort by indirect measure taken with intent to effect an object.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> If the crime be committed, the act charged against the defendant need not be the first act before the crime, nor the second or third or in any other numerical order before it, if it is a force guiltily set in motion that in the end induced the commission of the offense, or brought the actor in guilty association with one or more who committed the offense. For example, if A. should solicit B. to solicit C. to solicit D. to kill E., and D. did kill E., A. would under our law be a principal offender. If this be true of the crime actually committed, it logically follows, that the complicity would be the same if A. should solicit B. to solicit C. to solicit D. to kill E., although the chain of solicitations should be interrupted by the refusal of any person solicited to do the act. A.\u2019s solicitation of B. is intended to be carried through others to D., and the fact that B. fails to continue it does not change the quality of A.\u2019s act of solicitation, but interrupts its falling on D. as intended. If it be carried to D. and he refuse, then A.\u2019s attempt fails later in time, but remains an attempt.. When a crime is not committed, \u201cthose who have unsuccessfully solicited or incited another to commit it are at common law guilty of an indictable misdemeanor (whether the crime to which the solicitation or incitement related is either by common law or statute a felony or a misdemeanor).\u201d Russell\u2019s Law of Crime, 203. I conceive that there would be no distinction in criminality whether A., B., C., and D. should meet and concert measures whereby D. should kill E., or whether A. should initiate the crime with B., whereby it would be carried through C. to D. It is not necessary that the solicitation of B. should reach D. to implicate A. In Rex v. Banks, 12 Cox\u2019s Crim. Law Cases, 393, the defendant\u2019s letter to a woman to murder a child did not reach her,. but was intercepted at the house where the addressee lived. The defendant was convicted of an attempt to solicit and incite B. to murder. So in Regina v. Ransford, 13 Cox\u2019s Crim. Law Cases, 9, the defendant\u2019s letter reached the addressee, but he, not reading it, delivered it to authorities. The defendant was convicted of an attempt to incite the addressee to commit an offense. In the case at bar, the defendant\u2019s solicitation of Meyer was not carried to Gottlieb, nor did Meyer act upon it, but it was none the less an attempt to incite Gottlieb, which failed before reaching him. Penal Law, \u00a7 2, defines an attempt to commit a crime as \u201can act, done with intent to commit a crime, and tending but failing to effect its commission.\u201d If defendant solicited Meyer, whose truck had been stolen and who was Gottlieb\u2019s master, to withhold knowledge that he had, he did an act tending to incite Gottlieb in violation of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>813 of the penal law\u2014that is, to commit a crime\u2014and I consider that it is not different than if a letter tending to so incite Gottlieb had been posted, but had not reached him, or had been seized in the mail by the government. It may be that, in view of the words used in section 813, an undelivered letter would not sustain an indictment of inciting, but it would sustain an attempt to incite. In Rex v. Krause, 66 Justice of The Peace, 121 (1902), the defendant was indicted in that he did solicit, persuade, endeavor to persuade, and did propose to another to kill a third person, and also there were counts that he wrote and sent by post certain letters with intent to move, solicit, and incite another to kill such person. Thus the inciting and attempt to incite are both pleaded. The statute (24, 25 Vict. c. 100, \u00a7 4) provided :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">\u201cWhosoever shall solicit, encourage, persuade, or endeavor to persuade, or shall propose to any person, to murder any other person, * * * shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Lord Alverstone said, \u201cI think there must be some communication to the person in order to constitute the statutory offense;\u201d but submitted the case under the counts as to attempt, and the defendant was convicted, although it was not proved that the letters reached the person solicited. The argument for the defendant was that the mind of the man solicited should be reached, that the words \u201csolicit,\u201d \u201cencourage,\u201d \u201cpersuade,\u201d and \u201cpropose to\u201d all imply argument addressed to and reaching the mind of the person addressed, and the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">\u201cI think that the words \u2018endeavor to persuade\u2019 in the statute are descriptive of the character of the offense which involves direction to a particular person and in my opinion the words have the same meaning as the words \u2018encourage,\u2019 \u2018solicit,\u2019 \u2018persuade,\u2019 and \u2018propose to.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">But it is enough that in the case at bar the information sufficiently charges an attempt to incite, and this does not require that the solicitation should be brought to the person to be finally reached. While the judgment of conviction should be reversed and a new trial ordered for failure of proof, the information is sustained so far as it charges an attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Judgment of conviction of the Court of Special Sessions reversed, and new trial ordered. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
