No verified claim was presented by the plaintiff to the comptroller of the city of New York, as required by section 261 of the Greater New York charter (Laws 1901, c. 466). The learned court below held that the failure of the plaintiff to present \u201ca verified statement\u201d was fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, and rendered judgment in favor of the defendant dismissing the complaint. The single question presented for review upon this appeal is the correctness of this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-18\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The requirement of section 261 of the Greater New York charter that \u201ca verified statement\u201d shall be filed with the comptroller is a condition precedent to the plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain the action. Curry v. City of Buffalo, 135 N. Y. 366, 32 N. E. 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-19\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The fact that, after the defective claim was served, the plaintiff was examined as to the circumstances of the accident to his horse, and that the claim was not returned, did not establish a waiver of the right to object to the defective claim on the part of the defendant. Forsyth v. City of Oswego, 191 N. Y. 441, 84 N. E. 392, 123 Am. St. Rep. 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-20\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The claim of the appellant that he was not required to verify his statement because he appeared before the comptroller and signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>and swore to the examination taken by that officer under authority of section 149 of the Greater New York charter is untenable. The words \u201cverified statement,\u201d as used in section 261, do not refer to a verification of the plaintiff\u2019s claim upon the examination conducted by the comptroller, but relate to a separate and distinct statement, which a claimant is required to file, \u201cshowing in detail the property alleged to have been damaged or destroyed, and the value thereof.\u201d The case of Patterson v. City of Brooklyn, 6 App. Div. 127, 40 N. Y. Supp. 581, is in point, and is decisive of the question presented for determination. In that case the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\u201cWe are of the opinion that the statute requires the statement to be sworn to, and that an affidavit of verification must be attached to it when presented to the comptroller. It is true that the comptroller is given power to examine the claimant, and that by so doing he may verify the claim; but the term \u2018verified,\u2019 as applied to pleadings and statements of this character, has a settled meaning in our statutory law, and it refers to an affidavit attached to the statement as to the truth of the matters therein set forth. That the Legislature, in requiring that the claim be \u2018duly verified,\u2019 did not refer to a verification thereof by an examination by the comptroller, is clear from the plain language of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">It follows that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
