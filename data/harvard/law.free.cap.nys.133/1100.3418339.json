It also is established by the evidence that the agreement upon which plaintiff sues was, as matter of fact, based upon an additional order for 10,000 copies of plaintiff\u2019s publication, given by defendants to plaintiff under the same terms and conditions as the previous contract for 100,000 copies. Plaintiff proved the delivery of the 10,000 extra copies and the substantial performance of all the conditions of the contract therefor. The judgment dismissing the complaint, and in favor of the defendants on their counterclaim, is entirely against the weight of evidence, and is, in fact, not supported by credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">The judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
