Clyde Steamship Co., 133 N. Y. Supp. 298, decided herewith, with the exception that the goods Were first transported by railroad to Jacksonville, Fla., and were there loaded upon the Onondaga, and were transported to Boston on the same voyage, and were destroyed in the same fire, under a similar bill of lading. The partial transportation by rail, preliminary to the transport by water, creates no different situation, and for the reasons stated in the Jennings- Case judgment should be directed for the defendant, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
