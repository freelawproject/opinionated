The action is for the price of goods (dresses) sold and delivered by plaintiffs, to defendant. The defense is that delivery and acceptance was conditional upon the goods being <em>approved </em>by \u201cS. or W. Bauman,\u201d and that the goods were rejected as unsatisfactory. The plaintiffs\u2019 evidence tended to show that the goods delivered fully conformed to the contract, and that defendant\u2019s refusal to accept them was arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The only question in the case is whether plaintiffs, under such circumstances can recover, or whether the approval of \u201cS. or W. Bauman\u201d was a condition precedent to any recovery. Counsel for both parties have, in their briefs, assumed that the contract was one where the goods were sold subject to the approval of the buyer\u2014in other words, that \u201cS. or W. Bauman\u201d were identical with the defendant. Adopting this view, I cannot distinguish the case from the line of cases of which Duplex Safety Boiler Company v. Garden, 101 N. Y. 387, 4 N. E. 749, 54 Am. Rep. 709, Doll v. Noble, 116 N. Y. 230, 22 N. E. 406, 5 L. R. A. 554, 15 Am. St. Rep. 398, and Hummel v. Stern, 21 App. Div. 544, 48 N. Y. Supp. 528, affirmed 164 N. Y. 603, 58 N. E. 1088, are examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">The orders for the goods in question indicate that the sales were by sample. The goods were made for the trade, and are not to be distinguished from ordinary merchandise. They were not of such character as to justify the application of the rule applicable to contracts involving the taste, fancy, or judgment of him for whom the work is done, as was the case in Haehnel v. Trostler, 54 Misc. Rep. 262, 104 N. Y. Supp. 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Nor would the result be different if the contract is considered as one where acceptance was subject to the approval of a third person, because- the evidence justified a finding that the refusal of such approval was arbitrary and unreasonable. N. Y. &amp; N. H. Auto Sprinkler Co. v. Andrews, 62 App. Div. 8, 70 N. Y. Supp. 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> It is suggested by the respondent that the contract was of the kind known as \u201ccontracts of sale or return.\u201d Greacen v. Poehlman, 191 N. Y. 493, 84 N. E. 390. I do not so read it, because the buyer-reserved no option to return the goods in the event that they conformed to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with \u2022costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
