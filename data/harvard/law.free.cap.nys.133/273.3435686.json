She proved these facts, which were not controverted. This was sufficient to establish, prima facie, defendant\u2019s negligence and to call upon him to explain the circumstances or otherwise establish his freedom from liability. Volkmar v. Manhattan Ry. Co., 134 N. Y. 418, 31 N. E. 870, 30 Am. St. Rep. 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The defendant took up this burden and showed that he had employed an independent contractor to putty his windows, and that one of this contractor\u2019s workmen was near the window when it broke, from which it was sought to draw the inference that it was this workman who broke the window, although this was not expressly proven. Plaintiff then undertook to show that the breaking of the window did not result from the negligence of the workman, but from the defective condition of the window itself. This she was not permitted to do, and her complaint was dismissed. This was error. Even without the excluded evidence there was an issue of fact for the jury. The plaintiff had proved defendant\u2019s negligence prima facie. He had then offered evidence from which, as he claimed, it appeared that the negligence was not his, but that of another. It was not for the court to say, as matter of law, in view of the nature of the proof, that defendant had overcome the presumption arising from plaintiff\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Furthermore, it was error to exclude the evidence offered by plaintiff in rebuttal. When the rule of res ipsa loquitur applies, as it did in this case, the fact of the accident, and the attendant circumstances, without further proof of the cause, warrant the inference of negligence, and the plaintiff may rest thereon. If the defendant offers evidence tending to dispel this presumption, it is the right of the plaintiff, in rebuttal, to overcome the attempted explanation by additional evidence. Uggla v. Brokaw, 117 App. Div. 586, 102 N. Y. Supp. 857; Wiley v. Bondy, 23 Misc. Rep. 658, 52 N. Y. Supp. 68; Claflin v. Meyer, 75 N. Y. 260, 31 Am. Rep. 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
