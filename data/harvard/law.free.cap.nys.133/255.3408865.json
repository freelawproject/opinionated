Genovesia v. Pelham Operating Co. et al., 130 App. Div. 200, 114 N. Y. Supp. 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\"><bracketnum>[3, 4]</bracketnum> At the time of the accident the plaintiff was working on the ninth floor. The engine was on the street in front of the building, and the engineer was stationed there. After the accident the plaintiff was brought down on the elevator, and, assisted by fellow workmen, walked out to where the engineer was and had a conversation with him. Over the objection that it was incompetent and exception duly interposed and taken in behalf of appellant, plaintiff was permitted to give this' conversation, and in it, according to the plaintiff, the engineer admitted that he neglected to lower the elevator for five or six minutes after having been signalled so to do, and then lowered it without receiving any further signal and expressed regret that he was the cause of injury to plaintiff. This conversation was received, in effect, as an admission of negligence by the appellant through its employ\u00e9, who, although a party to the action, was not represented oh the trial, and the evidence was not received as against him, but as against the appellant who was defending the action. Counsel for the respondent attempts to sustain the ruling in admitting this evidence on the ground that the declaration of the engineer was admissible as part of the res gestae. We deem it quite clear that the declaration was a narration or admission with respect to a past event, and not an involuntary exclamation or declaration constituting part of the res gestae. Brauer v. New York City Int. Ry. Co., 131 App. Div. 682, 116 N. Y. Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>59. The evidence was most damaging to the appellant, and its erroneous admission requires a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">It follows, therefore, that the judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
