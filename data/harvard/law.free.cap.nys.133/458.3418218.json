The chattels in dispute had been mortgaged to one Kraus nearly three months before plaintiff took possession. This mortgage was filed, and unquestionably constituted a lien prior to any that plaintiff could acquire under his writ. Defendant, as an auctioneer, sold the chattels at the direction of the attorney for Kraus, the mortgagee, after plaintiff\u2019s seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-19\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The theory of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and of the trial court, seems to have been that this sale was no justification to defendant, because the Kraus mortgage allowed the mortgagor, against whom plaintiff\u2019s writ was directed, to retain possession until default. It is unnecessary to consider whether plaintiff or defendant should bear the burden of proving that there was or was not a default under the mortgage. This question is eliminated, because, even if defendant was guilty of conversion, which we do not decide, no damage was shown. Kraus\u2019 debt and lien was for $110, and the court found the value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the chattel to be only $90. In the absence of proof that the Kraus debt had been discharged, wholly or in part, no more than nominal damage was sustained by reason of defendant\u2019s appropriation of the goods to Kraus\u2019 use. Plaintiff\u2019s levy could reach only the excess value above the incumbrance, and no excess was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
