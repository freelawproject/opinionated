Maletz with directions to make findings of fact and recommendation for conclusions of law. The commissioner has done so in a report and opinion filed on January 16, 1967. Defendant has filed no exceptions or brief on this report and the time for so filing pursuant to the Rules of the court has expired. On March 6, 1967, plaintiffs filed a motion that the court adopt the opinion, findings of fact and conclusion of law in this ease. Since the court agrees with the commissioner\u2019s opinion, findings and recommended conclusion of law, as hereinafter set forth, it hereby adopts the same as the basis for its judgment in this case without oral argument. Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to recover and judgment is entered for plaintiffs with the amount thereof to be determined pursuant to Rule 47(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-23\">OPINION OF COMMISSIONER<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-24\">MALETZ, Commissioner:</p>\n<p id=\"b899-25\">This case involves section 170(b) (1) (D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 170(b) (1) (D) (1958)) which provides in part that no charitable deduction may be taken by the grantor of a trust for the value of any interest in property transferred in trust if the grantor has a reversionary interest in the corpus or income which exceeds five per cent of the value of the property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In issue is whether a gran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>tor who creates irrevocable trusts which require a fixed amount to be paid to charity but which also give the corporate trustee discretion to apply trust income or corpus for the support, maintenance and education of the grantor\u2019s children is entitled to charitable contribution deductions for income tax purposes. Resolution of this issue turns on whether the grantor had, within the meaning of section 170(b) (1) (D), a reversionary interest in the trusts which had a value of over five per cent of the property transferred in trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">The facts are not in dispute. In November 1955, Robert E. Darling (hereafter referred to as plaintiff) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> established six similar irrevocable trusts consisting of two trusts for the ultimate benefit of each of his three then minor children. Plaintiff and a bank (hereafter referred to as the corporate trustee) were named as trustees. Each of these trusts had a corpus of some $52,-000 and was to continue until the death of the survivor of plaintiff\u2019s wife and the child beneficiary. Upon the death of the survivor, the remainder was to be paid to a designated class of remaindermen.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Each trust had a charitable charge of $11,000 which had to be paid, with interest, either from the income or principal of the trust within 44 years or less, the plaintiff retaining the power to choose the specific charitable donees and the portion of the charge each was to receive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each payment to such donees reduced the charitable charge by the amount of the payment. The trust instrument also gave the corporate trustee the right \u201cin its absolute discretion\u201d to apply \u201cany or all\u201d of the trust income or principal for the use of the plaintiff\u2019s minor child-beneficiary\u2019s \u201ccare, comfort, education and welfare.\u201d No distribution could be made, however, if it would reduce the trust funds to an amount less than 150 per cent of the then unsatisfied charitable charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">The trust provisions allowed the plaintiff to increase the charitable charge upon each trust at any time but only on condition that the amount of his contribution to principal equalled at least 150 per cent of the additional charge for charitable purposes. Pursuant to these provisions, plaintiff in January 1956 transferred stock worth some $45,000 to each of the six trusts, increasing the charitable charge of each trust by $12,-000. In December 1956, plaintiff made an additional transfer to each of the trusts of stock worth some $12,000 increasing the charitable charge on each by $1,500. In December 1957, plaintiff created three additional irrevocable trusts, one for the ultimate benefit of each of his three then minor children and his family. These trusts were identical except for the name of the child who was the beneficiary thereof, and their terms and provisions were generally the same as the six trusts created in November 1955. Each of these three trusts had a corpus of stock valued at approximately $114,000 and contained a charitable charge of $27,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">In their joint income tax returns for the calendar years 1955, 1956 and 1957, plaintiff and his wife claimed charitable contribution deductions under section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the charitable charges imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>on the trusts for these years. These deductions were denied on the ground that the plaintiff had a reversionary interest in excess of five per cent of the principal or income of the trusts within the meaning of section 170(b) (1) (D) as defined by the regulations thereto;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a deficiency was assessed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Section 170(b) (1) (D) was a new provision which originated on the floor of the House in 1954 as an amendment to the bill (H.R. 8300) that was subsequently enacted as the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. See 100 Cong.Rec. 3560 (1954). As explained on the floor (ibid): \u201c[I]ts purpose is to plug the loophole which has been in existing law. The loophole was made more apparent at the time the committee adopted the liberalization policy in regard to charitable trusts created for a term of years with revisionary [sic] rights to the grantor. Under existing law, by means of these term charity trusts, a grantor was able in effect to get two deductions, first for the amount which was deducted from his gross income and then again the same amount as a charitable deduction. This amendment simply provides that only one deduction, the deduction from gross income is granted, and the charitable deduction is not granted.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>See also S.Rep. No. 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 208-09 (1954) (3 U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Adm. News, p. 4845 (1954)). Save for these statements of Congressional purpose, the legislative history of the section throws little light upon the scope of its operation, and provides no indication as to what constitutes a reversionary interest<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or how it is to be valued. The regulation, however, defines a reversionary interest broadly to include a possibility that the trust property or its income will be subject to a power exercisable by a nonadverse party to use that property or the income for the benefit of the grantor. See note 4. It is the defendant\u2019s contention that the discretionary power given to the corporate trustee to distribute principal or income to the plaintiff\u2019s minor children is a reversionary interest within the meaning of this regulation. Since the grantor has the legal obligation to support his children,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> defendant argues that there is a possibility that the trustee will use' trust funds to meet this obligation and thereby use the corpus or income of the trust for the \u201cbenefit of the grantor\u201d as these words are used in the regulation. Plaintiff contends that such a discretionary power exercisable by a trustee does not fall within the definition of a \u201crevisionary interest\u201d as that term is used in the statute and regulation, and, in the alternative, that if the regulation covers such a discretionary power, it is invalid as an improper extension of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Which contention is the correct one need not be decided, for even if it is assumed that such a discretionary support power in the hands of a trustee is a reversionary interest in the grantor for purposes of section 170(b) (1) (D), it is clear from the record that the reversionary interest did not have a value in excess of five per cent of the value of the property transferred in trust. The defendant asserts that the computation of the value of plaintiff\u2019s reversionary interest is a simple matter of arithmetic; it merely subtracts the charitable charge from the corpus of the trust to arrive at what it considers to be the value of the reversionary interest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But such an arithmetic computation merely sets forth the value of the amount the corporate trustee could have distributed to the minor, ignoring the fact that the critical inquiry is not the value of the property that is subject to the reversionary interest but the value of the reversionary interest itself. In other words, defendant\u2019s computation tells us only the <em>amount </em>of the trust subject to the trustee\u2019s discretion and does not tell us the value of the <em>probability </em>that this discretion will be exercised. And it is the <em>probability </em>that the plaintiff\u2019s support obligation will be met from the trust funds that is defined as the reversionary interest.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>4. Defendant\u2019s contention is analogous to valuing a reversion after a life estate by assuming that the life tenant will die immediately rather than at the end of his actuarial life expectancy. Such a computation would only show the greatest amount that could revert to the grantor and not the probable sum that would remain at the expiration of the life estate. In short, what must be valued here is not the amount which the corporate trustee could distribute immediately if it were of a mind to do so, but the probability as of the dates the transfers to the trusts were made that the corporate trustee would exercise its discretion, during plaintiff\u2019s lifetime, to make payments to plaintiff\u2019s children in discharge of plaintiff\u2019s legal support obligation to them.</p>\n<p id=\"axt-dedup-0\">Viewed in this perspective, it is apparent from the record that the probability that the corporate trustee would exercise this discretionary power was factually so remote as to be negligible. It is quite true that the trust instrument gave the corporate trustee absolute discretion to distribute principal or income to the plaintiff\u2019s children for their support, but this discretionary power not only may not be abused (see Scott on Trusts \u00a7 187), it must be considered in the context of applicable State law. See e. g., Helvering v. Stuart, 317 U.S. 154, 161-166, 63 S.Ct. 140, 87 L.Ed. 154 (1942). The rule in Connecticut regarding discretionary trusts is that the trustee, in determining whether to expend trust funds for the beneficiary\u2019s support, is entitled to take into consideration any other means of support available to the beneficiary. City of Bridgeport v. Reilly, 133 Conn. 31, 47 A.2d 865 (1946); Auchincloss v. City Bank Farmers Trust Co., 136 Conn. 266, 70 A.2d 105 (1949). This, it would seem clear, is what the corporate trustee as a prudent fiduciary would do in the present situation, especially since one of its primary obligations is to conserve the trust property. See Scott, op. cit. supra, \u00a7\u00a7 174, 176. In thus taking into account the other means of support available to plaintiff\u2019s children, it would be highly unlikely that the trustee would ever distribute trust funds to them in discharge of plaintiff's legal obligation of support. For one thing, plaintiff-grantor\u2019s adjusted gross income for each of the years when the transfers to the trusts were made was in excess of $400,-000 (of which over $367,000 a year was investment income) so that the probability was obvious that he would be able to support from his own funds those beneficiaries of the trusts to whom he owed the legal obligation of support.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, the corporate trustee would not have to use the resources of the trusts for the purpose of discharging plaintiff\u2019s obligation to support those beneficiaries. Furthermore, during the years in question, the adjusted gross income of each of the three minor children ranged from some $11,000 to $17,000 a year and was rising each year.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Added to this is the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>that when the transfers to the trusts were made, only a relatively short period remained before the children would reach their majority,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> at which time plaintiff\u2019s support obligation would come to an end for all practical purposes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\"> Moreover, the rule in Connecticut, when considering the propriety of a trustee\u2019s use or non-use of his discretionary support power, is to measure the trustee\u2019s action by looking to the grantor\u2019s intention \u201cin the light of any relevant circumstances.\u201d Auchincloss v. City Bank Farmers Trust Co., supra, 136 Conn, at 271, 70 A.2d at 107; Stempel v. Middletown Trust Co., 127 Conn. 206, 220, 15 A.2d 305, 311, 157 A.L.R. 657 (1940); Bridgeport-City Trust Co. v. Beach, 119 Conn. 131, 137-138, 174 A. 308, 311 (1934); City of Bridgeport v. Reilly, supra, 133 Conn, at 38-39, 47 A.2d at 867-868; Hull v. Holloway, 58 Conn. 210, 217, 20 A. 445 (1889). In the present case the plaintiff-grantor\u2019s intention appears clear that the discretionary power was not to be used except in instances of necessity and that action by the corporate trustee contrary to this intention would be unwarranted. In Article Fourth of each trust the plaintiff-grantor states that he \u201cwishes to impress upon the Corporate Trustee in the strongest possible manner, but without abridging the absolute discretion hereinbefore granted to it, that his wife\u2019s interests and her comfort and well-being are the * * [grantor\u2019s] first consideration and that accordingly it is his strong desire that after his death, if she shall survive him,\u201d the corporate trustee pay to or apply to her use as much of the income and principal \u201cas it may deem necessary, taking into consideration her available receipts from other sources and all other circumstances, to enable her to maintain the standards of living which she shall have maintained during the * * * [grant- or\u2019s] life.\u201d After his wife\u2019s death, the same recommendations are made with respect to the named child-beneficiary \u201cso that he may maintain the station in life that the * * * [grantor] maintained.\u201d Such language indicates that the corporate trustee is to manage the trust funds so as to provide adequately for the plaintiff\u2019s wife after his death. Making unneeded distributions to minor children would be contrary to such purpose since it would serve to reduce the funds available for plaintiff\u2019s wife \u2014 and for the children after the death of the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">In addition, it seems obvious that an important reason for establishing the trusts \u2014 apart from plaintiff\u2019s desire to provide for his wife and children \u2014 was to exclude the trust income from plaintiff\u2019s high tax bracket.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, any distribution by the corporate trustee which would satisfy plaintiff\u2019s support obligation under Connecticut law would be taxable to plaintiff under section 677(b). This would deny the income-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>shifting benefit as to such distributions that the creation of the trusts was meant to achieve. In such circumstances and considering the financial resources of plaintiff and his children, it would be most unlikely that the corporate trustee would thwart this important objective by distributing trust funds to discharge plaintiff\u2019s support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">In summary, the possibility as of the dates the transfers to the trusts were made that the corporate trustee would exercise its discretionary power, during plaintiff\u2019s lifetime, to make distributions to plaintiff\u2019s children for support purposes was factually so improbable as to be negligible.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, even if it be assumed that the plaintiff had a reversionary interest in these trusts, it is an interest whose value was not in excess of five per cent of the trust property. Since section 170(b) (1) (D) does not apply to such a reversionary interest, the general rule of section 170(a) of the Code controls and plaintiff is entitled to the claimed charitable contributions deductions for 1955, 1956 and 1957.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b899-12\"> The opinion, findings of fact, and recommended conclusion of law are submitted under the order of reference and Rule 57 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-13\">.

The ruling was subsequently published as Rev.Rul. 61-223, 1961-2 CB 125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b901-11\">. More particularly, the \u201cloophole\u201d to which reference was made stemmed from the fact that under existing law an individual could transfer property in trust for a period of up to ten years without being taxed on the trust income and could also obtain a charitable deduction for the present value of an assigned income interest, if transferred to a charitable organization. See Treas.Reg. 111 \u00a7\u00a7 29.22(a)-21, 29.23(o)-1; Rev.Rul. 194, 1953-2 CB 128. The \u201cloophole\u201d was made more apparent by the proposal to add section 673 (b) to the 1954 Code to allow the grantor of a trust whose income was irrevocably payable for at least two years to specific charities to exclude such income from his tax during that period even if he retained a reversionary interest in the trust at the end of that period. Although the income was not taxable to the grantor, he would nevertheless be entitled to a charitable deduction equal to the present value of the income placed in trust. As pointed out in the minority report of the House Ways and Means Committee, this would actually permit the high-bracket taxpayer to make money by giving it away: \u201cFor example, [the minority stated] if the taxpayer\u2019s highest tax rate is 90 percent and he owns property producing a yearly income of $5,000, over 2 years he will have $10,000 in income, pay $9,000 in taxes, and retain $1,000 after taxes. However, if the taxpayer desires to increase his retained income from the property 800 per cent, he need only make a gift of the 2-year income in trust for a charity. The charitable deduction of approximately $10,000 to which he thereby becomes entitled will reduce the taxes he would otherwise pay by $9,000. Thus, by giving up, through the charitable gift, the $1,000 which he would have retained after taxes, he will receive in exchange a $9,000 reduction in taxes. The result is an increase of $8,000 in his income after taxes (the savings in taxes of $9,000 less the net gift, after taxes, of $1,000 of income).\u201d H.Rept.

When the December 1957 trusts were created, less than six months remained for the son to reach his majority, while 3% and 6(4 years, respectively, remained for the daughters to reach their majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b904-6\">. In Connecticut a father has the duty to support an adult child only if such child is a pauper and unable to support himself and the father is able to support the child.

Such an occurrence would seem so remote in this case as to require no consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b904-10\">. Under section 677(b) of the 1954 Code, trust income is not taxable to the grantor merely because such income may in the trustee\u2019s discretion be applied or distributed for the support or maintenance of a beneficiary whom the grantor is legally obligated to support or maintain. To the extent, however, that the trust income is actually applied or distributed for that purpose, the section requires that it be included in the grantor\u2019s gross income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b905-6\">. The problem presented here \u2014 whether there is a factual likelihood that a discretionary power will be exercised \u2014 is not novel. For example, the question frequently arises under the estate tax as to whether a bequest of a remainder to charity, after a prior estate to a non-charitable beneficiary, is deductible from the gross estate as a charitable gift, which question turns on whether the charitable contribution had an ascertainable value at the time of the testator\u2019s death. In Millard v. Humphrey, 8 F.Supp. 784, 786-788 (W.D.N.Y.1934), aff\u2019d 79 F.2d 107 (2d Cir. 1935), decedent left a trust, the income of which was to be paid to his wife for life and the remainder was to be paid to charity. The wife was given the right to invade the principal of the trust for her support. When a charitable deduction for estate tax purposes for the remainder was claimed, the government denied the deduction on the ground that the remainder had no ascertainable value since the wife before her death could consume the entire principal of the trust. Upon considering the wife\u2019s financial position and her mode of living, the court held that there was no reasonable possibility that the corpus would ever be invaded and, therefore, allowed a deduction for the remainder interest <em>on </em>the assumption that the discretionary support power in the wife would never be exercised.

In view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to pass upon plaintiff\u2019s alternative contentions (i) that he did not have a re-versionary interest in those portions of each trust which were safeguarded for the charitable beneficiaries, and (ii) that even if he had a reversionary interest, the interest is not susceptible of valuation and, therefore, under the analogy of section 2037 of the 1954 Code dealing with the estate tax, it had as a matter of law a zero value.
