It is clear from a reading of the transcript of the trial that the witness testified that his recollection was refreshed by the written statement. We, therefore, conclude that the trial court did not err in permitting his testimony to be received in evidence even though on some occasions he stated that without reference to the written statement he could not recall all of the events that had transpired.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-19\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
