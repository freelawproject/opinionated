KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">The sole issue presented for our disposition is whether Judge Bonsai properly concluded that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the complaint brought by A. T. Brod &amp; Co. (Brod) against Jack and Adele Per-low (Perlows), the appellees. Brod, a member of the New York Stock Exchange brought its complaint under \u00a7 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5, and sought monetary damages to compensate for the losses it suffered as a result of the Perlows\u2019 alleged fraudulent failure to pay for securities they had ordered through Brod, as broker. The Perlows\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint was made pursuant to Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and was granted by Judge Bonsai.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">We recognize that in reviewing a dismissal of a complaint for a failure on its face to sufficiently allege jurisdiction, we must accept the allegations in that complaint as true. See Vine v. Beneficial Finance Co., 374 F.2d 627 (2d Cir., March 13, 1967); Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 12.08. Brod\u2019s complaint alleged that the Perlows placed orders with various brokers and dealers to purchase securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (Exchange) with the fraudulent intent of paying for the securities only if their market value had increased by the date payment was due. On September 28, 1966, acting pursuant to a purchase order placed by the Per-lows, Brod bought for their account 100 shares of S-C-M Corporation, listed on the exchange at 62%, and 100 shares of General Instrument Corporation, listed at 54%. The complaint further charged that the price of these securities declined by the payment date, and the Perlows, in accordance with their deceptive plan, refused to pay for the securities; as a result of this fraudulent action, Brod was compelled to sell the securities, thereby incurring a loss of $3,330.34. It is Brod\u2019s contention that this \u201cheads I win, tails you lose\u201d scheme, allegedly employed by the Perlows, constitutes a \u201cmanipulative or deceptive device or contrivance\u201d in contravention of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and that the District Court therefore had jurisdiction to entertain the complaint which sought damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\"> It should be noted at the outset that the parties are not of diverse citizenship, and that the damages alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>are less than $10,000. The only possible basis of jurisdiction, therefore, is the Perlows\u2019 alleged violation of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. And, while both sections are criminal in nature, it is well settled that they create an implied civil right of action. See, e. g., Fischman v. Raytheon Mfg. Co., 188 F.2d 783 (2d Cir. 1951); Fratt v. Robinson, 203 F.2d 627, 37 A.L.R.2d 636 (9th Cir. 1953); cf. J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 84 S.Ct. 1555, 12 L.Ed.2d 423 (1964). But, Judge Bonsai concluded that, even on the assumption that the allegations in Brod\u2019s complaint were true, they did not set forth fraud or deceit in violation of \u00a7 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. His rationale for this holding was: \u201cPlaintiff is not an investor, and no fraud is alleged as to the investment value of the securities nor any fraud \u2018usually associated with the sale or purchase of securities * * * \u2019 \u201d We believe that this interpretation of \u00a7 10 (b) and Rule 10b-5 is much too narrow and that the District Court had subject matter jurisdiction to entertain Brod\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Our conclusion is based, in the main, on the language of the applicable provisions. Section 10(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">(b) To use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered, <em>any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance </em>in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">One of the Rules so prescribed by the Commission is Rule 10b-5, which states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">(a) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">Neither \u00a7 10(b) nor Rule 10b-5, it appears, speaks in terms of limiting the nature of the violation to one involving fraud of \u201cinvestors\u201d; nor is there any justification for reading such an additional requirement into the Act. Section 10(b) was aimed at manipulative and deceptive devices which were employed \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security\u201d and which contravened the rules and regulations established by the Commission. These rules and regulations were to be promulgated by the Commission <em>\u201cin the public interest or </em>for the protection of investors.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Similarly Rule 10b-5, which prohibited fraudulent schemes in connection with the purchase and sale of securities, was designed to protect both investors <em>and </em>\u201cthe public interest.\u201d We cannot understand, therefore, any rationale which would restrict or inhibit appropriate private rights of action to enforce the Rule to those brought by \u201cinvestors.\u201d See Hooper v. Mountain States Securities Corp., 282 F.2d 195 (5th Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 814, 81 S.Ct. 695, 5 L.Ed.2d 693 (1961). Moreover, such a barrier to a suit would not be in harmony with the Supreme Court\u2019s postulation that the securities laws should be construed \u201cnot technically and restrictively, but flexibly to effectuate * * * [their] remedial purposes.\u201d SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 195, 84 S.Ct. 275, 285, 11 L.Ed.2d 237 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">For the same <em>ratio legis </em>we reject Judge Bonsai\u2019s holding that Brod\u2019s complaint must be dismissed because \u201cno fraud is alleged as to the investment value of the securities nor any fraud \u2018usually associated with the sale or put-chase of securities.\u2019\u201d Neither \u00a7 10(b) nor Rule 10b-5 contains any language which would indicate that those provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>sions were intended to deal only with fraud as to the \u201cinvestment value\u201d of securities, and, indeed, it is established that a 10b-5 action will survive even though the fraudulent scheme or device is unrelated to \u201cinvestment value.\u201d See Hooper v. Mountain States Securities Corp., supra (fraud with regard to the value of the consideration received for securities); Cooper v. North Jersey Trust Co., 226 F.Supp. 972 (S.D.N.Y. 1964) (conspiracy to defraud by selling pledged securities). Nor do we think it sound to dismiss a complaint merely because the alleged scheme does not involve the type of fraud that is \u201cusually associated with the sale or purchase of securities.\u201d We believe that \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 prohibit <em>all </em>fraudulent schemes in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, whether the artifices employed involve a garden type variety of fraud, or present a unique form of deception. Novel or atypical methods should not provide immunity from the securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Proceeding on the assumption that the allegations in the complaint are true, and that any ambiguities must be resolved in favor of the pleading, it seems clear to us that Brod stated a claim which the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain. It is alleged that the Perlows employed a fraudulent scheme in connection with the purchase<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of securities being traded on a national exchange. The complaint was filed by the purchaser <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the securities to recover the losses it sustained as a result of the Perlows\u2019 fraudulent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">Moreover, the practices allegedly employed by the Perlows will, if allowed to continue, exacerbate the very evils that the securities laws were designed to prevent. Indeed, the Securities and Exchange Commission, as <em>amicus curim, </em>has advised us that the artificial demand created by purchasing securities which are not to be paid for unless the market value of the stock rises, can have an unsettling and potentially manipulative effect on the Securities market \u2014 contrary to the very purpose of the Act. The practices allegedly engaged in by the Perlows represent a violent form of speculation which serves no useful purpose except that the speculator always holds the trump card. Moreover, the Perlows\u2019 activities resulted, in effect, in an involuntary extension of credit without compliance with the margin requirements established pursuant to the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78g, which restrict the use of credit for speculative purposes. The conduct engaged in by the appellees, if true, is fraudulent in nature, and the Commission has cited us to several uncontested eases where customers were enjoined from defrauding brokers through practices similar to those alleged in the present complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We see no sound reason for inhibiting private actions aimed at such fraudulent activities for \u201cprivate enforcement of the * * * [securities laws] provides a necessary supplement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>to Commission action.\u201d J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, supra at 432, 84 S.Ct. at 1560.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">It is true, of course, as the Per-lows submit, that Brod has not <em>proven </em>that the Perlows\u2019 failure to make payment constituted a \u201cdevice, scheme, or artifice to defraud.\u201d Indeed, we recognize that not every failure by a customer to pay for securities ordered adds up to a violation of the securities laws. But, whether there is actionable fraud or a mere breach of contract depends on the facts and circumstances developed at the trial or on motion for summary judgment. Brod was not required to <em>prove </em>in its complaint that it was entitled to an ultimate recovery, nor was it required to set forth in its complaint a detailed statement of the facts. Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires only that a complaint contain \u201c(1) a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court\u2019s jurisdiction depends * * * (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (3) a demand for judgment for the relief to which he deems himself entitled.\u201d Such simplified \u201cnotice pleading\u201d requires that the complaint be construed liberally, see Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); Dioguardi v. Durning, 139 F.2d 774 (2d Cir. 1944); and \u201cjurisdiction * * * is not defeated * * * by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which * * * [the pleader] could actually recover.\u201d Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682, 66 S.Ct. 773, 776, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The pleading rules, designed to avoid and reduce long and technical allegations, are necessarily supplemented by procedures, including summary judgment, which enable a party to have a judgment in a relatively short time if there is actually no bona fide claim presented.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Perlows are at liberty to avail themselves of these procedures and thereby seek to avoid what otherwise might be protracted litigation. But, accepting Brod\u2019s allegations as true, as we have indicated we must on a motion to dismiss the complaint, it is clear that the complaint sufficiently stated a claim grounded in federal jurisdiction. The order and judgment of the District Court dismissing the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction must, therefore, be vacated and reversed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-17\">. Pursuant to Rule 64 of the Federal Rules of Oivil Procedure and Article 62 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, appellant obtained an order of attachment on appellees\u2019 property located within the State of New York. Judge Bonsai\u2019s order dismissing the complaint, also vacated that order of attachment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-6\">. The term \u201cpurchase\u201d is defined by the Act to include \u201cany contract to buy, purchase, or otherwise acquire\u201d securities. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c (13).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\">. Prior decisions in this Circuit have been, on occasions, interpreted as standing for the rule that only a purchaser or seller may bring a Rule 10b-5 action. See, e. g., Birnbaum v. Newport Steel Corp., 193 F.2d 461 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 343 U.S. 956, 72 S.Ct. 1051, 96 L.Ed. 1356 (1952). The Commission, in recent cases, has urged that this interpretation of the Act is too narrow. See Vine v. Beneficial Finance Co., supra. We need not consider that contention since appellant is clearly a purchaser of securities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b451-12\">. Securities and Exchange Commission v.

As previously noted, Judge Bonsai also vacated the order of attachment that appellant had obtained.
