See Ward v. United States, 5 Cir. 1962, 296 F.2d 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-31\">The other point relied upon by appellant, complaining of the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>charge relative to the \u201cadmission or confession\u201d contained in the statement voluntarily given by Brown, was not saved for our consideration by an exception made to the charge at the time of trial. We think the charge as a whole gave the defendant a fair trial and no error has been shown that would warrant our applying the plain error rule, Rule 52 F.R. Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
