A written incriminating statement given to police officers by appellant on July 29, 1961, was, without objection, received in evidence. Appellant\u2019s counsel stipulated at the trial that the statement had been freely and voluntarily given by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-21\">After exhausting his state remedies, appellant filed a petition for habeas corpus in the District Court which was denied. Appellant\u2019s sole point on appeal is that, when the police started accusatory questioning, the appellant\u2019s right to an attorney became vested, and an admittedly voluntary confession thereafter made could not be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-22\"> Appellant\u2019s case was tried before either Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 1964, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977, or Miranda v. State of Arizona, 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 were decided by the Supreme Court. Neither case has retroactive application. Johnson v. State of New Jersey, 1966, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882, Marion v. Harrist, 5 Cir. 1966, 363 F.2d 139. Under the rules prevailing prior to <em>Escobedo </em>appellant\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel was not violated. Beavers v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1967, 373 F.2d 95, (Feb. 13, 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-23\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b500-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
