Bell here attacks his conviction on several grounds, but only one deserves mention \u2014 that he was denied due process by the Government\u2019s failure to request, and the District Court\u2019s failure to order, a pretrial inquiry under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4244 into Bell\u2019s mental competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">We have carefully reviewed the record of the hearing which included the testimony of virtually every person in any way connected with Bell\u2019s arrest, incarceration and trial, as well as his family, personal and medical (mental) history, including results of \u00a7 4208 post conviction studies. The District Court, in an exhaustive opinion, Bell v. United States, N.D.Miss., W.D., 1966, 265 F. Supp. 311, correctly concluded that the petitioner\u2019s contentions were without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
