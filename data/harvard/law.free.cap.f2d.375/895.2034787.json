It exists here pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-21\">Counsel representing the successful defendant below now represents both appellants. He urges six grounds for reversals, with heavy emphasis on the first two. They are:</p>\n<p id=\"b950-22\">1. Appellants were denied effective assistance of counsel due to an inherent conflict of interest;</p>\n<p id=\"b950-23\">2. The trial court erroneously examined certain reports of government agents;</p>\n<p id=\"b950-24\">3. The denial of the defendant Kap-lan\u2019s motion to suppress six $100 counterfeit bills invalidated his conviction under Count V;</p>\n<p id=\"b950-25\">4. Kaplan could not be guilty of aiding and abetting under Count III as a matter of law;</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>5. The denial of inspection of defendants\u2019 statements \u201cin hands of the government\u201d was error; and</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">6. Appellant Kaplan was denied due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">We consider each alleged error in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">Appellants are entitled to meaningful representation by counsel, without any possibility of conflict of interest present between any two of two or more defendants. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), Lugo v. United States, 350 F.2d 858, 859 (9th Cir. 1965). In determining this question, the trial court must be able, and be freely permitted, to rely upon counsel\u2019s representations that the possibility of such a conflict does or does not exist. The necessary adequate representation by an attorney which the law requires implies that the court may rely on the solemn representation of a fact made by such attorney as an officer of the court. The court may go further into the factual situation if he desires, but is under no original or continuing obligation to do so. Having determined the facts, he must then rule on the legal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">On March 29, 1965, Mr. Beckler, counsel in the court below representing Mr. Berumen and Mr. Kaplan, represented to the trial judge there was a recently discovered possible conflict of interest in his joint representation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He failed to disclose what it was. (Supp.Tr. VIII and IX.) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-14\">On March 29, 1965, a three day continuance to April 1st, 1965, was ordered (Supp.Tr. XIII) and a requested three weeks continuance denied. When counsel for appellants, once a longer continuance was denied, agreed he could be ready \u201ctoday,\u201d a continuance of on\u00e9 day was ordered by the court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-15\">When the case was called for trial on March 30, 1965, Mr. Beckler announced for his clients: \u201cThe defendant Kaplan and defendant Berumen are ready to proceed.\u201d (Tr. p. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-16\">After careful separate waivers of a jury trial (Tr. pp. 4-10), counsel for the government raised the problem whether there then existed any conflict or apparent conflict of interest. Mr. Beckler stated the conflict had been \u201climited to the possibility and contingency of a jury trial. Now that that matter has been disposed of, the conflict of interests\u2014 that is my representation of Mr. Beru-men and Mr. Kaplan \u2014 is now satisfied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>In short, there is no conflict.\u201d (Tr. pp. 12, 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">The trial court then satisfied himself of two things: (a) that the question of whether or not a jury trial should be had was the sole issue or conflict between the defendants, and (b) that it had been settled, not only to the satisfaction of the defendants\u2019 counsel, but to the complete satisfaction of each defendant. (Tr. p. 13, 1. 1 to p. 14, 1. 5.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">Unlike Glasser v. United States, supra, and other law cited by appellants, the record clearly and convincingly proves there was an intentional and intelligent waiver by each defendant of separate counsel. The trial judge here did precisely what <em>Glasser </em>requires\u2014 made a \u201cclear record\u201d of a \u201cproper waiver,\u201d i. e., a waiver \u201cknowingly and intentionally made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">Just as we cannot speculate as to whether a conflict of interest, once it exists, would affect a trial (we can assume arguendo that it would), neither can we speculate that a right, once intelligently and knowingly waived, should not have been waived; or speculate whether or not there could have existed some other possible conflict of interest not factually disclosed, or even suggested, by a careful reading of the record before us. Appellants\u2019 concession is of importance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-15\">We find no merit in appellants\u2019 position on alleged Error I.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-16\">II. <em>Court\u2019s Examination of Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-17\">When Agent Tomsic was called to the stand, counsel for the government presented certain documents to counsel for defendants. Codefendant\u2019s counsel requested a ten minute recess to read the statements. These documents were referred to and described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-18\">\u201cMR. BALABAN: At the request of Mr. Inman, I, in advance of trial, presented him with certain documents which were the Jencks Act statements of the witnesses who had previously testified. Despite the fact that we are not required to turn over the statements until the witness has testified, I did not believe that we would get to Mr. Tomsic by this afternoon and I planned to give Mr. Tomsic\u2019s Jencks Act statements to defense counsel this evening in anticipation of Mr. Tomsic testifying tomorrow. I have just given them to them, handed to them the statements of Agent Tomsic prior to him taking the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-19\">MR. BECKLER: I agree. There is no question. We appreciate this, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>of course, Mr. Balaban is correct. We are not entitled to this until the conclusion, but it is lengthy, your Honor. I think we would save time by taking them and reading them now.\u201d (R.T. p. 154, 1. 17 to p. 155, 1. 7.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The court then requested to see a copy of the statement. After identifying the witness on the stand, government counsel stated: \u201cAt this time, your Honor, I would like to state this defendant (sic) is only offered on the motion itself.\u201d (Tr. p. 159,11.12-14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">This reference to \u201ca motion\u201d was to the pending motion of defendant Rein-hardtsen to suppress. (See note 1, supra.) On March 15, 1965, it had been continued to the date of trial. (C.T. p. 105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Before Tomsic testified, the question was raised whether the court, as the trier of fact, could see the Jencks Act statements, delivered to counsel for the defendants by the government prior to the time any request was made on the record by counsel for defendants for their production. This question was never resolved or ruled upon. (Tr. p. 159, 1. 17 to p. 162, 1. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Counsel for appellants stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-9\">\u201c[The Jencks problem] hasn\u2019t arisen yet and I am wondering if the court in reading these is somewhat premature. I have no motion even. I can\u2019t very well move to strike the court\u2019s reading of these certainly, so at this time I will just sit down.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">No counsel for any defendant made any objection, or motion of any kind. Counsel for the codefendant conceded the delivery of the statements was \u201cproper.\u201d (R.T. 160, 11. 21-23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">Appellants state that they \u201cstrenuously questioned the right of the trier of facts to examine such documents without there being a Jencks motion made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">We flatly disagree. It was at best a half-hearted inquiry. When no protest or objection is made, no motion to strike made, no mistrial urged, and no record of any kind laid, it is inaccurate to describe such conduct as \u201cstrenuous questioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">Neither can we agree that the trial judge commenced reading the statements \u201cbefore either counsel was aware of the actions of the court.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Brief, pp. 31-32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-15\">The unchallenged record clearly discloses Mr. Inman, counsel for the acquitted defendant, <em>requested </em>the Jencks Act statements of the government. (Tr. p. 154, 1. 17 to p. 155, 1. 2.) Mr. Beck-ler, counsel for these appellants \u201cagreed\u201d and \u201cappreciated\u201d the courtesy of government counsel, and stated: \"We are not entitled to this until the conclusion [of Tomsic\u2019s testimony] but it is lengthy * * *. I think we would save time by taking them and reading them now.\u201d (Tr. p. 155, 11. 4-7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-16\">A recess was then called so defense counsel could read the statement, as they requested. Only then did the court look at the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-17\">The Tomsic statement falls within item three of the motion to suppress (C.T. p. 13), which motion the court then had under consideration (R.T. p. 158). The only purpose for Tomsic\u2019s testimony (R.T. p. 175, 1. 22; 179) was to aid the court in its determination of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-18\">We conclude not only that the perusal of the statements by the court was necessary and proper in this case in view of the pending motions; but that counsel for defendants, by his silence and inaction, inferentially waived any objections to such an examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-19\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-20\">We can deal more quickly with the other errors urged. The third had to do with the admission of the six $100 counterfeit bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-21\">These were found in the white Chevrolet with Ohio license plates and a \u201cdented\u201d front left fender. (Tr. p. 171, 11. 6-9) after its seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-22\">No search was made until <em>after </em>Tomsic had verified the fact the same vehicle had been used to transport a counterfeit $100 note to the Christmas tree lot, while Kaplan was driving. (R. T. p. 172, 1. 1 to p. 173, 1. 19.) He then had reasonable cause to believe the vehi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>ele could be properly seized as a vehicle used to transport contraband. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 781(a) (3) and (b) (3); 782. Burge v. United States, 342 F.2d 408 (9th Cir. 1964). He did seize it.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">We distinguish Preston v. United States, 376 U.S. 364, 84 S.Ct. 881, 11 L.Ed.2d 777 (1964) on the same grounds as did the eighth circuit in Drummond v. United States, 350 F.2d 983 (1965), cert. den. Castaldi v. United States, 384 U.S. 944, 86 S.Ct. 1469, 16 L.Ed.2d 542, Cf. Armada v. United States, 319 F.2d 793 (5th Cir. 1963), cert. den. 376 U.S. 906, 84 S.Ct. 659, 11 L.Ed.2d 605 (1964), United States v. One 1963 Cadillac, 231 F.Supp. 27 (D.C.Wis.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">We need not consider appellants\u2019 point four (Kaplan\u2019s guilt on Count III\u2014 aiding and abetting the unconvicted co-defendant) in view of Kaplan\u2019s conviction on Count V, with its concurrent sentence. But see: Rooney v. United States, 203 F. 928, 932 (9th Cir. 1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">We find no error in the denial of appellants\u2019 motion to have government summaries of defendants\u2019 statements given before trial produced for appellants\u2019 use. No such <em>statements </em>were offered in evidence against defendants, or used at the trial against them in any way. Appellants demanded in paragraph five, six and seven of their motion <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the production of written memoranda made by government agents of oral statements made by defendants not shown to nor signed by defendants. They were not records \u201cbelonging\u201d to appellants. Rule 16, Fed.R.Crim.P., United States v. Murray, 297 F.2d 812, 819 (2d Cir. 1962), cert. den. 369 U.S. 828, 82 S.Ct. 845, 7 L.Ed.2d 794 (1962), Schaffer v. United States, 221 F.2d 17, 19 (5th Cir. 1955), Shores v. United States, 174 F.2d 838, 843-845 (8th Cir. 1949). Cf. Holt v. United States, 272 F.2d 272, 277 (9th Cir. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-13\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">We agree with the answer made by the government to appellants\u2019 sixth alleged error (that appellant Kaplan was denied due process of law by use of admissions made by him when first contacted and before his arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-15\">Appellants concede that appellant Kaplan was properly advised of his. constitutional rights before he was interviewed by Agent Tomsic on December 19, 1964 (i. e., that he did not have to make any statements; that any statements he made could be used against him in court, and that he was entitled to have an attorney. (R.T. p. 239.)) Although the warning did not follow the form required by Miranda v. State of Arizona,. 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) (re the right to an attorney, though indigent, Id., p. 471, 86 S.Ct.. 1602), that ruling has no application to cases tried prior to June 13, 1966. Johnson v. State of New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed. 882 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-16\">A repetition of this warning on December 20th, 1964, was not required under either the <em>Miranda </em>decision or the ruling of Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 473, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964). As stated in <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. 436, 477, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1629:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-17\">\u201cThe principles announced today deal with the protection which must be given to the privilege against self-incrimination when the individual is first subjected to police interrogation while in custody at the station or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-18\">Similarly, the <em>Escobedo </em>ruling involved a situation where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-19\">\u201cThe existence of the crime was apparent. The police were seeking to identify the offender. The accused had been taken into custody.\u201d Kohat-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>su v. United States, 351 F.2d 898, 901 (9th Cir. 1965), cert. den. 384 U.S. 1011, 86 S.Ct. 1915, 16 L.Ed.2d 1017 (1966). Accord: Irwin v. United</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">States, 338 F.2d 777 (9th Cir. 1964). Appellant Kaplan was <em>not </em>in custody at the time these admissions were made; in fact, he was allowed to return home that night. (R.T. p. 253.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Finding no error in any of the points urged, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-9\">. The indictment was filed January 13, 1965. A cash bond for $500 had been filed for defendant Kaplan before the United States Commissioner on December 21, 1964, and a surety bond for defendant Berumen filed the same day. On January 25, 1965, counsel Beckler filed appearances to represent the two appellants, when they were arraigned. Not guilty pleas were entered February 8, 1965, and trial set for March 29, 1965. On March 9, 1965, attorney Beckler had filed a motion for discovery and inspection. (We note, parenthetically, that this motion sought to inspect \u201cany and all statements made by defendants at any time or place, to officers of the United States with respect to the subject matter of the instant case, whether or not reduced to writing and/or signed by said defendants, as to which some form of recordation, note or memorandum exists, incorporating, embodying or reproducing the substance and content of such statement.\u201d) See alleged error VI, supra. The motion was set for hearing on March 29, 1965, prior to the actual trial.</p>\n<p id=\"abm-dedup-0\">Thus, counsel for appellant in the district court had represented each of them, certainly for sixty days, and possibly for ninety days, prior to his \u201cdiscovery\u201d of any conflict of interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b951-19\">. In the week preceding Monday, March 29th, 1965, Kaplan had indicated he would move for a continuance based on illness. (Supp.Tr. XII, 11. 13-20.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b951-20\">. Supp.Tr. p. XIV, 1. 16 to p. XV, 1. 5 (March 29, 1965).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: Are you ready to go to trial then tomorrow morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-22\">\u201cMR. BECKLER: Ready right now. Well, ready tomorrow morning. I\u2019ll call someone today and we will go over it tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-23\">\u201cTHE COURT: Very weU * * (Supp.Tr.

In short, there is no conflict. I feel I can adequately represent both of them and intend to, and I believe it is Mr. Kaplan\u2019s desire that I proceed and go ahead with his representation during this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"Ain\">\u201cTHE COURT: Very well.

KAPLAN: Yes, I sure have.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Berumen, I would like to ask the same thing of you. You understood this?</p>\n<p id=\"b952-21\">\u201cMR. BERUMEN: Yes, we talked it out and it is all straightened out.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-22\">\u201cTHE COURT: You think now that without a jury trial there would be no occasion for any conflict or any conflict of any moment?</p>\n<p id=\"b952-23\">\u201cMR.
