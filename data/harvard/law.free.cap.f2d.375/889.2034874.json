The cases were consolidated for trial and the jury returned a verdict for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-27\">Although at the conclusion of the court\u2019s oral charge no objection was made by the plaintiffs, they now, for the first time on appeal, claim error in the court\u2019s charges. The plaintiffs assert that they were not afforded an opportunity by the District Court to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-28\">After notice of appeal was filed, the trial judge made and included in the record, over plaintiffs\u2019 objection, a certificate in which he described the events that transpired after his charge to the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>The transcript discloses only that, after the judge charged the jury, he told them, \u201cI am going to ask the clerk to get together the exhibits * * * and you may retire and consider your verdict,\u201d and that defendants\u2019 counsel then took exceptions to the charges. The Judge\u2019s certificate makes it clear, however, that at the time defendants made their exceptions plaintiffs were present and made no objections, and at that time the jury had not yet actually retired to consider its verdict, but rather was waiting on a stairway outside the courtroom in charge of the clerk. After the trial judge overruled defendants\u2019 objections, he instructed the clerk to take the jury to the deliberating room to begin its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Plaintiffs contend that we are barred from considering what actually transpired because we cannot take cognizance of the trial judge\u2019s certificate. It is insisted that \u201cThe record on appeal cannot be varied, added to, or explained by, a statement or certificate of the judge before whom the case was tried.\u201d 4A C.J.S. Appeal and Error, \u00a7 779, p. 648; United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company v. International Brotherhood, 1958, 40 Ala.App. 452, 115 So.2d 42; Scroggins v. Alabama Gas Corporation, 1963, 275 Ala. 650, 158 So.2d 90; Montgomery Bank &amp; Trust Company v. State, 1918, 201 Ala. 447, 78 So. 825. Even if these authorities stood for the proposition that the judge could not make the record conform to the truth by the certificate involved here,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> they would not control our decision for this is a \u201cprocedural\u201d question and under Erie R Co. v. Tomkins, 1938, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, and its progeny, especially Hanna v. Plumer, 1965, 380 U.S. 460, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8; Sibbach v. Wilson &amp; Co., 1941, 312 U.S. 1, 61 S.Ct. 422, 85 L.Ed. 479, and Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co. v. Wright, 5 Cir. 1963, 322 F.2d 759, we must look to federal law and not the law of Alabama to decide the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">The first two sentences of Rule 75(d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> relied upon by the defendants do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>not apply, for the parties did not submit any dispute to the District Court, nor was there any misstatement or omission from the record by error or accident. But Rule 75(d) goes on to provide that \u201cAll other questions as to the form and content of the record shall be presented to the court of appeals.\u201d' Under this provision we are faced with the question whether the certificate of the trial judge should be included in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Plaintiffs do not say, or even intimate, that the recitation in the certificate of the trial judge is in error or untruthful. Plaintiffs do not dispute what the certificate says \u2014 they just say that such a certificate cannot be made. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The certificate here does not attempt to vary, add to, or explain any evidenti-ary matter in the record. It simply describes what <em>physically </em>took place after the jury departed the courtroom. The matters of whether the judge remained on the bench; whether the jury remained with the clerk on the stairs before going to the deliberating room; whether counsel were close enough to each other and the bench so that each could hear what the other said, and whether the judge was available in chambers during the jury\u2019s deliberation were germane to a crucial issue raised for the first time by the plaintiffs as a point on which they intended to rely on appeal. These are all non-evidentiary matters <em>in pais </em>that could not have been incorporated in the record other than by certificate. Plaintiff cannot now ask our consideration of their claimed prejudice and at the same time deny us a record that speaks the truth on the point involved. An appellate decision based upon a false record would indeed be a travesty. We accept the certificate as a part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">Having had the opportunity to object before the jury retired to consider its verdict and having failed to avail themselves of it, plaintiffs may not now claim that the charges were erroneous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">The other errors assigned by the plaintiffs have been considered and are without merit. The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-29\">. The certificate states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-30\">\u201cI, Seybourn H.

After exception was duly taken by counsel for the defendants, Mr. Sharp, I then retired from the courtroom and remained in my chamber adjacent to the courtroom until the rendition of the verdicts, which was in excess of one hour from the time the jury began its deliberations.

The first two sentences of Rule 75(d) are as follows: <em>\u201cCorrection or Modification of the Record. </em>If any difference arises as to whether the record truly discloses what occurred in 'the district court, the difference shall be submitted to and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>settled by that court and the record made to conform to the truth.
