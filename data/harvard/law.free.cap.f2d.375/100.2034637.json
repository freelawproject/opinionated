The Commission order asserted jurisdiction under section 201(b) of the Federal Power Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We deny the petition and affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-28\">PSCI, a public utility and Indiana corporation with its principal office in Plainfield, Indiana, operates entirely within Indiana, doing business in 69 of the 92 counties but serving only large rural areas and Indiana\u2019s smaller cities. It owns and operates five steam generating plants and has extensive power lines able to transmit large \u201cblocks of power\u201d to all parts of its system. It is interconnected with six other public utilities at points within Indiana or at the state line. Three of these utilities serve areas outside Indiana.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sales in issue have been regulated by Indiana\u2019s Public Service Commission \u201cfor many years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The order on appeal resulted from a proceeding initiated by a Commission order directing an investigation and public hearing to determine mainly whether PSCI\u2019s sales to Municipal Electric Systems (Municipals) and Rural Electric Membership Corporations (RE MCs) were sales at wholesale in interstate commerce.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Presiding Examiner found that PSCI sold out-of-state energy at wholesale to Municipals and REMCs from a power pool or coordinated multi-state electric network and recommended substantially the order which the Commission eventually entered upon adopting the Examiner\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The Commission found that PSCI was interconnected with a single multi-state integrated electric power system and that PSCI\u2019s sales to its municipal and cooperative consumers were sales at wholesale in interstate commerce. This finding is vital to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction and is the principal target of PSCI\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The ultimate finding of the Commission upon which it asserted jurisdiction is substantially that PSCI\u2019s interconnections with other public utilities locates it in a \u201clarge power pool\u201d from which PSCI receives \u201clarge quantities\u201d of out-of-state energy resulting in \u201cpool sales\u201d subject to Commission regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">PSCI contends that there is no substantial basis in the record for the conclusion that its sales were in interstate commerce because the Commission did not employ point-to-point tracing studies as in many previous cases. The Commission\u2019s test, it argues, was an arbitrary nonseientific \u201cpower pool\u201d test, instead of the \u201cengineering and scientific\u201d test stated by the Supreme Court in Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. v. F. P. C., 324 U.S. 515, 65 S.Ct. 749, 89 L.Ed. 1150 (1945), and F. P. C. v. Southern Cal. Edison Co., 376 U.S. 205, 84 S.Ct. 644, 11 L.Ed.2d 638 (1964) (the <em>Colton </em>case). In <em>Connecticut, </em>the Court said that federal jurisdiction followed an \u201cengineering and scientific\u201d test rather than a \u201clegalistic or governmental\u201d test, pointing out that \u201cif any part of a supply of electric energy comes from outside of a state it is, or may be, present in every connected distribution facility.\u201d 324 U.S. at 529, 65 S.Ct. at 756. In context, this statement emphasized the potential reach of federal jurisdiction and demonstrated the need for enforcing the local distribution facilities exception to reconcile the claims of federal and local government. The Court did not discuss the meaning of the \u201cengineering and scientific\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">In <em>Colton, </em>however, the Supreme Court applied the test in holding that there was substantial evidence to support FPC jurisdiction over the <em>sales </em>involved there (by a conceded public utility). 376 U.S. at 209, n. 5, 84 S.Ct. 644. Tracing had been used in that case and was relatively easy, since the sales involved were made to one customer. We are not persuaded that <em>Colton </em>and <em>Connecticut </em>are applicable to rule out use by the FPC of the so-called \u201cpower pool\u201d test on the record before us. Scientific evidence can be circumstantial as well as direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">The use of the \u201cpower pool\u201d test was approved in both Indiana &amp; Mich. Elec. Co. v. F. P. C., 365 F.2d 180 (7th Cir. 1966) (I <em>&amp; </em>M), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 972, 87 S.Ct. 509, 17 L.Ed.2d 435 (Dec. 6, 1966), and Arkansas Power &amp; Light Co. v. F. P. C., 368 F.2d 376, 8th Cir., Nov. 7, 1966. In <em>I &amp; M, </em>this court said: \u201cWe think the Commission was justified in holding that the important consideration in determining jurisdiction here is the integrated interstate pool character of the operation.\u201d 365 F.2d at 184. And in <em>Arkansas, </em>the court said it was not prepared to say that \u201cdetailed tracing studies are a <em>sine qua non\u201d </em>to federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>jurisdiction, where there is an interstate \u201cpool assist\u201d operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">It is true, as the Commission found, that there are \u201cobvious differences\u201d between the case before us and <em>I &amp; M </em>and <em>Arkansas, </em>in that they both \u201cinvolved corporate control and centralized operation.\u201d But the distinctions which PSCI seeks to make between its operation and the operations in those two cases are not persuasive. They presuppose that PSCI is an \u201cindependent, non-affiliated electric utility which' is not a member of a power pool.\u201d This presupposition flies in the face of the uncontrovertible fact that PSCI is interconnected in the same interstate network to which I &amp; M and Arkansas Light &amp; Power are connected. Within that network, there are several more highly integrated \u201cpower pools,\u201d one of which includes PSCI. Its participation in this pool by virtue of its interconnections, even though only for economy and emergency purposes, results in the introduction of a substantial amount of out-of-state energy into PSCI\u2019s system.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"> Under the Federal Power Act the findings of the commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, are conclusive. Federal Power Act \u00a7 313(b);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> F. P. C. v. Southern Cal. Edison Co., 376 U.S. at 209, n. 5, 84 S.Ct. 644. The proof in the record before us is sufficient to support an inference, to a reasonable scientific certainty, that interstate energy entered all of the sales in question and commingled with PSCI-generated energy. Thus, we hold that the Commission did not err in asserting jurisdiction over PSCI\u2019s sales to the Municipals and REMCs. Pennsylvania Water &amp; Power Co. v. F. P. C., 343 U.S. 414, 420, 72 S.Ct. 843, 96 L.Ed. 1042 (1952); Arkansas Power &amp; Light Co. v. F. P. C., supra; Indiana &amp; Mich. Elec. Co. v. F. P. C., 365 F.2d at 184; Wisconsin-Michigan Power Co. v. F. P. C., 197 F.2d 472, 478 (7th Cir. 1952), cert. denied, 345 U.S. 934, 73 S.Ct. 794, 97 L.Ed. 1362 (1953). There are three reasons for our conclusion: PSCI\u2019s interstate interconnections bring it into virtually the same multi-state system, with the same physical properties, that this court <em>ini &amp; M </em>thought justified the Commission\u2019s finding that the resulting \u201cpool sales\u201d were in interstate commerce.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, there is a lack of practical availability of facilities for tracing interstate energy into each PSCI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>sale to Municipals and REMCs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally there is confirmatory evidence by Commission expert Jessel illustrating the necessary commingling of energy transmitted into the state with PS Cl-generated energy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We disagree with PSCI that the Commission\u2019s decision before us reversed the burden of proof which Congress has placed upon the Commission <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to establish its jurisdiction by showing that the wholesale sales to the Municipals and REMCs contained out-of-state energy. Indiana &amp; Mich. Elec. Co. v. F. P. C., 365 F.2d at 184. We think that the Commission could find that the FPC Staff met its burden on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We see no necessity of extensively discussing Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light Co. v. F. P. C., 319 U.S. 61, 63 S.Ct. 953, 87 L.Ed. 1258 (1943), and Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. v. F. P. C., 324 U.S. 515, 65 S.Ct. 749, 89 L.Ed. 1150 (1945), in connection with PSCI\u2019s contention that jurisdiction over the Company\u2019s sales to Municipals and REMCs is reserved to Indiana. The contention has no merit. F. P. C. v. Southern Cal. Edison Co., 376 U.S. at 209, 210, 84 S.Ct. 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">PSCI argues that because its sales to Municipals and REMCs are effected only through facilities used in local distribution, the Commission has no jurisdiction. The determination of this question involves factual questions and these are original matters for the Commission. F. P. C. v. Southern Cal. Edison Co., 376 U.S. at 210, n. 6, 84 S.Ct. 644. We have found ample evidence in the record to support the Commission finding on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\"> The remaining points argued by PSCI are without merit. The argument based upon Indiana\u2019s many years of exercising jurisdiction over company rates was rejected by this court in <em>I &amp; M: \u201c </em>[A] history of previously unchallenged\u201d state regulations does not oust the Commission of jurisdiction. 365 F.2d at 183. In Wisconsin-Michigan Power Co., this court rejected the argument that sales to municipalities were exempt. 197 F.2d at 479. And the sales to REMCs are not exempt, because regardless of the character of the cooperatives and members, they are persons within the meaning of section 201(d) of the Federal Power Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Arkansas Power &amp; Light Co. v. F. P. C., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-16\">. 49 Stat. 847-848 (1935), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824(b) (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-17\">. Indiana and Michigan Electric Company-serves both Indiana and Michigan, and its interconnection with PSCI is within Indiana. The other two utilities, interconnected at the state line, are Louisville Gas and Electric Company (Kentucky) and Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company (Ohio). After the hearings closed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>in December, 1964, PSCI interconnected with a seventh public utility, Central Illinois Public Service Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\">. During 1963 21% of PSCI\u2019s distributed power was sold to Municipals and REMCs. Revenue from these sales in 1963 and in each of the several years prior to 1963 was approximately 11% of total revenue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b157-6\">. The Commission rejected the contention that the net flow of energy into the system (0.1% of PSCI\u2019s total energy requirements) was controlling in determining the existence of out-of-state energy in the sales to the Municipals and REMCs. We think this was a permissible administrative interpretation of the Act, especially in view of the benefits accruing to PSCI under the pooling arrangement. Cf. Pennsylvania Water &amp; Power Co. v. F.P.C., 343 U.S. 414, 420, 72 S.Ct. 843, 96 L.Ed. 1042 (1952). These benefits include increased reliability, reduced costs and reduction of its \u201cspinning reserve.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b157-9\">. 49 Stat. 860-861 (1935), as amended, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 8251 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b157-10\">. In the case before us the Commission found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">PSCI argues that we are obliged to show by the tracing methods used in the past that out-of-state energy reaches the physical points of sale involved herein. While there was a difference of opinion between witnesses for PSCI and our staff as to whether it is possible to make such a tracing study, such polemics are now irrelevant in light of our decision in <em>Arkansas, </em>supra. As we observed in that case, it is an over-simplication to talk in terms of a flow of electricity from point to point in an integrated power network. Instead, generation from each source in the system contributes directly or indirectly, and to an ever varying extent, to the energy present in all parts of the system which are not isolated from out-of-state sources. This rationale is equally applicable here. There is nothing in this record which establishes that the points of sale at wholesale are isolated from out-of-state sources. On the contrary, the record here demonstrates that the nature of PSOI\u2019s system is such that out-of-state energy could, at one time or other, reach all of PSCI\u2019s customers during the periods it admittedly was brought into and permeated the backbone transmission system.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\">. The Commission expert was witness Jes-sel, Chief of the Division of Electric Resources and Requirements of the EPC. He gave testimony that tracing was neither feasible nor practicable for studying the PSCI system. He testified that the tracing method, even with \u201cenormous advances in techniques,\u201d would take one to two years, and if conditions changed during the study, restudy would be needed and .result in \u201cmaking it almost impossible\u201d to conclude the study.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\">. Jessell testified from exhibits in evidence how energy received at PSCI\u2019s Gallagher generating station is commingled with energy received from Kentucky and the commingled energy then transmitted to Gallagher\u2019s substations, lower substations and lines supplied from these substations. He did the same with respect to energy received from <em>I &amp; M </em>and companies in Illinois and Ohio. He concluded that for the hour subject of the tracing, \u201cout-of-state energy permeated the entire system, except possibly\u201d through one substation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b158-15\">. 60 Stat. 241 (1946), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1006(c) (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b158-16\">. 49 Stat. 848 (1935), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824(d) (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
