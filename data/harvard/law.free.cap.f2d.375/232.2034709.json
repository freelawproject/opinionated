Birnbaum\u2019s petition for rehearing merely restates \u2014 though at considerably greater length and with more vehemence \u2014 the same argument which we understood appellant to be making on the appeal proper, and which we unanimously rejected in our opinion. 373 F.2d 250. Though we believe our decision adequately explained our rationale for rejecting Birnbaum\u2019s argument, we will elaborate somewhat on our holding in order to put to rest any misgiving that appellant may have as to our recognition of his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">On his first appeal, Birnbaum argued that Judge Murphy had erred in refusing to turn over to appellant the transcript of the Leonhardt-Birnbaum tape. That Court, after reading the transcript, unanimously rejected the contention because it believed that the trial court\u2019s finding that the tape was not \u201crelated\u201d to Leonhardt\u2019s testimony afforded no basis for reversal. Our later opinion in United States v. Ellenbogen, 341 F.2d 893 (2d Cir. 1965), cited by appellant as necessitating a reversal of his conviction, is not apposite for in <em>Ellenbogen </em>we held only that where statements are related to testimony, they must be produced. Since we recognized on this appeal that Judge Murphy had concluded that the tape did <em>not </em>relate to Leonhardt\u2019s testimony, we do not believe <em>Ellenbogen </em>in any way overruled or modified our first <em>Birnbaum </em>opinion. Indeed, <em>Ellenbogen </em>cited the <em>Birnbaum </em>opinion with approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">At his second trial, as we noted in our opinion, Birnbaum was furnished with the transcript of the Leonhardt-Birn-baum conversation. On appeal from the second conviction, however, he argued once more that Judge Murphy had erred in not ordering the production of the transcript at the first trial. Appellant renewed this contention in the hope of persuading us that he had been denied an adequate opportunity at his first trial to cross-examine Leonhardt, arid that Judge Cooper had erred when he admitted Leonhardt\u2019s former testimony into evidence. But we believe we answered this claim in our opinion by stating, \u201cimplicit in our [first] holding was our recognition that appellant had not been denied an adequate opportunity to cross-examine Leonhardt.\u201d Thus, even if there were error (which we have indicated there was not) in not giving Birn-baum the transcript at his first trial, it was at most harmless error, and we therefore see no reason to reverse appellant\u2019s second conviction. See United States v. Annunziato, 293 F.2d 373 (2d Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">Birnbaum urges, however, that the transcript would have enabled him to confront Leonhardt with his failure directly to accuse him of complicity in the Simon bribe. But, the absence of any prejudice to appellant is clear from the record at both his trials. The opportunity for full cross-examination was indeed available to Birnbaum at the first trial without recourse to the Leonhardt-Birnbaum tape, and it is apparent that he abandoned the opportunity for tactical reasons. We cannot ignore the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the conversation with Leonhardt took place in Birnbaum\u2019s office and that Birn-baum was the other party to it. Thus, he knew well that Leonhardt had not accused him directly of complicity in the Simon bribe. The important information supposedly revealed by the transcript was, therefore, available to Bimbaum and his counsel in another form \u2014 Bim-baum\u2019s own recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Moreover, the first trial furnished Birnbaum with additional information. Following Leonhardt\u2019s direct examination, the appellant was provided with Government\u2019s Exhibit 23A, an FBI report of an interview with Leonhardt. The report disclosed that Leonhardt had advised the FBI on August 21, 1961 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">\u201c[H]e believes he is friendly enough with Simons to invite him to lunch and discuss the money without arousing his suspicion. * * * [H]e also believes that while he has not seen Birn-baum in about a year, he could also have a conversation with Birnbaum about his tax problems and other matters and bring up the Simons situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">It should be noted that Leonhardt had testified at the first trial to having such a conversation with Simon on September 13, 1961, and that he had recorded that conversation. Moreover, the government, while opposing the production of the Leonhardt-Birnbaum transcript at the earlier trial, had nevertheless identified the exhibit (GX27) as the transcript of a conversation between those two men held on October 2, 1961. Knowing all this and, in addition, being a party to the conversation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant chose not to cross-examine Leonhardt regarding his failure to accuse Birnbaum on October 2, 1961 of having participated in the bribe.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And, it is interesting that Birnbaum himself failed to mention the allegedly exculpatory conversation with Leonhardt when he testified at the first trial. Instead, he contented himself with his counsel\u2019s trial tactic to wait until his summation to the jury (when Leonhardt was foreclosed from explaining or answering) to make his broadside attack on Leonhardt\u2019s testimony because he failed \u201cat any time in any conversation\u201d to accuse Birnbaum of his part in the bribe. And, Mr. Brill, his lawyer at the first trial added: \u201cand you know very well that the reason there was not such a conversation with Birnbaum was because it never happened.\u201d It is also noted that a similarly potent argument by appellant\u2019s counsel was made at Birnbaum\u2019s second trial when Leonhardt\u2014 this time due to his death \u2014 was again unable to explain his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-15\">It is thus clear to us that the failure to provide Bimbaum at the first trial with a copy of the transcript of the Leon-hardt-Bimbaum tape did not deny him an adequate opportunity to cross-examine Leonhardt. It is apparent that appellant avoided confrontation on the issue involved while Leonhardt was alive and this maneuver can provide him with little solace now that Leonhardt is dead. Leonhardt\u2019s former testimony was properly admitted at Birnbaum\u2019s second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-16\">Petition for rehearing denied in all respects. Petition to stay mandate pending application to the Supreme Court for certiorari granted pursuant to Rule 28 (c) of this Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\">. Birnbaum\u2019s knowledge as to what transpired during his conversation with Leonhardt clearly distinguishes this case from Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966). In <em>Dennis </em>the petitioners had sought production of the grand jury testimony given by four government witnesses. The petitioners there, unlike Birnbaum, bad no knowledge of or access to the statements made to the grand jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b288-18\">.
