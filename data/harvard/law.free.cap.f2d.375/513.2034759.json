The Secretary, appellee herein, had filed a complaint to enforce the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1062-63 (1938), as amended; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206, 207 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-16\">The sole question is whether appellant transportation company is engaged in the business of operating taxi cabs within the meaning of an exemption clause in the Fair Labor Standards Act, \u00a7 13(a) (12), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a) (12) (1964). The particular part of its operation which appellant claims to be within this exemption is that involved in the operation of four-passenger sedans which it calls \u201cRed Tops,\u201d and which it operates from the Cincinnati Airport in the vicinity of Covington, Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-17\">The case was heard upon testimony and stipulations. The District Judge found as facts the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-18\">\u201c8. The Red Tops have certain attributes of a regular taxicab in that they are of a four-passenger capacity and do not operate over fixed routes according to a predetermined time schedule. However, all trips must either originate or terminate at the airport, the Red Tops are used for the sole purpose of providing ground transportation to and from the airport and their use by the general public is restricted to those traveling to and from the said airport. The Red Tops are unmetered, do not have vacancy signs and are not advertised as taxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>cabs. They stand and wait for passengers only at the airport.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201c9. The drivers of the cars are not free to organize their own time and use little or no initiative in securing passengers. The number of drivers on duty at any given time is determined by the defendants in advance by use of schedules of arrivals and departures of airplanes secured from the various airlines mentioned in Findings of Fact No. 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u201c10. Defendants stipulated that employee-drivers of the Red Tops were paid wages at rates less than the rates required by section 6 of the Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206). * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Based on these findings, the District Judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">\u201c5. Exemptions under the Act are to be narrowly construed and defendants have the burden of proving that their employees are exempt from the provisions of sections 6 and 7 by reason of section 13(a) (12). Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., 361 U.S. 388 [80 S.Ct. 453, 4 L.Ed.2d 393]; Mitchell v. Kentucky Finance Co., 359 U.S. 290 [79 S.Ct. 756, 3 L.Ed.2d 815]; A. H. Phillips, Inc. v. Walling, 324 U.S. 490 [65 S.Ct. 807, 89 L.Ed. 1095]; West Kentucky Coal Co. v. Walling, 153 F.2d 582 (CA6); Goldberg v. Furman Beauty Supply, 300 F.2d 16 (CA3); Mitchell v. Sherry Corine Corp., 264 F.2d 831 (CA4), [cert. denied, 360 U.S. 934 [79 S.Ct. 1453, 3 L.Ed.2d 1546] (1959)]; Airlines Transportation, Inc. v. Tobin, 198 F.2d 249 (CA4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">\u201c6. Defendants have failed to prove that they are engaged in the business of operating taxicabs within the meaning of the section 13(a) (12) exemption. Airlines Transportation, Inc. v. Tobin, 198 F.2d 249 (CA 4).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">The record clearly supports the findings of fact of the District Judge and certainly we cannot hold them to be \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Rule 52(a) Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">Further, we believe that the case principally relied upon by appellant actually supports the result reached by the District Judge. While we recognize that the limousines there dealt with followed regular schedules and routes and appellants\u2019 \u201cRed\u2019Tops\u201d do not, we think this distinction is not a vital one when balanced against the facts recited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">Among other things which distinguish appellants\u2019 business from \u201cthe business of operating taxicabs\u201d is that appellants\u2019 \u201cRed Tops\u201d clearly function under \u201ca contract with interstate air car-, riers to facilitate their interstate business.\u201d Airlines Transportation, Inc. v. Tobin, 198 F.2d 249, 252 (C.A.4, 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
