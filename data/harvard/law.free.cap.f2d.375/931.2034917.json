The policy was a so-called Home Owners Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-22\">Appellees\u2019 property was insured in part on an unspecified peril basis by another carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-23\">There is, in the policy here in question, an \u201cexcess\u201d provision providing for excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance. Appellees, who recovered from the other insurer for the property that was stolen, called on appellant for such excess loss. Appellant declined to pay and, on cross motions for summary judgment, the District Court held that the loss was covered by the \u201cexcess\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-24\">We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
