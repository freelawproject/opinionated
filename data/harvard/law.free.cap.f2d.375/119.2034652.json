He was placed on probation, which probation was revoked on December 4, 1964, and appellant was placed in the custody of the Attorney General. The Bureau of Prisons, acting on behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>of the Attorney General, placed appellant at first in ai Federal Reformatory at El Reno, Oklahoma, and then in a \u201cFederal Youth Camp\u201d at Tucson, Arizona. On November 13, 1965, appellant was a member of a \u201cfield tour,\u201d transported by bus from the Youth Camp to the University of Arizona under the supervision of a \u201crecreation officer,\u201d to observe a football game between the Arizona and the United States Air Force teams. After the game, upon boarding the bus to return to the camp, appellant was found missing. He was subsequently picked up by the Winslow, Arizona, police department, and while detained there, asked to speak to an F.B.I. agent. He then admitted he had escaped the custody of the Youth Camp.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Appellant was indicted for such escape (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751), was tried without a jury, convicted, and sentenced to three years imprisonment, <em>concurrent to his existing sentence under the Dyer Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Appellant specifies but one error on this appeal, namely, that once a preliminary hearing is commenced before a United States Commissioner there can be no grand jury indictment of a prisoner. No authority for this rule of law has been submitted to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Appellant relies upon (but miscites) United States v. Universita, 192 F.Supp. 154 (S.D.N.Y.1961). In that habeas corpus case, preliminary examination had been continued at the government\u2019s request, and an indictment thereafter returned. The writ, requested on the basis the defendant had been denied a preliminary examination, was denied; the court ruling (contrary to appellant\u2019s position here) that \u201c[t]he action of the grand jury * * * superseded and eliminated the need for a preliminary examination.\u201d Id. at 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Appellant\u2019s position was rejected in United States v. Gray, 87 F.Supp. 436, 437 (D.C.1949), where Judge Holtzoff stated: \u201c* * * [T]he Grand Jury had a right to hear the evidence presented against this defendant and find the indictment against him, irrespective of whether a preliminary hearing had or had not been held.\u201d Cf. also: United States v. Brace, 192 F.Supp. 714 (D.Md. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">This appeal approaches the frivolous. Appointed counsel may be congratulated for excessive zeal on behalf of his client, but no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
