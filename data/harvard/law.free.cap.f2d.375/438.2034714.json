He held that the retroactive grant of the license to file in Canada cured the putative invalidity of the patent because of the foreign filing without a license prior to the end of six months after the United States filing. Union Carbide Corporation v. Microtron Corporation, 254 F.Supp. 299 (W.D.N.C. 1966). Because there was then a conflict between the decision and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. Norton Co., 240 F.Supp. 150 (N.D.Ohio 1965), he made the necessary certifications, and we granted an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The decision in the Northern District of Ohio was reversed in Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. v. Norton Co., 366 F.2d 238 (6 Cir. 1966), which held that a patent for scouring pads was not invalid because the license for foreign filings, by its terms retroactive to the dates of foreign filings, was not obtained until after the United States patent was obtained. On the authority of the <em>Minnesota Mining </em>case (366 F.2d 238), and for the reasons advanced by the district judge from whom the instant appeal is taken, we conclude that Patent No. 2,784,-132 is not invalid, and we affirm the denial of summary judgment. There is before us, in this appeal, no question of the rights of the parties in regard to alleged infringement prior to the date of the issuance of the license for foreign filing, and we express no opinion with respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-13\">. Application for Patent No. 2,784,132 was filed May 11, 1953. The Canadian application was filed on October 10, 1953. The invention was insulating batt, consisting of a plurality of non-absorbent non-matting fibers held in three-dimensional, random, arrangement by flexible adhesive. The batt is claimed to be suitable for use as an interliner for clothing, as an air or gas filter, and as a packing material for delicate objects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-21\">.
