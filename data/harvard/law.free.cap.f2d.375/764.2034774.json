Motions for rehearing filed December 2 and 5, 1966 were denied by Judge Bonsai on January 5, 1967. Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on February 23, 1967. Although the running of the thirty days allowed for filing a notice of appeal was terminated by the filing of the motions for rehearing, regarded as motions \u201cto alter or amend the judgment\u201d under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), Vine v. Beneficial Fin. Co., Inc., 374 F.2d 627 (2 Cir. March 13, 1967); Gainey v. Brotherhood of Ry. &amp; S.S. Clerks, 303 F.2d 716 (3 Cir. 1962); 7 Moore, Federal Practice par. 73.09 [4], at 3185 (2 ed. 1966), more than thirty days elapsed between the denial of the motions on January 5 and the filing of the notice of appeal on February 23. This appeal must therefore be dismissed because the notice of appeal was untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">If the merits of the appeal were before us, we would affirm, because the absence of federal jurisdiction is clear. Plaintiff has not alleged any diversity of citizenship between herself and any of the defendants. She contends upon appeal that her complaint is based on \u201cviolations against the SEC,\u201d but the allegations of her complaint, however broadly read, do not charge any violations of the federal securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">Appeal dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
