If one goes from active duty to a reserve unit, it may be said one is half in and half out. On certain conditions, one in the reserves is subject to recall. One \u201csevered\u201d is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-20\">Normally severance pay is much greater than the readjustment pay, which one receives on a transfer out to the reserves. If Pedersen was \u201creadjusted out,\u201d he should have received $3,155.00. If he was severed, he was entitled to $12,465.17 ($13,220 less deductions of $754.83). The paymaster contemporaneously with the effective date of the release gave him a government check for $12,465.17 which Pedersen cashed. Four months later, the disbursing officer of the Marine Corps notified Pedersen that he was overpaid and requested repayment of the difference between the two amounts. Ped-ersen refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-21\">In this suit for the alleged overpayment, after a trial, the district court ruled for Pedersen.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-22\">Obviously, one\u2019s pay follows one\u2019s status. Here status was established by the release orders. We hold that the larger check does not impeach the release orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-23\">We cannot follow appellee\u2019s contention that the government must, somehow prove that, unknown to him, the government did- not make through some person or board a determination that he was disabled. However, the government\u2019s argument is rather convincing that it did prove satisfactorily that no such determination was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-24\">From the record, we can find no evidence that Pedersen was really ever on the severance track.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-25\">The judgment is reversed. The district court should enter a judgment against Pedersen based on the difference between severance and readjustment pay.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
