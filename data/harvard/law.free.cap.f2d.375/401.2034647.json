Appellant\u2019s application was first denied upon the Appeals Council\u2019s adoption of a Hearing Examiner\u2019s Decision. Review was sought in the United States District Court and there, upon motion of the Secretary, the matter was remanded for a further hearing. Such hearing was had before another Hearing Examiner whose decision recommended the award of benefits to appellant. The Appeals Council, however, did not adopt its Hearing Examiner\u2019s recommended decision and benefits to appellant were refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-18\">The matter was again brought to the District Court for review. After review of the entire administrative record, the District Court affirmed the Secretary\u2019s decision by granting his motion for summary judgment and denying a like motion by appellant. The Secretary\u2019s decision involved resolution of issues of fact as to appellant\u2019s disabilities and entitlement to Social Security benefits. They were decided against appellant after extensive hearings and testimony. We are satisfied that the findings of the Appeals Council which became the Secretary\u2019s Decision were supported by substantial evidence. This was the decision of the United States District Judge. His memorandum opinion adequately reviews the facts and issues, and correctly recites the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-19\">For the reasons set out in the District Judge\u2019s opinion, see Monday v. Cele-brezze, 265 F.Supp. 528 (D.C.W.D.Tenn. 1965), we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
