YALMAS, which was under sub-charter to Enterprise Marine Co., is entitled to a maritime lien. The answer turns on a construction of certain provisions in the time charter party, dated June 23, 1964, between Compagne Nav-iere, the owner, and Alltransport, Inc., as charterer, and in the subcharter party, dated August 10, 1964, between Alltrans-port and Enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-23\">International Terminal Operating Co., Inc., was employed by Enterprise, under a contract executed on May 27, 1964, to perform general stevedoring services on vessels owned, operated, controlled or chartered by Enterprise.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>suant to this contract, the stevedore unloaded cargo from the S.S. VALMAS when she was in Chicago under the management of Enterprise. In order to recover unpaid charges of $25,959 plus interest for the services supplied, the stevedore filed a libel in rem against the vessel. Both the owner and the time charterer claimed the vessel, and moved for summary judgment on the ground that by virtue of paragraph 18 of the time charter party and paragraph 17 of the subcharter party, Enterprise had no authority \u2014 and in fact was forbidden\u2014 to incur a maritime lien.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The libelant also moved for summary judgment, on the ground that nothing in either of the charters, correctly interpreted, prohibited Enterprise from inc\u00farring a lien on the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-16\">It is beyond dispute that absent the clauses in question, a lien would arise, since the Federal Maritime Lien Act, pertinent portions of which are set out in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that the supplier of \u201cnecessaries\u201d shall be entitled to a lien on the vessel to which the \u201cnecessaries\u201d are furnished.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-17\">If inspection of a charter party would have shown that the charterer had no authority to bind the ship, a supplier of \u201cnecessaries\u201d is charged by section 973 with knowledge of the provisions of the charter party forbidding the creation of a lien.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the present ease it is agreed that the stevedore did not seek to inspect the ship\u2019s papers, although they were readily available upon request, and thus failed to exercise the \u201creasonable diligence\u201d required by section 973. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Despite this failure, however, if the questioned documents do not deprive Enterprise of authority to permit a lien on the vessel, the stevedore is still entitled to a lien.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The District Court ruled that paragraph 18 of the time charter party prevented Alltransport from incurring a lien, but that the prohibition did not extend to Enterprise as the subcharterer. The court nevertheless dismissed the libel on the theory that paragraph 17 of the subcharter party prevented the creation of a lien by Enterprise. From the summary judgment libelant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s holding that the stevedore is not entitled to a lien, although we reach this result by a somewhat different route.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The case principally relied upon by the vessel to prevent the attachment of a maritime lien, Dampskibsselskabet Dan-nebrog v. Signal Oil &amp; Gas Co., 310 U.S. 268, 280, 60 S.Ct. 937, 943, 84 L.Ed. 1197, (1940), held that to have this effect, the charter party must \u201cprovide therein that the creation of maritime liens is prohibited.\u201d In <em>Signal Oil, </em>the time charterers had agreed to \u201cprovide and pay for\u201d fuel oil supplies. The Supreme Court held that this phrase was not adequate to prevent the creation of a lien for necessaries ordered by the charterer. The Court implied that to bar a lien, it would be necessary to include a provision similar to that considered in United States v. Carver, 260 U.S. 482, 43 S.Ct. 181, 67 L.Ed. 361 (1923): that charterers \u201cwill not suffer nor permit to be continued any lien * *</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">The clause in <em>Carver </em>is substantially identical with paragraph 18 of the time charter party in the case before us, except that the latter includes the phrase \u201cincurred by them or their agents.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the District Court held that paragraph 18 barred the creation of a lien by the charterers, it declared that because of this phrase, the provision was sufficient only to prohibit liens incurred by the time charterers \u201cor their agents,\u201d and that the prohibition did not extend to the subcharterer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We find this view unpersuasive; we read the words \u201cor their agents\u201d as words of emphasis, not of limitation. They imply no narrowing, but instead underscore the broad generality of the prohibition against liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">Although the time charter contains a clause permitting the charterer to sublet the vessel during the life of the time charter party, it explicitly provides that the charterers are to remain \u201cresponsible for the fulfillment of this Charter Party.\u201d The charterer could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u201cgrant to the sub-charterer rights beyond those which he has under his original charter from the owner * * Poor, Charter Parties &amp; Ocean Bills of Lading \u00a7 20 (4th ed. 1954). Thus the subcharterer stands in the shoes of the charterer, and a subcharter party between Alltransport and Enterprise would incorporate by implication the terms of the time charter. It is difficult to square the exaction from the original charterer of the agreement prohibiting the creation of a lien with the notion that it was a matter of indifference if the subcharter should create a lien exposing the vessel to the very risk stipulated against. It would take very compelling language indeed to justify reading the time charter party as forbidding the ch\u00e1rterer to suffer a lien against the vessel, yet tolerating its creation by any unknown subcharterer. The prohibition against permitting a lien is aimed not only at the charterer and his agents, but against permitting a lien by a subcharterer.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Alltransport, in accordance with maritime practice,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is described in the sub-charter party as the <em>\u201cTime-chartered </em>Owner of the motor-vessel VALMAS.\u201d Had the stevedore complied with the command of section 973 and inspected the ship\u2019s papers, it would have been put on notice of the existence of a prior charter party. Inspection of that document would have disclosed that Alltransport could not permit a lien to be created, and therefore could not grant Enterprise authority to do so. If Alltransport had purported to confer such authority, it clearly would have breached the terms of the time charter party. The stevedore, or other supplier of the vessel, reading the subcharter party and the time charter party to which attention was thereby directed, could hardly be misled into thinking that these documents left it the' protection of a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">We find support for this view in Ocean Cargo Lines, Ltd. v. North Atlantic Marine Co., 227 F.Supp. 872 (S.D.N.Y. 1964), where a supplier of fuel oil sought to avoid the effect of a prohibition of lien clause in a time charter by arguing that since the voyage charter between charterer and subcharterer contained no prohibition of lien clause, the supplier was not barred from enforcing its lien. The District Court pointed out, however, that section 973 of the Federal Maritime Lien Act refers to a prohibition of lien by \u201cthe terms of <em>a </em>charter party.\u201d (Emphasis in Judge Feinberg\u2019s opinion.) The court therefore declared that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">so long as a prohibition of lien is contained in <em>any </em>charter under which a vessel is operated at the time supplies are furnished to the vessel, a would be lienor is bound to exercise \u201creasonable diligence\u201d in inquiring whether the supplies are ordered by the owner or by one having authority to bind the vessel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">227 F.Supp. at 878. (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">We leave open, as unnecessary to a decision here, the question whether, standing alone, the language of section 17 of the subch\u00e1rter party, providing that cargo was to be loaded \u201cfree of risk and expense to the vessel\u201d constitutes a sufficient bar to the creation of a lien, as our District Court thought, or is insufficient, as Judge Wisdom thought in addressing himself to identical language in Cooper Stevedoring of Louisiana, Inc. v. Pappadakis, 363 F.2d 352 (5th Cir. July 18, 1966).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For the disposition of the present case, it is enough that the charter party and the subcharter party together, which were available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>on board the vessel and knowledge of the contents of which is attributable to the stevedore, conveyed ample notice that the lien was unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-12\">. Appellees \u2014 the owner and the time charterer \u2014 argue that this prior, <em>general </em>contract indicates that the stevedore did not rely on the credit of the vessel, since at the time the contract was made, the S. S. YALMAS had not yet been sub-chartered to Enterprise. We find no merit in this contention, however. In Dampskibsselskabet Dannebrog v. Signal Oil &amp; Gas Co., 310 U.S. 268, 60 S.Ct. 937, 84 L.Ed. 1197 (1940), the libelant was under a general contract to supply \u201cthe fuel' oil requirements of any and all vessels \u25a0owned, chartered, or operated by W. L. Comyn &amp; Sons.\u201d Subsequent to the contract\u2019s execution, vessels were chartered to W. L. Gomyn &amp; Sons to which libelant furnished fuel. The Court held that this did not prevent the creation of maritime liens for supplies actually furnished the vessels. See also Point Landing, Inc. v. Alabama Dry Dock &amp; Shipbuilding Co., 261 F.2d 861, 867 (5th Cir. 1958), which held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-25\">since the furnishing of the supply, repair or necessary to the vessel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>presumptively on the credit of the ship, a maritime lien arises unless it is affirmatively established that it was done solely on personal credit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Moreover, the Federal Maritime Lien Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 971 (1958), expressly states that it is not necessary to <em>prove </em>that credit was extended to the <em>vessel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">See note 3, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\">.
