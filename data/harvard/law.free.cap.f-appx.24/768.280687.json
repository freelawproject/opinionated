The immigration judge concluded that Gomez had satisfied the seven-year continuous residency requirement for suspension of deportation but denied his petition for failure to show extreme hardship. Gomez appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) for review of the immigra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>tion judge\u2019s decision that Gomez did not establish extreme hardship. Between the time that the immigration judge concluded that Gomez had satisfied the continuous residency requirement and the time that the BIA reviewed Gomez\u2019s petition, IIRI-RA went into effect. IIRIRA provided a new method, known as the \u201cstop-time rule,\u201d for determining whether a petitioner satisfied the seven-year continuous residency requirement. The BIA applied the stop-time rule retroactively and dismissed Gomez\u2019s petition without reviewing the immigration judge\u2019s decision that Gomez did not establish extreme hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Gomez filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus alleging that the retroactive application of IIRIRA violates his due process rights and violates the presumption against retroactivity. The district court denied Gomez\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus. This petition is governed by IIRI-RA\u2019s transitional rules. <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Before IIRIRA, an alien was eligible for suspension of deportation if he or she \u201cha[d] been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years immediately preceding the date of [the] application\u201d and met certain other conditions. <em>See </em>former INA \u00a7 244(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1). Commencement of deportation proceedings had no effect on an alien\u2019s accrual of the requisite seven years. Congress fundamentally altered this system by enacting IIRIRA\u2019s stop-time rule. The stop-time rule provides that the period of continuous physical presence in the United States stops accruing upon service of an order to show cause. INA \u00a7 240A(d)(l), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l). Thus, after IIRIRA, aliens must meet the continuous physical presence requirement before the commencement of deportation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Gomez\u2019s argument that the retroactive application of the stop-time rule violates his due process rights is foreclosed by <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510 (9th Cir.2001). In <em>Ram, </em>the Ninth Circuit held that the stop-time rule applies to suspension <em>of </em>deportation cases heard by an immigration judge or on appeal after IIRIRA took effect on April 1,1997. <em>Id. </em>at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Gomez is not eligible for suspension of deportation under INA \u00a7 244(a) because, as a result of the operation of the stop-time rule enacted by IIRIRA, he cannot meet the seven-year continuous residency requirement. Since Gomez\u2019s challenges to the stop-time rule fail, the denial of Gomez\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b794-25\">.
