The defendant argues that the district court erred when it failed to make specific factual findings regarding the nature, quantity, and risk of the substance involved, and further erred in choosing not to depart downward two base offense levels based on the relatively innocuous nature of those substances, as permitted by United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) \u00a7 2Q1.2, app. n. 8 (2000). The defendant further claims that the court erred in refusing to depart downward based upon the totality of the circumstances pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K2.0 (2000), and that the district court improperly calculated his criminal history category and failed to address specifically his claim that, contrary to the conclusions of the presentence report, he did not commit the instant offense while on probation. For the following reasons, we conclude that we do not have jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward and that the district court made no reversible error in sentencing the defendant. Accordingly, we dismiss the defendant\u2019s first claim for lack of jurisdiction and af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>firm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The defendant, Michael R. Kyle, was the president of Custom Concepts, Inc. (CCI). He and his equal partner and vice president, Edward L. Johnson, produced fiberglass automotive parts, repaired collision damage, and operated a retail business that sold after-market automotive parts. Throughout the course of business, the company generated hazardous waste, specifically acetone, isomers of xylene, and toluene. Kyle and Johnson had a documented history of not complying with the state or federal environmental regulations that required the proper labeling, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste, dating back at least to October 20,1998, when the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) inspected the CCI premises and found hazardous wastes improperly stored on site.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">CCI experienced serious financial difficulties, and Carl Romberg, the owner of the building in which CCI operated, eventually evicted the company for failure to pay rent. Kyle and Johnson moved the company and changed its name to Customer Fiberglass, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">In January 2000, after CCI vacated the premises, Romberg discovered that Kyle and Johnson had abandoned seventy-two 55-gallon drums containing various liquid wastes and fiberglass resin. On February 8, 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency conducted a criminal enforcement sampling investigation and determined that fourteen of the seventy-two drums contained hazardous waste. More specifically, the liquid in the fourteen drums exhibited the characteristic of ignitability. Four of the fourteen also exhibited the characteristic of toxicity. On July 7, 2000, Romberg paid $9,540.00 to dispose legally of the hazardous waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">The East Tennessee Environmental Crimes Task Force interviewed both Kyle and Johnson. They admitted that the contents of the drams had accumulated over approximately two years. They also conceded that they knew the proper method for the storage and disposal of hazardous waste but maintained that they did not have the funds to store and dispose of the waste properly. The waste was not marked or identified. Both Kyle and Johnson accepted responsibility for the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">Kyle and Johnson were arrested and indicted on three separate counts. Count One charged that \u201cfrom on or about [the] 20th day of October, 1998, and continuing until on or about the 7th day of July, 2000,\u201d Kyle and Johnson had knowingly stored hazardous waste without a permit. Counts Two and Three involved knowingly generating, storing, disposing of, and handling hazardous waste and failing to file records, applications, and reports. Kyle and Johnson entered into separate plea agreements in which they pled guilty to Count One in exchange for the dismissal of Counts Two and Three, and agreed to admit all facts alleged in the indictment and the stipulated \u201cagreed Factual Basis,\u201d which they signed contemporaneously with the plea agreement. They agreed that the maximum penalty they could receive was five years imprisonment, a $250,000.00 fine, three years supervised release, and a mandatory assessment fee of $100.00, and they waived all their rights except the right to appeal their sentences. The plea agreement explicitly stated that the violation occurred \u201cfrom on or about October 20, 1998 until on or about July 7, 2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">Prior to sentencing, Kyle was convicted twice of driving under the influence. He was placed on probation for these offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>on June 1, 2000. He has an extensive criminal history, which includes two previous DUIs. At the time of Kyle\u2019s sentencing, another DUI was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Kyle and Johnson were sentenced separately on July 7, 2001. The district court accepted Kyle\u2019s plea agreement and found his presentence report to be accurate. The district court adopted the presentence report\u2019s recommendation of a base level offense of ten \u2014 a base level of eight for mishandling hazardous materials, plus an additional four levels for storing hazardous material without a permit, less two levels for acceptance of responsibility. The district court found that Kyle had a criminal history category of III, based upon the three criminal history points Kyle received for his DUIs and the two additional criminal history points he received pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(d) for committing the offense while he was on probation. These findings resulted in a ten to sixteen month range in Zone C.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Kyle filed a motion for downward departure, which was denied. He was sentenced to five months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release, including five months of home detention. Further, Kyle was required to make restitution in the amount of $9,540.00 to Romberg, and to implement a hazardous waste prevention and detection program. Comparatively, the district court acknowledged that this sentence was minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Kyle appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">When we review a sentence imposed by a district court, we accept the findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (2001). We give \u201cdue deference\u201d to the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">\n<em>B. Downward Departure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">Two of Kyle\u2019s claims on appeal involve a request for this court to review and reverse the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward two base offense levels. First, Kyle asserts that the district court committed reversible error when it failed to make specific findings regarding the nature, quantity, and risk of the substances illegally stored. Kyle maintains that had the court made the required findings, he would have been entitled to a two-level downward departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Q1.2, app. n. 8 because the 55-gallon drums were sealed and were not leaking into the environment, and the quantity was so minimal that it did not present a threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">Second, Kyle claims\" that the district court erred by refusing to depart downward pursuant to the provisions of USSG \u00a7 5K2.0. Kyle argues that the district court failed to consider the totality of the circumstances, specifically Kyle\u2019s contentions that placing him in prison would result in the destruction of his business and the loss of his employees\u2019 jobs and that his criminal history category significantly over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. Had the district court departed downward two levels, Kyle\u2019s offense would have fallen within Zone B instead of Zone C, making him eligible for a sentence of confinement such as home detention rather than imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">We reject each of these claims. Although in his objections to the presentence report, Kyle raised his claim that because of the nature and quantity of the substances, the risks involved in their storage were minimal, he provided no evidence whatsoever at the sentencing hearing to support that claim. Rather, he merely reiterated his view that in relation to other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>environmental offenses (and compared to the really reprehensible actions he could have undertaken with regard to the hazardous waste that he illegally stored), this offense was innocuous. The district court did- not expressly reject the defendant\u2019s attempt to minimize his offense, but the court did specifically adopt the findings of the presentence report. Under these circumstances, we find no merit to Kyle\u2019s claim that the district court\u2019s failure to make specific factual findings was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">It is well established in this circuit that \u201ca district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward from a sentence within the properly computed guideline range is not appealable.\u201d <em>United States v. Pickett, </em>941 F.2d 411, 417-18 (6th Cir.1991). We may review a district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for a downward departure only if the district court mistakenly believed that it lacked the authority to grant such a departure as a matter of law. <em>United States v. Shabazz, </em>263 F.3d 603, 611 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Here, in denying Kyle\u2019s motion for downward departure, the judge said, \u201cThe court recognizes a number of appropriate circumstances that the Court might very well depart downward. So the Court is stating that it believes it does have the authority to depart downward, but the Court does not believe that the facts demonstrated here would justify a downward departure in this case.\u201d That the district court understood its authority to depart could not be clearer. We lack jurisdiction to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\n<em>C. Criminal History Category</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Kyle asserts that the district court improperly increased his criminal history points by two under USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(d) because he was not on probation at the time of the offense. He argues that because it was legal for him to store the waste without a permit for 180 days, the offense commenced on the day after he was required to obtain a permit for the storage of those materials and ended on the day the offense was discovered. By his calculations, the violation did not begin until 180 days after October 20, 1998 \u2014 the day of the TDEC inspection \u2014 and ended around February 8, 2000 \u2014 the date on which the criminal investigation was begun. Therefore, Kyle contends, the offense ended long before June 1, 2000, the date he was placed on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">We acknowledge the paucity of case law regarding the definite beginning and ending of such an offense. However, we need not address this issue \u2014 or Kyle\u2019s related claim that the district court failed to make specific factual findings with regard to the date the offense terminated\u2014 because Kyle pled guilty to this offense. The Supreme Court has held that when a defendant voluntarily and knowingly enters a guilty plea, that individual admits all averments of fact in the indictment. Tol<em>lett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 260-67, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973).. The indictment here expressly states that \u201cfrom on or about [the] 20th day of October, 1998, and continuing until on or about the 7th day of July, 2000,\u201d Kyle knowingly stored hazardous waste without a permit. Similarly, the plea agreement specifically states that the offense \u201coccurred] from on or about October 20, 1988, until on or about July 7, 2000.\u201d It is evident that Kyle admitted to the beginning and ending dates of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">Kyle was placed on probation for his DUI convictions on June 1, 2000, more than a month before the legal disposal of the hazardous waste was accomplished on July 7, 2000, the admitted ending date of the offense. Because Kyle was on proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>tion for at least a portion of the time period of the offense, the district court did not err by increasing Kyle\u2019s criminal history score by two points under USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS for lack of jurisdiction Kyle\u2019s downward departure claims made pursuant to USSG \u00a7\u00a7 2Q1.2, app. n. 8 and 5K2.0. We AFFIRM the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
