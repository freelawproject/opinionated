After being acquitted of the charges of assault and intimidation stemming from Weinstein\u2019s complaint against him, Lockhead sued Weinstein, a YWCA employee. Lockhead argued that Weinstein worked in concert with state authorities to falsely arrest and prosecute him, and therefore that she and the YWCA acted under \u201ccolor of state law\u201d to violate his federal rights and were hable under \u00a7 1983. The district court concluded that Lockhead did not introduce a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Weinstein and the YWCA acted under color of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., </em>198 F.3d 1104, 1108 (9th Cir.2000). We will affirm the decision to grant summary judgment when, reviewing the record as a whole and drawing ah reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, we find no genuine issue of material fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Lockhead asserts that Weinstein is lying when she claims that he assaulted her. His testimony alone is sufficient to create a fact question as to this issue. But the fact that she might have been lying does not mean that she acted under color of law under \u00a7 1983. A plaintiff trying to show that a private party acted under color of state law must show that the defendants \u201cconspired or acted jointly with state actors.\u201d <em>Radcliffe v. Rainbow Const. Co., </em>254 F.3d 772, 783 (9th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United Steelworkers v. Phelps Dodge Corp., </em>865 F.2d 1539, 1540 (9th Cir.1989)). The plaintiffs must therefore provide evidence of \u201can agreement or meeting of the minds to violate constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Phelps-Dodge, </em>865 F.2d at 1540-41). But the mere furnishing of information to police officers does not constitute joint action under color of state law which renders a private citizen liable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Benavidez v. Gunnell, </em>722 F.2d 615, 618 (10th Cir.1983); <em>Butler v. Goldblatt Bros., Inc., </em>589 F.2d 323, 327 (7th Cir.1978). As we noted in <em>Radeliffe, </em>\u201ca relationship of cause and effect between the complaint and the prosecution is not sufficient, or every citizen who complained to a prosecutor would find himself in a conspiracy.\u201d <em>Radcliffe, </em>254 F.3d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">Lockhead argues that the officers who arrested him, and the prosecutors who decided to try him, acted against him at Weinstein\u2019s urging despite the fact that there was no probable cause to do so. He asserts that Weinstein, who was the Executive Director of the YWCA, had connections with the local law-enforcement community, and that she used these contacts to conspire with them to falsely arrest and prosecute him. Lockhead points to the following facts as evidence of a conspiracy: 1) Weinstein knew Assistant City Attorney Judy Wang before the incident; 2) Weinstein contacted Wang at home on a weekend; 3) Wang decided the case was a felony and referred it to Townsend; 4) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>audio portion of the video tape of the incident, according to Lockhead, reveals that the entire incident lasted only eight seconds, which was not enough time for Lockhead to have acted as Weinstein alleged; 5) Weinstein was familiar with the local law-enforcement community, if not the actors in this case other than Judy Wang; and 6) when Weinstein phoned 911 after the incident, she identified herself as the Executive Director of the YWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">None of these facts, however, goes to show that Weinstein \u201cconspired\u201d with the law-enforcement officials involved. <em>See Radcliffe, </em>254 F.3d at 783. Lockhead was arrested after Weinstein\u2019s statement to the police and before Weinstein called Wang. Thus his arrest can hardly be attributed to Weinstein\u2019s control over Wang. Moreover, the investigating officer\u2019s incident report gives the bases for Lockhead\u2019s arrest: Weinstein\u2019s statement, the statements of two eye-witnesses, and the injuries to Weinstein. There is simply no evidence that Lockhead was arrested because of Weinstein\u2019s relationship with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Similarly, there is no evidence that Lockhead was prosecuted because of Weinstein\u2019s special relationship with law-enforcement officials. Although Lockhead did know Wang before the incident occurred, she did not know County Attorney Karen Townsend, who made the decision to prosecute Lockhead. There is no evidence that Townsend decided to prosecute Lockhead because of Wang\u2019s recommendation instead of an independent assessment of the evidence. Wang was not herself a friend of Townsend. Indeed the evidence \u2014 Weinstein's statement, the statements of two eye-witnesses, and the injuries to Weinstein \u2014 is sufficient to give Townsend reason to prosecute Lockhead. There is no evidence that Townsend treated Weinstein differently than any other complainant or witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">We accordingly agree with the district court that Lockhead has raised no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Weinstein acted under color of state law. Because Lockhead\u2019s claim against the YWCA is wholly derivative of his claim against Weinstein, he has also not raised a fact issue in his claim against the YWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b832-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
