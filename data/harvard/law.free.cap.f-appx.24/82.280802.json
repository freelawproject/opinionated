Subsequent to the filing of Owens\u2019 amended complaint, on January 17, 2001, the district court dismissed the amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), by order that states in its entirety: \u201cFor the reasons stated orally on the record, defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal of the the [sic] amended complaint is granted. The case is dismissed. The pro se clerk is to file a notice of appeal on behalf of the plaintiff.\u201d Record on App. doc. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Unfortunately, the record on appeal does not contain a copy of the hearing referred to in the January 17 order. Nevertheless, it is unnecessary to trouble the district court with a remand for supplementation of the record when the bases for dismissal are so obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Owen\u2019s claims of discrimination based on race, color and sex are non-viable under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) because her complaint does not make out a case of prima facie discrimination. This requires a showing that Owens: (1) is a member of a protected class; (2) was qualified for the position; (3) was subject to an adverse employment action; and (4) the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. <em>McLee v. Chrysler Corp., </em>109 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir.1997); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). There is no evidence to support even an arguable inference of discrimination based on race, color or sex; therefore, dismissal of these claims was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Owen\u2019s allegation of discrimination based on age was also properly dismissed: Owens did not file a charge of discrimination raising this claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) or the New York City Commission on Human Rights (\u201cNYCCHR\u201d). \u201cNo action based on a claim of age discrimination may be brought in federal court unless the claim was properly raised with the EEOC....\u201d <em>Miller v. Int\u2019l Tel. &amp; Tel. Corp., </em>755 F.2d 20, 23 (2d Cir.1985) (citations omitted); <em>see also Holtz v. Rockefeller &amp; Co., </em>258 F.3d 62, 82-83 (2d Cir. 2001). Although there are exceptions to this rule, <em>see Butts v. City of New York Dep\u2019t of Hous. Preserv. and Dev., </em>990 F.2d 1397, 1402-03 (2d Cir.1993), none apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Owens\u2019s complaint and amended complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
