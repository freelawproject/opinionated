There is no constitutional requirement \u201cthat juvenile proceedings be by ... jury trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Juvenile, </em>228 F.3d 987, 990 (9th Cir.2000) (citing <em>McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, </em>403 U.S. 528, 545, 91 S.Ct. 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d 647 (1971)). Contrary to B.D.\u2019s contention, <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 243 n. 6, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), did not overrule <em>McKeiver.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-23\">B.D.\u2019s argument that the Major Crimes Act incorporates Montana\u2019s procedural guarantee of a jury trial for juvenile defendants, Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 41-5-1502, is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pluff, </em>253 F.3d 490, 491 (9th Cir.2001), which holds that the Major Crimes Act does not \u201cadopt wholesale a state\u2019s criminal and constitutional law.\u201d Whether B.D. has a right to a jury trial is therefore \u201ca federal issue to be determined by reference to federal constitutional principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-24\">2. B.D.\u2019s conviction for abusive sexual contact is not inconsistent with his acquittal on the charge of burglary. The district court\u2019s finding of reasonable doubt as to whether B.D. \u201cknowingly ... entered or remained unlawfully\u201d in the building \u201cwith the purpose to commit the offense therein,\u201d which is the definition of burglary under Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 45-6-204, has no bearing on the charge of abusive sexual contact under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(1), which requires a determination that B.D. knowingly had sexual contact with the victim. Because the district court articulated a rational basis for the different verdicts, B.D. was not denied due process. <em>United States v. Franco, </em>136 F.3d 622, 631 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>3. The district court did not err in finding the prosecution witnesses credible and their testimony sufficiently clear. The evidence supports a finding that B.D. had specific intent to \u201cabuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b867-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
