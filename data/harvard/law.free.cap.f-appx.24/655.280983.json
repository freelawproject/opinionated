The district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> granted a limited permanent injunction which required one former Conseco employee to return 14 customer files he had at his home. Conseco appealed to this Court arguing the district court erred in concluding that the customer lists were not trade secrets, that North American could solicit at-will employees, and that no trade secrets were misappropriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-20\">The district court issued a very well reasoned opinion discussing the relevant facts and applying the well-established law in both trade secret and employment law. We conclude that a comprehensive opinion in this case would lack precedential value, accordingly, we affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s rulings without further discussion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Aq3\">. The Honorable E. Richard Webber, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
