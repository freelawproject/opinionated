Cope appeals the sentence imposed upon his pleas of guilty and nolo contendere to charges that he sent annoying and harassing electronic mail messages in interstate and foreign communication in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a)(1)(C). The parties have expressly waived oral argument, and upon examination, the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. RApp. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Cope pleaded guilty and nolo contendere to multiple charges that he harassed his former girl-friend, Sarah K. Jackson, a nationally recognized high school teacher, by sending incriminating e-mail messages in her name. Cope sent the e-mail messages to Ms. Jackson\u2019s church minister, members of her Sunday school class, the principal of the high school where she taught, the superintendent of her school system, and others. The messages, which seemed to be from Ms. Jackson and her ex-husband, indicated that she had been having sexual relationships with her students.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">Prior to sentencing, Cope objected to the proposed \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d and obstruction of justice enhancements, the lack of any reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and the district court\u2019s failure to group the counts under USSG \u00a7 3D1.2. The district court addressed Cope\u2019s objections and overruled them. Accordingly, the district court sentenced Cope to twenty-four months of imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release, fined him $1,300.00, and ordered him to pay $2,100.00 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">In his timely appeal, Cope reasserts the claims that he set forth in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">In reviewing a challenge to a sentence, this court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, duly defers to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to those facts, and reviews the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Curly, </em>167 F.3d 316, 318 (6th Cir.1999). A factual finding is clearly erroneous when a reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>United States v. Ables, </em>167 F.3d 1021, 1035 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>527 U.S. 1027, 119 S.Ct. 2378, 144 L.Ed.2d 781 (1999). A district court\u2019s factual findings for sentencing purposes need only be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>39 F.3d 119, 122 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly determined that several of Cope\u2019s victims constituted vulnerable victims. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). Cope argues that Sarah Jackson was the only victim and that the vulnerable victim enhancement applies only if the victim is a victim of the offense of conviction. Whether victims are vulnerable is a factual finding subject to review for clear error. <em>United States v. Salyer, </em>893 F.2d 113, 116-17 (6th Cir.1989). Since 1997, the Guidelines Manual has specified that a \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of USSG \u00a7 3A1.1 includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>either a victim of the \u201coffense of conviction\u201d or a victim of \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under USSG \u00a7 lBl.l(b). Section 3Al.l(b)(l) of the Guidelines Manual provides that if the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim, the calculation is increased by 2 levels. USSG \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). A \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d is a person (A) who is a victim of the offense of conviction and any conduct for which the defendant is accountable under \u00a7 IB 1.3 (Relevant Conduct); and (B) who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct. USSG \u00a7 3A1.1, comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">As part of his scheme for revenge against his ex-girlfriend, Cope impersonated Ms. Jackson\u2019s ex-husband (Kirk Jackson). Kirk Jackson was terminally ill with the HIV virus, and Cope referred to Mr. Jackson\u2019s illness in his e-mail messages. Mr. Jackson\u2019s status as HIV positive satisfies the vulnerable victim classification. <em>United States v. Moskal, </em>211 F.3d 1070, 1072-73 (8th Cir.2000). While impersonating Ms. Jackson, Cope published several messages in which he named two high school students as Ms. Jackson\u2019s current sexual partners. The juveniles\u2019 ages satisfy the vulnerable victim classification. Ms. Jackson\u2019s fourteen-year-old son also qualifies as a vulnerable victim because of his age, because of his proximity to his mother, and because he was forced to watch his mother suffer from Cope\u2019s scheme. The district court\u2019s factual findings with respect to the vulnerable victims are not clearly erroneous. <em>See Salyer, </em>893 F.2d at 116 \u2014 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The district court properly enhanced Cope\u2019s sentencing calculation for obstructing justice. While this court reviews for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying an obstruction of justice enhancement, the district court\u2019s determination that the facts constitute an obstruction of justice is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Mise, </em>240 F.3d 527, 530-31 (6th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>165 F.3d 1032, 1034-35 (6th Cir. 1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">\u201c[Tjhreatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully influencing a ... witness ..., directly or indirectly, or attempting to do so,\u201d constitutes an obstruction of justice. USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(a)). In this case, Cope left nude pictures of Ms. Jackson at her father\u2019s home in an effort to intimidate her and influence her not to provide evidence against him. Moreover, Cope was convicted in a companion case for his role in the January 22, 1999, shooting that occurred at Ms. Jackson\u2019s residence and the subsequent murder for hire scheme involving Ms. Jackson. That shooting was obviously designed to intimidate Ms. Jackson from participating in the prosecution of this case and thus justifies the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>28 F.3d 47, 48-49 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">In light of the foregoing conduct, the district court did not err in refusing to grant Cope a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Cope claims that his guilty and nolo contendere pleas should have entitled him to such a reduction. A defendant has the burden of demonstrating that he is entitled to a reduction of his base offense level for acceptance of responsibility under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. <em>United States v. Walker, </em>182 F.3d 485, 487 (6th Cir.1999). Cope has clearly failed to demonstrate that he is entitled to a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">Finally, we conclude that the district court properly applied a sentencing adjustment under USSG \u00a7 3D1.4. Cope argues that the district court should have grouped the counts of his conviction under \u00a7 3D 1.2 rather than apply a five-level multiple count adjustment under \u00a7 3D1.4. Cope ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>gues that the counts of conviction should have been grouped under USSG \u00a7 3D1.2 because his conduct involved the same act and, in essence, the same victim \u2014 Ms. Jackson. This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s refusal to group offenses under the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>154 F.3d 655, 656 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Application Note 6 to \u00a7 3D1.2 provides that counts involving offenses to which different guidelines apply are grouped together under subsection (d) if the offenses are of the same general type and otherwise meet the criteria for grouping under this subsection. Application Note 8 to the same guideline further indicates that a primary consideration when applying \u00a7 3D1.2 grouping principles is whether the offenses involved different victims. Application Note 8 reads in relevant part: \u201c[e]ases involving injury to distinct victims are sufficiently comparable, whether or not the injuries are inflicted in distinct transactions, so that each count should be treated separately rather than grouped together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In the instant case, Cope\u2019s e-mail messages harmed multiple victims. Cope was convicted of thirteen counts of sending harassing communications with the intent to annoy or harass. The thirteen messages were sent to nine different victims. The applicable guideline of each count was \u00a7 2A6.1. Section 2A6.1 offenses are specifically excluded from grouping under \u00a7 3D1.2(d). Thus, the district court properly refused to group Cope\u2019s offenses under \u00a7 3D1.2 and properly applied a sentencing adjustment under USSG \u00a7 3D1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Accordingly, we hereby affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
