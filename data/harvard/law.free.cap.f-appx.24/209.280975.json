Williams\u2019 attorney noted a timely appeal and filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he represents that there are no arguable issues of merit presented by this appeal. Nonetheless, in his brief, counsel addressed the possibility that the district court erred in declining to depart downward pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.13 of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cUSSG\u201d). The time for filing a supplemental brief has passed and Williams has not responded, despite being advised of his right to do so. The Government moves to dismiss the appeal based on a waiver provision in Williams\u2019 plea agreement. Finding the waiver valid and enforceable, we grant the motion and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">We have reviewed Williams\u2019 plea agreement and the Rule 11 colloquy and find that Williams knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal \u201cwhatever sentence imposed.\u201d <em>See United States v. Broughton-Jones, </em>71 F.3d 1143, 1146 (4th Cir.1995). We therefore find that Williams waived his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of a downward departure under USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C). This is the only issue presented by counsel through this appeal. Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have independently reviewed the entire record and all pertinent documents. We have considered all possible issues presented by this record and conclude that there are no non-frivolous grounds for this appeal. Pursuant to the plan adopted by the Fourth Circuit Judicial Council in implementation of the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A (1994), this court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If requested by the client to do so, counsel should prepare a timely petition for writ of certiorari, unless counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous. In that case, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
