Thomas appeals the judgment of the district court affirming the denial of her claims for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income benefits. After the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied her claims, Thomas requested review by the Appeals Council of the Social Security Administration (\u201cAppeals Council\u201d). Although she provided the Appeals Council with additional medical evidence from her treating physician, it denied review. Because the record is unclear on whether the Appeals Council recognized the additional evidence to be from Thomas\u2019s treating physician, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">On January 30,1997, Thomas filed applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income benefits, alleging that she had been disabled since January 9, 1997.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, Thomas claimed on her Disability Report of January 30, 1997, that her disabling illnesses were \u201cdiabetes, swelling arthritis, high blood pressure, [and] high cholesterol.\u201d Tr. 72. Thomas asserted that her illnesses prevented her from working because they caused finger1 swells, blurry vision, headaches, vomiting, and gout. Prior to being laid off in January 1997, Thomas had worked for approximately ten years as a hooker in a textile mill, a job classified by the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>as \u201cmedium work.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Previously, she had been employed as a tagger in a textile mill, a job classified as \u201clight work.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">At Thomas\u2019s request, the ALJ, in May 1998, conducted a hearing on her applications for benefits. He heard testimony from Thomas and considered \u201cthe conclusions and treatment notes of the claimant\u2019s treating and examining physicians, as well as the opinions of the State Agency Medical Consultants.\u201d Tr. 16. On June 22, 1998, the ALJ issued his detailed Notice of Decision denying Thomas\u2019s applications for benefits. Although he agreed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>medical evidence established that Thomas suffered from \u201csevere\u201d impairments, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, gout, a heel spur, and osteoarthritis, the ALJ found that Thomas did not meet or equal the criteria of any impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (2001), and he also found that she retained the functional capacity to perform light work. Tr. 18-19. As such, the ALJ determined that Thomas was not under a disability as defined by the Social Security Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">On July 7, 1998, Thomas filed with the Appeals Council a \u201cRequest for Review of Hearing Decision/Order.\u201d On December 21, 1998, while her request for review was pending, an additional physician, Dr. Josephine Lake, examined Thomas. Dr. Lake diagnosed</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Thomas as suffering from (1) gout with chronic pain of the left knee; (2) poorly-controlled diabetes; and (3) migraine headaches that occurred weekly, lasted hours, and were associated with vomiting. Dr. Lake then completed two reports, a \u201cSedentary Work Disability Statement\u201d and a \u201cLight Work Disability Statement\u201d (collectively \u201cDr. Lake\u2019s Disability Reports\u201d), concluding in the former that Thomas was unable to perform \u201csedentary work,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and in the latter that she was unable to perform light work. Tr. 224-25. On December 30, 1998, Thomas provided the Appeals Council with both of Dr. Lake\u2019s Disability Reports. By letter dated January 7,1999, Thomas\u2019s lawyer provided the Appeals Council with five additional pages of medical records on Thomas, described as \u201c[m]edieal reports and lab work from Anson Regional Medical Services\u201d (\u201cAnson Medical Records\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These records reflect medical examinations and related information concerning Thomas, conducted at Anson Regional Medical Services in Wadesboro, North Carolina, on December 3, 4, 9, and 23,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">Over a year later, on February 25, 2000, the Appeals Council denied Thomas\u2019s request for review. As a result, the ALJ\u2019s Notice of Decision of June 22, 1998, constitutes the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) on Thomas\u2019s applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.981 (2001) (explaining that denial of request for review by Appeals Council renders ALJ\u2019s decision binding). Although the Appeals Council denied Thomas\u2019s request for review, it received and filed the new evidence, i.e., Dr. Lake\u2019s Disability Reports and the Anson Medical Records, into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Thomas\u2019s administrative record. The Appeals Council explained, however, that it had \u201cconsidered the contentions raised in your representative\u2019s [appeal] letter dated August 5, 1998, as well as the additional evidence also identified on the attached Order of the Appeals Council, but concluded that neither the contentions nor the additional evidence provide[d] a basis for changing the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision.\u201d Tr. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Pursuant to the provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), Thomas then initiated this civil action in the Western District of North Carolina, seeking review of the Commissioner\u2019s denials of her applications for benefits. Her case was referred to the United States Magistrate Judge and, on February 16, 2001, he issued a detailed Memorandum and Recommendation concluding that summary judgment should be awarded to the Commissioner and that the ALJ\u2019s decision should be affirmed. <em>Thomas v. Halter, </em>Memorandum and Recommendation, No. 3:00CV104-MU (W.D.N.C. Feb. 16, 2001). After conducting its independent review of the record, the district court, on March 16, 2001, issued its Order accepting the recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, <em>Thomas v. Halter, </em>Order, 3:00CV104-MU (W.D.N.C. Mar. 16, 2001), and entered summary judgment for the Commissioner. <em>Thomas v. Commissioner, </em>Judgment in a Civil Case, 3:0OevlO4MU (W.D.N.C. Mar. 16, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Thomas filed her timely notice of appeal on April 6, 2001. In this appeal, she contends that the Appeals Council erred by failing to give appropriate weight to Dr. Lake\u2019s Disability Reports and the Anson Medical Records.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">As a general proposition, our review of the ALJ\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income benefits is limited to determining whether such a decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Craig v. Chater, </em>76 F.3d 585, 589 (4th Cir.1996). Substantial evidence has been described as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (internal citations and quotations omitted); <em>NLRB v. Peninsula Gen. Hosp. Med. Ctr., </em>36 F.3d 1262, 1269 (4th Cir.1994) (same). In order for this Court to determine whether the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we must first assess whether the Commissioner has provided adequate information to explain its decision. <em>Gordon v. Schweiker, </em>725 F.2d 231, 235 (4th Cir.1984) (\u2018We cannot determine if findings are unsupported by substantial evidence unless the Secretary explicitly indicates the weight given to all of the relevant evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">Thomas maintains on appeal that the Commissioner erred in failing to adequately consider Dr. Lake\u2019s Disability Reports and the Anson Medical Records. Because, as we explain below, we are unable to determine from the record whether the Appeals Council understood Dr. Lake to be a treating physician, we now remand for further development of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">As we have observed, Dr. Lake diagnosed Thomas with gout with chronic pain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>of the left knee; poorly-controlled diabetes; and migraine headaches that occurred weekly, lasted hours, and were associated with vomiting. Dr. Lake then concluded that Thomas could not perform even sedentary work. Because she examined Thomas in December 1998, after the ALJ issued his June 1998 decision, the ALJ was not afforded an opportunity to consider Dr. Lake\u2019s Disability Reports and the An-son Medical Records. The Appeals Council, however, considered both submissions, and it added them to Thomas\u2019s administrative record. Ultimately, however, the Appeals Council offered only the ambiguous explanation \u201cthat neither the contentions nor the additional evidence provide[d] a basis for changing the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision.\u201d Tr. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">It has long been settled that \u201cReviewing courts are restricted to the administrative record in performing their limited function of determining whether the Secretary\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Wilkins v. Secretary, DDHS, </em>953 F.2d 93, 96 (4th Cir.1991) (en banc) (quoting <em>Huckabee v. Richardson, </em>468 F.2d 1380, 1381 (4th Cir.1972)). Although the Appeals Council discounted the \u201cadditional evidence,\u201d it specifically incorporated Dr. Lake\u2019s Disability Reports and the Anson Medical Records into Thomas\u2019s administrative record. We are obliged to review the record as a whole, including the evidence added to the administrative record by the Appeals Council subsequent to the ALJ\u2019s decision, in determining whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The Magistrate Judge discounted Dr. Lake\u2019s Disability Reports, at least in part, because he understood that \u201cDr. Lake was not a treating physician.\u201d J.A. 17. Until oral argument of this appeal, the Commissioner likewise represented to this Court that Dr. Lake was not Thomas\u2019s treating physician. At argument the Commissioner\u2019s counsel candidly corrected this error, and he acknowledged to us that Dr. Lake was a treating physician. From this record, however, we are unable to discern whether the Appeals Council, like the Magistrate Judge, failed to correctly understand that Dr. Lake was Thomas\u2019s treating physician. Indeed, its statement discounting the \u201cadditional evidence\u201d gives no indication whether it understood Dr. Lake to be a treating physician. As this Court has stated, \u201c[judicial review of an administrative decision is impossible without an adequate explanation of that decision by the administrator.\u201d <em>DeLoatche v. Heckler, </em>715 F.2d 148, 150 (4th Cir.1983). <em>See also Riley v. Apfel, </em>88 F.Supp.2d 572, 579-80 (W.D.Va.2000) (\u201cWhen this court is left in the dark as to how the Appeals Council treated the new evidence a meaningful judicial review is impossible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Whether the Appeals Council properly recognized Dr. Lake to be a treating physician is significant to the Thomas disability determination primarily because \u201cthe treating physician rule generally requires a court to accord greater weight to the testimony of a treating physician.\u201d <em>Hunter v. Sullivan, </em>993 F.2d 31, 35 (4th Cir. 1992) (per curiam); <em>see also Coffman v. Bowen, </em>829 F.2d 514, 517 (4th Cir.1987) (\u201c[The treating physician] rule requires that the opinion of a claimant\u2019s treating physician be given great weight and may be disregarded only if there is persuasive contradictory evidence.\u201d); <em>Mitchell v. Schweiker, </em>699 F.2d 185, 187 (4th Cir.1983) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Because of the ambiguity in the record, and in light of the treating physician rule, we believe the district court should remand this case to the Commissioner for further development of the record. The Commissioner should then evaluate Dr. Lake\u2019s Disability Reports, as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Anson Medical Records, while giving appropriate consideration to Dr. Lake\u2019s status as a treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we vacate the judgment and remand. The district court should return this case to the Commissioner for such further proceedings as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-9\">.
