In view of the facts that (1) the defect in service was not called to petitioners\u2019 attention prior to mid-June at the earliest (and not clearly signaled until the district court\u2019s memorandum of July 6, 2000), (2) the district court was divested of jurisdiction upon petitioners\u2019 filing of a notice of appeal on June 21, 2000, and (3) upon restoration of the case to the district court, petitioners promptly requested an opportunity to remedy the defect in service, we believe the district court should, in the exercise of its discretion, have permitted petitioners the opportunity to effectuate service of process in accordance with the requirements of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1608.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-15\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgement and remand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
