Mr. Wayt contends the district court incorrectly determined a personality disorder is not a \u201cmental disease or defect,\u201d as used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Wayt also asserts the district court committed plain error when it allowed him to assume the burden of proving his incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">After reviewing the district court\u2019s ruling, we hold the district court applied the proper legal standard. The district court\u2019s decision was a factual one, supported by specific findings, and its conclusion that Mr. Wayt was competent pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241 was not clearly erroneous. Mr. Wayt\u2019s second claim of error also fails because the assignment of the burden of proof did not affect the district court\u2019s determination. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b907-17\">Glen Wayt was indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming on conspiracy, possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, and aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine charges, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, and 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(C). Mr. Wayt was evaluated by Dr. Ralph Ihle, at the government\u2019s request, after Mr. Wayt\u2019s counsel alleged a jailhouse fight resulted in a head injury that rendered Mr. Wayt unable to understand the proceedings against him or to assist counsel in his case. When Mr. Wayt asked for an evaluation by Dr. Grant Fleming, the district court granted his motion. Mr. Wayt then requested and received a competency hearing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4241 and 4247.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-18\">Both doctors testified at the competency hearing and provided copies of their reports. The doctors agreed on several points: 1) Mr. Wayt possessed the cognitive capability to understand the proceedings; 2) Mr. Wayt did not exhibit paranoia sufficient to constitute a psychotic disorder; and 3) tests indicated signs of malin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>gering. The doctors differed on whether Mr. Wayt could properly assist counsel in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Dr. Fleming testified he spoke with Mr. Wayt\u2019s girlfriend, who described Mr. Wayt as a long-term user of methamphetamine. Dr. Fleming explained Mr. Wayt exhibited characteristics of a long-term user and Mr. Wayt\u2019s long-term methamphetamine abuse resulted in paranoia. Dr. Fleming concluded Mr. Wayt\u2019s paranoia was so strong it would significantly affect his ability to assist counsel and he was not competent to provide adequate information for his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Dr. Ihle recognized that whether a personality disorder was severe enough to be a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241 is \u201cultimately the court\u2019s decision.\u201d Dr. Ihle did not find any major mental disorder that would result in significant impairment of Mr. Wayt\u2019s ability to understand the nature of the proceedings or impair his ability to properly assist counsel. Weighing this testimony, the district court found Mr. Wayt competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">After the district court resolved the competency issue, Mr. Wayt entered a conditional guilty plea to the conspiracy count as part of a plea agreement with the government. The parties stipulated to the relevant conduct, and the district court sentenced Mr. Wayt to 121 months imprisonment and five years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">Mr. Wayt contends the district court incorrectly concluded, as a matter of law, that a personality disorder derived from long-term substance abuse cannot constitute a mental disease or defect under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241. The government argues the district court\u2019s ruling was a factual analysis specifically applying the law to Mr. Wayt\u2019s situation, not a legal conclusion precluding all defendants with personality disorders from the protection of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">Competency to stand trial is an issue of constitutional significance, and a question concerning whether the district court applied the appropriate test is a question of law, subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See Lafferty v. Cook, </em>949 F.2d 1546, 1550 (10th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>504 U.S. 911, 112 S.Ct. 1942, 118 L.Ed.2d 548 (1992). However, the question of whether a defendant is competent to stand trial is a factual determination, set aside only if clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Verduzco-Martinez, </em>186 F.3d 1208, 1211 (10th Cir.1999). A finding is clearly erroneous when the reviewing court is left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">The district court\u2019s ruling had four parts: 1) Mr. Wayt was casting about for a defense and his complaints about lost memory were not credible; 2) Dr. Fleming\u2019s conclusions concerning Mr. Wayt\u2019s drug use were unreliable because the reports of his drug use are unreliable; 3) even if the reports were reliable, Dr. Fleming did not present a causal connection between drug use and Mr. Wayt\u2019s personality disorder; and 4) even if Mr. Wayt had a personality disorder with paranoid features, \u201cit ha[d] not been established by a preponderance of the evidence for purposes of the Court ruling as to the incompetence of this particular accused.\u201d In other words, Mr. Wayt\u2019s personality disorder<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not meet the statutory standards, and he was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Although the government contended a personality disorder is not a mental disease or defect, the district court\u2019s thorough competency ruling was based on factual findings. In sum, the district court concluded Mr. Wayt was competent to stand trial. The district court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous. Contrary to Mr. Wayt\u2019s contentions, the district court\u2019s ruling does not convey a generalized legal rule that personality disorders do not qualify for consideration under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241. We find more than adequate support in the record for its findings and, therefore, uphold the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">As his second issue on appeal, Mr. Wayt asserts the district court committed plain error when it allocated the burden of proof. To establish plain error, Mr. Wayt must show: 1) there was an error; 2) the error was clear or obvious under current law; and 3) the error affected substantial rights. <em>United States v. </em>Whitney, 229 F.3d 1296, 1308 (10th Cir.2000). If these three elements are met, we may exercise our \u201cdiscretion to correct the error if it \u2018seriously affectfs] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">The federal statute providing for competency hearings does not allocate the burden of proof. <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>56 F.3d 403, 410 (2d Cir.1995); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4241, 4247. We need not resolve the question here, because the district court\u2019s allocation of the burden of proof did not affect the outcome of its competency determination. The district court correctly noted the standard of proof in the competency hearing was the preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(d). \u201c[T]he allocation of the burden of proof to the defendant will affect competency determinations only in a narrow class of cases where the evidence is in equipoise; that is, where the evidence that a defendant is competent is just as strong as the evidence that he is incompetent.\u201d <em>Medina v. California, </em>505 U.S. 437, 441, 449, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 120 L.Ed.2d 353 (1992) (applying state law with \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">The evidence in this case was not in equipoise. When the district court concluded Mr. Wayt was competent, it found: 1) Dr. Fleming\u2019s conclusions were based on unreliable information and were therefore unreliable; 2) Mr. Wayt was not credible but was casting about for defenses; and 3) Dr. Fleming did not establish a causal connection between Mr. Wayt\u2019s drug use and his personality disorder. In contrast, the district court found Dr. Ihle, and the information he relied upon, extremely credible. Therefore, we find no error. However, even if we had found error, the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings were not seriously affected. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s competency determination.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b907-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel.
