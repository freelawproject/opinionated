Strunk contends that New York\u2019s method of selecting presidential electors, whereby all of the State\u2019s electoral college positions are given to individuals representing the candidate who wins the State\u2019s popular vote, violates <em>inter alia </em>the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the Privileges and Immunities Clause of U.S. Const. Art. IV, \u00a7 2; the right to a republican form of government under U.S. Const. Art. IV, \u00a7 2, cl. 5; the First Amendment; New York\u2019s Constitution; and New York statutory and common law. The defendants made oral motions, pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), to dismiss all of the plaintiffs claims, and the district court granted the motions. The district court held that states have authority to determine the method of selecting presidential electors and that Strunk offered no evidence of fraud as a predicate for judicial intervention. Strunk\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-19\">The district court was correct to reject all of Strunk\u2019s claims. Strunk\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>quest for injunctive relief is moot because the presidential electors were already seated at the December 18, 2000 meeting of the electoral college and the President and Vice President of the United States have been elected. <em>See United States v. Mercurris, </em>192 F.3d 290, 293 (2d Cir.1999). Thus, it is \u201cimpossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>In re Kurtzman, </em>194 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.1999); <em>see also Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>Fox v. Bd. of Trs. of the State Univ. of N.Y., </em>42 F.3d 135, 140 (2d Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>515 U.S. 1169, 115 S.Ct. 2634, 132 L.Ed.2d 873 (1995). Nor does the instant case fall within the limited exception wherein a controversy may be \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>Weinstein v. Bradford, </em>423 U.S. 147, 149, 96 S.Ct. 347, 46 L.Ed.2d 350 (1975). Although the same controversy may arise in connection to the 2004 elections, Strunk can file a timely petition for relief at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The district court in this instance reached the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claims, and rejected all of them. We note that the district court correctly stated the proposition of law that states are constitutionally empowered to determine how to select electors: \u201cEach State shall appoint, in such Manner <em>as the Legislature thereof may direct, </em>a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress.\u201d U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 2 (emphasis added). Thus, \u201c[t]he individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for electors for the president of the United States unless and until the state legislature chooses a statewide election as the means to implement its power to appoint members of the Electoral College.\u201d <em>Bush v. Gore, </em>531 U.S. 98, 104, 121 S.Ct. 525, 148 L.Ed.2d 388 (2000) (citing U.S. Const. Art. II \u00a7 1); <em>see also McPherson v. Blacker, </em>146 U.S. 1, 35, 13 S.Ct. 3, 36 L.Ed. 869 (1892).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
