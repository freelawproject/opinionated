The BAP and the bankruptcy court held that the record lacked evidence proving willful and malicious injury pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6) (2001), and therefore, the debt Clark owed to Huarte was discharged. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">The facts are well known to the parties and will not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">1. Nondischargeability For Willful and Malicious Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b748-14\">Although we appreciate the excellent work of the BAP, we review independently the findings of the bankruptcy court. <em>Beaupied v. Chang (In re Chang), </em>163 F.3d 1138, 1140 (9th Cir.1998). We review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-15\">The bankruptcy code excepts from discharge any debt \u201cfor willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6). The Supreme Court has interpreted \u201cwillful\u201d to modify \u201cinjury.\u201d <em>Kawaauhau v. Geiger, </em>523 U.S. 57, 61, 118 S.Ct. 974, 140 L.Ed.2d 90 (1998). In order to deny a discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(6), the debtor must have intended the consequences of his action and not just the action itself. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-16\">Subsequently, we have held that \u201cthe willful injury requirement of \u00a7 523(a)(6) is met when it is shown either that the debt- or had a subjective motive to inflict the injury or that the debtor believed that injury was substantially certain to occur as a result of his conduct.\u201d <em>Petralia v. Jercich (In re Jercich), </em>238 F.3d 1202, 1208 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 2552, 150 L.Ed.2d 718 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-19\">In order for Huarte\u2019s debt to be excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(6), she must show that, at the time of the injury, Clark intended the injury or was substantially certain injury would occur. Huarte contends the settlement agreement satisfies her burden. The settlement agreement, however, does not establish Clark\u2019s intent when the actions were taken; rather, it was a concession, several years later, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>that Huarte, at the time of this unfortunate episode, was incapable of consent. In fact, nothing in the record indicates that, at the time, Clark intended to harm or was substantially certain that harm would befall Huarte. The only evidence in the record is Clark\u2019s own testimony that he did not intend to hurt Huarte and he believed at the time that the encounter was consensual. Because Huarte failed to show that any injury suffered was willful on Clark\u2019s part, her debt is discharged in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b748-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
