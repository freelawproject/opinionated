After a two-day trial, a jury found for the Department on Hanson\u2019s harassment and retaliation claims, and the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found for the Department on the due process claim. Hanson appeals with respect to his harassment and due process claims. After careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Based on the evidence at trial, the jury could have concluded that the conduct described by Hanson did not rise to the level of sexual harassment. <em>See Moring v. Arkansas Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>243 F.3d 452, 456 (8th Cir.2001). Further, the district court properly held that Hanson did not have a protected property interest. <em>See Batra v. Board of Regents, 79 </em>F.3d 717, 720 (8th Cir.1996); <em>Rochester Methodist Hosp. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>728 F.2d 1006, 1010 (8th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-9\">. The HONORABLE HARRY F.
