Parker first asserts that he was denied the right to represent himself despite repeated requests to do so. We conclude that the district court acted properly in referring Parker for a competence examination, based on both the motion of Parker\u2019s counsel and the district court\u2019s own observations. Competence in the context of waiver of counsel is coextensive with competence to stand trial. <em>Godinez v. Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 399, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993). Once Parker was found to be competent, he made no clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>and unequivocal assertion of his right to represent himself. <em>See United States v. Frazier -l, </em>204 F.3d 553, 558 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 994, 121 S.Ct. 487, 148 L.Ed.2d 459 (2000). Therefore, we find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to continue the proceeding with Parker represented by appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">We also reject Parker\u2019s challenge to the jury instruction regarding the proof necessary to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 876. In <em>United States v. Maxton, </em>940 F.2d 103, 106 (4th Cir.1991), we held that a defendant must have a general intent to threaten at the time of mailing. A general intent to threaten requires that the government \u201cestablish that the defendant intended to transmit the interstate communication and that the communication contained a true threat.\u201d <em>United States v. Darby, </em>37 F.3d 1059, 1066 (4th Cir.1994). The jury charge complied with our holdings in <em>Maxton </em>and <em>Darby, </em>and we decline Parker\u2019s invitation to reconsider that decision to require proof of a specific intent to threaten.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Finally, Parker asserts that he was denied his rights under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3161 (West 2000) (the Act). Even if we were to concede Parker\u2019s argument concerning transportation time under \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(H), the trial was within the allotted period under other exclusions provided for in the Act. Therefore, Parker is entitled to no relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">We affirm Parker\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
