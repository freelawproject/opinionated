Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 437, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991). Gutierrez-Llamas\u2019s consent to answer the Border Patrol agent\u2019s questions and to have the trunk of his car opened was voluntary and uncoerced. The agent was alone when he approached the defendant, the agent\u2019s gun was not drawn, and the entire encounter took place on a public highway. These circumstances, evaluated by the \u201ctypical reasonable person\u201d standard, <em>United States v. Cannon, </em>29 F.3d 472, 477 (9th Cir.1994), do not suggest coercion. <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>37 F.3d 510, 515 (9th Cir.1994). The district court\u2019s determination that the defendant\u2019s consent was voluntary and that, consequently, no violation of the Fourth Amendment has occurred is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b814-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
