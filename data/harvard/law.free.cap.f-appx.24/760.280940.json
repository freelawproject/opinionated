R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b786-27\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-28\">Plaintiff Carolyn Jane Priest filed this action against Defendant Ribelin Lowell &amp; Co., alleging that the company failed to compensate her for overtime as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-219, and the Alaska Wage and Hour Act, Alaska Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 23.10.050-150. The district court granted summary judgment to Defendant on the ground that Plaintiff was an exempt administrative employee. On de novo review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">A. <em>Salary Basis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Plaintiffs first argument is that she was not paid on a salaried basis, which is a condition for the applicable exemption under both federal and state law. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.2(e)(1); Alaska Admin. Code tit. 8, \u00a7\u00a7 15.908, 15.910(a)(1). The company paid her a predetermined amount biweekly, which was never reduced for an absence of less than one day. However, when paying additional compensation for unused personal leave time at the end of each year, Defendant had a policy of taking into account absences of less than one day. Plaintiff asserts that this policy violated the salary-basis test.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">This court squarely rejected Plaintiffs position in <em>Webster v. Public School Employees of Washington, Inc., </em>247 F.3d 910 (9th Cir.2001). Plaintiff relies on our earlier decision in <em>Abshire v. County of Kern, </em>908 F.2d 483 (9th Cir.1990), but in that case we refused to answer the question posed here, <em>id. </em>at 487 n. 3; <em>Webster </em>later did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">B. <em>Administrative Employee</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">1. <em>Federal Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">Because Plaintiffs $54,000 annual salary considerably exceeded $250 per week, the two-part \u201cshort test\u201d applies. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.2(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">The first half of that test is met here. Plaintiffs day-to-day responsibilities as the Computer Systems Manager required her to maintain Defendant\u2019s automated information system accurately and efficiently; serve as a liaison with the user group and system vendor; train staff members on using the system; troubleshoot; perform accuracy audits; maintain historical logs and system backup files; access the system\u2019s tracking and reporting capabilities; keep current on improvements in agency management systems; recommend appropriate updates to hardware, software, technical, and floor-plan configurations to ensure efficiency; determine the most cost-effective methods of accomplishing those updates; and carry out additional related administrative tasks such as developing a proposal for buying a new computer system and interviewing outside consultants in preparation for making a recommendation to Defendant\u2019s upper management. This partial list of her duties illustrates that Plaintiffs job related directly to the management policies and general business operations of Defendant\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-13\">The second half of the \u201cshort test\u201d is met because Plaintiffs work required the exercise of discretion and independent judgment. As she acknowledged in her deposition, she exercised discretion and independent judgment \u201cevery day\u201d in carrying out the kinds of tasks described above. The record gives many examples so illustrating. To name only three:</p>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">\u2022 Plaintiff designed and implemented a Year 2000 compliance program with only minimal oversight by upper management.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-15\">\u2022 She had the authority to make significant financial decisions about the maintenance of the computer system.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-16\">\u2022 She undertook, on her own initiative, a series of benchmark tests designed to identify ways to increase productivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-17\">2. <em>State Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-18\">Plaintiff also met the requirements of Alaska Administrative Code title 8, \u00a7 15.910(a)(1). The state requirements that parallel the federal ones are met for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the reasons discussed above. The additional state requirements also are met because:</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">\u2022 Plaintiff performed work under only-general supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">\u2022 She regularly and directly assisted Defendant\u2019s exempt executive employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">\u2022 She worked in a specialized or technical area that required special training, experience, or knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b786-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
