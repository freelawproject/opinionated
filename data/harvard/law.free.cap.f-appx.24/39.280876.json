The court also denied Howard\u2019s motion for a hearing on justification and excluded evidence, including testimony, in support of that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-21\">This Court reviews de novo the legal conclusions underlying a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Bold, </em>19 F.3d 99, 102 (2d Cir.1994). We find that under <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>Howard was not seized when he fled from the officers approaching him. <em>Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 626, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991). As the evidence that Howard tossed during the chase was not the product of a search and seizure, no demonstration of reasonable suspicion was necessary to defeat defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>Id. </em>Howard\u2019s reliance on <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>requiring more than an informant\u2019s allegation of weapon possession to provide the reasonable suspicion necessary for a search and seizure, is thus misplaced. <em>See </em>529 U.S. 266, 272-73, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-22\">We further find that the district court did not err by denying Howard\u2019s motion for a hearing on the justification defense. This Court approves the use of a pre-trial evaluation of defenses as a matter of judicial economy. <em>See United States v. Paul, </em>110 F.3d 869, 871 (2d Cir.1997); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>United States v. Villegas, </em>899 F.2d 1324, 1343 (2d Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Alicea, </em>837 F.2d 103, 107 (2d Cir.1988). While it has approved the use of pre-trial hearings in the course of such evaluations, <em>see United States v. Bakhtiari, </em>913 F.2d 1053, 1057 (2d Cir.1990), it does not require separate hearings when the pertinent evidence is otherwise before the court. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b) (allowing pre-trial consideration of motions and noting, in the 1944 committee notes following, that the evaluation may be made \u201cin such a manner as the court deems appropriate\u201d). We find, in this case, that the district court made an informed evaluation of Howard\u2019s proposed justification defense after reviewing the evidence at the suppression hearings. The court did not err by refusing to hold a hearing on justification alone. We further find that the court properly excluded only evidence pertaining to justification. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401, 402. In addition, the defendant was <em>not </em>entitled to present evidence concerning his belief that his actions were justified. Defendant\u2019s knowledge of the unlawful nature of his acts is not an element of a \u00a7 922(g) offense. <em>See United States v. Allah, </em>130 F.3d 33, 39 (2d Cir. 1997) (\u201cIn order to prove that a defendant \u2018knowingly\u2019 engaged in prohibited conduct, the government need only show that he knew he was engaging in that conduct, not that he knew his conduct was unlawful.\u201d); <em>United States v. Sherbondy, </em>865 F.2d 996, 1001-03 (9th Cir.1988) (reading the \u201cknowingly\u201d mens rea standard of \u00a7 924(a) into \u00a7 924(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Finally, we find that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and its supporting provision \u00a7 924(e) are constitutional. <em>See United States v. Santiago, </em>238 F.3d 213, 216 (2d Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Feliciano, </em>223 F.3d 102, 117-19 (2d Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>85 F.3d 1023, 1031 (2d Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Sorrentino, </em>72 F.3d 294, 296 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
