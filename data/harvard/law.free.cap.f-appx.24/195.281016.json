We vacate the judgment of the district court because we lack subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-28\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b221-29\">John and Bill Emery co-owned and operated Focus Golf Systems, Inc. (Focus Golf), a golf equipment distributor. Both brothers were employed by Focus Golf; John Emery was the Chief Executive Officer, Bill Emery performed a variety of other functions. In 1999, Bill Emery, the majority shareholder of Focus Golf, caused the corporation to terminate the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ment of John Emery. John Emery sued, claiming that Focus Golf owed him salary, a salary bonus, and rent on property he owned. Focus Golf and Bill Emery counterclaimed, asserting that John Emery had misappropriated corporate funds. The case was tried to a magistrate judge. All of the claims that were actually tried to the magistrate judge were state law claims. The complaint also contained a claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 <em>et seq., </em>JA at 15, but this claim was effectively abandoned. In fact, it appears, from the lack of mention in the record, that the RICO claim was not pursued beyond the pleading stage. The magistrate judge found that Focus Golf owed John Emery salary, salary bonus and rent, but disagreed with John Emery as to the amount of salary owed. The magistrate judge also agreed with Focus Golf as to the amount of funds contained in John\u2019s \u201cadvance account,\u201d which operated as a set-off on John\u2019s claims. Both parties have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">We may not reach the merits of the appeal because we lack subject matter jurisdiction. The parties assert that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship. It is readily apparent to us that we do not. Focus Golf, a plaintiff below, is incorporated in Michigan. John Emery, the defendant below, is a resident of Michigan. Because, under <em>28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c)(1), a corporation is deemed to be a citizen of its State of incorporation as well as of the State of its principal place of business, this case lacks \u201ccomplete diversity.\u201d <em>Strawbridge v. Curtiss, </em>3 Cranch 267, 7 U.S. 267, 267-68, 2 L.Ed. 435 (1806).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">\n<em>VACATED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-6\"> The parties secondarily assert that the Court has jurisdiction because the RICO claim presented a federal question, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and the other state law claims were appended based on supplemental jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. But federal question jurisdiction was not invoked below, and the RICO claim was not pursued. <em>See United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 728, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). Accordingly, we reject \u00a7 1367 as a basis for jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
