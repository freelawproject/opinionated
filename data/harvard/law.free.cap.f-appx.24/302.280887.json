This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-24\">Chambers filed his motion in the district court seeking review of a Michigan Supreme Court decision denying him a writ of mandamus. Chambers alleged that an Assistant United States Attorney committed prosecutorial misconduct during 1992 resentencing proceedings involving plaintiff, and that the Michigan Attorney Griev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>anee Commission refused to discipline the prosecutor. The district court dismissed the motion sua sponte for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal. On appeal, plaintiff essentially reiterates his claim that a federal prosecutor committed misconduct during his resentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Upon de novo review, <em>see Duncan v. Rolm Mil-Spec Computers, </em>917 F.2d 261, 263 (6th Cir.1990); <em>Moir v. Greater Cleveland Reg\u2019l Transit Auth., </em>895 F.2d 266, 269 (6th Cir.1990), we affirm the judgment for the reasons stated by the district court in its opinion and order denying plaintiffs motion filed September 26, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
