MAGILL, Senior Circuit Judge, of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b175-17\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b175-18\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b175-19\">David Solomon was indicted for, and convicted of, possession of firearms by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), (g)(9) and 924(a)(2). He now appeals, raising challenges to several of the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and to the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-21\">Prior to trial, Solomon moved to suppress post-arrest statements and the firearms seized from his house that triggered the instant prosecution. During the pretrial suppression hearing, the government called as a witness Solomon\u2019s wife, who both appeared and testified. Solomon\u2019s trial was thereafter set for November 6, 2000, and Mrs. Solomon was subpoenaed to testify again. She came to court on November 6, but did not testify because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>only the jury selection took place on that date. The court directed the jury to return on November 14 for the first day of trial, and the government advised Mrs. Solomon to do the same. However, Mrs. Solomon failed to appear on November 14. On motion by the government, the district court allowed the prosecution to introduce into evidence Mrs. Solomon\u2019s testimony from the suppression hearing. The district court also admitted into evidence an ATF Form 4473, which recorded a firearm purchase by Solomon.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The defendant first challenges the admissibility at trial of his wife\u2019s testimony from the suppression hearing, contending, first, that his wife was not \u201cunavailable\u201d within the meaning of Fed.R.Evid. 804(a)(5), and, second, that, even if she was \u201cunavailable\u201d as a trial witness, defense counsel did not have a \u201csimilar motive to develop\u201d her testimony at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Under Fed.R.Evid. 804(a)(5), a witness is \u201cunavailable\u201d if \u201cabsent from the hearing and the proponent of a statement has been unable to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance ... by process or other reasonable means.\u201d To establish \u201cunavailability,\u201d it must be shown that reasonable, good-faith efforts to locate the witness were made. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>705 F.2d 709, 711-12 (4th Cir.1983). If a declarant is \u201cunavailable\u201d at trial, his testimony \u201cat another hearing of the same or a different proceeding\u201d is admissible \u201cif the party against whom the testimony is now offered ... had an opportunity and <em>similar motive </em>to develop the testimony by direct, cross or redirect examinations.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Mrs. Solomon was \u201cabsent\u201d from the hearing on the morning of November 14, when she was scheduled to testify, and neither the defense nor the government knew of her whereabouts. As to the government\u2019s efforts to procure her attendance on that day, the district court found that the government \u201csummoned [her] to appear at the commencement of trial and ... required [her] by the subpoena to attend each day of trial until excused.\u201d J.A. 301. It is undisputed that Mrs. Solomon was not \u201cexcused\u201d by the court on November 6, and thus had a continuing obligation pursuant to the subpoena to appear at trial. Moreover, the government represented to the district court and to us that, on November 6, \u201cit advised Mrs. Solomon to return on November 14, 2000, the day the actual trial was to commence,\u201d J.A. 301 (opinion of the district court); indeed, upon this representation, the district court issued a warrant, pursuant to which Mrs. Solomon was arrested later that day. And the defendant concedes that Mrs. Solomon was aware that the trial was to begin on November 14. Br. of Appellant at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">The government had no reason to take further precautions to ensure Mrs. Solomon\u2019s presence at trial. Its efforts to ensure Mrs. Solomon\u2019s attendance on November 14 were reasonable in light of Mrs. Solomon\u2019s initial compliance with the subpoena, through her attendance at both the jury\u2019s selection and the pre-trial suppression hearing; her willing participation in the pre-trial proceedings at its request; and its advice to her to return on November 14. <em>See Thomas, </em>705 F.2d at 712 (concluding that the government\u2019s attempts to locate witnesses by the service of process were reasonable); <em>cf. United States v. Puckett, </em>692 F.2d 663, 670 (10th Cir.1982) (concluding that inability to procure witnesses was due to the \u201cattorney\u2019s tardiness in failing to attempt to subpoena [them] until near the end of the second week of trial\u201d). The district court did not err in concluding that the government had made reasonable efforts to secure her at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>tendance such as to satisfy the threshold requirement of \u201cunavailability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Solomon next argues that there was not, at the suppression hearing, a motive similar to that at trial, to develop Mrs. Solomon\u2019s testimony, because the only purpose of the suppression hearing was to establish the consensual nature of the search of Solomon\u2019s home and of the seizure of firearms by authorities. By contrast, Solomon notes, at the trial, the government introduced Mrs. Solomon\u2019s testimony to establish the fact that he possessed seized firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">However, defense counsel did have a \u201csimilar motive\u201d at the suppression hearing to develop Mrs. Solomon\u2019s testimony on the issue of firearms possession. Even prior to the trial itself, Solomon\u2019s counsel knew that Solomon\u2019s possession of firearms would be of central importance at Solomon\u2019s trial on charges of illegal possession of firearms. At the suppression hearing, the government elicited Mrs. Solomon\u2019s testimony establishing the defendant\u2019s ownership and possession of these firearms. J.A. 14, 17 (identifying their home as the location of the firearms; identifying locations where he kept his firearms; and confirming that defendant possessed firearms on the date in question). Upon the elicitation of this testimony by the prosecution, Solomon\u2019s counsel had ample motive to cross-examine Mrs. Solomon on the possession issue, if for no other reason than for protection in the event of her unavailability at trial. Absent cross-examination at the suppression hearing, Mrs. Solomon\u2019s testimony as to her husband\u2019s possession of the firearms might go unchallenged at trial, establishing the chief element of the charged offense. <em>See </em>30B Michael Graham, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 7073 (\u201c[A] decision not to cross-examine ... at a preliminary hearing ... assumes the risk that the witness will not be available at trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Salerno, </em>505 U.S. 317, 112 S.Ct. 2503, 120 L.Ed.2d 255 (1992), is misplaced, because that ease explicitly- left open for the lower court the question of whether the United States in fact had a \u201csimilar motive\u201d to develop through cross-examination before the grand jury, the testimony that it sought to introduce at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 325, 112 S.Ct. 2503.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting at trial, under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1), Mrs. Solomon\u2019s suppression hearing testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">Solomon also challenges the admission, under Federal Rule of Evidence 807, of ATF Form 4473, which recorded his purchase of one of the firearms seized from his house. The ATF Form is required to be maintained by all firearms dealers at their place of business. The particular Form 4473 that was introduced at Solomon\u2019s trial was provided to the prosecution by Mr. Kearney, the current record custodian at the K-Mart in Florida where the firearm was purchased. The Form contains information such as Solomon\u2019s name, address, sex, age, height, weight, race and driver\u2019s license number. It is signed and dated by Solomon. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Form also contains the type, model, caliber of gauge, serial number, and manufacturer of the firearm. Finally, the title, transaction serial number, and date of the transaction appear on the Form. J.A. 283-84; 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">We agree with the district court that this Form satisfies the requirements for admission under Rule 807.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is evidence of a \u201cmaterial fact\u201d \u2014 purchase of a firearm, the seizure of which triggered the instant prosecution. It is \u201cmore probative\u201d than other evidence that \u201ccan be procured through reasonable means\u201d because \u201cit was not reasonable to require the government to bring in the record custodians from different parts of the country to prove th[e fact of the purchase].\u201d <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>773 F.2d 1455, 1459 (4th Cir.1985) (admitting a Firearms Trace form under Fed.R.Evid. 803(24), which is now Rule 807). Finally, \u201cthe general purposes of [the Federal Rules of Evidence] and the interests of justice [are] best served\u201d by the admission of this form, as it possesses a \u201chigh degree of reliability.\u201d K Mart was required by law to complete this form when it sold the firearm to Solomon, J.A. 309 (opinion of the district court), and, as we have previously observed, there is \u201csimply no reason for the [sellers] of these weapons to falsify the entries on the routine ATF forms,\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>773 F.2d at 1459.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Solomon\u2019s contention that Mr. Kearney fabricated the document upon receipt of BATF\u2019s requesting letter is far-fetched. The form includes information that does not appear in the BATF letter, such as the transaction serial number; it is signed by Mr. Solomon and the salesman; and it spells the name of Mr. Solomon\u2019s street differently than does the BATF letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The district court did not err in admitting the ATF Form 4473 into evidence. IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Lastly, Solomon argues that, absent Mrs. Solomon\u2019s statements and the ATF Form, there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction for the unlawful possession of firearms. However, not only were Mrs. Solomon\u2019s statements and the ATF Form 4473 properly admitted, as we have held, but other evidence, as well, established Solomon\u2019s possession of the firearms in question. A police officer testified that he knew that Solomon possessed the firearms and that in fact he removed the firearms from Solomon\u2019s house, J.A. 69-71, and, Solomon himself made two statements to the police officers confirming that in fact he had been in possession of the firearms seized. J.A. 73, 186. Thus, sufficient evidence supported Solomon\u2019s conviction, even absent the evidence that we hold today was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">For the reasons that appear, the judgment of conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">. Alternatively, the testimony is admissible under the residual hearsay exception, because it \"ha[d] equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trust-worthiness.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(5). The defendant\u2019s own counsel questioned Mrs. Solomon, and a contemporaneous transcript was prepared of her statement, which was made voluntarily under oath. There is also no evidence that Mrs. Solomon had any incentive to lie; and, had she lied, she could have been prosecuted for perjury. See <em>United States v. Clarke, </em>2 F.3d 81, 84-85 (4th Cir. 1993) (listing these criteria as evidence of circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b178-6\">.
