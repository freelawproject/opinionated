Restaurant Corporation, to collect from them a debt of several million dollars on loans made to Golden Corral franchisees. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court entered judgment in favor of Golden Corral and S.S. Restaurant. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b217-19\">.GE Capital is the successor in interest on ten loans made by Metropolitan Life Capital Corp. (\u201cMetLife\u201d) to Corral Northeast (\u201cCNE\u201d) and Corral Midwest (\u201cCMW\u201d). CNE and CMW are subsidiaries of Corral America, Inc., which in turn is a subsidiary of Golden Corral. They are also Golden Corral franchisees, owning numerous family-style restaurants franchised by Golden Corral.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-20\">Because of financial difficulties in operating its family-style restaurants, Golden Corral decided in the 1980s to franchise its underperforming restaurants rather than sell them outright. In 1998, it approached MetLife about funding its franchising program, assuring MetLife that Golden Corral would \u201cattempt to assist [its] franchi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>sees with meeting their financial needs\u201d by providing franchisees with lists of lenders to contact. Golden Corral stated that it was \u201cwilling to commit [its] resources (without recourse to Golden Corral)\u201d to help the franchisees and that it would provide limited guarantees for some loans, based on the amount of the loan and other specified guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In reviewing Golden Corral\u2019s proposal, MetLife generated internal review documents which stated that MetLife would consider making loans to Golden Corral franchisees that had two years of restaurant experience \u201cin the event that Golden Corral will provide limited recourse for the obligation.\u201d These internal documents observed that \u201cGolden Corral has indicated that they may be willing to provide a 10% guaranty of the principal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Despite these observations in its internal documentation, MetLife wrote to Golden Corral on July 20, 1994, that it would provide franchisee financing under Met-Life\u2019s Franchising Financing Program in an amount up to $10 million, referring in its letter only to \u201cpossible support by Golden Corral.\u201d Thereafter, MetLife negotiated a Master Loan Agreement, as well as specific loan documents, with CNE and CMW. Golden Corral did not provide any guarantees, nor was it signatory to any of the loan documents; indeed, the documents did not even reference Golden Corral. The Master Loan Agreement included a cross-default provision that permitted MetLife, in the event of a default by CNE or CMW, \u201cto enter any premises where any Collateral is situated and take possession thereof without notice or demand and without legal proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In 1997, as Golden Corral expanded its franchise program, it requested an additional $5 million of funding from MetLife for Golden Corral franchisees. In its request, Golden Corral stated that it would not \u201cguarantee any of the franchisee obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Beginning in 1996, Golden Corral\u2019s franchisees began to suffer financially, and Golden Corral decided to restructure the franchising program to bail out some of the franchisees through a \u201c1996 Restructuring.\u201d Under the restructuring arrangement, Golden Corral\u2019s sister corporation, S.S. Restaurant, signed an Asset Purchase and Assumption Agreement with CNE under which S.S. Restaurant purchased five underperforming restaurants (the \u201cWhitehall Restaurants\u201d) from CNE. It paid for the five restaurants by assuming \u201call liabilities and obligations of [CNE] relating to the operation of [the five] Restaurants.\u201d The loans made to the Whitehall Restaurants never went into default.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Several other loans made by MetLife to CNE and CMW, however, went into default. GE Capital, as successor in interest to MetLife, commenced this action in January 2000 against Golden Corral and S.S. Restaurant to collect on the loans that MetLife had made to Golden Corral\u2019s franchisees and that were in default. It sued not only for breach of contract, but also on an agency theory, asserting that the defaulting franchisees were Golden Corral\u2019s agents. It also alleged claims against Golden Corral and S.S. Restaurant for negligence and mismanagement and against Golden Corral for negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">The district court rejected all of GE Capital\u2019s claims and entered judgment in favor of Golden Corral and S.S. Restaurant. From the judgment entered, GE Capital filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">GE Capital contends first that Golden Corral, as a principal, is vicariously liable for the acts and omissions of both its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>franchisees and S.S. Restaurant, as agents. This claim relies on both actual and apparent agency. The district court dismissed this claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. We affirm this ruling. GE Capital\u2019s complaint does not allege any facts that would demonstrate that, when CNE and CMW executed the notes with Met-Life, they were acting on behalf of Golden Corral. Nor does its complaint allege that Golden Corral authorized these franchisees to enter into loan agreements that would bind Golden Corral.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">GE Capital next contends that Golden Corral and S.S. Restaurant are contractually liable to repay the franchisees\u2019 defaulted loans, either by reason of the 1996 Restructuring or by reason of oral statements made by Golden Corral\u2019s executives in 1994. Again, this claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">As an initial matter, it is undisputed that Golden Corral did not sign the Master Loan Agreement between MetLife and CNE and CMW, and there is no evidence that Golden Corral expressly assumed the loan obligations of these franchisees. Although MetLife\u2019s internal documentation referring to Golden Corral\u2019s original funding proposal stated that Golden Corral \u201cmay be willing to provide a 10% guaranty\u201d for some of the loans and MetLife\u2019s financing approval letter said that there would be \u201cpossible support by Golden Corral\u201d for the loans, there is simply no evidence that Golden Corral ultimately agreed to assume the loan obligations. In fact, the evidence is to the contrary. Golden Corral explicitly stated that it would financially assist its franchisees <em>only </em>in finding lenders, and it wrote MetLife that it \u201cdoes not guarantee any of the franchisee obligations.\u201d Furthermore, in a 1999 demand letter that GE Capital sent to Golden Corral with respect to the defaulted loans, GE Capital requested specifically that Golden Corral at that time undertake to guarantee the loans, a recognition that GE Capital knew that Golden Corral had not previously done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">GE Capital also attempts to rely on oral statements by Golden Corral\u2019s officers in 1994. When MetLife\u2019s vice president Steere was asked whether \u201canybody with Golden Corral ever promised [him] that MetLife would get paid on loans that it made to Corral Northeast or Corral Northwest,\u201d he answered, \u201c[n]ot in those words.\u201d But Steere testified that \u201cit was implied that these companies [CNE and CMW] had every bit of support from Golden Corral\u201d and that he was told by someone at Golden Corral that no lender had ever lost money financing Golden Corral\u2019s franchisees. These vague statements suggesting that MetLife\u2019s risk would be low, however, are not sufficient to form binding contracts by Golden Corral to repay millions of dollars in debt that it never undertook to repay.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Moreover, such oral statements are unenforceable under North Carolina\u2019s statute of frauds. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 22.1 (requiring that a \u201cpromise to answer the debt, default, or miscarriage of another person\u201d be in writing). GE Capital contends that an exception to the statute of frauds applies under the \u201cmain purpose\u201d or \u201cleading object\u201d rule where \u201cthe promisor has the requisite personal, immediate, and pecuniary interest in which a third party is the primary obligor.\u201d <em>Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Foil, </em>284 N.C. 740, 748, 202 S.E.2d 591 (N.C.1974). In those circumstances, \u201cthe promise is said to be original rather than collateral and therefore need not be in writing to be binding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>GE Capital argues that the doctrine is applicable to this case because Golden Corral stood to earn royalties from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>CNE and CMW when their loans were approved. GE Capital, however, presented no evidence that shows that Golden Corral had such a royalty agreement with the franchisees. Additionally, any such royalties would be based on future profits and therefore Golden Corral could not have an \u201cimmediate\u201d interest in such royalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">GE Capital also contends that Golden Corral and S.S. Restaurant assumed the loans during the 1996 Restructuring. This contention, however, is belied by the language of the applicable documents involved in the 1996 Restructuring. In those documents, S.S. Restaurant assumed only the loans associated with the five Whitehall Restaurants, and those loans were not in default and therefore were not the subject of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">On its claim for negligence, GE Capital contends that Golden Corral failed to supervise and manage its franchisees adequately, resulting in harm to GE Capital when the franchisees defaulted. But GE Capital has not been able to identify any legal duty that Golden Corral owed GE Capital to supervise and manage the Golden Corral franchisees. The district court correctly granted summary judgment for Golden Corral on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Finally, GE Capital contends that Golden Corral is liable to GE Capital for negligent misrepresentations made to Met-Life. GE Capital asserts that Golden Corral represented to MetLife that Golden Corral would support and monitor its franchisees and that no lender had ever lost money lending money to Golden Corral\u2019s franchisees. The first alleged misrepresentation, however, was not a representation of fact but at most a promise to act in the future. In any event, there was no evidence to support the statement. Golden Corral only stated to MetLife that it would pre-approve the franchisees for participation in the franchise program. On the second alleged misrepresentation, GE Capital did not demonstrate the statement to be false. Accordingly, the district court correctly granted summary judgment on GE Capital\u2019s misrepresentation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">S.S. Restaurant filed a cross-claim for a declaratory judgment that it was not hable under the cross-default provision of the Master Loan Agreement, and the district court granted S.S. Restaurant a summary declaratory judgment. GE Capital also challenges that ruling on appeal. Again, we affirm the district court. Under the Master Loan Agreement between Met-Life and CNE, a default on any \u201cnote\u201d of the \u201cdebtor\u201d creates default on all other \u201cnotes\u201d of the \u201cdebtor\u201d and permits Met-Life (or GE Capital) to seize the assets of the debtor. The agreement, however, defines \u201cdebtor\u201d as CNE. Therefore, the cross-default provision applies only to defaults of CNE\u2019s loans. Since S.S. Restaurant did not default on any of the CNE loans and was current on the loans that it assumed, the cross-default provision does not apply to S.S. Restaurant. On the loans that it did not assume, S.S. Restaurant was not the \u201cdebtor,\u201d as defined under the Master Loan Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
