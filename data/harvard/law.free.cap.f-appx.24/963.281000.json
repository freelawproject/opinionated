R.App. P. 34(a)(2). The ease is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-26\">Plaintiff Cheryl Louise M\u00e1rchese filed this action against the Mt. San Rafael Hospital alleging the following claims: (1) violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213; (2) violation of her civil rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; (3) \u201cverbal harassment,\u201d Rec. doc. 5, at 2 (Complaint, filed May 11, 2000); (4) negligence; (5) sexual harassment; (6) defamation; (7) slander; and (8) \u201crespondeat superior.\u201d Rec. doc. 17, at 3 (Amended Complaint, filed Oct. 30, 2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number><em>See generally </em>Rec. docs. 4, 5, 7, and 17 (Plaintiffs Complaints and Amended Complaints, filed May 12, 2000, June 12, 2000, and Oct. 30, 2000). All of Ms. Marchese\u2019s claims involve allegations that hospital employees harassed her during preoperative procedures in March 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">According to Ms. M\u00e1rchese, the employees\u2019 harassment led her to cancel a scheduled operation. Ms. M\u00e1rchese further maintains that hospital personnel acted negligently. In her various complaints, Ms. M\u00e1rchese alleges that the federal court\u2019s jurisdiction was based not only on the ADA and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 but also on diversity of citizenship. <em>See, e.g., </em>Rec. doc. 5, at 1 (Complaint, filed May 11, 2000) (stating that \u201cjurisdiction is also founded in the diversity of citizenship of the parties and the amount of [sic] controversy in so far as the action is based upon the tortious and negligent conduct of the defendant,\u201d alleging that the plaintiff is a citizen of Pennsylvania, and that the defendant hospital is located in Colorado). In her May 11, 2000, complaint, Ms. M\u00e1rchese demands judgment in the amount of $2.5 million. <em>See id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">The district court dismissed Ms. Marchese\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims with prejudice. The court reasoned that Ms. M\u00e1rchese had failed to allege the necessary state action. It also noted that \u00a7 1983 affords no remedy based on respondeat superior or negligence. Finally, the court dismissed Ms. Marchese\u2019s state law claims. The court stated that, having dismissed each of Ms. Marchese\u2019s federal law claims, it now lacked any basis upon which to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over those state law claims (pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Ms. Marchese\u2019s federal claims. Section 1983 establishes a cause of action only against those individuals acting \u201cunder color of [law].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Although private parties may be held liable in certain circumstances, \u201ca plaintiff must show ... that the [party\u2019s] conduct is \u2018fairly attributable to the State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pino v. Higgs, </em>75 F.3d 1461, 1465 (10th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., Inc., </em>457 U.S. 922, 937, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982)). Ms. Marchese\u2019s complaints and amended complaint do not allege that the hospital\u2019s conduct was fairly attributable to the state. As to her ADA claim, we agree with the defendant hospital that Ms. M\u00e1rchese has failed to specifically allege that the hospital discriminated against her on the basis of a disability protected by the ADA. <em>See </em>Aple\u2019s Br. at 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">However, we must further conclude that, based on the allegations of Ms. Marchese\u2019s complaints and amended complaint, the district court erred in dismissing her state law claims pursuant to Fed. R. 12(b)(6). As noted above, Ms. M\u00e1rchese alleged both diversity of citizenship and damages exceeding the $75,000 jurisdictional amount set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1). \u201cThe general federal rule has long been to decide what the amount in controversy is from the complaint itself, unless it appears or is in some way shown that the amount stated in the complaint is not claimed \u2018in good faith.\u2019\u201d <em>Horton v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>367 U.S. 348, 353, 81 S.Ct. 1570, 6 L.Ed.2d 890 (1961) (quoting <em>St. Paul Mercury Indem. Co. v. Red Cab Co., </em>303 U.S. 283, 288, 58 S.Ct. 586, 82 L.Ed. 845 (1938)); <em>see also Laughlin v. Kmart Corp., </em>50 F.3d 871, 873 (10th Cir. 1995) (\u201cThe amount in controversy is ordinarily determined by the allegations of the complaint.\u201d). Here, the defendant hospital has not argued that Ms. Marchese\u2019s claim for damages exceeding the jurisdictional amount was asserted in bad faith, and the district court made no such finding. Thus, the district court erred in dismissing Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>Marchese\u2019s state law claims on the grounds that there was no basis for it to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over them.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Accordingly, we DENY the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of Ms. Marchese\u2019s federal claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the ADA, we VACATE the district court\u2019s dismissal of her state law claims, and we REMAND this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b989-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and law of the case. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
