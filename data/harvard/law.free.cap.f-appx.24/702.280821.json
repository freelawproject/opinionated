Hearsay statements may constitute substantial evidence supportive of a finding if they are probative and rehable. <em>See Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 402, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1428, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). Hanamoto\u2019s arbitration testimony, affidavit and declaration were both probative and because corroborated by other evidence, rehable, and thus constituted substantial evidence supportive of the Commission\u2019s finding that Wilshire-Dayton\u2019s investment objectives were low-risk and that Gliksmaris trading was unsuitably excessive in hght of the company\u2019s objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">In any event, substantial evidence independent of Hanamoto\u2019s uncross-examined hearsay statements supports the Commission\u2019s finding. Gliksman testified that Wilshire-Dayton\u2019s investment objective was to \u201cmake money without too much risk.\u201d The trading pattern in the Wilshire-Dayton account estabhshes Gliksmaris trading was excessive by objective standards. Further, Gallagher testified he would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d have approved Gliksman\u2019s trading had he known the Wilshire-Dayton account was a customer account.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">The failure of the NASD and the Commission to subpoena Hanamoto in order to allow Ghksman and Gallagher to cross-examine her did not violate their procedural due process rights. This Court examines errors in NASD proceedings \u201conly to determine if they infected the Commission\u2019s action and led to error on its part.\u201d <em>Sorrell v. SEC, </em>679 F.2d 1323, 1326 (9th Cir.1982). Substantial evidence other than Hanamoto\u2019s uncross-examined hearsay statements supports the Commission\u2019s findings and therefore any error in the NASD proceedings did not \u201cinfect\u201d the Commission\u2019s decision. The Commission did not err by refusing to subpoena Hanamoto. Her attendance at the Commission hearing was unnecessary in hght of the other evidence available.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-15\">The Commission\u2019s decision that Gallagher failed to properly supervise Gliksman is not premised on an error of law. The Wilshire office was an office of supervisory jurisdiction. NASD Rule 3010 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>requires a member to designate an \u201cappropriately registered\u201d principal in each office of supervisory jurisdiction. NASD Manual 3010(a)(4) (1998). The Commission properly construed the NASD Rules as requiring a manager of an office of supervisory jurisdiction to be registered as a General Securities Principal. Since Gallagher testified Alyse Gliksman was supervisor of the Wilshire office and she was not registered as a General Securities Principal, Gallagher failed to designate an \u201cappropriately registered\u201d principal to supervise the Wilshire office.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Even if Alyse Gliksman was \u201cappropriately registered\u201d to supervise the Wilshire office, Gallagher violated NASD Conduct Rule 3010 by failing to provide a reasonable system of supervision for the office. Although a branch manager may serve as the \u201cfirst line of compliance,\u201d a supervisory system cannot rely solely on supervision by branch managers; it must provide enough checks to ensure any supervisory responsibility delegated to branch managers is being diligently exercised. <em>In re La Jolla Capital Corp., </em>SEC Release No. 34-41755, 1999 SEC LEXIS 1642 at *17 (SEC 1999). Gallagher\u2019s supervisory procedures for the Wilshire office were inadequate because he did not implement any checks on Alyse Gliksman\u2019s authority to supervise the office. He did not compile reports on commissions charged, costs charged or trading frequency and did not have sufficient access to customer accounts or complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-11\">.
