We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion, as supported by its reasons as stated from the bench, and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Robinson v. Houston, </em>Nos. CA-96-1298AMD; CA-96-896-AMD; CA-96-1388AMD (D.Md. Sept. 27, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-26\">We deny Robinson\u2019s motion for a transcript at government expense because he has failed to establish grounds for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>transcript. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) (1994). We also deny Robinson\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Affirmed by unpublished PER CURIAM opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
