Dowd, Jr., United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b324-20\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-21\">Scott Spurlock, a pro se Ohio resident, appeals a district court judgment dismissing his civil rights complaint construed as being filed under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq.; </em>the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 <em>et seq.; </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-22\">Seeking unspecified damages, Spurlock sued the University of Cincinnati contending that the University never took his disability into consideration and gave him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>failing grades in a discriminatory manner. In one of his pleadings Spurlock also discusses racism in the University which the district court construed as a civil rights allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The case was referred to a magistrate judge who recommended that the complaint be dismissed pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Spurlock did not file objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. As no objections were filed, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In his timely appeal, Spurlock\u2019s rambling brief consists mostly of questions and quotations by famous Americans. The district court\u2019s judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>See Sistrunk v. City of Strongsville, </em>99 F.3d 194, 197 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Spurlock has waived appellate review of his arguments. The case was referred to a magistrate judge who recommended dismissing the case for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Spurlock was notified pursuant to <em>Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 155, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985), that his failure to file specific objec- \u2022 tions to the magistrate judge\u2019s report would constitute a waiver of his claims on appeal. Spurlock failed to file specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. Thus, Spurlock has waived appellate review of his arguments. <em>See Miller v. Currie, </em>50 F.3d 373, 380 (6th Cir.1995); <em>Howard v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>932 F.2d 505, 508-09 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
