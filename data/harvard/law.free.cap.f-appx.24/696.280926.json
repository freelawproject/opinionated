We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-16\">We have considerable doubt whether Henderson made out a prima facie case of discrimination and whether all of the Army\u2019s employment decisions of which he complains constituted \u201cadverse employment actions\u201d for purposes of Title VII, even under our circuit\u2019s broad interpretation of that category. <em>See Ray v. Henderson, </em>217 F.3d 1234, 1240-43 (9th Cir.2000). We need not address those questions, however, because no reasonable jury could find that the neutral reasons set forth by the Army for its actions are pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-17\">The Army provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for Henderson\u2019s transfer, for the Army\u2019s refusal to terminate two of Henderson\u2019s subordinates as requested by Henderson, for Henderson\u2019s poor performance review, and for the Army\u2019s delay in processing Henderson\u2019s complaint. The Army supervisor transferred Henderson because of his documented poor performance as a manager and because of the Army\u2019s need to replace the entire staff at the EEO office. Henderson\u2019s supervisor showed that the Army lacked evidence and documentation to terminate Henderson\u2019s subordinates. The Army further produced evidence that Henderson set his own performance standards and did not meet them due to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>poor managerial skills. Finally, the Army provided sufficient evidence that the delay in processing Henderson\u2019s complaint was due to a TRADOC employee\u2019s need to take emergency leave because of her father\u2019s death and her husband\u2019s heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">With regard to Henderson\u2019s retaliation claims, the Army articulated legitimate, non-retaliatory explanations for the transfers and the poor performance review. It further explained that Henderson was not deprived of any supervisory duties in the TQM office. When Col. Elliot transferred Henderson to the TQM office, he intentionally did not give him supervisory responsibilities because Henderson had proven to be a poor manager in the EEC office.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Henderson produced no meaningful evidence that the Army\u2019s proffered explanations are false or that his supervisors harbored discriminatory animus toward him because he is African-American. <em>See Bradley v. Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., </em>104 F.3d 267, 270 (9th Cir.1996). Jerry Colonna was not similarly situated to Henderson for purposes of establishing discriminatory animus; unlike Henderson, Colonna was disciplined for behavior unrelated to his job performance. Without \u201cspecific, substantial evidence\u201d to show discriminatory intent or pretext, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Army intentionally discriminated against Henderson or retaliated against him in violation of Title VII. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Secretary is</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b723-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
