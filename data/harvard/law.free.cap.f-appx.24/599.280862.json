Heiss filed a motion to vacate or correct sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by ignoring his request to appeal. The district court denied Heiss\u2019s motion, concluding that the evidence before it conclusively showed that Heiss did not ask his counsel to appeal. But because Heiss alleges facts that, if proven, would entitle him to relief, we vacate and remand for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion Heiss raised a claim that his counsel was per se ineffective for having failed to file a notice of appeal. Heiss alleges in particular: \u201cI asked my attorney ... to appeal my sentence but I have not heard from him since the date of sentencing, 12-16-99.\u201d As relief, Heiss requested the court to restore his appellate rights. The government filed a response, asserting that Heiss had failed to set forth any \u201cbasis for a possible claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d because he did not demonstrate that he suffered prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal. Heiss responded, specifying that he asked counsel to file a notice of appeal on the date of his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In an order dated May 24, 2000, the district court rejected the government\u2019s argument that Heiss\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim necessarily failed because he did not demonstrate prejudice resulting from counsel\u2019s failure to perfect an appeal. In that same order the district court directed Heiss\u2019s counsel to submit an affidavit specifying whether Heiss had requested him to file a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Counsel filed an affidavit, in which he noted that as part of the plea agreement Heiss \u201cwaived his appellate rights\u201d and the \u201cright to challenge his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 with the exception of a claim of involuntariness or ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Counsel said that prior to sentencing he had discussed with Heiss \u201chis rights to appeal and the time limits for filing a notice of appeal\u201d and explained that \u201chis appellate rights were limited.\u201d Counsel further stated that the first time he heard from Heiss after sentencing was when he received a letter dated February 7, 2000, wherein Heiss \u201cfirst raised the issue of an appeal.\u201d In that letter, which counsel attached to his affidavit, Heiss made two ambiguous references to an appeal. First, after noting that he would not be sent to a \u201ccamp,\u201d Heiss asked, \u201cDo I have any chance to appeal?\u201d Second, after inquiring whether he could be transferred to the MCC, Heiss said, \u201cThey tell me I only had ten days to appeal my sentence.\u201d According to counsel, prior to receiving the letter. Heiss never asked him to file a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Heiss submitted a response to counsel\u2019s affidavit; he styled it \u201cAffidavit of Robert L. Heiss.\u201d Heiss agreed that counsel had spoken to him about his appellate rights and the time limit for filing of a notice of appeal. According to Heiss, however, counsel \u201cglossed through my appelate [sic] rights without emphasizing the significant rights I was waiving.\u201d Heiss further stated that he asked counsel to file a notice of appeal \u201cseveral times beginning with my sentencing December 16, 1999 but he was totally unresponsive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">In its supplemental response, the government argued that Heiss\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim failed because he submitted only unsworn statements in support. The government further contended that Heiss\u2019s February 7 letter to counsel did not constitute a request to file a notice of appeal, and that even if it did, such a request was by that point untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The district court ultimately denied Heiss\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. The court credited counsel\u2019s statement in his affidavit that Heiss had not asked him to appeal and concluded that Heiss\u2019s \u201cunsworn assertions to the contrary\u201d did not require it to hold an evidentiary hearing. The district court subsequently granted a certificate of appealability as to the following question: whether Heiss \u201cis entitled to a hearing on the issues of whether (a) he timely requested that his attorney file a notice of appeal and/or (b) if not for deficient performance by his attorney, he would have requested that his attorney file a timely notice of appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">On appeal Heiss argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 2255 motion without holding an evidentiary hearing. Heiss\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim is based on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Castellanos v. United States, </em>26 F.3d 717 (7th Cir.1994), which holds that counsel\u2019s failure to perfect an appeal, despite the defendant\u2019s request, constitutes ineffective assistance without regard to the probability of success on appeal. <em>See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 477, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 2, a district court has discretion to deny an evidentiary hearing where the \u201cmotion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d The salient question here, then, is whether the evidence before the district court conclusively showed that Heiss did not make a timely request to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">We think that the evidence before the district court was largely inconclusive. What we have here is a factual dispute\u2014 Heiss said he asked counsel to appeal on the date of his sentencing, and counsel said Heiss did not. Heiss alleges facts that, if proven, would entitle him to relief under <em>Castellanos, </em>and the evidence before the district court did not conclusively defeat Heiss\u2019s claim. Accordingly, Heiss was entitled to an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Daniels v. United States, </em>54 F.3d 290, 293-94 (7th Cir.1995); <em>Stoia v. United States, </em>22 F.3d 766, 768 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">We find no merit to the government\u2019s assertion that an evidentiary hearing was not required because Heiss presented only unsworn statements in support of his claim. The government overlooks the fact that by signing his \u00a7 2255 motion Heiss swore to the truth of his allegations. Heiss alleges in his motion that he asked counsel to file a notice of appeal but had not heard from counsel since the date of sentencing. Heiss is proceeding pro se, and a liberal reading of Heiss\u2019s allegations supports an inference that he timely requested counsel to appeal. <em>See McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993) (filings of pro se prisoner must be liberally construed); <em>Winsett v. Washington, </em>130 F.3d 269, 280 (7th Cir.1997). Moreover, we do not think that the district court properly credited counsel\u2019s version over Heiss\u2019s where it never told Heiss that he needed to submit a response to counsel\u2019s affidavit or that he was required to reduce the allegations of his \u00a7 2255 motion to affidavit form. Heiss did file what he styled \u201cAffidavit of Robert L. Heiss,\u201d and if the district thought this \u201caffidavit\u201d was insufficient, it should have given Heiss the opportunity to correct the deficiency. <em>Cf. Lewis v. Faulkner, </em>689 F.2d 100 (7th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">We also reject the government\u2019s assertion that other evidence before the district court further contradicted Heiss\u2019s allegation that he asked counsel to appeal. The government first points to the appeal waiver in the plea agreement. But we do not understand how the presence of an appeal waiver defeats Heiss\u2019s allegation that he asked counsel to appeal. Second, the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>ernment points to Heiss\u2019s letter of February 7. The government basically reads into this letter an implicit concession by Heiss that he did not ask counsel to appeal because he did not mention that request in the letter. But Heiss\u2019s letter is ambiguous at best and in our view does not conclusively defeat his assertion that he asked counsel to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The government alternatively argues for the first time on appeal that counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal because Heiss waived his right to appeal in the plea agreement. But because the government did not raise this argument in the district court, it is waived on appeal. <em>See Cossel v. Miller, </em>229 F.3d 649, 653 (7th Cir.2000). In any event, the government\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Our starting point is the plea agreement, in particular the waiver, which reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">The defendant is also aware that Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742 affords a defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed. Acknowledging this, the defendant knowingly waives the right to appeal any sentence within the maximum provided in the statute of conviction (or the manner in which that sentence was determined), in exchange for the concessions made by the United States in this Plea Agreement .... The waiver in this paragraph does not apply to a claim of involuntariness, or ineffective assistance of counsel, which relates directly to this waiver or its negotiation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG5\">Heiss\u2019s appellate rights may have been limited by the waiver but the waiver does not foreclose all appellate review. For instance, although Heiss waived the right to appeal his sentence, he did not waive the right to attack the circumstances underlying his guilty plea. <em>See Bridgeman v. United States, </em>225 F.3d 589, 591-92 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Jones v. United States, </em>167 F.3d 1142, 1144-45 (7th Cir.1999). The plea agreement itself makes this clear: exempted from the waiver are claims of involuntariness and ineffective assistance of counsel. As we noted in <em>United States v. Behrman, </em>235 F.3d 1049, 1052 (7th Cir. 2000), \u201cjust as we are willing to enforce waivers of appeal, we enforce them only to the extent of the agreement.\u201d Moreover, the waiver does not completely foreclose review of Heiss\u2019s sentence. We considered an almost identical waiver in <em>Behrman, </em>and held the defendant there had surrendered only the right to appeal a sentence within the maximum provided in the statute of conviction. <em>See id. </em>As in <em>Behrman, </em>the statute of conviction here provides for imprisonment and a fine, but it makes no mention of other aspects of Heiss\u2019s sentence, such as supervised release. Based on the plain language of the waiver, Heiss still has the right to appeal, although that right is limited. Deprivation of that right, no matter how limited, is all that Heiss needs to show for the presumption of prejudice to attach. <em>See Roe, </em>528 U.S. at 483, 120 S.Ct. 1029; <em>Castellanos, </em>26 F.3d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">One final matter. While his \u00a7 2255 motion was pending, Heiss submitted an \u201cAddendum,\u201d in which he raised a number of claims beyond the ineffective-assistance claim alleged in his original \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court construed that filing as a request to amend the \u00a7 2255 motion and denied it. The court reasoned: \u201cIf Heiss desires to raise other issues in a \u00a7 2255 motion, he should file a separate motion and clearly state all claims that he desires to raise. The present \u00a7 2255 motion, limited to the right to appeal, will not bar a subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion as a successive motion.\u201d But Heiss is entitled to only one round of collateral review, <em>Talbott v. Indiana, </em>226 F.3d 866, 869 (7th Cir.2000), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>and would be barred from filing a second collateral attack absent this court\u2019s permission. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 18. The district court\u2019s conclusion that Heiss could file another \u00a7 2255 motion would have been correct only had it granted relief on his <em>Castellanos </em>claim. <em>See Shepeck v. United States, </em>150 F.3d 800, 801 (7th Cir.1998). But that was not the case here. Therefore, on remand, if Heiss moves to amend his motion, the district court should determine whether leave should be granted. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>196 F.3d 802, 805-06 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">The judgment of the district court is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
