The district court found that, while Summers may have made out a prima facie case of discrimination, he failed to establish a genuine issue as to whether the reason given for his termination was pretextual. Because we hold that Summers did not even make out the a prima facie case of gender discrimination, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-15\">To survive the summary judgment motion, Summers was required to establish that he was performing according to his employer\u2019s legitimate expectations. <em>See Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir.1998). He failed to make this showing. During his short time at the prison, his performance evaluations steadily declined from a solid \u201cstandard\u201d rating to a \u201cneeds improvement\u201d rating. His employer\u2019s concerns about his performance were largely the same on each consecutive evaluation; he was told what he needed to do to improve and failed to make the necessary changes in his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-16\">The chewing tobacco incident, only one of numerous problems, is telling. Summers had been counseled not to continue to spit tobacco into trash cans in the nurses\u2019 area. A reasonable nurse could not have believed that it was an appropriate alternative to spit tobacco and saliva into a pill container, close the container, and leave the container on a shelf where medicines were kept. Summers has failed to produce evidence that would permit a rational trier of fact to find that he was meeting the reasonable expectations of his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-17\">Because Summers failed to raise an issue of fact that he was performing satisfactorily, the district court\u2019s grant of sum: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>mary judgment in favor of the State of Nevada is</p>\n<p id=\"Aqp\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b776-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
