White was convicted, upon a jury verdict, of thirty-three counts of mail fraud. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 2 (1994). The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently, and three years\u2019 su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>pervised release. In this appeal of his conviction and sentence, White\u2019s counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and White has filed a pro se supplemental brief. We address seriatim the arguments in the <em>Anders </em>and supplemental briefs, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Specifically, (1) the evidence at trial sufficiently supports the jury\u2019s verdict, <em>see United States v. Robinson, </em>217 F.3d 560, 564 (8th Cir.) (standard of review), ce<em>rt. denied </em>531 U.S. 999, 121 S.Ct. 497, 148 L.Ed.2d 468 (2000); <em>United States v. Bearden, </em>265 F.3d 732, 736 (8th Cir. 2001) (listing the elements of mail fraud); (2) White did not make a showing that the lack of African Americans on his jury venire panel was the result of systematic exclusion so as to violate his Sixth Amendment rights, <em>see United States v. Clifford, </em>640 F.2d 150, 156 (8th Cir.1981); (3) we reject his arguments that he is entitled to relief based on an alleged violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), <em>see Dye v. Stender, </em>208 F.3d 662, 665 (8th Cir.2000), and that the District Court committed clear error in denying a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see United States v. Ervasti, </em>201 F.3d 1029, 1043-44 (8th Cir. 2000); (4) the Court\u2019s jury instructions, as a whole, fairly and adequately submitted the issues to the jury, <em>see United States v. Lalley, </em>257 F.3d 751, 755 (8th Cir.2001); (5) the government properly charged White for each individual instance of mail fraud in the scheme, <em>see United States v. Gardner, </em>65 F.3d 82, 85 (8th Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1064, 116 S.Ct. 748, 133 L.Ed.2d 696 (1996); and (6) based on our holding that sufficient evidence supports White\u2019s convictions, we find merit-less his contentions that the acts he committed were not included in the mail fraud statute, and that the grand jury failed to adequately investigate, <em>see United States v. Dugan, </em>150 F.3d 865, 868 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>525 U.S. 1009, 119 S.Ct. 528, 142 L.Ed.2d 438 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-15\">. The Honorable Robert T.
