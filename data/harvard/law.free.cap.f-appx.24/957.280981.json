McCauley, and Donald E. Little (collectively \u201cDWG\u201d) appeal an order from the United States District Court for the District of Utah granting a preliminary injunction in favor of defendants-appellees Ruth U. Fertel, Inc. and Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak Houses (collectively \u201cRUFI\u201d). Exercising appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">At the time of the original complaint, DWG owned the U.S. Prime Steak House, a restaurant in Park City, Utah. RUFI is the owner of the Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House chain. RUFI is also the owner of a registered service mark which features the words \u201cU.S. Prime\u201d in all-capital, block lettering tilted at an upward angle and surrounded by two concentric circles. DWG filed this suit challenging the validity of RUFI\u2019s \u201cU.S. Prime\u201d service mark. RUFI filed a counterclaim and a motion for injunctive relief, alleging that DWG\u2019s use of the name \u201cU.S. Prime\u201d in its restaurant and products infringed on RUFI\u2019s registered mark, in violation of the Lanham Act. The district court granted RUFI\u2019s motion to dismiss DWG\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Following a preliminary injunction hearing, the district court enjoined DWG from using the mark \u201cU.S. Prime\u201d on its restaurant, products, advertisements, and other materials in an order filed on September 28, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">On appeal, DWG makes several challenges to the district court\u2019s determinations of the validity of RUFI\u2019s registered mark and DWG\u2019s infringement. Specifically, DWG argues that the district court erred in (1) failing to consider whether RUFI\u2019s mark was generic; (2) concluding that RUFI\u2019s mark had acquired secondary meaning; (3) determining that there was a likelihood of confusion between DWG and RUFI\u2019s marks; and (4) failing to consider adequately DWG\u2019s defenses based on RUFI\u2019s disclaimer of a prior mark and RUFI\u2019s allegedly unclean hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-12\">This court reviews the grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. <em>See Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians v. Pierce, </em>253 F.3d 1234, 1243 (10th Cir.2001). A district court abuses its discretion if it \u201ccommits an error of law, or is clearly erroneous in its preliminary factual findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The district court\u2019s determination of the level of distinctiveness is a question of fact reviewed for clear error. <em>See Boston Beer Co. v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co., </em>9 F.3d 175, 180 (1st Cir.1993). A determination of whether a mark has acquired secondary meaning is also a question of fact reviewed for clear error. <em>See J.M. Huber Corp. v. Lowery Wellheads, Inc., </em>778 F.2d 1467, 1470 (10th Cir.1985). In general, likeli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>hood of confusion is a question of fact subject to clear error review. <em>See Heartsprings, Inc. v. Heartspring, Inc., </em>143 F.3d 550, 553 (10th Cir.1998); <em>Beer Nuts, Inc. v. Clover Club Foods Co., </em>805 F.2d 920, 923 n. 2 (10th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">As a preliminary matter, this court denies DWG\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal with materials not before the district court at the preliminary injunction hearing. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 10(e) (authorizing modification of the record only to extent necessary to \u201ctruly disclose[ ] what occurred in the district court\u201d); <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>225 F.3d 1187, 1191 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201cThis court will not consider material outside the record before the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Turning to the merits, DWG first contends that the district court erred by failing to determine the relative distinctiveness of the mark. In its order, the district court stated that \u201cRUFI\u2019s U.S. Prime service mark seems to be either \u2018descriptive\u2019 or \u2018suggestive,\u2019 indicating some quality or ingredient of the goods.\u201d This court therefore finds no merit in DWG\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">As for DWG\u2019s arguments that the district court erred in concluding that RUFI\u2019s mark had acquired secondary meaning and that there existed a likelihood of confusion between DWG\u2019s and RUFI\u2019s marks, this court concludes that the district court\u2019s factual determinations on these issues were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">The district court did not explicitly address DWG\u2019s disclaimer defense in its order granting a preliminary injunction. Here, however, there are no disputed facts underlying the disclaimer defense. Because remand to the district court would needlessly consume judicial resources, this court addresses the merits of the disclaimer defense. <em>See McCord v. Bailey, </em>636 F.2d 606, 613 (D.C.Cir.1980). A disclaimer of a federal registration disavows any exclusive right to use the disclaimed words except within the composite mark. <em>See Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple, </em>747 F.2d 1522, 1529 (4th Cir.1984). DWG concedes that RUFI has not disclaimed the \u201cU.S. Prime\u201d mark RUFI seeks to enforce. Apparently, DWG relies on the disclaimer of one of RUFI\u2019s earlier registered marks. Disclaimer of a previous mark, however, does not affect the validity of a subsequent registration without a disclaimer if the disclaimed matter has become distinctive. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(b) (\u201cNo disclaimer ... shall prejudice or affect the applicant\u2019s or registrant\u2019s rights then existing or thereafter arising in the disclaimed matter, or his right of registration on another application if the disclaimed matter be or shall have become distinctive of his goods or services.\u201d). DWG does not present any argument to rebut the application of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(b) in this case. Accordingly, we find no merit to DWG\u2019s disclaimer defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Finally, this court concludes that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to address DWG\u2019s unclean hands defense. DWG\u2019s defense rests heavily on its claim that RUFI falsely advertised the grade of beef allegedly depicted in a Ruth\u2019s Chris advertisement. This claim, however, is not substantiated in DWG\u2019s briefs or supported by the portions of the record cited. <em>See Gamble, Simmons &amp; Co. v. Kerr-McGee Corp., </em>175 F.3d 762, 773 n. 5 (10th Cir.1999) (\u201cIn the absence of sufficient citation to record support for a party\u2019s allegations, we decline to search for the proverbial needle in a haystack.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">The United States District Court for the District of Utah did not abuse its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>tion and its order granting a preliminary injunction is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b984-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
