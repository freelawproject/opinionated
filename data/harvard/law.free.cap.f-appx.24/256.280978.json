On January 14, 2000, he was sentenced to 355 months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. It is from this judgment that Gilmore now ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>peals. The parties have waived oral argument, and the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed in this case. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Gilmore argues that his firearm conviction violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the sentencing court assumed that he had brandished a firearm, as required for a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years under \u00a7 924(e)(l)(A)(ii). He concedes that this claim is reviewed for plain error because it was not raised in the district court. <em>See United States v. Koeberlein, </em>161 F.3d 946, 949 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Our court has applied an <em>Apprendi </em>analysis to statutorily mandated minimum sentences, as well as to statutory m\u00e1ximums. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ramirez, </em>242 F.3d 348, 351-52 (6th Cir.2001). Nevertheless, Gilmore\u2019s argument lacks merit because the brandishing factor was charged in his indictment and because he acknowledged a sufficient factual basis for applying that factor when he entered his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The indictment expressly charged Gilmore with violating \u00a7 924(c), by knowingly using, carrying and brandishing a firearm during a carjacking. The district court determined that he understood this charge before it accepted his plea. It also advised him that the minimum sentence for a first-time violator of this offense would be \u201cnot less than seven years.\u201d Gilmore subsequently acknowledged a sufficient factual basis for his guilty plea, which included an admission that he had struck the victim in the head with a pistol. Moreover, it is clear that the district court did not feel constrained by the seven-year minimum since it imposed a seventeen-year sentence on the firearm charge. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Gilmore\u2019s firearm conviction did not violate the procedural safeguards that were outlined in <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Garcia, </em>252 F.3d 838, 843-44 (6th Cir. 2001); <em>United States v. Harper, </em>246 F.3d 520, 530-31 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Gilmore also argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to depart downward from the applicable guideline range under USSG \u00a7 5K2.13, in light of his diminished mental capacity. However, he did not file any relevant objections to the presentence report or argue for a downward departure at sentencing. Thus, Gilmore has forfeited this claim in the absence of plain error that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Koeberlein, </em>161 F.3d at 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The district court did not commit plain error here, as a downward departure is not allowed for diminished capacity, when \u201cthe facts and circumstances of the defendant\u2019s offense indicate a need to protect the public because the offense involved actual violence or a serious threat of violence.\u201d USSG \u00a7 5K2.13(2) (1999). There is also no indication that the sentencing judge was unaware of her discretion to grant a downward departure in appropriate cases. Her decision not to exercise that discretion here is not reviewable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>209 F.3d 614, 618 (6th Cir. 2000); <em>United States v. Byrd, </em>53 F.3d 144, 145 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
