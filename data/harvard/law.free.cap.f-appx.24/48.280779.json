Little was sentenced principally to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-15\">On appeal, Little objects to the district court\u2019s calculation of the amount of crack cocaine considered as relevant conduct in the determination of Little\u2019s base offense level. In addition to the .414 grams of crack cocaine that Little admitted to selling in his plea agreement, the district court counted 9.5 grams sold by another individual. Little contends that the 9.5 grams should not have been charged to him because, besides being present at the transaction and giving the seller directions to the crack house, he played no role in the transaction and did not financially benefit from it. In making this argument, Little relies primarily on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2), which prescribes reduced base offense levels for those convicted of managing a drug establishment who \u201chad no participation in the underlying controlled substance offense other than allowing use of the premises .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-16\">Little\u2019s rebanee on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2) is plainly misplaced. The Application Note to this Sentencing Guideline not only expressly precludes its application to the instant case; it also refutes Little\u2019s claim that his participation in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>sale of the 9.5 grams of crack cocaine did not appreciably extend beyond his being \u201cpresent\u201d at the sale: \u201c[S]ubsection (a)(2) would not apply to ... a defendant who made telephone calls to facilitate the underlying controlled substance offense.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.8, cmt. n. 1. In this case, Little facilitated the sale of the 9.5 grams by giving directions over the telephone to the seller, who was lost, and by orally directing another individual to meet the seller so that he could bring the seller back to the crack house to make the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Little\u2019s other arguments are similarly unavailing. It does not matter that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office might have thought that it had insufficient evidence to convict Little for the sale of the 9.5 grams. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 12 (\u201cTypes and quantities of drugs not specified in the count of conviction may be considered in determining the offense level.\u201d). Nor does it matter that Little\u2019s co-defendants, who \u201cwere also present,\u201d did not have their charges enhanced in the same way. As discussed above, Little was not simply present but actively facilitated the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
