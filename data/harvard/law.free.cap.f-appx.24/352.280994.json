Garwood, United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\">I.</p>\n<author id=\"b380-8\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Linda L. Kettering appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Diamond-Triumph Auto Glass on her Title VII hostile environment and retaliation claims, and to Susan Parris on her defamation claim. We AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">Kettering was hired as a sales representative for Diamond, a supplier and installer of automobile glass, on November 4, 1996. She was initially hired to represent Diamond\u2019s Akron, Ohio store, but shortly after her hire, she was also assigned Diamond\u2019s Mansfield, Ohio store. As a sales representative, Kettering\u2019s principal responsibilities were to cultivate new accounts and increase sales in the Akron and Mansfield territories.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">Kettering\u2019s supervisor was Gina Bennington, a Diamond sales manager based in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Bennington, in turn, reported to Keith Omaits, Diamond\u2019s District Manager for the Northern District of Ohio and the individual who hired Kettering. Included in Omaits\u2019s district were the Akron and Mansfield stores. The employees at the Akron store were Keith Newbauer, the branch manager; Mike Benbow, a customer service representative; and two glass installers. Newbauer was described as a difficult person to work with, and as uncivil and demeaning to both co-workers and customers. Although Newbauer was the branch manager of the Akron store, he did not have supervisory authority over Kettering.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-15\">The first incident of sexual harassment occurred on April 25,1997 when Newbauer \u201cfondled [Kettering\u2019s] right leg and said how nice her leg felt.\u201d In response, Kettering told Newbauer to stop. When she later bent over to pick something up, Newbauer said, \u201cOh and while you\u2019re down there ...,\u201d to which Kettering responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d and walked away. Kettering immediately reported this incident to Bennington.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-16\">Kettering alleges that after this incident, Newbauer began a campaign of harassment against her. For example, after Kettering told Newbauer that she made twenty-six sales calls one day, Newbauer replied sarcastically, \u201cIs that all?\u201d On another occasion, Newbauer told Kettering to call on the Allstate Insurance Office, and when Kettering questioned this request because Allstate already used another network of glass installers, he replied \u201cBull-fucking shit\u201d and said \u201cIf he wants you to call on him, you better fuck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>ing call on him.\u201d Kettering also alleges that in May, Newbauer threw a tantrum when she told him Omaits directed her to run the Akron shop the following day because an installer would be off and Newbauer would have to fill in. Newbauer ranted that he wanted someone from Cleveland to come in \u201cwho knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d On another occasion, Newbauer repeatedly interrupted Kettering when she was on the phone with a customer. When she asked him to let her finish her conversation with the customer, Newbauer replied loud enough for the customer to hear, \u201cThis is fucking important.\u201d On May 9, Kettering allegedly received a-call from Omaits in which he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6M\">Everything is negative on your part, not Keith Newbauer\u2019s. Our figures the past two months in Akron have been the highest ever. You are more disrespectful to Newbauer than he is to you. Ohio is the best store in most of the nation now and you seem to be the crux of the problem. I will not allow negativism to pull this store down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Omaits also told her that she had \u201cabsolutely no grounds for a sexual harassment charge and that [she] made Newbauer very uncomfortable.\u201d After this conversation, says Kettering, \u201cNewbauer apparently got the message as he did not directly harass [her]; however, he did it surreptitiously and behind [her] back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The second incident of sexual harassment occurred on September 19, when Kettering, Newbauer and Benbow were in Diamond\u2019s Akron store discussing the importance of good customer relations. Kettering stated that she believed it was important to follow up with customers after a sale, and thank them for their business. Newbauer allegedly replied, \u201cI\u2019ll bet you care take care of them .... \u201d and motioned with his hand and mouth simulating oral sex. Kettering told Newbauer that he \u201creally crossed the line\u201d and that she was insulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Kettering reported this second incident to Bennington on October 6. Bennington relayed this information to Diamond\u2019s owner and told Kettering that the incident would be handled \u201caccording to company policy.\u201d In an affidavit, Omaits stated that he investigated this incident \u2014 which Newbauer denied \u2014 and admonished Newbauer to refrain from making inappropriate remarks to Kettering or anyone else. He filed a written employee disciplinary report in Newbauer\u2019s personnel file on October 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">On February 3, 1998, a meeting was held in the Akron store with Kettering, Benbow, Newbauer, Bennington and Omaits. Newbauer criticized Kettering for lagging sales in the Akron territory and for improperly listing new accounts on her weekly report sheets.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Omaits sent Susan Parris, Diamond\u2019s Cleveland sales representative, with Kettering on June 10 and 11. Kettering contends that Omaits sent Parris \u201cto be [his] eyes and ears\u201d and to unofficially critique her performance. Parris reported to Omaits that Kettering refused to call on certain businesses and spoke highly of her previous employer, a competitor of Diamond, at some of the accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">On June 13, Omaits came to the Akron store and fired Kettering. According to Kettering, Omaits told her that she was being fired because she had not increased sales in the Akron and Mansfield areas and because of her sales technique. He added that if he did not let her go, he would have to lay off an installer. Omaits also told Kettering that \u2018You scared the hell out of us with your sexual harassment threats.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">Kettering filed an administrative charge of sexual harassment and retaliation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on November 13, 1998. In the course of its investigation, the Commission requested information from Diamond, and in response, Diamond asked Parris to prepare a written statement summarizing her observations of Kettering\u2019s work. Parris reported that Kettering refused to call on certain businesses, that Kettering spoke highly of her previous employer at some of the accounts and made lewd comments and gestures in her presence. Diamond forwarded this letter to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">On June 11, 1999, Kettering filed the instant lawsuit alleging federal and state hostile environment sexual harassment and retaliation claims against Diamond, and a defamation claim against Parris. On June 25, 2000, the district court granted defendants summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant'of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Gribcheck v. Runyon, </em>245 F.3d 547, 549 (6th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is granted if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">A. Kettering\u2019s Hostile Environment Claim Against Diamond</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">In a \u201cdeferral state\u201d such as Ohio, Title VII requires a plaintiff to file an administrative charge of discrimination with the Commission within three hundred days of the alleged harassment. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e) (1994). Taking the underlying facts in the light most favorable to Kettering, she was harassed on two occasions \u2014 the first on April 25, 1997, and the second on September 19, 1997.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kettering did not file an administrative charge with the Commission until November 13, 1998 \u2014 more than three hundred days after the most recent incident of sexual harassment. Thus, unless Kettering can avail herself of an exception to Title VIPs filing requirements, her claim was not timely filed with the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">One such exception is the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d doctrine, which provides that when \u201cthere is an ongoing, continuous series of discriminatory acts, they may be challenged in their entirety as long as one of those discriminatory acts falls within the limitations period.\u201d <em>Kovacevich v. Kent State Univ., </em>224 F.3d 806, 829 (6th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Haithcock v. Frank, </em>958 F.2d 671, 677 (6th Cir.1992)). Kettering cannot avail herself of this exception because neither incident of harassment occurred within the limitations period. Kettering cannot rely on her additional allegations of harassment because those alleged incidents were not \u201csexual\u201d in nature or directed to Kettering because of her gender; rather, they were a function of Newbauer\u2019s uniformly rude and uncivil personality. As Kettering acknowledges \u201che [Newbauer] treated everybody pretty much the same.\u201d Therefore, Kettering cannot rely on the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d doctrine, and her hostile environment claim is time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">B. Kettering\u2019s Retaliation Claim Against Diamond</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">Kettering\u2019s claim that Diamond retaliated against her for her complaints about Newbauer\u2019s harassment is governed by the familiar <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework. <em>See Gribcheck, </em>245 F.3d at 550. In order to establish a prima facie case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>retaliation, Kettering must show that: (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) the defendant knew of this exercise of her protected rights; (3) defendant took an employment action adverse to her; and (4) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>See id. </em>To establish the necessary causal connection, plaintiff must proffer sufficient evidence \u201cto raise the inference that her protected activity was the likely reason for the adverse action.\u201d <em>Zanders v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>898 F.2d 1127, 1135 (6th Cir.1990) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie claim of retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the discharge. <em>See Gribcheck, </em>245 F.3d at 550. If the defense meets this burden, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason is merely a pretext for retaliation. <em>See id. </em>To demonstrate pretext, a plaintiff is required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered reason either had no basis in fact, did not actually motivate the discharge, or was insufficient to motivate discharge. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">As the district court found, Kettering can establish a prima facie case of retaliation. Kettering notified Diamond of the harassment, therefore it knew about the exercise of her protected rights; and Diamond ultimately took adverse action against her because it terminated her employment. Kettering can also establish the requisite causal connection because when she was fired, Omaits, a Diamond district manager, told her that she \u201cscared the hell out of us with [her] sexual harassment threats.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Diamond has also satisfied its burden by presenting sufficient evidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Kettering\u2019s discharge. Kettering was hired to increase sales in the Akron and Mansfield territories, but according to Omaits, Kettering did not, in fact, increase sales in these territories. Moreover, Omaits also believed that Kettering was unwilling to call on her certain businesses and was apparently promoting the interests of her former employer, a competitor of Diamond.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Although Omaits\u2019s statement makes this a relatively close case, Kettering is ultimately unable to establish that Diamond\u2019s proffered justification for her discharge was pretextual. In an effort to carry her burden, Kettering focuses on sales records for March and April 1998, which indicate that the Akron and Mansfield stores were profitable. As the district court found, however, this evidence is inconclusive and is insufficient to meet the preponderance of evidence standard. Not only do these records fail to address Kettering\u2019s contribution, they also only cover a limited time period of Kettering\u2019s employment. Her reference to the August 1998 sales records also does not support her claim because they reflect sales after her termination. Kettering\u2019s other arguments represent, at best, \u201cdisputation of the facts underlying [the defendant\u2019s] legitimate business reason,\u201d which this Court has recognized is \u201cnot sufficient to carry [the plaintiff\u2019s burden].\u201d <em>Gribcheck, </em>245 F.3d at 552 (quoting <em>Irvin v. Airco Carbide, </em>837 F.2d 724, 726 (6th Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">C. Kettering\u2019s Defamation Claim Against Parris</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Kettering\u2019s defamation claim revolves around Parris\u2019s written statement summarizing her observations of Kettering\u2019s job performance and demeanor. To prove a defamation claim under Ohio law, a claimant must show \u2014 (1) a false statement; (2) the statement is defamatory to the plaintiff; (3) the statement was pub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>lished to a third party; (4) the publishing defendant was, at a minimum, negligent; (5) the statement damaged plaintiffs reputation. <em>See Parry v. Mohawk Motors, </em>236 F.3d 299, 312 (6th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Lansdowne v. Beacon Journal Publishing Co., </em>32 Ohio St.3d 176, 512 N.E.2d 979, 984 (Ohio 1987)). Privilege, absolute or qualified, is a defense to defamation. <em>See Parry, </em>236 F.3d at 313. Under Ohio law, statements made to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission are absolutely privileged. <em>See Saini v. Cleveland Pneumatic Co., </em>No. 51993, 1987 WL 11098, at *4 (Ohio App. 8th Dist. May 14, 1987). Because Parris\u2019s statements regarding Kettering\u2019s performance and behavior were made to the Commission and in response to the Commission\u2019s request, they are absolutely privileged. Therefore, Kettering\u2019s defamation claim against Parris must fail.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-9\">. On appeal, Kettering alleges a third incident of harassment, but because it was not raised below, we do not consider it here. See <em>United States v. Markwood, </em>48 F.3d 969, 974 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
