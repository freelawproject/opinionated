R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Alan David Swendra appeals the District of Colorado\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition and the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">We have thoroughly reviewed the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, the district court\u2019s decision, and the record. We adopt the magistrate judge\u2019s well-documented findings and dismiss Mr. Swendra\u2019s \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. We also deny Mr. Swendra\u2019s application for a certificate of appeal-ability. Mr. Swendra has failed to \u201cdemonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Nor has Mr. Swendra shown that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling,\u201d as required to issue a COA when the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Mr. Swendra\u2019s motion to proceed in for-ma pauperis is granted, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b949-21\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
