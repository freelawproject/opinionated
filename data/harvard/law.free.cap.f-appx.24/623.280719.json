According to the record, Brownlee also has mild mental retardation, with partial and full-scale IQ scores ranging from 52-82. Brownlee receives special education services five periods per day, takes Ritalin for his ADHD, and wears glasses which correct his vision to 20-30 in his right eye. Although Brownlee\u2019s problems noticeably impair his academic performance in mainstream classes, Brownlee has good attendance, receives good marks for citizenship, and good grades in reading, language, spelling, and math. He is also able to ride his bicycle, play video games, and complete household chores. Supplemental benefits were initially granted, then denied after the Commissioner reviewed Brownlee\u2019s case in light of the 1996 changes to the Social Security Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382e(a)(3) (1994 &amp; Supp. IV 1998). To be considered disabled under the new law, children must have more serious impairment-related limitations than under the old law. <em>See Rucker for Rucker v. Apfel, </em>141 F.3d 1256, 1259 (8th Cir.1998). After conducting a hearing and the proper sequential evaluation, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that Brownlee is not working, has a severe impairment (ADHD and loss of depth perception in his right eye), but does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meet the criteria for disability. <em>See, e.g., </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924 (2001). The Appeals Council affirmed the ALJ\u2019s determination. Shelton filed for judicial review. The district court<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> affirmed, finding substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Shelton now appeals, claiming Brownlee\u2019s impairments are sufficient to meet the criteria for disability either by meeting a listed impairment or having two marked impairments that functionally equal a listed impairment. Having carefully reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. <em>See Hunt v. Massanari, </em>250 F.3d 622, 623-24 (8th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">Shelton contends Brownlee is disabled because he meets the listed impairment of mental retardation under \u00a7 112.05(C) and (D). <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. I \u00a7 112.05 (2001). Because Shelton did not raise her claim under \u00a7 112.05(C) before the Commissioner or the district court, we decline to consider it for the first time on appeal. <em>See Norwest Bank of N.D., N.A. v. Doth, </em>159 F.3d 328, 334 (8th Cir.1998). We conclude no manifest injustice will result from our decision because Shelton can reapply for benefits asserting Brownlee is disabled under \u00a7 112.05(C). We reject Shelton\u2019s claim under \u00a7 112.05(D), finding the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>ord as a whole supports the ALJ\u2019s contrary determination. To be disabled under \u00a7 112.05(D), Brownlee must have a \u201cvalid verbal, performance, or full scale IQ of 60 through 70 and a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant limitation of function.\u201d We agree Brownlee meets the IQ criterion but reject Shelton\u2019s contentions that Brown-lee\u2019s language disorder, ADHD, and right-eye blindness each impose the required additional functional limitation. Brown-lee\u2019s treatment progress reports and most of his grades are good, and his vision is corrected to 20-30, supporting the ALJ\u2019s determination that Brownlee\u2019s function is not significantly limited by an additional impairment. <em>See, e.g., Briggs v. Callahan, </em>139 F.3d 606, 609 (8th Cir.1998) (finding denial of benefits supported when child\u2019s hyperactivity improved with medication and behavior was appropriate at school).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Shelton also contends that Brown-lee meets the functional equivalent of a listed impairment because he is markedly impaired in eogmtive/communicative development and in concentration, persistence, and pace. <em>See </em>\u00a7 112.00(C). Brownlee must be markedly impaired in two functional domains to qualify as being functionally equal to a listed disability. Even though Brownlee\u2019s cognitive test scores are two standard deviations below the mean, thus meeting the definition of marked impairment in cognitive/communicative development, <em>see id., </em>school records, progress notes, and evidence of Brownlee\u2019s ability to perform a wide range of daily activities support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Brownlee is less than markedly impaired in concentration, persistence, and pace. Because Brownlee is not markedly impaired in two domains, we reject Shelton\u2019s contention that he is functionally equal to a listed disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\"> The Honorable Heniy L.
