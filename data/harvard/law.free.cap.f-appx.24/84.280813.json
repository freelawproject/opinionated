Johnson Controls World Servs., </em>No. 97-CV-5835, slip op. at 11 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 5, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-23\">Leca alleges that Johnson Controls discriminated against him on account of his race and national origin by subjecting him to a hostile work environment and retaliating against him in violation of Title VII of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cTitle VII\u201d), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cADEA\u201d), the New York Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. L. \u00a7 296(l)(a) (\u201cNYHRL\u201d), the New York City Administrative Code, Title 8 \u00a7 8-107(l)(a) (\u201cNYCAC\u201d). He has also brought an action for the New York common law tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Upon Johnson Controls\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court ruled that Leca had not presented evidence sufficient to create an issue of material fact as to: (1) whether a hostile work environment existed and whether Johnson Controls knew or should have known of allegations of discrimination against Leca; (2) whether Johnson Controls\u2019s alleged retaliatory actions were motivated by animus based on protected activity; and (3) whether Johnson Controls engaged in the \u201cextreme and outrageous conduct\u201d necessary to sustain a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. <em>Leca, </em>slip op. at 6-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment de novo. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Mazzola, </em>175 F.3d 255, 258 (2d Cir.1999). We conclude that Johnson Controls cannot be held liable for Leca\u2019s harassment at the hands of his coworkers because he has not submitted evidence sufficient to create an issue of material fact as to whether Johnson Controls \u201c \u2018either provided no reasonable avenue for complaint or knew of the harassment but did nothing about it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Distasio v. Perkin Elmer Corp., </em>157 F.3d 55, 63 (2d Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Murray v. N.Y. Univ. College of Dentistry, </em>57 F.3d 243, 249 (2d Cir.1995)). The record shows that Johnson Controls thoroughly investigated Leca\u2019s numerous complaints of harassment and that the overwhelming majority of those complaints contained no allegations of age- or national origin-based harassment. Leca\u2019s complaints that did contain such allegations were simply too few and far between to put Johnson Controls on notice that harassment based on discriminatory animus may have been occurring. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Leca\u2019s hostile work environment harassment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">With respect to Leca\u2019s retaliation claim, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment since Leca has not submitted evidence sufficient to create an issue of material fact as to whether a casual connection existed between his protected activity and the adverse employment actions to which he was subjected. <em>See Johnson v. Palma, </em>931 F.2d 203, 207 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Finally, with respect to Leca\u2019s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment. Leca\u2019s submissions do not raise an issue of fact as to whether Johnson Controls\u2019s actions were sufficiently extreme or outrageous to constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress. <em>See Howell v. N.Y. Post Co., </em>81 N.Y.2d 115, 121, 596 N.Y.S.2d 350, 612 N.E.2d 699 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
