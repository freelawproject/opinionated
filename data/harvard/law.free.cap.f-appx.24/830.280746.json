We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Lough contends that the district court erred when it found that his prior Oregon conviction for unlawful possession of a machine gun was a crime of violence for purposes of determining his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3). We review de novo, <em>see United States v. Huffhines, </em>967 F.2d 314, 320 (9th Cir.1992), and determine that the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">Lough\u2019s prior conviction was for the unlawful possession of an unregistered machine gun in violation of Ore.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 166.272. We have previously concluded, however, that possession of a firearm required to be registered under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845 is a crime of violence. <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>946 F.2d 615, 620-21 (9th Cir.1991) (concluding that the possession of an unregistered firearm of the kind defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845 is categorically a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d). As machine guns are specifically listed in section 5845\u2019s definition of firearms, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a)(6), the district court properly determined the base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">Lough also contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional, and therefore, the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the section 922(g)(1) counts and in failing to require that the jury find sufficient evidence of an interstate commerce connection. As Lough concedes, however, the argument that Congress exceeded its Commerce Clause power in enacting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Davis, </em>242 F.3d 1162, 1163 (9th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 178, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b857-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
