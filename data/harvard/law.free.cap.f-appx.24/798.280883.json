(Appellants) appeal the district court\u2019s denial of AL-OR\u2019s motion for an order to show cause why Appellee Reller, Inc. (Reller) should not be held in contempt for violation of a permanent injunction. The district court found that Reller did not violate the terms of the permanent injunction because the jewelry in question was neither a \u201ccolorable imitation of\u2019 nor \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to Appellants\u2019 trademark, and therefore denied Appellants\u2019 motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-17\">Appellants were granted a trademark (the Trademark) on February 27, 1990, which consisted of a \u201cmetallic nautical rope design as an integral feature of ... clocks, watches, and jewelry; namely, key rings, rings, bracelets, earrings, necklaces, pendants, and cufflinks, all made of precious metal.\u201d Appellants brought a successful trademark infringement and unfair competition suit against Reller which resulted in the issuance of an injunction permanently enjoining Reller from manufacturing infringing goods. Reller subsequently developed new fines of cable jewelry named \u201cNew Twist\u201d and \u201cGold Wave.\u201d Appellants filed a motion with the district court alleging that these new lines of cable jewelry contained the Trademark in violation of the permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-18\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of Appellants\u2019 motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Vertex Distributing, Inc. v. Falcon Foam Plastics, Inc., </em>689 F.2d 885, 889 (9th Cir.1982). \u2018When enforcing injunctions that enjoin the use of any mark confusingly similar to the protected mark, courts should not adjudicate issues such as product proximity but should simply evaluate whether or not the new mark is confusingly similar to the protected mark.\u201d <em>Wolfard Glassblowing Co. v. Vanbragt, </em>118 F.3d 1320, 1322 (9th Cir.1997). Further, under the terms of the permanent injunction, the district court was required to determine whether the new designs were \u201ccolorable imitations of\u2019 or \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the Trademark. A \u201ccolorable imitation\u201d itself is a product that is likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>to cause confusion. <em>See id. </em>at 1323. Thus, the central focus of the district court\u2019s inquiry was whether confusing similarity existed between the designs.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">A comparison of the jewelry exemplars in this case shows that Judge Collins did not clearly err or abuse her discretion in concluding that Reller\u2019s new line of jewelry was neither a \u201ccolorable imitation of\u2019 nor \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the protected mark. While the Trademark has a smooth surface and resembles a single strand of rope, Reller\u2019s \u201cNew Twist\u201d and \u201cGold Wave\u201d designs at issue here more closely resemble several small strands of barbed wire twisted around each other, with \u201cnegative space\u201d between each of the strands. The district court did not err in finding that there was no confusing similarity between these designs.
