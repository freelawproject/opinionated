See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b765-26\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-27\">Defendant-Appellant Vili Ava appeals his convictions on three counts of defrauding a bank in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-28\">Although he did not object at trial, on appeal Ava objects to four categories of evidence: (1) testimony regarding the $8,400 he \u201cborrowed\u201d from Mauai\u2019s account; (2) his evasive answers and shifting explanations when confronted by investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>tors; (3) a copy of Mauai\u2019s passbook and testimony that Ava had made all the entries in it, many of which did not balance; and (4) testimony that somehow Mauai\u2019s address had been changed in the bank\u2019s records to an address from which mail was returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Contrary to Ava\u2019s contention, none of this evidence was \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. Thus, Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) does not bar its admission. This evidence concerns acts inextricably intertwined with acts properly at issue during the trial. <em>United States v. King, </em>200 F.3d 1207, 1215 (9th Cir.1999). The events regarding the $8,400 occurred prior to the third loan. It is logical to infer that Ava obtained the third loan, without Mauai\u2019s knowledge, so that he could both pay off the prior loan and give Mauai some money in order to make it appear that he was making good on his promise to pay back the $8,400. The false passbook entries and the changed address in the bank\u2019s computer system were a way for Ava to cover his tracks and lull Mauai so that Mauai would not realize Ava was taking advantage of Mauai through the loans. Further, testimony regarding Ava\u2019s changing stories to the bank investigators and the FBI agent also was admissible as inextricably intertwined and to prove his consciousness of guilt. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Jiminez, </em>967 F.2d 1321, 1327-28 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Thus, the challenged evidence was admissible, and its admission certainly did not constitute plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (holding that reviewing courts are required to reverse for plain error only when \u201c \u2018a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)); <em>United States v. Turman, </em>122 F.3d 1167, 1170 (9th Cir.1997) (describing plain error as \u201cerror that is so clear-cut, so obvious, a competent district judge should be able to avoid it without benefit of objection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Given our determination that the evidence was admissible, Ava\u2019s claims of (1) ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to object to admission of the evidence and (2) prosecutorial misconduct based on government counsel\u2019s introduction of the evidence and reference to it in closing argument also necessarily fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b765-30\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
