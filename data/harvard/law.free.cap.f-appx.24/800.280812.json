Because the facts are familiar to the parties, we recount them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-23\">Fimbres asserts that this court should reverse his conviction because the deportation underlying his conviction violated his right to due process. Fimbres argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>the due process violation occurred because the Immigration Judge who ordered Fimbres\u2019 deportation failed adequately to inform him of the availability of a waiver of deportation available under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). Although our precedent recognizes the viability of such a collateral attack, this precedent makes equally clear that in order for this claim to succeed a defendant must show that the due process violation caused him prejudice. <em>United States v. Muro-Inclan, </em>249 F.3d 1180, 1182 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">In order to show prejudice, the defendant must demonstrate that he had a \u201cplausible ground\u201d for relief under \u00a7 1182(h) at the time of the underlying deportation proceeding. <em>Id. </em>Part of this showing includes a demonstration that the defendant\u2019s deportation arguably would impose an extreme hardship on his citizen family members. Fimbres asserts that he would have been eligible for a \u00a7 1182(h) waiver because his wife is a United States citizen. However, he made no showing whatever in the district court, nor did he argue before us, that his wife (or any other citizen relative upon whom a \u00a7 1182(h) waiver could be based) would have suffered hardship upon his deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Because Fimbres has failed to demonstrate a necessary element of his claim, we deny his appeal and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b826-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
