As the facts are known to the parties, we do not recite them here. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">After the April 23, 1996 effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), this court may grant a habeas petition on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only if that court\u2019s decision was contrary to or involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Under AEDPA, \u201cwe must reverse a state court\u2019s decision as involving an \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 of clearly established federal law when our independent review of the legal question does not merely allow us ultimately to conclude that the petitioner has the better of two reasonable legal arguments, but rather leaves us with a \u2018firm conviction\u2019 that one answer, the one rejected by the court, was correct and the other, the application of the federal law that the court adopted, was erroneous \u2014 in other words that clear error occurred.\u201d <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1153-54 (9th Cir. 2000) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-13\">Lee argues that the detectives\u2019 initial violation of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), rendered involuntary his subsequent Mirandized statements. The state court decision rejecting that argument was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1153-54 (9th Cir.2000). In <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 314, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985), the Supreme Court held that \u201cabsent deliberately coercive or improper tactics in obtaining the initial statement, the mere fact that a suspect has made an unwarned admission does not warrant a presumption of compulsion,\u201d and \u201c[a] subsequent administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings to a suspect who has given a voluntary but unwarned statement ordinarily should suffice to remove the conditions that precluded admission of the earlier statement.\u201d Thus, the detectives\u2019 initial violation of Lee\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights is not enough by itself to render involuntary his subsequent Mirandized statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-14\">Lee\u2019s alternative argument is that even if the intentional violation of <em>Miranda </em>alone is not enough to render inadmissible the later statements, this violation, when combined with other deliberately coercive tactics by the police, requires a finding of involuntariness and a suppression of both the Mirandized confession and the weapon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>that was the \u201cfruit\u201d of that confession. Again, the state court\u2019s application of relevant Supreme Court precedent was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">\u201c[Cjoercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntary\u2019 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986). In examining whether the police used coercive activity to undermine Lee\u2019s ability to exercise his free will, the state court properly examined \u201call the surrounding circumstances \u2014 both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.\u201d <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 226, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). The state court found that the police did make false representations, suggest self-defense story lines, and imply that the district attorney might be more lenient if Lee confessed to a lower level of culpability; but it found that other factors \u2014 most notably the relatively short duration of the interrogation and the understanding of interrogation techniques that Lee gained in his training at the police reserve academy \u2014 indicated that Lee\u2019s will ultimately was not overborne. The <em>pre-Miranda </em>conduct by the officers, though certainly giving some cause for concern, is not so strongly indicative of coercion as to render the state court\u2019s finding of voluntariness an \u201cunreasonable application of clearly established federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b727-15\"> jhjg disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
