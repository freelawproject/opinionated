The United States is the defendant under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2671 et. seq., because the clinic, as a recipient of federal funds, is an employee of the United States. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233. The United States appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment holding it liable because the clinic and the clinic\u2019s employees, in violation of clinic policy, failed to provide a chaperone to Avitia during her gynecological exam. The United States also challenges the failure of the district court to apportion damages. The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Because the alleged tort occurred in California, we apply California tort law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674. To determine California law, we look first to decisions of the state\u2019s highest court, <em>West v. AT &amp; T, </em>311 U.S. 223, 237-38, 61 S.Ct. 179, 85 L.Ed. 139 (1940), and then to \u201call available data,\u201d <em>Harbeson v. Parke Davis, Inc., </em>746 F.2d 517, 521 (9th Cir.1984) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of California tort law de novo. <em>Harbeson v. Parke Davis, Inc., </em>746 F.2d 517, 521 (9th Cir.1984). We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, <em>Sana v. Hawaiian Cruises, Ltd., </em>181 F.3d 1041, 1044 (9th Cir.1999), and a district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo, <em>Cigna Prop. and Cas. Ins. Co. v. Polaris Pictures Corp., </em>159 F.3d 412, 418 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The United States first argues that it cannot be held liable under a respondeat superior theory because the California Supreme Court, in <em>Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Mem\u2019l Hospital, </em>12 Cal.4th 291, 48 Cal.Rptr.2d 510, 907 P.2d 358 (1995), held that an employer cannot be held liable for an employee\u2019s intentional sexual misconduct as such conduct is not within the scope of employment. Whether an employee\u2019s act is within the scope of employment is a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>Meridian Int\u2019l Logistics, Inc. v. United States, </em>939 F.2d 740, 745 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">The United States misunderstands the application of <em>Lisa M. </em>to this case. <em>Lisa M. </em>held that a hospital was not liable for the intentional sexual assault of a patient by one of its technicians under a respondeat superior theory because the assault was not within the scope of the technician\u2019s employment. <em>Lisa M., </em>48 Cal.Rptr.2d 510, 907 P.2d at 364-66. It did not foreclose employer liability for an employee\u2019s intentional sexual misconduct based on other theories. Indeed, the court expressly affirmed that theories other than sexual misconduct are still available when it remanded the case so that the lower court could determine whether the hospital was independently negligent. <em>Id. </em>at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">Here, the district court found the clinic liable both for its own negligence and, under respondeat superior, for the negligence of Dr. Shohayeb and Medical Assistant Barbosa because Shohayeb and Barbosa failed to comply with the clinic\u2019s chaperone policy. Although the court found the clinic liable in part under respondeat superior, the tort underlying the respondeat superior theory was employee negligence, not an employee\u2019s intentional sexual assault. <em>Lisa M. </em>did not preclude an employer\u2019s liability under respondeat superior generally. It merely closed the door to respondeat superior liability for intentional sexual misconduct in certain circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 365 n. 7. Since the district court based the clinic\u2019s respondeat superior liability upon the failure of the clinic\u2019s employees to follow the chaperone policy, and not on Shohayeb\u2019s assault, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>predict that the California Supreme Court would hold that the district court\u2019s ruling is not contrary to <em>Lisa M.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The United States properly relies on <em>Maria D. v. Westec Residential Sec., Inc., 85 </em>Cal.App.4th 125, 102 Cal.Rptr.2d 326 (2000), to support its argument that Avitia should not be permitted to recover on a respondeat superior theory where the underlying tort was Shohayeb\u2019s failure to follow the chaperone policy. Under <em>Westec, </em>Shohayeb\u2019s negligent failure to follow the chaperone policy, if there was any, merged into the intentional assault. <em>Id. </em>at 342. The district court\u2019s ruling, however, was also based on the negligence both of the clinic and Barbosa. While the evidence relied on by the district court to support its determination that the clinic and Barbosa were both negligent may be scant, the United States has waived this argument because it failed to raise it in its opening brief. <em>Kim v. Kang, </em>154 F.3d 996, 1000 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Neither <em>Lisa M. </em>nor <em>Westec </em>forecloses liability-whether based on respondeat superior or another theory-when the negligent act on which liability is based is independent of an intentional sexual assault, even if the negligent act is in the chain of causation with the sexual assault. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s liability determination to the extent that it is based on the negligence of the clinic or Barbosa.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The United States next argues that the district court erred when it relied on the testimony of health care administrators rather than the testimony of a physician to establish the standard of care that was applicable to Shohayeb. Since we have already concluded that Shohayeb\u2019s negligent failure to follow the chaperone policy cannot support the district court\u2019s liability determination, there is no need to address this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The United States next argues that the clinic\u2019s negligence (or that of its employees) was not the cause-in-fact or the proximate cause of Avitia\u2019s injuries. We review questions of causation for clear error. <em>Vollendorff v. United States, </em>951 F.2d 215, 217 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">The district court found that the \u201clegal and proximate\u201d cause of Avitia\u2019s injury was the failure of the clinic and those it employed to follow the chaperone policy. To recover for negligence, Avitia must demonstrate that the complained-of conduct was the cause-in-fact (or \u201cbut for\u201d cause) as well as the proximate cause of her injury. The United States argues that the district court clearly erred when it held that the negligent acts, other than Shohayeb\u2019s intentional assault, were the cause-in-fact and proximate cause of Avitia\u2019s injuries. To prove cause-in-fact, Avitia must demonstrate that \u201cbut for\u201d the clinic\u2019s (and its employee\u2019s) failure to follow the chaperone policy, her injuries would not have happened. <em>Akins v. Sonoma County, </em>67 Cal.2d 185, 60 Cal.Rptr. 499, 430 P.2d 57, 65 (1967). Since Shohayeb\u2019s assault on Avitia would almost certainly not have happened if Barbosa was in the room at the time of the examination, the district court\u2019s finding of cause-in-fact here was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">The United States\u2019 more forceful argument is that the clinic\u2019s (and its employee\u2019s) failure to follow the chaperone policy is not the proximate cause of Avitia\u2019s injuries because Shohayeb\u2019s assault on Avitia was a superseding cause. A superseding, cause is an intervening act that relieves a negligent actor of liability. <em>Workman v. Howard Zink Corp., </em>97 Cal. App.2d 418, 218 P.2d 43, 47-48 (1950). An intervening act is a superseding cause if it is not foreseeable, or is highly unusual or extraordinary. <em>Schrimsher v. Bryson, 58 </em>Cal.App.3d 660, 130 Cal.Rptr. 125, 127 (1976). The chaperone policy at the clinic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>at the time the eomplained-of assault took place was put in place in part to ensure patient safety. It is no stretch of imagination that such safety concerns would include the prevention of the kind of inappropriate conduct complained of here. If the policy was put in place to prevent such conduct, the assault was foreseeable and Shohayeb\u2019s intentional conduct did not supersede the negligent acts of the clinic and Barbosa.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The United States quotes the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lisa M. </em>as having held that intentional sexual misconduct like Shohayeb\u2019s is not reasonably foreseeable as a matter of law. That is not the holding of <em>Lisa M. </em>In <em>Lisa M. </em>the court limited its foreseeability analysis to respondeat superior cases, 48 Cal.Rptr.2d 510, 907 P.2d at 364, and declined to hold that \u201csexual misconduct is per se unforeseeable in the workplace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363. In this context, we predict that the California Supreme Court would find that Shohayeb\u2019s conduct was foreseeable. Consequently, the district court\u2019s causation decision was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Finally, the United States contends that the district court should have apportioned fault. A district court\u2019s apportionment of fault is a factual determination which we will reverse only if clearly erroneous. <em>Halek v. United States, </em>178 F.3d 481, 485-86 (7th Cir.1999), <em>Knotts v. United States, </em>893 F.2d 758, 762 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The district court awarded $210,000 in non-economie damages to Avitia and her husband and stated that \u201c[t]o the extent that apportionment is appropriate and if it were indeed a requirement, I would find that the entire liability of this award and the entire cause of damage is born by the United States.\u201d The United States correctly contends that the district court should have apportioned the damages among the joint tortfeasors including, most importantly, Shohayeb for his intentional sexual misconduct. Section 1431.2 of the California Civil Code limits a defendant\u2019s liability for non-economie damages in a personal injury case to \u201cthat defendant\u2019s percentage of fault.\u201d Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1431.2 (2001). Here, Shohayeb\u2019s intentional misconduct was an important cause of Avitia\u2019s injury. <em>Weidenfeller v. Star &amp; Garter, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 1, 2 Cal.Rptr.2d 14, 16 (1991). The district court clearly erred when it disregarded his conduct as a contributing factor. We vacate the award of damages and remand this case for an apportionment of fault consistent with the reasoning in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b798-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
