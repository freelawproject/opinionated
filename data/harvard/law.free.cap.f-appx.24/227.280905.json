We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. The district court properly denied the adjustment based on Hernandez Dominguez\u2019s attempted escape from the jail where he was held prior to his conviction, his forceful restraint of a correctional officer during the escape attempt, and his less than forthcoming discussion of his role in the offense. USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (nn.l, 3, 4); <em>United States v. Melton, </em>970 F.2d 1328, 1335-36 (4th Cir.1992). Accordingly, we affirm Hernandez Dominguez\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
