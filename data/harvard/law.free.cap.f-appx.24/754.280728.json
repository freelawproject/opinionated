Barcume alleged that David and Melinda Bowles reneged on three agreements concerning the purchase and lease of real property. He obtained a default judgment against the Bowleses, which the district court later vacated pursuant to Fed.R.CivJP. 60(b)(1) (\u201cRule 60(b)(1)\u201d) and 60(b)(4). The district court then issued an order to show cause asking Barcume to explain why the case should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The court ultimately dismissed the action, concluding that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction because Barcume did not satisfy 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)\u2019s amount in controversy requirement. Barcume now appeals the district court\u2019s orders vacating the default judgment and dismissing the action against the Bowleses.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm the order vacating the default judgment, but reverse the order dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">I. Order Vacating the Default Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"ANs\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to vacate a judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1) for an abuse of discretion. <em>TCI Group Life Ins. Plan v. Knoebber, </em>244 F.3d 691, 695 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Barcume argues that the district court abused its discretion by finding that the Bowleses committed \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d sufficient to justify vacating the default judgment under Rule 60(b)(1). He contends that the district court did not properly apply the test for \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d set forth in <em>Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership., </em>507 U.S. 380, 395, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993) (dealing with \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding). <em>See Briones v. Riviera Hotel &amp; Casino, </em>116 F.3d 379, 381 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201c[T]he equitable test set out in <em>Pioneer </em>applies to Rule 60(b) as well.\u201d). He also argues that the district court\u2019s finding was contrary to the material facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">We disagree. The district court expressly applied the equitable test set forth in <em>Pioneer </em>and <em>Briones, </em>and took into account \u201call relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Pioneer, </em>507 U.S. at 395, 113 S.Ct. 1489. Moreover, the district court\u2019s finding that there was \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d is supported by the record. As the district court noted, it is unclear if Barcume properly served the Bowleses. In addition, it appears that the Bowleses had a meritorious defense to Barcume\u2019s claims. Finally, there is evidence that the Bowleses failed to appear telephonically at the hearing on the motion for default judgment because they misunderstood the time difference between Hawaii and California. The district court\u2019s conclusion that there was \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d under Rule 60(b)(1) did not constitute an abuse of discretion, and we affirm its order vacating the default judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">II. Order Dismissing the Action</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">We review a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>Budget Rent-A-Car, Inc. v. Higashiguchi, </em>109 F.3d 1471, 1473 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-14\">The district court decided that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)\u2019s amount in controversy requirement was not met.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although Barcume alleged claims in excess of $75,000 in his complaint, the district court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>his subsequent decision to ask for a default judgment based on just one of the claims brought the amount in controversy below the jurisdictional minimum and divested the court of subject matter jurisdiction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">It is well-settled that a claim in excess of the requisite amount in controversy, made in good faith in the complaint, satisfies the jurisdictional requirement. <em>St Paul Mercury Indem. Co. v. Red Cab Co., </em>303 U.S. 283, 288-90, 58 S.Ct. 586, 82 L.Ed. 845 (1938); <em>Crum v. Circus Circus Enters., </em>231 F.3d 1129, 1131 (9th Cir.2000). Events \u201coccurring subsequent to the institution of suit which reduce the amount recoverable below the statutory limit do not oust jurisdiction.\u201d <em>St. Paul, </em>303 U.S. at 289-90, 58 S.Ct. 586. <em>See also Hill v. Blind Indus. &amp; Servs. of Maryland, </em>179 F.3d 754, 757 (9th Cir.1999); <em>Northeast Clackamas County Elec. Co-op. v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>221 F.2d 329, 332 (9th Cir.1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">In his complaint, Barcume alleged claims against the Bowleses' in excess of $75,000. Since the existence or nonexistence of the required amount in controversy is determined as of the time the complaint was filed, the jurisdictional minimum is satisfied. Moreover, under <em>St. Paul, </em>Bareume\u2019s later decision to pursue a single claim for less than $75,000 did not divest the district court of jurisdiction. We, therefore, reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.
