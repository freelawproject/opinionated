The district court dismissed Flowers\u2019 second petition after concluding that it did not rely on \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A) (1994 &amp; Supp. IV1998). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-24\">On August 26,1997, we granted Flowers leave to file a second habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). The second petition alleged a violation of Flow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ers\u2019 constitutional rights under <em>Riggins v. Nevada, </em>504 U.S. 127, 112 S.Ct. 1810, 118 L.Ed.2d 479 (1992). The Supreme Court decided <em>Riggins </em>in 1992, several years after the denial of Flowers\u2019s first habeas petition. <em>Riggins </em>holds that the forced administration of anti-psychotic drugs to a defendant during trial \u2014 without a determination by the court of overriding justification and medical appropriateness \u2014 is a violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>Id. </em>at 135-38, 112 S.Ct. 1810. Relying on <em>Riggins, </em>Flowers argues in his second petition that the state violated his constitutional rights by forcibly medicating him with anti-psychotic drugs during his trial without first obtaining a ruling by the court of overriding justification and medical appropriateness.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Flowers asks this court to find that he is entitled to have the district court consider the merits of his second habeas petition alleging a <em>Riggins </em>violation as it constitutes a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review. Since nothing in the <em>Riggins </em>opinion expressly makes the holding retroactive, petitioner asks this court to decide that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A) codifies the Supreme Court\u2019s approach to retroactivity announced in <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Petitioner\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Tyler v. Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 2438, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001). In <em>Tyler, </em>the Court held that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A) did not incorporate the <em>Teague </em>standard but that in order for a new rule of constitutional law to be made retroactive to cases on collateral review, the Supreme Court must expressly hold it to apply retroactively. 533 U.S. at-- -, 121 S.Ct. at 2483-2484.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Therefore, the opinion of the district court dismissing Flowers\u2019 habeas petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-25\">.
