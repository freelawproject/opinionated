Because Tavel failed to assert in his complaint that he ever filed a written SSI application, the district court correctly dismissed the complaint. Pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u2022\u00a7\u00a7 416.305 and 416.202(g), an individual is not eligible for SSI unless he or she first files an application. Tavel\u2019s 1994 oral inquiry does not constitute such an application. <em>See Crane v. Shalala, </em>76 F.3d 251, 255 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cWhile a Title II application is considered as an oral inquiry into Title XVI benefits, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.350, to obtain them a claimant must actually file an application, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.305 &amp; .310.\u201d). Tavel thus neglected to plead an essential element of his cause of action and his complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-20\">On appeal, Tavel asks that we amend his pleadings to include the assertion that he filed a written application in 1997, a fact he alleged first in his memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss. Tavel did not ask the district court for leave to amend his complaint, and the district court did not abuse its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>by not doing so <em>sua sponte. In re Am. Express Co. S\u2019holder Litig., </em>39 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.1994); <em>Pani v. Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, </em>152 F.3d 67, 76 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Tavel also argues that the court improperly converted the Rule 12(b)(6) motion into one for summary judgment by considering material outside the pleadings. This assertion is meritless. After explaining why the case must be dismissed for failure to state a claim, the district court, in dicta, discussed matters in the affidavits submitted by both parties because it thought that the existence of an alleged 1997 application \u201cis the nub of the dispute between the parties.\u201d This section of the opinion, however, did not affect the district court\u2019s decision, which was limited to the complaint before it. <em>See Amaker v. Weiner, </em>179 F.Sd 48, 50 (2d Cir.1999) (\u201c[Reversal for lack of conversion is not required unless there is reason to believe that the extrinsic evidence actually affected the district court\u2019s decision and thus was not at least implicitly excluded.\u201d). We express no view as to the viability of any claim based on any such filed written application.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">We have considered all of Tavel\u2019s contentions that are properly before us and have found them all to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
