Ramos-Lara asserts three claims of error. First, he contends the admission of evidence on cross examination concerning his prior deportation violated Federal Rules of Evidence 402 and 404\u00ae). Second, Ramos-Lara alleges that the district court erred in denying his motion for mistrial after the prosecutor\u2019s cross examination implied the existence of prejudicial facts unsupported by evidence. Third, Ramos-Lara asserts that the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct during closing argument by arguing facts not in evidence and appealing improperly to the jury\u2019s sympathy. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">The district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings during trial are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Fuchs, </em>218 F.3d 957, 964 (9th Cir.2000). We apply this same deferential standard to the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct. <em>See United States v. Scholl, </em>166 F.3d 964, 974 (9th Cir.1999). \u201cWhere defense counsel objected to acts of alleged prosecutorial misconduct at trial, we review for harmless error.\u201d <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>201 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">Ramos-Lara\u2019s testimony about his prior deportation during cross-examination was arguably relevant on two grounds: first, as evidence that Ramos-Lara smuggled, rather than accompanied, the Abundiz family across the Mexico-United States border; and second, to impeach his testimony on direct examination. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion to admit this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-14\">Likewise, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ramos-Lara\u2019s motion for mistrial. Even if the prosecutor\u2019s question during cross-examination was prejudicial, the error was harmless in light of the other \u201csubstantial, independent and credible evidence\u201d of Ramos-Lara\u2019s guilt. <em>Scholl, </em>166 F.3d at 974. The presence of such overwhelming evidence also renders the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks during closing argument harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-15\">In sum, Ramos-Lara\u2019s appeal presents no grounds for a finding of reversible error. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b731-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
