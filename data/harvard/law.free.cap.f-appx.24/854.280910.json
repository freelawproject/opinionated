RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">Appellant Alvin D. Esnault Jr., a state prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his second amended complaint as frivolous. Mr. Esnault filed an amended \u00a7 1983 complaint seeking unspecified injunctive and declaratory relief for Defendants\u2019 failure to provide him with interferon or ribavirin shots after he was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 1993. On April 6, 2001, the district court directed Mr. Esnault to file a second amended complaint specifying each Defendant\u2019s personal participation in the acts that allegedly violated Mr. Esnault\u2019s Eighth Amendment rights. On May 10, 2001, Mr. Esnault filed a second amended complaint. On May 23, 2001, the district court dismissed Mr. Esnault\u2019s second amended complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) as legally frivolous for failure to allege sufficient facts which would demonstrate Defendants\u2019 personal participation in the alleged constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">The district court granted Mr. Esnault leave to proceed pursuant to the federal in forma pauperis statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. Section 1915(e)(2)(B) authorizes a district court to dismiss an action if it is frivolous. A claim is legally frivolous when the plaintiff asserts a violation of a legal interest that does not exist or when the plaintiff asserts facts that do not support a claim. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 324,109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). A careful review of Mr. Esnault\u2019s second amended complaint fails to demonstrate sufficient facts showing how each individual defendant participated in the alleged violation of Mr. Esnault\u2019s constitutional rights. As the district court correctly stated, showing that each defendant\u2019s personal participation caused the deprivation of a federal right is essential to a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 166, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number><em>Bennett v. Passic, </em>545 F.2d 1260, 1262-63 (10th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">We have carefully reviewed Mr. Esnault\u2019s second amended complaint and the record. For substantially the same reasons underlying the district court\u2019s May 23, 2001 Order, we affirm the dismissal of Mr. Esnault\u2019s complaint as legally frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Appellant\u2019s motion to proceed without prepayment of the filing fee is granted. We remind Appellant that because his motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal was granted, he must continue making partial payments on court fees and costs previously assessed until such have been paid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b881-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
