The case has been referred to this panel pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. We unanimously agree that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-23\">In a complaint signed on January 18, 2000, and filed in the district court on January.24, 2000, Aldridge claimed that the defendants violated his civil rights while he was imprisoned at the McCracken County Regional Jail. The magistrate judge found that Aldridge was transferred out of the McCracken facility and to a different prison on January 29, 1999. The magistrate judge \u2014 applying Kentucky\u2019s one-year statute of limitations \u2014 concluded that Aldridge\u2019s suit was timely filed only as to claims that accrued at the McCraken facility between January 24 and January 29,1999. The magistrate judge went on to conclude that the two claims that may have occurred within this period actually accrued at a date earlier than January 24, 1999, and that the entire suit should therefore be dismissed as untimely. Over Aldridge\u2019s timely objections, the district court adopted the finding of the magistrate judge and dismissed the suit as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-24\">We vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case for reconsidera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>tion in the light of <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 267, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988) and <em>Brown v. Morgan, </em>209 F.3d 595, 596 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The \u201cmailbox rule\u201d of <em>Houston v. Lack </em>applies to the filing of \u00a7 1983 suits under the applicable, state statute of limitations. <em>See, e.g., Cooper v. Brookshire, </em>70 F.3d 377, 378 (5th Cir.1995) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Upon remand, the court should also determine whether our recent decision in <em>Broum, </em>209 F.3d at 596 (tolling the applicable statute of limitations during the time a prisoner exhausts administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997(e)), has an effect on the propriety of the dismissal as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
