The court found that, although some circumstances supported a finding that Anderson was a Washington citizen, the Normans had not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Anderson was a Washington citizen at the time the Normans filed their suit in 2000. In particular, the court found \u2014 after careful consideration of the evidence \u2014 that Anderson had moved to Missouri in 1998 with the intent to make it his permanent home; he thereafter sold his home in Washington; when his wife died, he decided that at some point in the future he would return to Washington; but despite this intent, he had not successfully changed his citizenship back to Washington. <em>See Yeldell v. Tutt, </em>913 F.2d 533, 537 (8th Cir.1990) (citizenship requires concurrence of individual\u2019s presence in state in question with intent to make home there indefinitely); <em>Rogers v. Bates, </em>431 F.2d 16, 18 (8th Cir. 1970) (law requires party\u2019s physical presence in state coupled with intent to make it his present home).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying its determination of citizenship. <em>See Sheehan v. Gustafson, </em>967 F.2d 1214, 1215 (8th Cir. 1992) (determination of citizenship is mixed question of law and fact, but mainly fact; district court\u2019s findings of fact underlying legal conclusion of citizenship are reviewed for clear error). We also reject, as unsupported by our cases, the Normans\u2019 contention that they were required in these circumstances to make only a prima facie showing of diversity.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-8\">.
