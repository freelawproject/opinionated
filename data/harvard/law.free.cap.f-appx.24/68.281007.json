The complaint seeks monetary damages. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, and the District Court granted the defendants\u2019 motions. The District Court held that the doctrine established by <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983) and <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923) (the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine) mandated that the action be dismissed for want of jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Specifically, the District Court found that adjudication of Mr. Stem\u2019s claims would require it to review and possibly modify or overrule decisions of the Kings County Family Court pertaining to the placement and custody of Mr. Stein\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">On appeal, Mr. Stein claims that as to the five-month period from May through October 1994, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine should not bar his claim for damages because during that period, he was not a party to the Family Court proceedings. Therefore, he argues, he did not have an opportunity to litigate his claim in a state proceeding, a prerequisite to the operation of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. Stein also raises, for the first time, an assertion that the defendants failed to provide him with a prompt post-deprivation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Federal district courts \u201cdo not have jurisdiction ... over challenges to state court decisions in particular cases arising out of judicial proceedings even if those challenges allege that the state court\u2019s action was unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 486; <em>see also Rooker, </em>263 U.S. at 415-16; <em>Hachamovitch v. DeBuono, </em>159 F.3d 687, 693 (2d Cir.1998). Adjudication of Mr. Stein\u2019s claims would require, at minimum, review of the Family Court order entered on November 3, 1993, that placed Mr. Stein\u2019s children with New York City\u2019s Commissioner for Social Services for one year. This order was issued while Mr. Stein was a party to the Family Court proceedings, and it encompasses the entire five-month period as to which, on this appeal, Mr. Stein claims the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine does not apply. Accordingly, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars jurisdiction over Mr. Stein\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">We need not entertain Mr. Stein\u2019s argument that the Defendants failed to provide him with a prompt post-deprivation hearing, because the argument was never raised in the District Court. However, even on its merits, the argument fails. Mr. Stein was not denied <em>any </em>opportunity to be heard; in fact, Mr. Stein was a party to and participated in the Family Court proceedings that resulted in the November 1993 order placing his children with the Commissioner for Social Services. Thus, <em>Tenenbaum v. Williams, </em>193 F.3d 581, 593-94 (2d Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1098, 120 S.Ct. 1832, 146 L.Ed.2d 776 (2000), in which the plaintiff parents received no hearing prior to the removal of their child, is inapposite. Mr. Stein essentially is arguing that he was entitled to an additional hearing. This amounts to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>challenge to the Family Court\u2019s handling of the case, and a finding in Mr. Stein\u2019s favor would necessitate some modification or possibly overruling of the orders entered by the Family Court. Thus, this ground for appeal, like Mr. Stein\u2019s first argument, runs afoul of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">For the reasons set forth, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
