The district court denied Gradeless\u2019 petition. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">On May 28, 2000, Gradeless, a state inmate in Indiana, went to his prison\u2019s Offender Service Building (OSB) to get ibuprofen for a broken finger. On his return to his dormitory from the OSB, Gradeless passed through the prison\u2019s outdoor recreational area. As Gradeless entered the dormitory, Sergeant Sheridan, a correctional officer, asked Gradeless where he had been. Gradeless explained that he had been at the OSB, but Sheridan wrote in a \u201cReport of Conduct\u201d that he had seen Gradeless \u201cout at rec[reation]\u201d when he was supposed to be in the dormitory.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Based on Sheridan\u2019s report, Gradeless was charged with \u201cbeing in an unauthorized area\u201d in violation of the prison\u2019s disciplinary code. Gradeless pleaded not guilty to the charge and attended a disciplinary hearing before the prison\u2019s Conduct Adjustment Board (CAB). At the hearing Gradeless explained that he passed through the recreation area on his path from the OSB. Gradeless also contends that at the hearing he requested the OSB\u2019s logbook on the assumption that it would prove he had been there. The record of the hearing, however, indicates no such request. Regardless, the OSB logbook was not presented at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">After hearing Gradeless\u2019 story and reviewing Sheridan\u2019s report, the CAB found Gradeless guilty of being in an unauthorized area. According to its written findings, the CAB credited Sheridan\u2019s report as \u201ctrue and factual.\u201d The CAB sanctioned Gradeless with a written reprimand and a revocation of 60 days of earned good-time.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Gradeless appealed the CAB\u2019s decision to prison superintendent John VanNatta, who affirmed it. While acknowledging that Gradeless had been at the OSB, VanNatta stated that Gradeless had violated prison rules by stopping at recreation on his return to his dormitory. Gradeless appealed to the final reviewing authority of the Indiana Department of Corrections, which also affirmed the CAB\u2019s decision. Gradeless then turned to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">On appeal Gradeless first contends that the CAB violated his due process rights by judging him guilty of a disciplinary infraction and depriving him of earned good-time without sufficient evidence. Indiana prisoners possess a liberty interest in earned good-time, which thus cannot be revoked without due process of law. <em>See McPherson v. McBride, </em>188 F.3d 784, 785 (7th Cir.1999). The process due in a prison discipline setting is: \u201c(1) advance written notice of the disciplinary charges; (2) an opportunity, when consistent with institutional safety and correctional goals, to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in [the prisoner\u2019s] defense; and (3) a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action.\u201d <em>Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). Furthermore the decision to revoke good-time credits need only be supported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d meaning that it should not be arbitrary. <em>Id. </em>at 455-56,105 S.Ct. 2768. Even a brief disciplinary report may provide sufficient evidence for the decision of a disciplinary board to survive a challenge. <em>See McPherson, </em>188 F.3d at 785-86. In this case a report by a correctional officer noted that Gradeless was \u201cout at recreation\u201d without authorization, providing \u201csome evidence\u201d of an infraction. Although Grade-less faults the CAB for relying on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>disciplinary report instead of his alternative explanation, it was not for the district court or for us now to question the CAB\u2019s decision to accept the correctional officer\u2019s version of the facts. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Gradeless also argues that the CAB denied him due process by refusing to give him access to the OSB\u2019s logbook to demonstrate that there was not enough time for him to linger at recreation between signing out of the OSB and entering his dormitory. Gradeless states that he requested the logbook at the hearing, although there is no record of his request. Even if Gradeless did request the logbook, however, his request was untimely. Inmates have a limited right to present documentary evidence at a disciplinary hearing, but a request for documents made during the hearing is too late to be timely. <em>See Miller v. Duckworth, </em>963 F.2d 1002, 1004 n. 2 (7th Cir.1992). The CAB therefore would have been justified in denying the request. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">We are not persuaded otherwise by Gradeless\u2019 contention that the prison\u2019s \u201cNotice of Disciplinary Hearing\u201d was deficient because it provided space to list expected witnesses but not to list requested documents. Gradeless argues that he therefore did not know that he should request the logbook before his hearing. But the notice did inform Gradeless of his right to present documentary evidence. He thus had enough information to make a timely request for the logbook, but did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
