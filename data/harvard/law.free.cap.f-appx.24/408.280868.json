The case has been referred to this panel pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. We unanimously agree that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-18\">A detailed recitation of the pertinent facts are set out in <em>Cardwell v. Kentucky, </em>12 S.W.3d 672 (Ky.2000), and need not be repeated here. The gist of the matter is that Cardwell was sentenced to a total of fifteen years of imprisonment, but the written judgment by the trial court in the ultimate sentencing proceeding led prison officials to believe the total sentence was a ten-year term. The trial court later corrected its error in an amended judgment, and Cardwell claims the amended judgment violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-19\">Nothing in the federal constitution prevents a state from ensuring that its records accurately reflect the disposition of criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-20\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for the reasons stated by that court in its memorandum opinion entered on May 29, 2001.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
