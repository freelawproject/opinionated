Jackson appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-16\">I. Background.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-17\">The University has employed Jackson as a building service worker since 1994. In May and June 1996, believing he had been the victim of race discrimination, Jackson complained to Dr. Margo Smith, the University\u2019s affirmative action officer, about several incidents relating to his employment. Jackson told Smith that his supervisor, a Caucasian named Norman Gagnon, gave him a written \u201crecord of counseling\u201d for poor performance without proper cause, used foul language toward him, and was intoxicated when he confronted Jackson about his performance. Smith gave Jackson an affirmative action complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>form and referred him to Gloria Carter, an African American woman who served as the Director of Personnel. Jackson told Carter that Gagnon had verbally harassed him while he, Gagnon, was intoxicated. Carter told Gagnon\u2019s supervisor, Richard Henry, to investigate Jackson\u2019s allegations. Henry thereafter told Gagnon about Jackson\u2019s complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Several days later, Gagnon asked Jackson to talk with him privately. Jackson and Gagnon relay different versions of what happened next. According to Jackson, Gagnon confronted him about his complaints and swore at him. Jackson said that, when he turned to leave, Gagnon grabbed his arm and \u201cPlaintiff swung to get his arm off,\u201d hitting Gagnon \u201csomewhere on his person.\u201d Jackson was arrested and charged with assault, but he claimed that the University police refused his request to file charges against Gagnon for grabbing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">According to Gagnon, Jackson left the room before Gagnon finished talking. Gagnon claimed that he followed Jackson, \u201cplucked his sleeve at the elbow,\u201d and that Jackson responded by hitting him in the face with a closed fist. Gagnon stated that Jackson started shouting threats, and that Gagnon then called the University\u2019s Public Safety Department and filed assault charges against Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The day after Jackson hit Gagnon, Carter placed Jackson on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Carter took charge of the investigation, and Jackson admitted to her that he had hit Gag-non. The University\u2019s Employee Disciplinary Management Program provides that employees who engage in fighting are subject to various disciplinary measures, including suspension and discharge. In August 1996 Carter notified Jackson that the University was seeking his discharge, and suspended him without pay pending the discharge proceedings. In responding to the University\u2019s summary judgment motion, Jackson contested the accuracy of the information Carter gathered during her investigation, but admitted that Carter suspended him because she believed that he had struck Gagnon in the face with a closed fist and threatened further bodily injury. Gagnon also was disciplined; he received a written reprimand for confronting Jackson and grabbing his arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">After he was suspended, Jackson filed a discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) and the Illinois Department of Human Rights (\u201cIDHR\u201d) claiming (1) that Gagnon issued Jackson a \u201cwritten warning\u201d for poor performance based on his race and not his performance, and (2) that Carter retaliated against Jackson for complaining about Gagnon when she placed him on administrative leave and, subsequently, suspended him. The IDHR dismissed Jackson\u2019s charge for lack of substantial evidence, and Jackson then filed this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The district court granted summary judgment in faVor of the University. The court analyzed Jackson\u2019s claims under the indirect, burden-shifting approach of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and decided that Jackson could not establish a prima facie case of discrimination because (1) he failed to meet the University\u2019s legitimate expectations when he struck Gagnon, and (2) he presented no evidence that similarly-situated employees were treated more favorably. In any event, the district court concluded, Jackson failed to present any evidence that the University\u2019s proffered reason for suspending him \u2014 that he struck his supervisor\u2014 was pretextual. As for Jackson\u2019s retaliation claim, the court concluded that Jackson failed to set forth a prima facie case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>because he could not show any causal nexus between his protected activities and his suspension. Our review is <em>de novo, </em>and we evaluate the evidence in the light most favorable to Jackson, drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. <em>Jordan v. Summers, </em>205 F.3d 337, 341 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">II. Analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">At the outset, we dispense with Jackson\u2019s arguments that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because he presented evidence that the University police discriminated and retaliated against him. The district court did not err in disregarding this evidence because it is outside the scope of Jackson\u2019s EEOC charge, which does not mention his arrest or the University police. <em>See Haugerud v. Amery Sch. Dist., </em>259 F.3d 678, 689 (7th Cir.2001). We thus limit our analysis to Jackson\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">A. Race Discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Jackson challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that he failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. To establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must show that (1) he was a member of a protected class, (2) he was meeting his employer\u2019s legitimate performance expectations, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) he was treated less favorably than similarly-situated employees outside of his protected class. <em>See Dunn v. Nordstrom, Inc., </em>260 F.3d 778, 784 (7th Cir.2001). The district court concluded that Jackson established the first and third prongs, but that he failed to present evidence that he met the University\u2019s legitimate expectations or that the University had treated similarly-situated employees more favorably.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">As for the University\u2019s legitimate expectations, Jackson argues that he did not fail to meet those expectations when he struck Gagnon because, Jackson asserts, he acted in self-defense. But Jackson does not dispute that the University legitimately expected that he would not engage in physical fighting. Thus, even if we accepted as true that Gagnon started the fight, Jackson could not prevail because he admits he violated the University\u2019s rules against fighting and that Carter suspended him for that reason. <em>See Johnson v. West, </em>218 F.3d 725, 733 (7th Cir.2000) (\u201c[W]e have no quarrel with the idea that an employer need not tolerate employees who go around resolving their problems with physical assaults.\u201d); <em>see also Contreras v. Suncast Corp., </em>237 F.3d 756, 761 n. 1 (7th Cir.2001) (it was \u201cirrelevant\u201d whether plaintiff said \u201clet\u2019s get the hell out of here\u201d rather than that supervisor was a \u201cmotherfucker\u201d where, either way, the \u201cwords evince an attitude of actual and perceived insubordination that factored into [the plaintiffs] dismissal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">As for the similarly-situated prong, Jackson maintains that he raised an issue of fact by presenting evidence that (1) he was disciplined for taking time off and Caucasian employees were not, and (2) the University treated Gagnon more leniently than Jackson for fighting. In disciplinary eases like this one, a plaintiff must show that he is similarly situated to persons outside the protected class with respect to performance, qualifications, and conduct. <em>Radue v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., </em>219 F.3d 612, 617-618 (7th Cir.2000). On appeal, Jackson identifies only one person he claims the University treated more leniently for taking time off: a Caucasian named David Schroeder, whom Jackson says was not written up for being absent when his mother died. But Schroeder is not comparable. The record shows that Jackson was disciplined for being absent without authorization or without a sufficient amount of accrued leave; Jackson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>presented no evidence that Schroeder or any other non-African American employee was absent under comparable circumstances. Neither is Gagnon comparable to Jackson because Gagnon\u2019s misconduct was qualitatively different than Jackson\u2019s; Gagnon grabbed Jackson\u2019s arm while Jackson struck Gagnon. Jackson presented no evidence of any non-African American employees who struck their supervisors and were treated by the University more leniently than Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Jackson cannot meet his burden at the prima facie stage and summary judgment as to his discrimination claim was appropriate for that reason. We note, however, that Jackson\u2019s admission that Carter suspended him because he struck Gagnon defeats his claim on the pretext issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">B. Retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">To establish a prima facie case of retaliation a plaintiff must show (1) that he engaged in protected activity, (2) that he subsequently suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that a causal nexus exists between the adverse action and the protected activity. <em>Oest v. Illinois Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>240 F.3d 605, 615-16 (7th Cir.2001). The district court concluded that Jackson established the first two prongs of his prima facie case, but that he failed to present any evidence of a causal nexus.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">On appeal Jackson contends that he presented sufficient evidence of a causal nexus between his protected activity\u2014 complaining to the University and to the EEOC \u2014 and his suspension because (1) Gagnon confronted him about his complaints and \u201cattacked\u201d him, and (2) the \u201cracial animus\u201d of Gagnon and two University police officers (one who arrested him for striking Gagnon and one who questioned him on another matter) influenced Carter\u2019s decision to suspend Jackson. Both arguments lack merit. Gagnon\u2019s conduct in confronting Jackson did not cause his suspension; Jackson admits that he was suspended because he struck Gag-non. Similarly, the record is devoid of evidence that Carter was influenced by the \u201cracial animus\u201d of Gagnon or the University police officers; Jackson does not contend that any of them made race-based comments to Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
