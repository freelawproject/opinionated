Jenkins seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 (West 1994 &amp; Supp.2001) petition. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Jenkins\u2019 notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-27\">Parties are accorded thirty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-28\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on July 10, 2001. Jenkins\u2019 notice of appeal was filed on August 21, 2001. Because Jenkins failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
