We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(5) for review of Petitioner\u2019s claim of citizenship and nationality arising under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a) (now repealed). We-have jurisdiction to determine whether Jayme: (1) is an alien who; (2) is removable because; (3) he was convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>See Matsuk v. INS, </em>247 F.3d 999, 1000-02 (9th Cir.2001). We review legal questions under the INA <em>de novo, </em>although the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>the statute is entitled to deference. <em>See Ladha v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 889, 896 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Jayme concedes that he was convicted for battery with a deadly weapon, for which a sentence of 96 months was imposed. Thus, he is an aggravated felon removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) if he is an alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Jayme also concedes that he does not meet the statutory conditions for citizenship provided in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a), but argues that \u00a7 1432(a)(3) violates his right to equal protection under the United States Constitution. Specifically, he argues that because he was born out of wedlock, \u00a7 1432(a)(3) discriminates against him on the basis of gender because he can only enjoy derivative citizenship through his naturalized father if his parents were married and legally separated and his father had legal custody. Otherwise, he can only become a citizen through his mother if she were to become a citizen and his paternity has not been established. To the extent that Jayme purports to challenge \u00a7 1432(a)(3) on the ground that it discriminates based on gender, he lacks third-party standing to do so. His father is the person allegedly accorded differential treatment on the basis of gender, but there is no obstacle to his father\u2019s bringing suit himself. <em>Powers v. Ohio, </em>499 U.S. 400, 411, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991) (some hindrance required to third party\u2019s ability to protect own interests). However, to the extent that Jayme challenges the statute in his own right, his claim cannot be based on gender discrimination because the statute makes no classification based on the child\u2019s gender. Therefore, this claim is subject to rational basis scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Under rational basis scrutiny, a statute may be upheld based on generalized classifications unsupported by empirical evidence. <em>See Heller v. Doe, </em>509 U.S. 312, 320, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993) (\u201c[A] classification must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification ____\u201d). It is rational that Congress, in delineating the conditions for acquiring citizenship, would adopt the general principle that the naturalization of both parents was necessary to transmit citizenship to a child. It is also rational that Congress would enact exceptions to this general rule in situations where only one parent is legally responsible for the child, to avoid hardship and preserve the unity of a single-parent family. As one of these limited exceptions, \u00a7 1432(a)(3), which permits an unwed mother to transmit citizenship to her non-legitimated child, is constitutionally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">Because Jayme is an alien \u2014 not a citizen \u2014 we lack jurisdiction to review his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-14\"> This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
