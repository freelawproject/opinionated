Schwarzer, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Appellant Robert Sangster (Sangster) appeals a judgment by the district court granting summary judgment to Sverdrup Civil, Inc. (Sverdrup) in a diversity action. Sangster alleged that when Sverdrup transferred him out of a San Diego project after concluding he had committed sexual harassment, the company violated the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (\u201cFEHA\u201d), breached an implied-in-fact contract not to terminate without good cause, and breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Sangster was transferred without loss of salary or benefits. It is unclear from the record what damages Sangster claims he suffered because he did not submit his original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. A grant of a motion for summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Delta Savings Bank v. United States, </em>265 F.3d 1017, 1021 (9th Cir.2001). We hold that the district court did not err in granting Sverdrup\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">The basic facts have already been set forth by both parties in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Summary judgment was proper as to Sangster\u2019s FEHA claim because Sangster offers no evidence that Sverdrup discriminated against him on the basis of gender. He must establish a prima facie case raising a presumption of discrimination. <em>Soda v. Robert F. Kennedy Med. Ctr., </em>56 Cal.App.4th 138, 148-50, 65 Cal. Rptr.2d 112 (1997). However, Sangster does not point to any female employee at Sverdrup who committed sexual harassment and was treated more favorably.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">Summary judgment was also proper as to Sangster\u2019s implied contract and implied covenant claims because he could not establish that an implied agreement existed specifying a fixed term of employment or allowing terminations and transfers only for good cause. \u201cLong and successful service standing alone cannot demonstrate an implied-in-fact contract right not to be terminated at will.\u201d <em>Guz v. Bechtel National Inc., </em>24 Cal.4th 317, 343, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000). An implied contract of employment may arise from a combination of factors, including (1) longevity of service; (2) oral and written assurances of stable and continuous employment, including commendations and promotions; and (3) an employer\u2019s personnel practices and policies. <em>Caterpillar, Inc. v. Williams, </em>482 U.S. 386, 389 n. 2, 107 S.Ct. 2425, 96 L.Ed.2d 318 (1987). Although Sangster worked for Sverdrup for over 9 years, he could not show any oral or written assurances of continued employment made by any Sverdrup representative. He was never promoted, received a poor performance review in 1992, and the San Diego project staffing forecast charts he relied so heavily upon were only internal company documents used to project staffing costs. Sangster also does not show an unwritten company-wide policy of transferring or terminating employees only for good cause. The excerpt of Roger Woodhull\u2019s deposition testimony he quotes was actually Woodhull\u2019s uncertain response to a question regarding his knowledge of Sverdrup\u2019s <em>written </em>employment policies. Sangster was an at-will employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">Finally, because we conclude that no implied-in-fact contract existed between Sangster and Sverdrup, \u201cit necessarily follows he cannot state a cause of action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d <em>Gould v. Md. Sound Indus., Inc., </em>31 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1152, 37 Cal.Rptr.2d 718 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b793-10\">.
