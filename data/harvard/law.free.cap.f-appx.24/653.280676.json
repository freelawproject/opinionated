After the denial of his appeal and post-conviction motions, <em>see State v. Simmons, </em>865 S.W.2d 893 (Mo.Ct.App.1993), he filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>alleging, among other things, that appellate counsel was ineffective for not arguing that the state had violated Missouri\u2019s speedy trial statute. <em>See </em>Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 217.450, 217.460 (2000). The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied the petition, and we granted a certificate of appealability on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">After careful review of the record, we conclude that Simmons\u2019 appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the speedy trial issue because the argument lacks merit. <em>See Grubbs v. Delo, </em>948 F.2d 1459, 1464 (8th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 835, 113 S.Ct. 109, 121 L.Ed.2d 67 (1992); <em>State v. Allen, </em>954 S.W.2d 414, 417 &amp; n. 2 (Mo.Ct.App.1997). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court and deny Simmons\u2019 pending motion as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-15\">. The Honorable Charles A. Shaw, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Frederick R. Buckles, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
