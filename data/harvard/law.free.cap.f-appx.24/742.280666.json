We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">\n<em>1. The Prosecutor\u2019s Rebuttal Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">Whitney contends that reference in the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument to Whitney\u2019s failure to provide an adequate alibi as evidence of his involvement in the crime violated his right to remain silent during trial. Because Whitney\u2019s attorney did not object at trial to the prosecution\u2019s closing argument, a \u201cplain error\u201d standard of review applies. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>84 F.3d 1206,1211 (9th Cir.1996) (applying plain error standard when defendant failed to object to closing argument). Plain error is \u201c \u2018highly prejudicial error affecting substantial rights, and is found only in exceptional circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Williams, </em>990 F.2d 507, 510, 511 (9th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">We find no plain error here. The prosecutor\u2019s statements highlighted Whitney\u2019s failure to counter the inculpatory testimony of the government\u2019s witnesses. They did not rise to the level of comments on his failure to testify. <em>United States v. Mende, </em>43 F.3d 1298, 1301 (9th Cir.1995) (a prosecutor \u201cmay properly comment upon the defendant\u2019s failure to present exculpatory evidence, as long as it is not phrased to call attention to defendant\u2019s own failure to testify\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">\n<em>2. Sufficiency of the Evidence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b769-17\">Whitney\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction also lacks merit. He argues that the government failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt because the government\u2019s witnesses did not sufficiently link him to the crime. The evidence was sufficient to support his conviction if, \u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Ginn, </em>87 F.3d 367, 369 (9th Cir.1996) (emphasis omitted) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-18\">We have reviewed the record and find ample evidence to support Whitney\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>victions. Co-conspirator Brown testified to Whitney\u2019s participation in the planning and execution of the bank robbery. Mulqueen\u2019s eyewitness account of the appearance and actions of the driver of the bank robbers\u2019 car matches Whitney\u2019s appearance and Brown\u2019s account of Whitney\u2019s actions. Dannheim\u2019s testimony about Whitney\u2019s behavior before and after the robbery, and the letters Whitney sent to Dannheim seeking her cooperation in establishing a false alibi, are consistent with his participation in the crime. When viewed in the light most favorable to the government, this evidence was sufficient for the jury to have found the essential elements of each of the offenses at issue beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b769-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
