Jackson sued Wal-Mart under the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act, S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 41-10-10 to 41-10-110 (Law.Co Op.Supp.2000), alleging that Wal Mart made excessive deductions from his wages for insurance premiums.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> WalMart removed the action based on federal question jurisdiction under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001). The district court denied Jackson\u2019s motion to remand, granted Wal-Mart\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and denied Jackson\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment. Jackson timely appealed. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">ERISA supersedes any and all state laws insofar as they relate to any employee benefit plan covered by ERISA. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1144(a). A state law relates to an ERISA plan \u201cif it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u201d <em>See Griggs v. E.I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>287 F.3d 371, 377 (4th Cir.2001) (finding a state law of general application, with only an indirect effect on a pension plan, may relate to that plan for preemption purposes). ERISA\u2019s preemption provisions are broadly construed. <em>See FMC Corp. v. Holliday, </em>498 U.S. 52, 58, 111 S.Ct. 403, 112 L.Ed.2d 356 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">The district court observed that Jackson\u2019s action was tantamount to an action seeking return of contributions made under the terms of the plan and for restitution of any overpayments under 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1132(a)(3)(B). Because Jackson\u2019s claim entails an inquiry into the terms and administration of the employee benefits plan to determine whether WalMart deducted unauthorized amounts from Jackson\u2019s wages, Jackson\u2019s claim relates to the employee benefit plan. Therefore, we find that the district court correctly found that ERISA preempted the application of the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">We review the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact, given the parties\u2019 burdens of proof at trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>56(c); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-49, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In determining whether the moving party has shown that there is no genuine issue of material fact, a court must assess the factual evidence and all inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505; <em>Smith v. Virginia Commonwealth Univ., </em>84 F.3d 672, 675 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Jackson claims that the plan administrator directed excessive deductions from his wages for insurance premiums. Wal Mart supported its motion for summary judgment with documentation evidencing that an erroneous social security number provided by Jackson when he transferred to a new store caused WalMart to miscalculate Jackson\u2019s payroll deducted insurance premiums. After Jackson terminated his coverage, the plan administrator conducted an audit that reconciled the amount of premiums owed and appropriate deductions. Jackson failed to produce countervailing evidence to support his conclusory assertions that the reconciliation was incorrect, thus failing to stave off Wal-Mart\u2019s properly supported motion for summary judgment. Consequently, we find that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Wal-Mart and in denying Jackson\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We affirm the district court\u2019s order granting Wal-Mart\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b159-10\"> Jackson also sued Mutual of Omaha, which was subsequently dismissed via consent order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
