We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm the conviction and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-24\">Tenorio pleaded guilty to attempted importation of methamphetamine hydrochloride (\u201cice\u201d), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960 and 963. At sentencing, the district court granted Tenorio\u2019s motion for a two-level minor participant reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). The district court also apphed a two-level enhancement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>for knowing importation of methamphetamine under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">An attempt to commit the substantive offense defined by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a) does not require that the defendant personally commit all elements of the offense; participation in a scheme to do so, coupled with a substantial step taken toward completion, is sufficient. <em>United States v. Mayes, </em>524 F.2d 803, 807 (9th Cir.1975); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The facts elicited at Tenorio\u2019s change-of-plea hearing established that she acquired a cell phone eleven days before the \u201cice\u201d arrived from the Phillip-pines. The packages containing the \u201cice\u201d were addressed to her and listed her cell phone number as the contact number. After being notified of the packages\u2019 arrival, Tenorio drove to the airport to retrieve the packages, knowing they contained \u201cice\u201d and that they came from the Philippines. At the airport, she presented a \u201cnote\u201d to claim them. This evidence supports the conclusion that Tenorio took substantial steps toward effectuating the importation of the \u201cice\u201d and that she aided and abetted a scheme to do so. <em>See Mayes, </em>524 F.2d at 807. The factual basis for Tenorio\u2019s plea was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Tenorio also argues, and the government agrees, that her sentencing guideline range was miscalculated due to the district court simultaneously applying a two-level enhancement for knowing importation of methamphetamine and a two-level minor participant reduction. Tenorio is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">If a defendant is eligible for a minor participant reduction, the two-level enhancement for knowing importation of methamphetamine is inapplicable. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(4). Consequently, having granted Tenorio\u2019s motion for a minor participant reduction, the district court should not have applied the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(4). Because this error was not brought to the attention of the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Sanchez, </em>189 F.3d 1143, 1148 (9th Cir. 1999). We conclude the error was plain, affected Tenorio\u2019s substantial rights and affected the fairness of her judicial proceeding. <em>Cf. id. </em>We further conclude the error should be corrected. We therefore vacate Tenorio\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">Conviction AFFIRMED; sentence VACATED; case REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b721-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
