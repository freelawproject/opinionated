The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231; this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-18\">Gastelum-Leyva first asserts there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction on the gun charge, arguing the gun was merely present at the scene, was handled casually by the government\u2019s confidential informant, and was not actively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>employed or an operative factor in relation to the drug offense. We find the government put on sufficient evidence to satisfy the \u201ccarry\u201d element of \u00a7 924(c). As this was all that was necessary under the statute, we need not address Gastelum-Leyva\u2019s arguments regarding use.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The government presented videotaped and still images showing Gastelum-Leyva at the crime scene with a pistol visible in his waistband. As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[n]o one doubts that one who bears arms on his person \u2018carries a weapon.\u2019\u201d <em>Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 130, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Gastelum-Leyva next asserts a violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) in the manner in which he was sentenced. He argues that where a determination of fact will result in the mandatory increase in the statutory minimum sentence, that factual determination must be made by the jury. This argument ignores our directly applicable case law to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed <em>statutory maximum </em>must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (emphasis added). In <em>United States v. Garcia-Sanchez, </em>238 F.3d 1200, 1201 (9th Cir.2001), we rejected an <em>Apprendi </em>argument where the appellant sought to apply the holding to a sentence in excess of a <em>statutory minimum. Id.; see also United States v. Antonakeas, </em>255 F.3d 714, 727 (9th Cir.2001) <em>(Apprendi </em>only applied where facts, not found by a jury, could increase the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Here, there was a finding of quantity made by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The decision in <em>Apprendi </em>had been issued the day before Gastelum-Leyva\u2019s jury began to deliberate. The district court asked the jury to answer a special interrogatory designed to have them make a finding of quantity. At sentencing, the district court acknowledged that it was bound by the finding and could sentence Gastelum-Leyva to no more than the statutory maximum applicable to 501 grams of cocaine. As the district court recognized the correct statutory maximum, and sentenced Gastelum-Leyva to a term far less than that maximum, it is irrelevant under <em>Apprendi </em>that the sentence was in excess of the statutory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">Finally, Gastelum-Leyva argues that the district court\u2019s denial of a downward departure based on ineffective assistance of counsel was in error. As the district court\u2019s finding was a discretionary refusal to depart, and the district court recognized it had such discretion, its decision not to depart is not reviewable on appeal. <em>United States v. Davoudi, </em>172 F.3d 1130, 1133 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-19\">.
