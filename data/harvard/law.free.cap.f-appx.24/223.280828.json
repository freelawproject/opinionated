The district court denied Brown\u2019s motion, apparently on the grounds that it would not intervene in a prison administrative matter. However, Brown included with his motion a letter from the Bureau of Prisons stating that Brown\u2019s records would be changed to reflect his name upon receipt of an amended judgment and commitment order from the district court. Because it is not clear whether the district court denied the motion on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to amend the judgment and commitment order or whether it concluded that it had jurisdiction but declined to exercise its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>discretion to do so, we vacate and remand for further findings by the district court. In doing so, we express no opinion as to the merits of Brown\u2019s claim. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
