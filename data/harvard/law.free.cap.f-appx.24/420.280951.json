The parties have expressly waived oral argument, and upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">A jury convicted Vega of the above offenses on June 10, 1999. Vega absconded prior to sentencing and thereafter pled guilty to failing to appear, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(a)(1). In the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d), the probation officer calculated Vega\u2019s total offense level as 28, her criminal history category as I, and the guidelines range of imprisonment as 78 to 97 months. The total offense level resulted from a multiple-count adjustment pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3D1.4. Calculated separately, the offense level was 22 for the marijuana charge pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2D1 .1, 28 for the money laundering charges pursuant to USSG \u00a7 281.1(a)(1), and 15 for the failure to appear charge pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2J1.6(a)(2). The district court overruled Vega\u2019s objections to the PSR and sentenced her in the middle of the guidelines range to concurrent prison sentences of 60 months for the marijuana charge and 78 months for the money laundering charges, to be followed by 12 months on the failure to appear charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">In her timely appeal, Vega argues that the district court erred by not reducing her offense level by two pursuant to USSG \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6) and 5C1.2. Relying on <em>United States v. Mertilus, </em>111 F.3d 870 (11th Cir.1997), Vega contends that \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6) may be applied to money laundering crimes which are based on drug trafficking activities and that the safety valve provision of \u00a7 5C1.2 may be applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>to offenses that do not carry a statutory mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">This court reviews a sentencing court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines and sentencing statutes de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Swiney, </em>203 F.3d 397, 401 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1238, 120 S.Ct. 2678, 147 L.Ed.2d 288 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Vega\u2019s reliance on <em>Mertilus </em>is misplaced. In <em>Mertilus, </em>the defendant was appealing his conviction for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b) by using telephone communications to facilitate a conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine. Ill F.3d at 872. Where a defendant has been convicted of using a communication facility to commit a drug offense, the base offense level is the offense level applicable to the underlying drug offense. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2D1.6. Thus, Mertilus\u2019s base offense level was \u201cdetermined under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, which states that the base offense level shall be decreased by two levels \u2018[i]f the defendant meets the criteria set forth in subdivisions (l)-(5) of \u00a7 5C1.2 ... and the offense level determined [under section 2D1.1] is level 26 or greater.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mertilus, </em>111 F.3d at 874 (citing to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(4), now enumerated as \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6)).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In contrast, Vega\u2019s offense level, under the multiple-count grouping decision, was derived from the group of offenses with the highest offense level, i.e., the money laundering offenses. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3D1.4. The base offense level for money laundering offenses is 23 for defendants such as Vega who were convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A). <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Sl.l(a)(l). The base offense level for money laundering is not contingent upon any underlying offense and no cross-reference is made to \u00a7 2D1.1. Thus, there is no provision for reducing Vega\u2019s offense level by two if she meets the criteria of \u00a7 5C1.2. Furthermore, \u00a7 5C1.2\u2019s list of offenses eligible for a reduced sentence does not include money laundering offenses. <em>See United States v. Saffo, </em>227 F.3d 1260, 1273 (10th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 1608, 149 L.Ed.2d 473 (2001) (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h) conviction). Although the offense level for Vega\u2019s marijuana charge was initially calculated under \u00a7 2D1.1, this does not entitle her to receive a two-point reduction under \u00a7 5C1.2 because her offense level of 22 for the marijuana charge was four points beneath that required to trigger a reduction under \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">As \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6) may not be applied to money laundering offenses, it is unnecessary to consider whether the safety valve provision of \u00a7 5C1.2 may be applied to offenses that do not carry a statutory mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
