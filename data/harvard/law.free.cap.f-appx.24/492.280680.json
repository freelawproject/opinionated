This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. RApp. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">Seeking monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, Hessmer sued his former attorney Jack \u201cBF\u201d Lowery, Sr. Hessmer alleged that Lowery violated his rights under the United States Constitution and the FTCA when he negligently represented Hessmer in criminal and civil matters. The district court screened the complaint, granted Hessmer in forma pauperis status, and dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). Hessmer filed a \u201cPetition to Reconsider and Convert,\u201d requesting permission to substitute 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 as the bases for his suit. The district court denied the motion, holding that Hessmer was not entitled to amend his complaint to avoid sua sponte dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">In his timely appeal, Hessmer argues that the district court should have construed his complaint as arising under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-17\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). <em>McGore v. Wrigglesworth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.1997). Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Hessmer\u2019s complaint. Hessmer alleged that Lowery negligently defended him in a state court criminal matter by failing to recover im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>properly seized property, failing to get charges dropped or reduced, and failing to raise the defense of mental incompetence. Hessmer also alleged that Lowery overcharged him in the criminal matter and settled a personal injury claim for too little money. The FTCA provides a cause of action only if the claim is brought against a federal employee. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2674; <em>FDIC v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 477, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994). Because Hessmer did not allege that his former attorney was a federal employee, his complaint failed to state a claim under the FTCA. The district court properly dismissed the complaint and denied Hessmer\u2019s later motion because courts do not have the discretion to permit an in forma pauperis plaintiff to amend a complaint to avoid a sua sponte dismissal. <em>See McGore, </em>114 F.3d at 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Accepting Hessmer\u2019s allegations as true, he can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. <em>See Lewis v. ACB Bus. Servs., Inc., </em>135 F.3d 389; 405 (6th Cir.1998); <em>Mayer v. Mylod, </em>988 F.2d 635, 638 (6th Cir.1993). For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. '</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
