We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The issue in this appeal was squarely addressed in an opinion of this Court issued earlier this year. Carr argues that \u00a7 440(d) of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 440(d), 110 Stat. 1277, has an impermissibly retroactive effect as applied to aliens like him whose criminal conduct pre-dated the AEDPA\u2019s enactment date, even though his conviction post-dated the AEDPA\u2019s enactment date. In <em>Domond v. U.S. I.N.S., </em>244 F.3d 81 (2d Cir.2001), we held that \u00a7 440(d) does not have an impermissibly retroactive effect as applied to aliens whose criminal conduct pre-dated the AEDPA\u2019s enactment date but whose convictions post-dated the AEDPA\u2019s enactment date. The Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent affirmance of our decision in <em>St. Cyr v. INS, </em>229 F.3d 406 (2d Cir.2000), <em>aff'd, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), which addressed the impermissibly retroactive effect of \u00a7 440(d) as applied to aliens whose guilty pleas pre-dated the AEDPA\u2019s enactment date, does not undermine <em>Domond. </em>Accordingly, the district court properly denied Carr\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus entered by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
