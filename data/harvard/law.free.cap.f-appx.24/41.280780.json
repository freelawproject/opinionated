It is the obligation of the party opposing a renewed motion for JMOL to raise its procedural objections to it in the district court. <em>Gibeau v. Nellis, </em>18 F.3d 107, 109 (2d Cir.1994). We will only consider a new argument not presented to the district court \u201cwhere necessary to serve an \u2018interest of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-18\">Milius did not object that the Secretary\u2019s post-verdict motion for JMOL was procedurally defective, and therefore, she has waived the issue for our review. <em>Gibeau, </em>18 F.3d at 109. Further, because Milius failed to object to the Secretary\u2019s post-verdict motion for lacking specificity, she also waived her right to appellate review of that issue. <em>Marfia v. T.C. Ziraat Bankasi, </em>147 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir.1998). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>There is no interest of justice that requires us to consider these new arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We also agree that as a matter of law Milius failed to establish that she was the victim of sexual harassment under a hostile work environment theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">As a general matter, in order to be actionable, the incidents of harassment must occur with a regularity that can reasonably be termed pervasive. <em>Quinn v. Green Tree Credit Corp., </em>159 F.3d 759, 768 (2d Cir.1998). \u201cHowever, where the conduct is sufficiently severe, it may alter the plaintiffs conditions of employment without repetition....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In this ease Milius proved that in an isolated incident a coworker who suffered from multiple sclerosis dropped his pants in front of her as he asked her to see whether there was an injury on his back after he had fallen down. Milius did not allege that similar behavior had ever occurred before or after. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to her, that isolated incident was not so severe that it could have altered the conditions of Milius\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
