Nickerson, <em>Judge, </em>sentencing him principally to a prison term of 2% years <em>for </em>violation <em>of </em>the terms of his supervised release. On appeal Maggio contends that the court failed to consider the recommendations of Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) for such a violation, and that the sentence was unreasonable. Finding no merit in any of his contentions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The district court is given broad discretion to fashion a punishment for a defendant\u2019s violation of the terms of supervised release and has authority to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Wirth, </em>250 F.3d 165, 169 (2d Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Sweeney, </em>90 F.3d 55, 57 (2d Cir.1996). Guidelines Chapter 7, which sets out policy statements with regard to the revocation, states that \u201cat revocation the court should sanction primarily <em>the defendant\u2019s breach of trust, </em>while taking into account, to a limited degree, the seriousness of the underlying violation and the criminal history of the violator.\u201d Guidelines Chapter 7, Part A, 3(b) (Policy Statement) (emphasis added). The policy statements also recommend ranges of imprisonment for various types of supervised release violations, including a four-to-ten-month range for that of Maggio. However, those recommendations are merely advisory, and the district court is not required either to adopt them or to make explicit, detailed findings when it declines to follow them. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Pelensky, </em>129 F.3d 63, 69 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Maggio\u2019s contention that the district court failed to consider the Chapter 7 suggestion for four-to-ten months\u2019 imprisonment is belied by the record. At the hearing, defense counsel repeatedly mentioned the Guidelines-recommended \u201cfour to ten months\u201d range and asked the court to sentence Maggio at the bottom of that range. The court then inquired about its \u201calternatives.\u201d After the court was informed that one permissible alternative was to sentence Maggio to a term of imprisonment of up to three years, defense counsel again brought up \u201cthe guideline provision,\u201d and the court interrupted, stating, \u201cI understand that\u201d; defense counsel stated, \u201cI know you understand that.\u201d We see no indication in the record that the court failed to consider the Guidelines-recommended four-to-ten-months range.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Nor is there merit in Maggio\u2019s contention that the district court fashioned his sentence solely on the basis of the nature of the crime that violated the terms of his supervised release rather than primarily on the basis of his \u201cbreach of trust,\u201d as recommended by the Chapter 7 Policy Statement. For example, in imposing sentence, the court stated, \u201cI was really shocked[,] to tell you the truth, shocked that he turned around, got out and he was immediately into crime again. You didn\u2019t learn a lesson.\u201d Indeed, it was defense counsel who urged the court to rely to a greater extent on the nature of Maggio\u2019s new crime, emphasizing that it was not a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Maggio also contends that the 2%-year prison term was unreasonable because it was longer than (a) the term recommended by the Guidelines, (b) the term recommended by the Probation Department\u2019s Supervised Release Report, and (c) the term imposed on a codefendant who also violated the terms of supervised release, and because Maggio\u2019s new criminal conduct was \u201cisolated and non-repetitive.\u201d (Maggio Brief on Appeal at 15-16.) We reject this contention. A sentence imposed for violation of supervised release may be reversed only if it is \u201c \u2018plainly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Wirth, </em>250 F.3d at 169 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4)); <em>United States v. Sweeney, </em>90 F.3d at 57 (same). In the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the district court noted that with respect to his underlying conviction Maggio had been given a relatively short prison term; that Maggio engaged in his new criminal conduct just days after being released from prison; that apparently Maggio did \u201cnot ... take[ ] [supervised release] seriously\u201d; and that there was thus \u201cno point to\u201d giving Maggio a sentence that consisted largely of supervised release again. In light of this record, we cannot conclude that the prison term imposed was \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">We have considered all of Maggio\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
