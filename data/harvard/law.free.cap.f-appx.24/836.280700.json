Having carefully reviewed Appellant\u2019s contentions, we conclude that the record does not support his claims that trial counsel failed to assert a due process argument in the attempt to exclude similar crimes evidence and that trial counsel failed to require the balancing of prejudice. The record shows instead that counsel argued due process and requested balancing of prejudice. Counsel performed properly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>The trial court considered and did not abuse its discretion in rejecting counsel\u2019s argument for exclusion of the similar crimes\u2019 evidence, finding that the probity of the evidence, which showed <em>modus oper- and% </em>was not substantially outweighed by its prejudice. No failure of the effective assistance of counsel required by the Constitution is presented. See <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b862-8\"> This disposition is inappropriate <em>for </em>publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
