Cioffi, Commissioner, appeal from the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, Senior Judge Constance Baker Motley sitting by designation, in favor of plaintiff-appellee Harold F. Evans, Jr. in his claim for race discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">The district court bifurcated this case into liability and damages, finding defendants-appellants hable for racial discrimination after a bench trial on July 11, 1996, and awarding $877,253.80 in back pay, prejudgment interest, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to Evans on June 27,1997. <em>Evans v. Connecticut, </em>967 F.Supp. 673 (D.Conn. 1997) (amended findings on liability and damages); <em>Evans v. Connecticut, </em>935 F.Supp. 145 (D.Conn.1996) (findings of fact and conclusions of law). On appeal, defendants-appellants argue that the court erred by (1) determining that plaintiff had established a prima facie case of discrimination, (2) finding defendants\u2019 proffered reasons for Evans\u2019 discharge pretextual, (3) finding liability under a \u201cmixed motive\u201d theory of discrimination, (4) sanctioning the state for failure to produce certain requested documents, (5) appointing and utilizing an \u201cexpert,\u201d (6) calculating damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, and (7) denying defendants\u2019 motion for a stay of judgment pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">This Court will first address the defendants-appellants\u2019 claims regarding the district court\u2019s evaluation of the substantive discrimination determinations (claims 1-3). The district court reviewed Evans\u2019 claim under both the \u201ctraditional\u201d <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and the \u201cmixed motive\u201d Price <em>Waterhouse </em>analyses, finding liability in each case. <em>See Evans, </em>935 F.Supp. at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">We find defendants-appellants\u2019 challenge to the prima facie ease no longer germane. <em>See United States Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 713-14, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983) (\u201cBecause this case was fully tried on the merits, it is surprising to find the parties ... still addressing the question whether [the plaintiff] made out a <em>prima facie </em>case.\u201d). In the words of the Supreme Court, \u201c[w]here the defendant has done everything that would be required of him if the plaintiff had properly made out a <em>prima facie </em>case, whether the plaintiff really did so is no longer relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715. We need not, therefore, address defendants-appellants\u2019 specific challenge to the district court\u2019s interpretation of qualification under <em>McDonnell Douglas\u2019s </em>prima facie test.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>We further reject the defendants\u2019 challenges to the court\u2019s findings of liability under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and <em>Price Waterhouse </em>tests. This Court examines the district court\u2019s factual interpretations under the deferential, \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. <em>See Prima v. Panalpina, </em>223 F.3d 126, 129 (2d Cir.2000). Judge Motley\u2019s determinations of liability turned on her assessment of the evidence presented at trial \u2014 the report of the court\u2019s expert, the testimony of various police officials and of plaintiff Evans, and the state\u2019s failure to produce key documents for review. Viewing the record with deference, we affirm Judge Motley\u2019s liability determination, finding no clear error in her assessment of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">This Court reviews the district courts\u2019 imposition of Rule 37 sanctions, appointment of experts, and damage awards for abuse of discretion. <em>See Mackler Prods., Inc. v. Cohen, </em>225 F.3d 136, 141 (2d Cir.2000) (sanctions); <em>Fisher v. Vassar College, </em>70 F.3d 1420, 1445 (2d Cir.l995)(expert/evidentiary ruling); <em>Carrero v. New York City Hous. Auth., </em>890 F.2d 569, 579-80 (2d Cir.1989) (damages). This case required extensive analysis of documentary and statistical evidence. This Court, therefore, finds no abuse of discretion in the appointment of an expert to review and testify about that evidence. In so finding, we note that defendants\u2019 suggestion that the expert was used as a special master is not supported by the record, despite the incorrect use of that label during the trial by the court and the parties. We find further that the state\u2019s failure to produce the documents necessary to facilitate the expert\u2019s review, particularly after multiple requests, warranted imposition of sanctions. Additionally, we note that the district court relied on expert testimony and traditional methods in construing the appropriate damage and attorneys\u2019 fees awards. We thus find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s sanction, expert, or damage decisions (Claims 4-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Finally, defendants-appellants argue that the trial court erred in denying their motion to stay the entry of judgment pending resolution of this appeal (Claim 7). This Court denied a renewed motion for a stay over four years ago, requiring the funds in question to be deposited in escrow. <em>See </em>Docket Entry, 9-17-97. The question now raised is thus moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the appeal of the denial of a stay is DISMISSED as moot and the judgment of the district court is otherwise AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
