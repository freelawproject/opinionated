Appellants answered the original bill, denying the material allegations of the bill. They also filed their cross-bill, and their first and second amended cross-bills against appellee and others. The substance of the matters set up by the second and last amended cross-bill is that by reason of certain facts averred, the promissory notes which evidenced the debt secured b)r the mortgage in question had become satisfied, and the debt evidenced was extinguished. It also set up certain facts pertaining to the title, and claimed relief as against Frank H. Collier, praying for a decree that Collier convey the premises to cross-complainants. Upon motion of appellee certain portions of this cross-bill were stricken out and appellee\u2019s demurrer to it was sustained and the cross-bill was dismissed.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-6\" pgmap=\"22\">Upon bill, answer and replication, the cause upon the original bill was referred to a master in chancery to hear evidence and report.

We are of opinion that the demurrer was properly sustained. The matters set up by the cross-bill as ground for relief as against Frank H. Collier, Esq., are new and distinct matters, in no way germane to the subject-matter of the original bill of complaint. Therefore they are not such matters as could support a cross-bill. Thompson v. Shoemaker, 68 Ill. 256; Lund v. S. E. Bank, 96 Ill. 181.</p> <p id=\"b22-11\" pgmap=\"22\">The remaining matters set up by this cross-bill are purely matters of defense to the original bill of complaint, and available, if at ail, under the answer. Therefore they could not support a cross-bill. Morgan v. Smith, 11 Ill. 194; Newberry v. Blatchford, 106 Ill. 584.</p> <p id=\"b22-12\" pgmap=\"22\">But, irrespective of the manner of pleading them, the facts set up by answer and by cross-bill are wholly insufficient, either to constitute a defense to the original bill of complaint or to entitle cross-complainants to .any affirmative relief. No facts are averred which would constitute an extinguishment of the mortgage debt, and no rights of. appellants set forth which would entitle them to affirmative equitable relief in respect to the property in question. The decree is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
