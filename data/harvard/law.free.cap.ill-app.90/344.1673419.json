The plea was the general issue. A trial before the court and a jury resulted in a verdict being directed by the court in favor of the defendant, on which judgment was rendered, to reverse which this writ of error is prosecuted. At the close of all the evidence the plaintiff asked the court to give an instruction in her favor, which was refused by the court, and an exception preserved by her.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\" pgmap=\"365\">Defendant in error is composed of numerous subordinate societies, known as courts, with constitutions and by-laws governing the principal body, the defendant in error, known as the high court, and also the subordinate courts, which, together, constitute the high court. Among other provisions of the high court constitution are the following:</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\" pgmap=\"365\">\u201cArticle Y, Sec. 9.

Every endowment assessment notice shall state that the high court levies an assessment on each member of the order in good standing for the purpose of paying death benefits, and that each and every court of the Cat\u00fcolic Order of Foresters shall forward immediately to the high treasurer the assessment due from every member, and said notice shall be in accordance with the form prescribed by the high court, and shall include a list of all the deaths subsequent to the last assessment.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\" pgmap=\"365(20) 366(55)\">\u201c Article X, Sec. 1.

Upon the receipt of such notice calling for an endowment or a special ' assessment, .the, recording secretary of the subordinate court shall immediately acknowledge the same to the high secretary, and at the same time notify the financial secretary of his court of the facts set forth in the call. The financial secretary shall thereupon certify to the treasurer of his court the amount due the high treasurer on account of such endowment or special assessment from the subordinate court, and the treasurer of such court shall thereupon pay to the high treasurer the amount so certified.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-7\" pgmap=\"366\">\u201c Sec. 3. The treasurer of the subordinate court shall notify the recording secretary of his court of the amount paid or forwarded to the high treasurer, on which account, the date it was sent and the manner in which it was forwarded or\" paid, and the recording secretary shall immediately notify the high secretary of all such facts and also report the same to his court at its next regular meeting.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-8\" pgmap=\"366\">\u201c Sec. 4.

The evidence shows that if there was no such forfeiture, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount of the certificate, less any unpaid assessments up to April 29, 1899, and interest on the balance from August 23,1899.</p> <p id=\"b371-4\" pgmap=\"371(311) 372(259)\">It is important, in the consideration of this question, to note the relations under the constitutions and by-laws governing the order, of the member, the subordinate court and the high court. In the matter of payment of endowment assessments, with which we are here concerned, the high court deals with the member through the subordinate court only, except in case of a suspension of the subordinate court for failure to pay to the high court such assessments, with which we are not here concerned, as there was no suspension of the subordinate court. The member, in the payment of his assessments, deals only with the subordinate court, paj^s his assessments to that court, and they are forwarded, when called by the high court, to its proper officer. In all cases when an assessment is called by the high court, it must be paid by the subordinate court at a date prior to the assessment which the member is called upon to pay by the same notice given by the high court through the subordinate court. In this case, when assessment No. 152 was called to the high treasury of the high court by notice of January 5, 1898, the time for its payment by the subordinate to the high court expired January 20, 1898, while the time for the member to pay to his subordinate court expired February 15,1898. This assessment, amounting to seventy-two cents, was paid by the subordinate court to the high court within the time required by the by-laws; but, as we have seen, the assured failed to pay the assessment to his subordinate court, and, upon request by him made, at a regular meeting of the subordinate court, which occurred six days before his time for payment expired, he procured an extension of time from the subordinate court until February 23, 1898, when he, having still failed to pay the assessment, was by the action of the subordinate court suspended from the order because of his non-payment of the assessment, and the high secretary of the high court duly notified of such suspension. The claim of defendant in error is that, under section 1 of article XIII of the subordinate court constitution, above quoted in the statement, Flicek, by the non-payment of his assessment when it became due, according to the terms of the notice, was ipso facto suspended, and there was no necessity of any action being taken by the subordinate court in that regard. We think this contention is not tenable. As will be seen from the by-laws quoted in the statement, the subordinate court, in the case of the failure of a member to pay his endowment assessment, might appropriate out of the court fund a sum sufficient to pay it,, and the member should be charged in his court fund account the sum so appropriated; also the subordinate court has the power to set apart a sufficient sum of money to pay the dues and assessments of a sick member for the period of one year. These provisions, in our opinion, clearly establish the right of the subordinate court to waive the provisions of the by-law above referred to, by the terms of which it is said that the member failing to pay his assessments when due should by that fact stand suspended from the order.</p> <p id=\"b372-5\" pgmap=\"372\">Forfeitures are not favored in the law, and before they will be enforced by the courts they must be clearly and strictly established. Palmer v. Ford, 70 Ill. 369; Conductors\u2019, etc., Assn. v. Tucker, 157 Ill. 200; Metropolitan, etc., Assn. v. Windover, 137 Ill. 417-32; High Court, etc., v. Schweitzer, 171 Ill. 325; Order of Friends v. Austerlitz, 75 Ill. App. 87; King v. Radeke, 175 Ill. 72-7.</p> <p id=\"b372-6\" pgmap=\"372(64) 373(128)\">The action of the subordinate court, as we have seen, in extending the time to Flicek for him to pay his assessment, was authorized by the by-laws and waived any right of forfeiture thereunder by reason of his failure to pay, and being once waived could not be revived or availed of for the same cause, viz., the payment of assessment No. 152. It is not claimed that his rights were forfeited by reason of his failure to pay any other assessment, or for any other reason, and early in March, 1898, presumably at the first meeting of the subordinate court iu that month, the president of the court refused to receive any delinquent dues or assessments from Flicelc when the same were offered to be paid by Mrs. Flicelc. He could do no more, and the actions of St. Mathias court, on February 23, 1898, in attempting to suspend him, and afterward in attempting to expel him, were of no avail as against his beneficiary. Continental, etc., Assn. v. Rogers, 119 Ill. 487; Met., etc., Assn. v. Windover, 137 Ill. 432; High Court v. Schweitzer, 171 Ill. 325.</p> <p id=\"b373-4\" pgmap=\"373\">The cases cited by counsel for defendant in error, which be claims sustain his contention that a subordinate lodge and its officers have no authority to waive any laws of the order relating to the substance of the contract between the member and the order, do not, in our opinion, sustain the contention in so far as concerns the action of the subordinate lodge or society. They relate to acts of officers or representatives of the subordinate society which they claimed to establish a waiver, and not to the acts of the society itself, which we have seen had, by the constitution and the by-laws of the order, the power to extend the time of payment of assessments to the member.</p> <p id=\"b373-5\" pgmap=\"373\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
