Sheffield filed a bill June 14, 1894, under section 39 of the mechanics\u2019 lien law, then in force, alleging that on the third day of February, 1894, said Sheffield entered into a contract with one David A. Blythe for the construction of a building. It is alleged that Blythe partly completed the work, and that the amount due under the contract with Blythe for the work which he did, was not sufficient to satisfy the claims of those who furnished labor and material as sub-contractors. These alleged sub-contractors were made defendants to the suit, and the bill prayed that the respective amounts due them might be ascertained and that the balance due from Sheffield to Blythe under the contract, might be distributed pro rata among the claimants, according to the provisions of the lien law.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-10\" pgmap=\"218(19) 219(309)\">Among others who were made defendants to the bill were the persons composing the firm of Olson &amp; Clayton, who answered, and subsequently filed a cross-bill setting up that on or about' the third day of March, 1894, they agreed with said Blythe to furnish certain building material to be used in the construction of the building, pursuant to the contract between Blythe and Sheffield; that in pursuance of such agreement they delivered to said Blythe certain of the materials as agreed upon, but that the said Blythe failed and refused to pay for the same; that by reason of said failure and refusal of said Blythe to so perform his part of the agreement, said complainants refused to further deliver material; that thereupon, on or about May 16, 1894, said George S. Sheffield entered into an agreement with said complainants, partly expressed and partly implied, whereby said Sheffield was substituted for said Blythe and became subject to all the duties and obligations and entitled to the rights of said Blythe under the agreement with said complainants; that, thereafter, in pursuance of said agreement with Sheffield, complainants furnished material which was used in said building by said Sheffield; that, in addition to the items furnished in accordance with the agreement as originally made with Blythe,: they furnished other material subsequently ordered by said Sheffield, and that he agreed to pay within five days after-the completion of said building for all material so furnished,, whether under the original contract with Blythe or extra material furnished as aforesaid upon his order. It is alleged that, on August 1, 1894, complainants filed with the clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County, in which county said premises and improvements are situated, a just and true statement of such account duly verified by affidavit. The cross-bill prays, among other things, that the said Sheffield may be decreed to pay complainants the amount due them.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-4\" pgmap=\"219\">The answer of Sheffield to this cross-bill admits the contract between complainants and Blythe, but denies that he was ever substituted for Blythe in the contract, and either denies or calls for proof of the other allegations,</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-5\" pgmap=\"219\">Deneen &amp; Hamill, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-4\" pgmap=\"220\">Tenney, McConnell, Coffeen &amp; Harding, attorneys for appellees.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b220-5\" pgmap=\"220\">Mr. Justice Freeman</author> <p id=\"AoqV\" pgmap=\"220\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b220-6\" pgmap=\"220\">Appellant Olson prosecutes this appeal as successor to Olsen &amp; Clayton, of which firm he was a member. Said firm sought by cross-bill to establish a lien as original contractors and to recover against appellee Sheffield by reason of an alleged agreement, whereby Sheffield, the owner of the property, became substituted for Blythe, his architect, with whom appellant\u2019s firm made their original contract.</p> <p id=\"b220-7\" pgmap=\"220\">It is sought to maintain a lien as original contractors, first upon the ground that the original contract between Sheffield and his architect, Blythe, was made to deceive and defraud, and Blythe was not in fact general contractor for the building, notwithstanding a written contract to that effect, but was merely agent for Sheffield, the owner.</p> <p id=\"b220-8\" pgmap=\"220\">The master has found that Sheffield and Blythe did endeavor to mislead contractors and place them in a position where they could not establish liens, using the contract between them for that purpose. It appears also, that' Blythe, in his answer to one of the cross-bills herein filed by other parties, admits that in the construction of the said building he was architect for Sheffield; that in the work he acted as architect \u201c and as the agent of the owner, said George Sheffield,\u201d and that further than this he has no interest in the controversy. If it be true that Blythe\u2019s real relation to Sheffield was only that of architect and agent, then notwithstanding the written contract purporting to constitute him an original general contractor, the contract with Olson &amp; Clayton in his name should be treated as the contract of his principal, even though the agency was then known only to Sheffield and himself. There is evidence, tending to sustain such a conclusion.</p> <p id=\"AD_R\" pgmap=\"220(40) 221(83)\">But whether such evidence be accepted as controlling or not, it appears that Sheffield accepted, in writing, of date March 3, 1894, an order upon him by Blythe for the amount \u00f3f the original contract with appellant\u2019s firm. This contains an itemized estimate of material to be furnished amounting in value to \u00a71,071, bearing the \u201c O. K.\u201d of Murray, Sheffield\u2019s superintendent. At the bottom is the following: \u201cPlease pay above amount to Olson &amp; Clayton as delivered. E. A. Blythe.\u201d On the margin appears, \u201cit lieing understood that we furnish enough to complete building; style and trim to be selected by owner.\u201d Signed \u201c O. K. Olson &amp; Clayton.\u201d Beneath is, \u201c Accepted. George S. Sheffield.\u201d ' '</p> <p id=\"b221-5\" pgmap=\"221\">It was sought by appellant to amend the cross-bill, alleging in substance that the above writing constituted an original contract with Sheffield. This amendment the court refused to allow. It is true it was offered after the master\u2019s report had been made and after the case had been submitted to the chancellor. But it was not, after all, new matter. A copy of the itemized estimate with the above order by Blythe, the \u201c O. K.\u201d of appellant\u2019s firm and the written acceptance by Sheffield, was attached to the cross-bill as originally filed. It is true that the original cross-bill relied upon the alleged written agreement of May 16, 1894, as evidencing the substitution of Sheffield for Blythe as party to the contract originally made with Blythe. Appellant adhered to this theory throughout the case, and adheres to it still. But the delivery of the writing of May 16th was controverted, and we find no good reason why the parties could not amend and assert that such substitution was evidenced not only by the writing of May 16th, but in reality had been acted upon more than two months before that date. There was here no change in the real issue, but only a change in the allegation as to the time when the agreement with Sheffield first went into effect. It was not a change such as was sought to be made in Adams v. Gill, 158 Ill. 190, where an original charge of mistake by an attorney was changed by amendment into a charge of fraud by principals. We think the amendment might properly, and should have been allowed.</p> <p id=\"b221-6\" pgmap=\"221(23) 222(177)\">But it is urged that even had this amendment been alio wed, the writing of March 3d can not be construed as constitu\u00eding an original contract with Sheffield. We can not agree with this view. The writing at the foot of an itemized statement or estimate of material to be furnished was in effect an order by Blythe to pay the sum of \u00a71,071 to Olson &amp; Clayton for the materials enumerated as they should be delivered. It contained next a statement by Olson &amp; Company that an understanding existed on their part that they should furnish not only the material enumerated, but also enough more, if more should be needed, to complete the building, the \u201cowner\u201d to select the \u201cstyle of trim.\u201d This agreement equally with the order of payment, and all that precedes,is \u201caccepted\u201d by Sheffield, the owner. The memorandum seems to us to be susceptible of no other construction. It is an agreement by the owner to pay the price mentioned-for the material specified as fast as it shall be delivered, and an acceptance by him of Olson &amp; Clayton\u2019s proposition to furnish, in addition enough of such material to complete the building.</p> <p id=\"b222-5\" pgmap=\"222\">But if this be not regarded as proving a contract with the owner for all material thereafter furnished, as we think it must be, it at least furnishes corroborative evidence that Blythe was acting in his arrangements with Olson &amp; Clayton as the agent of the owner. Otherwise no reason appears why this memorandum should have been submitted to Sheffield at the outset and accepted by him personally before any material was delivered.</p> <p id=\"b222-6\" pgmap=\"222\">It is urged that the paper of May 16th shows an attempt to get something to bind Sheffield, which would have been unnecessary had the memorandum of March 3d been understood as an agreement between him and Olson &amp; Clayton. It appears, and the master finds, that Olson &amp; Clayton had been unable to get payment promptly, and had therefore stopped delivering material, and refused to continue unless Sheffield would pay them $300, and sign a specific agreement to pay the balance. Thereupon Sheffield executed the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b222-7\" pgmap=\"222\">\u201cMay 16, 1894.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b222-8\" pgmap=\"222(21) 223(20)\">I, George S. Sheffield, hereby agree to pay Olson &amp; Clayton whatever sum may be found due them for material furnished on building 4232 Calumet Ave., according to contract and specifications, within five days after completion of said building.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b223-4\" pgmap=\"223\">(Signed) George S. Sheffield.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b223-5\" pgmap=\"223\">As to whether there was an actual delivery of this written agreement is a matter of controversy\u2014the only controverted question, it is said, before the master. Appellant claims the evidence shows that it actually was delivered. Appellees\u2019 evidence is to the effect that it was not so delivered, because of a discussion which arose as to its scope, after it was signed and left lying on the table, notwithstanding it had been drawn up by Sheffield's own agent and superintendent, who swears he took it back, and did not know of the existence of the copy. Patterson, the agent of Olson &amp; Clayton in the matter, testifies that he supposed the letter press copy which he made was \u201c as good as the original,\u201d and that he himself gave the original back to Sheffield, who wanted some evidence of what it was he had signed; that he did this because\u201c of course our copy would stay in the book, and I gave him the original,\u201d Patterson retaining the copy as a duplicate.</p> <p id=\"b223-6\" pgmap=\"223(179) 224(109)\">We are not satisfied that this contract of May 16th was not delivered. It evidently passed into the hands of appellant\u2019s agent, and remained there long enough to make the letter press copy. This indicates,, intentional delivery, and such delivery, if made, would not be rescinded by merely seizing and carrying away the original without appellant\u2019s consent, or taking it with such consent for a special purpose only, leaving a copy for his use. It is true the original was taken away. But it was acted upon by both parties as if delivered. Olson &amp; Clayton resumed, in good faith, the delivery of material which had been suspended pending a specific written promise of payment from Sheffield. If not delivered, it is clear that Sheffield got the benefit of it, as if it had been. But Sheffield, on his part, paid the three hundred dollars demanded by Olson &amp; Clayton\u2014whether through Bivthe, we do not regard as material. The interview at which the agreement was executed occurred at appellant\u2019s place of business, where Sheffield, Blythe, his architect, and Murray, his superintendent, had gone together to try to induce Olson &amp; Clayton to resume delivery of the remaining material. In this they succeeded. If the instrument was not in fact delivered, appellant was evidently misled and supposed it to have been binding, and acted accordingly. If, as the master finds, it was not so delivered as to be binding on Sheffield as a contract in writing, we must nevertheless regard the letter press copy retained by appellant as competent evidence tending to show, in connection with the conceded facts, what the understanding between the parties was upon which both of them thereafter acted.</p> <p id=\"b224-5\" pgmap=\"224\">It is said that amendment to the cross-bill, if allowed, would have availed nothing, for the further reason that the claimants were bound by the sworn lien statement filed by them, and that in that statement the contract relied upon was the agreement of May 16th. An examination of that statement, however, shows that its wording is such as to indicate reliance upon both of the alleged agreements with Sheffield\u2014that of March 3d as well as that of May 16th.</p> <p id=\"b224-6\" pgmap=\"224(204) 225(35)\">It is urged that this appeal is taken and errors assigned by Olson alone, although the cross-bill was filed by Olson and Clayton as partners, and the claim was a joint claim. It appears that Clayton had retired from the firm. i The appeal was prayed by and allowed to both Olson and Clayton. Both have united in the assignment of error and there is joinder in error. After this it is too late for appellees to insist that only one has appealed. Hodson v. McConnel, 12 Ill. 170; Robinson v. Magarity, 28 Ill. 423 (426). Ho motion has been made by appellees to dismiss the appeal, and the latter have assigned cross-errors. The statute provides (Sec. 71, Practice Act) that where a decree is rendered against two or more, either can remove such suit to the Appellate Court by appeal or writ of error, and for that purpose shall be permitted to use the names of the others, if necfessarv. Such cases shall be determined in the Appellate Court as if all parties had joined in the appeal. The objection now made is technical in its nature. If appellees desired to avail themselves of it, they should have made a motion to dismiss. Failure so to do .is a waiver of the right to insist upon the objection. Dinet v. The People, 73 Ill. 183 (184); Brady v. The People, 51 Ill. App. 112, and cases cited.</p> <p id=\"APb\" pgmap=\"225\">Other points are presented which we have fully considered, and do not deem it necessary now to discuss. The judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views here expressed. Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
