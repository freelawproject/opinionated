On motion by appellant for a new trial, the court required appellee to remit $5,000 from the verdict as a condition of overruling the motion, which appellee did, and judgment was rendered for the balance, $15,000. Appellant has two street car tracks on Western avenue in the city of Chicago, on which it operates cars moved by electricity. Western avenue is a north and south street, and the east track of appellant is the north bound track, and the west track the south-bound track. Appellee at the time of the injury complained of, was between six and seven years of age, and lived with her mother, whose residence was on the east side of Western avenue between Harvard and Polk streets, which streets lie east and west across Western avenue.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-10\" pgmap=\"50\">Between six and seven o\u2019clock in the evening of October 31, 1895, appellee, while crossing from the west side of Western avenue to her mother\u2019s house on the east side of the street, was struck by a north-bound electric car of appellant, and was seriously and permanently injured.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-11\" pgmap=\"50(33) 51(64)\">The contention of appellant, which its counsel claim is supported by the evidence, is \u201c that the car was going at a reasonable rate of speed, and that the child ran out from behind a south-bound car, which hid her from view until too late to avoid the accident.\u201d The contention of counsel for appellee is, \u201c that the car was being operated at an excessive rate of speed; that the motorman\u2019s view of the child was unobstructed, and that, had he maintained a proper lookout, he would have discovered the child and have avoided the accident.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-4\" pgmap=\"51\">The trial commenced March 16th, and continued until March 24, 1899, at which last date the verdict was rendered. During the progress of the trial the jury were permitted to separate daily in the evening, when court adjourned. March 20, 1899, while the trial was progressing, appellant presented and read to the court an affidavit which is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-5\" pgmap=\"51\">\u201c George A. Tuille, being first duly sworn, on oath deposes and says that he is second vice-president of the defendant company, and that he is the agent of the defendant company in this behalf. That on Friday morning, March IT, A.

She was frightfully mangled, an arm and part of one foot being cut off. She is now unable to dress or undress herself, or to do anything requiring the use of bands, having only a thumb and forefinger on one hand. At the former trial, which occurred before Judge Hanecy in May, 1898, it was shown that the motorman was inexperienced and could not stop the car in time to avoid the accident. Two'of the jurors, Frank S. O\u2019Brien of 3645 Hamilton avenue, and Jas. Kenney of 643 W. Fifty-sixth street, confessed to State\u2019s Attorney Heneen that they had been bribed by Lynch to \u2018hang\u2019 the jury in favor of the company. According to the confessions, O\u2019Brien was paid $100 and Kenney $50, though the latter complains he was promised $75. Both men are now under bond for their appearance in court.\u2019</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-17\" pgmap=\"52\">\u201c That on Saturday morning, March 18, A.

Olson, the conductor of the car, who swore that it was late and running at the.rate of thirtj miles an hour, and that it did not stop at the Harvard street crossing, where a passenger was waiting. H. M. Anderson, whose home is in Harvard street, near the corner of Western avenue, told the jury that he was the man waiting, and that the car did not stop, though he signaled it to do so.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-11\" pgmap=\"53\">\u2018 SAW THE CHILD STRUCK.</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-12\" pgmap=\"53\">\u2018 Mrs. M.

It was this tot\u2019s case over which a jury disagreed, and investigation of that disagreement brought about the indictment of ex-Bailif\u00ed Jas. J. Lynch on the charge of bribery.

He estimated the speed of the car to be eighteen miles an hour, and was unshaken on cross-examination as to this important point.

A number of witnesses testified that they saw the car strike and run over the child. On cross-examination it was revealed that most of the witnesses had been paid by the company for loss of time due to the suit, and that several days had been thus compensated for in,nearly every case.</p><p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-8\" pgmap=\"59\">\u2018An attempt of the defense to break down the testimony of Conductor Olson met with a.setback when Superintendent Fuller on cross-examination failed to state the date when he claimed to have discharged Olson.

He was followed by Attorney Prentice for the West Chicago Street Railroad Company. Attorney Richolson will continue the defense this morning and the closing speech will be made by Russell M. Wing on behalf of the plaintiff. The principal testimony for the defense during the day was furnished bv the motorman of the car that struck the child. His statements were to the effect that the car had slowed down at Harvard street to two or three miles an hour, and that when little Emma was struck the controller showed five points, or speed of about eight miles an hour.</p><p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-9\" pgmap=\"60\">' The declaration made by several of the other witnesses for the defense, that the child ran from behind a southbound car directly in front of the north-bound one, was also repeated by the witness.

Wing to the jury. Judge Smith\u2019s court room had been crowded all the afternoon by spectators, drawn thither by the unusual importance of the case, the fact that bribery was alleged to have been committed in the former trial and the expectation that the principal counsel for the plaintiff would put forth all his (pictures of ex-Judge Russell M. Wing showing the characteristic attitudes of little Emma Grenell\u2019s attorney pleading for damages against a street car company) powers in his closing argument. For three hours ex-Judge Wing pleaded for the little girl, and it was the universal opinion of the spectators who had followed the trial, that a heavy verdict would be the result of the plea.</p><p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-9\" pgmap=\"61\">\u2018 ATTACKS OAK COMPANY\u2019S METHODS.</p><p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-10\" pgmap=\"61(82) 62(51)\">\u2018 The fact that the witnesses for the plaintiff nearly all admitted having spent several days in the office of Alex. Sullivan and having been paid for their time, was made a basis of a general attack by ex-Judge Wing on the methods employed by the company. Glaring discrepancies in the testimony of the witnesses for the defense were brought to the jury\u2019s attention, and the attack of the company on Conductor'Olson by trying to prove that he had been discharged was shown to be due to the fact that Olson -was given his choice between quitting the company\u2019s service and testifying according to its wishes.

B. Janecke a copy of the Chicago Daily News, published on March 23, A. D. 1899; that he took from jurors Earl Anderson and another of said jurors, ivhose name this affiant does not remember, copies of the Chicago Becord, dated and published March 24th. A.

The jurors should not have read the article. * * * The publication of such articles during the pendency of important trials serves no good purpose, but, on the contrary, tends to impede and adulterate the stream of justice. This article results in giving a defendant a new trial in an important case, for we discern no other ground for a reversal of the cause, save the one now under consideration.\u201d People v.

As the case must be remanded for another trial, we do not deem it necessary or expedient to comment on the evidence further than to say that the evidence bearing on the question whether or not the accident was occasioned by appellant\u2019s negligence, is so conflicting and contradictory that, had the verdict been for the appellant, we would not be warranted in setting it aside on the ground of its being against the weight of evidence.</p> <p id=\"b65-3\" pgmap=\"65\">We regard the question whether the court erred in refusing to discharge the jury, or to grant a new trial, on account of the facts alleged in the affidavits set out in the preceding statement, the most serious presented by the record. It seems hardly necessary to say that the newspaper articles set forth in the affidavits, if seen by any juror, were eminently calculated to prejudice him against the appellant. If to prejudice the minds of the jurors against the appellant had been the intention, the articles could not have been more ingeniously devised to effect that purpose. The article of March 17th, published the next morning after the impaneling of the jury, states that the jury on the former trial had been bribed; that two of the jurors had so confessed to the State\u2019s attorney; that one of them was to receive $100 and another $75, and that they were both under bonds to appear at court. The article contains the name and residence of each juror, purports to describe the injuries of appellee, and states that the case is to be given another chance for \u201c justice.\u201d The publication in the Chicago Daily News of March 17, 1899, describes appellee\u2019s injuries and refers to the jury as \u201c the twelve men who are to decide whether the street railway company owning the car which mutilated the child shall make monetary recompense for her injuries.\u201d The article also refers to bribery of jurors on the former trial.</p> <p id=\"b65-4\" pgmap=\"65\">The article published in the Chicago Record, March 22, 1899, commenting on the evidence of the witnesses for appellant, states : \u201c On cross-examination it was revealed that most of the witnesses had been paid by the company for loss of time due to the suit, and that several days had been thus compensated for in nearly every case; \u201d also, that an attempt of appellant to break down the testimony of Olson, a witness for appellee, had met with a set-back; and that it appeared that one of appellant\u2019s principal witnesses had boarded with Mrs. Grenell, appellee\u2019s mother, a number of months, and left suddenly without pajdng his bill.</p> <p id=\"b65-6\" pgmap=\"65\">In the article of March 23, 1899, in the Chicago Record, this appears:</p> <blockquote id=\"b66-4\" pgmap=\"66\">\u201c The declaration made by several of the other witnesses for the defense, that the child ran from behind a south-bound car directly in front of the north-bound one, was also repeated by the witness. Several persons swore that these circumstances had attended the accident, but on cross-examination it was developed that they had been paid or expected to be paid by the company for testifying.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b66-5\" pgmap=\"66\">Mr. Prentice, in his affidavit, deposed that he saw a copy of the newspaper containing the article in the possession of Janecke, one of the jurors.</p> <p id=\"b66-6\" pgmap=\"66\">The article published in the Chicago Becord on the morning of March 24, 1899, after the argument of counsel had closed, and before the jury had been instructed, states that \u201c it was the universal opinion of the spectators who had followed the trial, that a heavy verdict would be the result of the plea.\u201d referring to Judge Wing\u2019s argument, and contains the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b66-7\" pgmap=\"66\">\u201cThe fact that the witnesses for the plaintiff nearly all admitted having spent several days in the office of Alex. Sullivan, and having been paid for their time, was made a basis of a general attack by ex-Judge Wing on the methods employed by the company. Glaring discrepancies in the testimony of the witnesses for the defense were brought to the jury\u2019s attention, and the attack of the company on Conductor Olson by trying to prove that he had been discharged, was shown to be due to the fact that Olson was given his choice between quitting the company\u2019s service and testifying according to his wishes. The falsehood of much of the testimony for the defense he said was evident, and he dwelt upon the point with impressive earnestness.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b66-8\" pgmap=\"66\">It appeal's by the affidavit of George W. Kroll, copied in the preceding statement. that he was the bailiff who attended the jury when they retired to the jury room to consider of their verdict, and that he took from juror William B. Janecke a copy of the Chicago Daily Hews of March 23, 1899, and from juror Earl Anderson and another juror copies of the Chicago Becord of March 24, 1899.</p> <p id=\"b66-9\" pgmap=\"66(44) 67(73)\">The articles, in effect, warned the jury that the eye of the public was on them; that it was expected that in justice to appellee they would give a heavy verdict; that their names and residences were known, and that if they should find for the appellant, they would subject themselves to the suspicion of bribery. The articles also plainly intimated that witnesses for appellant were bribed, or were, for other reasons, not worthy of credit. In short, the probable effect of the articles on the mind of the ordinary juror would be to prejudice him against the appellant and its witnesses, and to intimidate him, and swerve him from an impartial consideration of the case.</p> <p id=\"b67-4\" pgmap=\"67\">The only direct evidence that newspapers containing the articles in question came to the hands of the jurors, is that of Prentice, who deposed that he saw two of the jurors reading the article in the Chicago Record of May 21, 1899, and the newspaper containing that article in the hands of another, and also saw in the possession of juror Janecke a copy of the paper containing the article of March 23, 1899, and the affidavit of bailiff Kroll as to taking from jurors copies of the Chicago Daily News of March 23, 1899, and of the Chicago Record of March 21, 1899.</p> <p id=\"b67-5\" pgmap=\"67\">It has been held in cases like the present, that direct evidence that newspaper articles prejudicial to one of the parties were read by the jurors, or some of them, is not necessary to warrant the granting of a new trial;, that it may be inferred from circumstances that the jury read the articles.</p> <p id=\"b67-6\" pgmap=\"67\">In Meyer v. Cadwalader, 49 Fed. Rep. 32, a new trial was granted solely on the ground of publications .made during the trial of a character to prejudice the jury. The court, in its opinion, says :</p> <blockquote id=\"b67-7\" pgmap=\"67\">\u201cIt is idle to say that there is no direct evidence to show that the jury read these articles. They appeared in the daily issues of leading journals and were scattered broadcast over the community. The jury separated at the close of each session of the court, and it is incredible that, going out in the community, they did not read these newspaper publications.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b67-8\" pgmap=\"67(45) 68(54)\">But in the present case it is not necessary to resort to the presumption indulged in by the court in the case cited. The articles of March 21st, 23d and 24th have been traced to the hands of jurors, and there is positive evidence that two of the jurors read the article of March 21st, and that another had it in his hands. We think it a legitimate inference that the articles of March 23d and March 24th, which were as prejudicial to appellant as any published, were read bx the jurors in whose possession they were found.</p> <p id=\"b68-5\" pgmap=\"68\">That the reading by jurors of newspaper articles prejudicial to one of the parties is cause for a new trial, we regard as well settled. People v. McCoy, 71 Cal. 395; People v. Stokes, 103 Ib. 193; Cartwright v. The State, 71 Miss. 82; Walker et al. v. The State, 37 Tex. 366; Carter v. State, 77 Tenn. (9 Lea) 440; Farrer v. The State, 2 O. St. 54.</p> <p id=\"b68-6\" pgmap=\"68\">In the present case two of the jurors xvere named in Prentice\u2019s affidavit as persons whom he saw reading the article of March 21, 1899, and two from whom the bailiff took the articles of March 23d and March 24th are named in the bailiff\u2019s affidaxdt. Prior to the publications of March 33d and 24th, the jury were instructed by the court to refrain from reading anything in the newspapers about the case. Ho affidavits of jurors were produced denying the reading of the articles in question, although it is familiar law that the affidavits of jurors to sustain their verdict are admissible. We are of opinion that on the affidavits in respect to the articles in question, the court should have granted a new trial.</p> <p id=\"b68-7\" pgmap=\"68(140) 69(46)\">Appellant\u2019s counsel object to the refusal of the court to strike out the testimony of alleged incompetent witnesses as to the speed of the appellant\u2019s car at the time of the accident, the retention on the panel of a juror named Condon, whose discharge was moved by appellant on the ground, supported by affidavits, that in his examination he made false statements, thereby inducing his acceptance by appellant as a juror, when otherwise he xvould haxm been peremptorily challenged, and the refusal of certain of appellant\u2019s instructions. The question as to the competency of witnesses as to speed, value, etc., rests largely in the discretion of the court, and the witnesses having testified, we find no material error in the refusal of the court to exclude their evidence after their cross-examination. It was for the jury, who heard their evidence, to decide as to its weight and credibility. The question as to the retention of juror Condon on the panel is not likely to arise on another trial, and we do not deem, it necessary now to pass on that question.</p> <p id=\"b69-4\" pgmap=\"69\">The court gave twenty-seven instructions for appellant, fairly and fully instructing the jury as to the law of the case, and we find no material error in the refusal of instructions. No instructions were given on behalf of appellee.</p> <p id=\"b69-5\" pgmap=\"69\">Counsel further object to the exhibition to the jury of appellee\u2019s injured limbs. In this there was no error.</p> <p id=\"b69-6\" pgmap=\"69\">For the reason heretofore stated, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
