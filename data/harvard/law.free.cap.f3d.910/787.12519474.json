The firearms were found in his home, which police searched after obtaining a warrant based on finding three marijuana stems in a trash pull. Lyles filed a motion to suppress the evidence found in his home-including the firearms, ammunition, and marijuana-arguing that the trash pull did not provide probable cause for the search. The district court granted defendant's motion, and the government now appeals. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prince George's County Police, during an investigation unrelated to the present case, saw Lyles's phone number in a homicide victim's cell phone. They suspected that defendant might be relevant to that investigation. But it was only a hunch. So the police searched four trash bags found at a curb near Lyles's home and applied for a warrant to search Lyles's home based on what they found. The application's factual basis is quoted below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   During the month of January, 2015, members of the Prince George's County Police Department became involved in an investigation of the residence located at 9010 Ridgewood Dr., Ft. Washington, Prince George's County Maryland 20744. Investigators had become aware of possible connections between the residence, its occupants and unlawful activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to this investigation, on January 5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2014 [sic] Your Affiant along with Sergeant Logan #2528 observed four large green plastic bags were abandoned on the curb side of 9010 Ridgewood Dr., Ft. Washington, Prince George's County Maryland 20744. Your Affiant along with Sergeant Logan #2528 removed the four green plastic bags from the curb and upon inspection your Affiant found three unknown type plant stems, three empty packs of rolling papers and one document addressed to 9010 Ridgewood Dr., Ft. Washington, Prince George's County Maryland 20744. The stems were taken to the Prince George's County Drug Lab where they tested positive for marijuana by a forensic chemist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   That upon the above described information and your Affiant's knowledge, training and experience, your Affiant believes that there are controlled dangerous substances, Marijuana, and handguns\n   being stored, used and/or sold at 9010 Ridgewood Dr., Ft. Washington, Prince George's County Maryland 20744.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   J.A. 24-25 (emphasis omitted). The affidavit included only these limited facts and general averments that marijuana is often stored in secure locations and disposed of nearby. It sought to search the home for evidence of possession of controlled substances, possession with intent to distribute controlled substances, and money laundering.

The application provided the magistrate with no facts about the earlier, unrelated investigation involving the recovered phone. It did not identify a homeowner or name the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The magistrate judge, however, granted a warrant to search defendant's home\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   . The warrant provided broad permissions to search the home and \"any and all persons suspected to be involved in said illegal activities.\" J.A. 28. It authorized the police to seize essentially anything in the home, including cell phones, jewelry, records, diaries, and firearms. The police subsequently found four handguns, ammunition, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia in defendant's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A federal grand jury indicted Lyles under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) for possession of firearms as a convicted felon. Defendant asked the district court to suppress the evidence recovered from his home, arguing that the search warrant was issued without probable cause. The district court held two hearings and requested supplemental briefing on that issue. It ultimately suppressed the evidence, finding \"that the presence of only three marijuana stems and rolling paper ... does not establish a fair probability that additional marijuana will be found within the home.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

If so, the officers were lawfully inside Lyles's home, and the essential firearm and ammunition evidence might be saved under the plain view doctrine. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    California v.

See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Montieth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3850696\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/662/660/#p664\">\n    662 F.3d 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 664-65 (4th Cir. 2011) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The trash from a home often will contain a variety of private items and effects. The fact that someone wishes to dispose of something does not mean he intends all others to have access to it. One need only imagine the discomfort of watching a neighbor or stranger sift through trash bags recently left at the curb. Indeed, the relevance of items discovered in a trash pull is predicated on a connection between trash and the home. But the rationale for allowing warrantless trash searches is, ironically, predicated on the lack of a connection between trash and the privacy expectations in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Precisely because curbside trash is so readily accessible, trash pulls can be subject to abuse. Trash cans provide an easy way for anyone so moved to plant evidence. Guests leave their own residue which often ends up in the trash. None of this means that items pulled from trash lack evidentiary value. It is only to suggest that the open and sundry nature of trash requires that it be viewed with at least modest circumspection. Moreover, it is anything but clear that a scintilla of marijuana residue or hint of marijuana use in a trash can should support a sweeping search of a residence. The Supreme Court recognized similar dangers in searches incident to traffic stops, where allowing comprehensive searches following minor infractions would create \"a serious and recurring threat to the privacy of countless individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    Arizona v. Gant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653882\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/332/#p345\">\n    556 U.S. 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 345,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653882\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/332/#p345\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653882\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/332/#p345\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). That threat, like the threat posed by indiscriminate trash pulls, \"implicates the central concern underlying the Fourth Amendment-the concern about giving police officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a person's private effects.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653882\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/332/#p345\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The question, as so often in Fourth Amendment cases, is what precisely the facts show. Among four trash bags, the officers discovered three empty packs of rolling papers, a piece of mail addressed to the home, and three marijuana stems. That is all. It is unsurprising, then, that the government contended at oral argument that its reasoning would apply anytime a trash pull revealed a single marijuana stem, and nothing more. But the evidence in this case falls well short of the evidence in previous cases that upheld home search warrants based, in part, on trash pulls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gary\n   </em>\n   , we approved a search warrant issued after the police received an anonymous tip that a named individual was selling drugs from a home.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581086\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/528/324/#p328\">\n    528 F.3d at 328-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The government invites the court to infer from the trash pull evidence that additional drugs probably would have been found in Lyles's home. Well perhaps, but not probably. The government's argument has several shortcomings. This was a single trash pull, and thus one less likely to reveal evidence of recurrent or ongoing activity. And from that one trash pull, as defendant argues, \"[t]he tiny quantity of discarded residue gives no indication of how long ago marijuana may have been consumed in the home.\" Appellee Br. at 21. This case is almost singular in the sparseness of evidence pulled in one instance from the trash itself and the absence of other evidence to corroborate even that.

The warrant listed the following as items, evidence, and contraband to be seized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   1) Marijuana and any and all controlled dangerous substances, in whatever form, condition or however packaged, and to seize such paraphernalia that is used in the administration, preparation, and distribution or in conjunction with said illegal activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   2) Any books, records, and documents relating to the acquisition, possession or distribution of said controlled dangerous substances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   3) Any and all safes, locked boxes and receptacles that could contain any other items described in this warrant and to seize all contents which pertain to the said illegal activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   4) Any and all indicia of occupancy, residency, rental, and/or ownership of the premises described herein including, but not limited to, utility and telephone bills, canceled envelopes, rental, purchase or lease agreements, keys, photographs, clothing and personal toiletries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   5) To search any and all persons suspected to be involved in said illegal activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   6) To view all non-commercially produced video recordings, digital video discs, and any other analog or digital media.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   7) Any electronic equipment, such as computers, external hard drives, facsimile machines, digital pagers, cellular telephones, answering machines, surveillance equipment, and related manuals used to generate, record, and/or store the information described in this exhibit, and the contents therein. Additionally, computer software, tapes and discs, audio and video tapes and/or discs, and the contents therein, containing the information generated by the aforementioned electronic equipment and used in the aforementioned violations relating to the transportation, distribution, ordering and purchasing of controlled dangerous substances. Due to files that are password and/or encryption protected and due to the extensive time involved in data recovery, this search and seizure warrant authorizes the removal and examination of such electronic devices in a laboratory setting by trained personnel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   8) Any and all appointment books, diaries, calendars, financial records, work schedules, computer records, or other documents that detail the aforementioned violations or individuals involved in the aforementioned violations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   9) Any and all financial documents that are related to the placement of monies used in the aforementioned violations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   10) Any and all photographs, including still photos, negatives, video recordings, films, undeveloped film, external memory sticks, cards and discs and the content therein, slides, in particular photographs of co-conspirators, of assets and/or controlled dangerous substances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   11) Currency, precious metals, jewelry, and financial instruments, including stocks and bonds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   12) Firearms, including but not limited to: handguns, pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns, machine guns, and any and all other weapons, as well as ammunition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   13) To search any and all vehicles parked on or about the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   J.A. 28-29 (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It is fair to gauge the breadth of a warrant with an eye toward the purposes for which it was secured. This astoundingly broad warrant-resembling a general warrant-was chiefly based, as noted, on finding three marijuana stems in the trash. But it empowered the police to seize a host of things seemingly unconnected to marijuana possession. It permitted, for starters, the seizure of any computers, toiletries, or jewelry, and the search of every book, record, and document in the home.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%20547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at paras. 2, 4, 7, 8, 11. The connection of such things to the personal possession of marijuana is, to put it gently, tenuous. The warrant also allowed the search and seizure of any cell phones in the home. J.A. 28 at para. 7. The Supreme Court has recognized that \"cell phones, as a category, implicate privacy concerns far beyond those implicated by the search of a cigarette pack, a wallet, or a purse.\"\n   <em>\n    Riley v. California\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/#p2488\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2488-89,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/#p2488\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). But cell phones also carry more information that can be essential to an investigation than do cigarette packs, wallets, or purses. We need not explore that tension here, as the warrant application lacked any nexus between cell phones and marijuana possession. There is insufficient reason to believe that any cell phone in the home, no matter who owns it, will reveal evidence pertinent to marijuana possession simply because three marijuana stems were found in a nearby trash bag. At some point an inference becomes, in Fourth Amendment terms, an improbable leap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The warrant also allowed officers \"[t]o search any and all persons suspected to be involved in said illegal activities.\" J.A. 28 at para. 5 (listing this among the items to be seized). But this warrant did not limit those searches to particular people or even to a particular location. \"[A]s long as there is good reason to suspect or believe that anyone present at the anticipated scene will probably be a participant in the criminal activity occurring there, presence becomes the descriptive fact satisfying the aim of the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9231380\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/267/#p277\">\n    372 F.3d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted) (analyzing warrant to search all persons in a residence). But the miniscule quantity of marijuana detected in the trash pull, again, does not provide the requisite foundation to search any and all persons in the home, let alone any other location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This case, ultimately, touches on the Fourth Amendment's independent requirement that \"all searches and seizures must be reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Kentucky v.
