We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Sentencing Guidelines establish a higher base offense level for a felon-in-possession who has a prior conviction for a \"crime of violence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A \"crime of violence\" includes, among other things, \"any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that ... has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). To determine whether an offense meets this definition, we look to the \"elements of the offense as defined in the statute of conviction rather than to the facts underlying [the] prior conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indeed, we recently concluded that a prior version of Missouri's\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   -degree-robbery statute, which consisted of\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the forcibly-steals-property element,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mo.

As we explained, the statute \"require[d] proof [of] physical force or threatened ... physical force,\" and there was \"no realistic probability that Missouri courts would apply [the law] to conduct that does not involve force that is capable of causing physical pain or injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 672 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    at 671-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting state-court decisions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   It follows that first-degree robbery, which also has the element of \"forcibly steal[ing] property,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20569.020.1\">\n    Mo.

To be sure,\n   <em>\n    Swopes\n   </em>\n   addressed the phrase \"violent felony,\" found in ACCA, and not \"crime of violence,\" which appears in the Guidelines.
