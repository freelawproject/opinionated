Specifically, he claims that his former employer wrongfully terminated him, and that his union breached its duty of fair representation in its handling of his resulting grievance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The district court found that the collective bargaining agreement required Staudner to exhaust the agreement's grievance procedures before filing suit in federal\n   court, and that Staudner had failed to do so. Interpreting this exhaustion requirement as a prerequisite to its jurisdiction over the case, the district court dismissed Staudner's action. We find that the district court erred in two respects: first, in treating exhaustion as a matter of jurisdiction; and second, in holding that this collective bargaining agreement in fact required exhaustion. Accordingly, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Patrick Staudner worked for Robinson Aviation, Inc., as an air traffic controller for fourteen years. During that time, he regularly received successful performance reviews. According to Staudner, however, toward the end of his tenure, his relationship with his direct supervisor soured. Staudner contends that the resulting personal animosity caused Robinson Aviation to fire him in November 2014-roughly a month after his latest successful performance review. Robinson Aviation justified Staudner's termination by pointing to a number of minor breaches of airport policy: Staudner parked (partially) in the wrong spot, did not stop when entering the parking lot, and did not lock his car. Robinson Aviation also indicated that Staudner twice failed to lock the air traffic control tower following a shift, allegations that Staudner denies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under the collective bargaining agreement negotiated between Robinson Aviation and Staudner's union, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, Staudner may be terminated only \"for just cause.\" J.A. 38. Because Staudner believes that his supervisor fired him for personal reasons, and that Robinson Aviation's stated reasons are pretextual, he argues that his termination violated the collective bargaining agreement. For support, Staudner points to his consistently positive performance reviews, as well as his supervisor's admission that he had never before disciplined an employee for failing to park in the correct spot or lock his car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Staudner filed a grievance to appeal his termination under the four-step process set out by the collective bargaining agreement. As described by the agreement, the first three steps involve filing written grievances with Robinson Aviation officials of escalating authority, culminating with a decision from the chief executive officer or a designee. At step four, the grievance goes to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Robinson Aviation denied Staudner's grievance at each of the first three steps of this process. Although the union offered some assistance with Staudner's claim in the earlier steps, when Staudner attempted to initiate the fourth and final step, the union informed him that it did not believe his case warranted arbitration. Staudner contacted the designated arbitration service on his own, and reached out to Robinson Aviation to begin the arbitrator selection process-the first step of arbitration under the agreement. Robinson Aviation refused to participate, informing Staudner that only the union could force it to arbitrate. After the union gave Staudner express permission to proceed individually, Staudner attempted again to initiate arbitration. Again Robinson Aviation refused to arbitrate, and Staudner filed suit in federal court in the Eastern District of North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Staudner's complaint included claims against both Robinson Aviation and his union under \u00a7 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). He claimed that Robinson Aviation violated the collective bargaining agreement by firing him without just cause, and that the\n   union breached its duty of fair representation by declining to take his grievance to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In their answers, neither defendant asserted that Staudner failed to exhaust the collective bargaining agreement's grievance procedures. Instead, the union moved for summary judgment on the merits, contending that Staudner failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact regarding his \u00a7 301(a) claims. The district court denied the union's motion. The court held that Staudner had introduced sufficient evidence to suggest that his wrongful discharge claim had merit, and that the union's pursuit of that claim was so minimal that a genuine dispute existed as to whether the union had breached its duty of fair representation by declining to arbitrate that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At that point, the union raised the exhaustion issue in a motion to dismiss Staudner's action under Rule 12(b)(1). According to the union, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the suit because Staudner had failed to exhaust his remedies under the collective bargaining agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This time, the district court granted the union's motion. The court began by recognizing that the Supreme Court has established an exhaustion requirement under \u00a7 301(a), under which an \"employer cannot be held liable for breach of a collective bargaining agreement unless it can be shown that the employee unsuccessfully sought relief through the union grievance procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Staudner v.

Under the first, an employee may forego exhaustion where the union \"breached its duty of fair representation in its handling of the employee's grievance.\"\n   <em>\n    Vaca v.

Under the second, an employee need not exhaust \"when the conduct of the employer amounts to a repudiation of those contractual procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/#p185\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/#p185\">\n    at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/#p185\">\n    87 S.Ct. 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court considered each exception and determined that Staudner qualified for neither.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   First, the district court rejected Staudner's argument that the union's refusal to take his claim to arbitration amounted to a breach of its duty of fair representation, excepting him from the need to exhaust. As the district court read the collective bargaining agreement, Staudner was permitted to arbitrate his grievance even without the union's participation. It followed, the court reasoned, that Staudner could not invoke the exception for union breach of duty, because any breach by his union did not have the effect of preventing him from arbitrating his claim and thus exhausting the agreement's grievance procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Groves v. Commc'n Workers of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147401\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/177/#p182\">\n    815 F.3d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182 (4th Cir. 2016) (exception for union breach applies only when there is \"some causal nexus between a union's breach of its duty of fair representation and an employee's failure to exhaust contractual remedies\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court then turned to the second exception, for cases in which an employer repudiates contractual grievance procedures. According to the district court, Robinson Aviation's repeated refusals to arbitrate with Staudner without his union's participation did not amount to a \"repudiation\" for purposes of this exception. Although the court had ruled that Staudner in fact could arbitrate without his union, it found that Robinson Aviation nevertheless \"was acting on what it\n   <em>\n    perceived\n   </em>\n   to be its right to decline [Staudner's] invitation to arbitrate,\" rather than repudiating the agreement's grievance procedures.\n   <em>\n    Staudner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265626\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/267/679/#p682\">\n    267 F.Supp.3d at 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Having concluded that Staudner failed to exhaust, and that no exception to the exhaustion requirement applied, the district court granted the union's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We turn first to the district court's assumption that the exhaustion requirement at issue here is jurisdictional.

In this case, however, it makes no difference: Even if exhaustion were an element of Staudner's claim, so that the defendants were entitled to raise failure to exhaust late in the proceedings, the defendants cannot prevail on their exhaustion argument for the reasons we turn to now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The district court, as described above, focused its exhaustion analysis on the exceptions to the exhaustion requirement. But before we reach the matter of exceptions, we must determine whether this agreement requires exhaustion at all. As the Supreme Court has explained, the exhaustion requirement is not a freestanding rule of law, but rather a matter of contract enforcement, holding parties to their agreement to make a contractual grievance process the \"exclusive remedy\" for breaches of that contract.\n   <em>\n    Vaca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/#p185\">\n    386 U.S. at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/#p185\">\n    87 S.Ct. 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So the threshold question is whether the parties here in fact have agreed to a mandatory and exclusive grievance process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We conclude that they have not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This agreement's plain language does not make its grievance procedures exclusive. Instead, Article 19, Section 4 of the agreement-entitled\n   \"Dispute Resolution\"-provides to the contrary, and expressly so: \"An employee shall have the option of utilizing the unfair labor practice procedures as provided by law\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   other such avenues as provided by law\n   <em>\n    or the grievance/arbitration procedures contained in this Article\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. 48 (emphases added). Staudner contends that this language makes the agreement's grievance procedures optional, not mandatory, and we agree. By plain terms, it is up to the employee to choose the forum in which to resolve a dispute-and those choices include \"other such avenues as provided by law,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/#p185\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , a formulation broad enough to encompass Staudner's current \u00a7 301(a) action. And consistent with the clear import of Section 4, the agreement throughout uses only permissive, not mandatory, language to describe an employee's grievance-procedure options.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 49 (\"[A]n employee who\n   <em>\n    chooses to use\n   </em>\n   this grievance procedure shall indicate ... whether or not the employee shall be represented by the Union.\" (emphasis added) ); J.A. 50 (\"Within seven (7) days of an event giving rise to a grievance ..., an employee\n   <em>\n    may submit\n   </em>\n   a written grievance.\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The defendants do not dispute this plain reading of their agreement. They do, however, suggest that even if the agreement does not require that all employees use the grievance procedures, it does require that an employee who initiates a grievance (as Staudner did here) take that grievance all the way through arbitration. But again, the clear terms of the agreement are to the contrary. At each step of the grievance process, the agreement gives employees the\n   <em>\n    option\n   </em>\n   of escalating to the next; there is no\n   <em>\n    requirement\n   </em>\n   that they do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 50 (providing that employee dissatisfied with determination at step one or two \"may appeal\"). And arbitration is no exception: \"If dissatisfied with the decision [at step three], the employee\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   present the grievance ... for arbitration.\" J.A. 51 (emphasis added). Nothing in this agreement commits employees-even those who have initiated the grievance process-to mandatory arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We note that even if the agreement did put employees to the all-or-nothing choice envisioned by defendants-allowing employees either to forgo the grievance process altogether or to complete all its steps-it is not clear that it would establish a single \"exclusive remedy\" for purposes of the Supreme Court's exhaustion doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vaca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/#p185\">\n    386 U.S. at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/#p185\">\n    87 S.Ct. 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A central concern of the exhaustion doctrine is that when parties have agreed to make grievance procedures the exclusive means for settling their disputes, they should not be permitted to circumvent that agreement by going to court instead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maddox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11732825\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/379/650/#p652\">\n    379 U.S. at 652-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11732825\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/379/650/#p652\">\n    85 S.Ct. 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Vaca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/#p185\">\n    386 U.S. at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/#p185\">\n    87 S.Ct. 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But an agreement under which employees may choose as an initial matter to bring their claims directly to court has not made the internal grievance procedure\n   an \"exclusive remedy,\" and does not implicate that concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   That brings us to defendants' more fundamental argument: that federal law requires Staudner to exhaust even if the agreement does not. That argument misconceives the nature of the exhaustion requirement, which is grounded in contract principles and, as noted above, applies only when \"the bargaining agreement contains grievance and arbitration provisions which are intended to provide the exclusive remedy for breach of contract claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Vaca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/#p185\">\n    386 U.S. at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/#p185\">\n    87 S.Ct. 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
