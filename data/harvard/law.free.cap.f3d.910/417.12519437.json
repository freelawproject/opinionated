He structured his businesses to offer these payday loans exclusively through a number of proprietary websites with names like \"500FastCash,\" \"OneClickCash,\" and \"Ameriloan.\" Although these sites operated under different names, each disclosed the same loan information in an identical set of loan documents. Between 2008 and 2012, Tucker's businesses originated more than 5 million payday loans, each generally disbursing between $150 and $800 at a triple-digit interest rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The application process was simple. Potential borrowers would navigate to one of Tucker's websites and enter some personal, employment, and financial information. Such information included the applicant's bank account and routing numbers so that the lender could deposit the funds and-when the bill came due-make automatic withdrawals. Approved borrowers were directed to a web page that disclosed the loan's terms and conditions by hyperlinking to seven documents. The most important of these documents was the Loan Note and Disclosure (\"Loan Note\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provided the essential terms of the loan as mandated by the Truth in Lending Act (\"TILA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .

Thus, the Commission asked the court permanently to enjoin Tucker from engaging in consumer lending and to order him to disgorge \"ill-gotten-monies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In December 2012, the parties agreed to bifurcate the proceedings in the district court into a \"liability phase\" and a \"relief phase.\" During the liability phase, the Commission moved for summary judgment on the FTC Act claim, which the district court granted. In the relief phase, the court enjoined Tucker from assisting \"any consumer in receiving or applying for any loan or other extension of Consumer Credit,\" and ordered Tucker to pay approximately $1.27 billion in equitable monetary relief to the Commission. The district court instructed the Commission to direct as much money as practicable to \"direct redress to consumers,\" then to \"other equitable relief ... reasonably related to the Defendants' practices alleged in the complaint,\" and then to \"the U.S. Treasury as disgorgement.\" Tucker timely appeals and challenges both the entry of summary judgment and the relief order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Tucker first argues that the district court wrongly granted the Commission's motion for summary judgment finding Tucker liable for violating \u00a7 5 of the FTC Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits \"deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

Instead, it must show only that the \"net impression\" of the representation would be likely to mislead-even if such impression \"also contains truthful disclosures.\"\n   <em>\n    FTC v. Cyberspace.com LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3336776\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1196/#p1200\">\n    453 F.3d 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1200 (9th Cir. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In this case, the Commission argues that Tucker violated \u00a7 5 because the Loan Note was likely to mislead borrowers about the terms of the loan. The top third of such Loan Note contained the so-called TILA box, which disclosed the \"amount financed,\" the \"finance charge,\" the \"total of payments,\" and the \"annual percentage rate.\" The \"amount financed\" portion of the box was the amount borrowed, and the \"finance charge\" was equal to 30 percent of the borrowed amount. The final two figures were calculated by summing the principal and the finance charge (\"total of payments\") and then determining the \"annual percentage rate.\" By way of illustration, suppose that a customer wanted to borrow $300. The Loan Note's TILA box would state that the \"amount financed\" was $300, that the \"finance charge\" was $90, and that the \"total of payments\" was $390. The \"annual percentage rate\" would vary based on the date the first payment was due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   But the fine print\n   <em>\n    below\n   </em>\n   the TILA box was essential to understanding the loan's terms. This densely packed text set out two alternative payment scenarios: (1) the \"decline-to-renew\" option and (2) the \"renewal\" option. Beneath the TILA box, the Loan Note stated: \"Your Payment Schedule will be: 1 payment of [the 'total of payments' number] ... if you decline* the option of renewing your loan.\" The asterisk\n   directed the reader to text five lines further down the page, which read: \"To decline this option of renewal, you must select your payment options using the Account Summary link sent to your email at least three business days before your loan is due.\" Tucker would send this \"Account Summary link\" three days after the funds were disbursed. With this email, borrowers hoping to exercise the decline-to-renew option had to navigate through an online customer-service portal, affirmatively choose to \"change the Scheduled\" payment, and agree to \"Pay Total Balance.\" All of this had to be done \"at least three business days\" before the next scheduled payment. Thus, the borrower had to take\n   <em>\n    affirmative action\n   </em>\n   within a specified time frame if he hoped to pay only the amount listed in the TILA box as the \"total of payments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   By contrast, the \"renewal\" option would end up costing a borrower significantly more. Importantly, renewing the loan did not require the borrower to take any affirmative action at all; it was the default payment schedule. On the third line below the TILA box, the Loan Note read: \"If renewal is accepted you will pay the finance charge ... only.\" And with each \"renewal,\" the borrower would \"accrue new finance charges\"-that is, an additional 30-percent premium. After the fourth renewal, Tucker would begin to withdraw the \"finance charge plus $50,\" and he would withdraw another such payment each subsequent period until the loan was paid in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To illustrate, consider again the example of the customer who wanted to borrow $300. The Loan Note's TILA box would indicate that his \"total of payments\" would be $390, equaling $300 in principal plus a $90 finance charge. But he would be required to pay much more than that, unless he took the affirmative steps to \"decline\" to renew the loan. Once again, these steps required him to wait three days after getting the cash, follow a link in a separate email, and agree at least three days before the due date to pay the full balance. If he failed to perform this routine, then he would owe yet another finance change (equaling another 30 percent of the borrower's remaining balance) at the next due date. And if he simply let Tucker automatically withdraw the payments for the course of the loan, he would owe the $300 principal, plus\n   <em>\n    ten\n   </em>\n   separate finance charges, each equaling 30 percent of the borrower's remaining balance. Altogether, a borrower following the default plan would pay $975 instead of $390.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We agree with the Commission that the Loan Note was deceptive because it did not accurately disclose the loan's terms. Most prominently, the TILA box suggested that the value reported as the \"total of payments\"-described further as the \"amount you will have paid after you have made the scheduled payment\"-would equal the full cost of the loan. In reliance on this information, a reasonable consumer might expect to pay only that amount. But as we have described, under the default terms of the loan, a consumer would be required to pay much more. Indeed, under the terms that Tucker actually enforced, borrowers had to perform a series of affirmative actions in order to decline to renew the loan and thus pay only the amount reported in the TILA box.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Loan Note's fine print does not reasonably clarify these terms because it is riddled with still more misleading statements. First, the explanation of the process of declining to renew the loan is buried several lines below where the option to decline is first introduced. Second, nothing in the fine print explicitly states that the\n   loan's \"renewal\" would be the\n   <em>\n    automatic\n   </em>\n   consequence of inaction. Instead, it misleadingly says that such renewal must be \"accepted,\" which seems to require the borrower to perform some affirmative action. Third, between the sentence that introduces the decline-to-renew option and the sentences that explain the costly consequences of renewal, there is a long and irrelevant sentence about what happens if a pay date falls on a weekend or holiday. Thus, the fine print's oblique description of the loan's terms fails to cure the misleading \"net impression\" created by the TILA box.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Tucker suggests, however, that the Loan Note is not deceptive because it is \"technically correct.\" But the FTC Act's consumer-friendly standard does not require only technical accuracy. In\n   <em>\n    Cyberspace\n   </em>\n   , we held that a solicitation was deceptive even though \"the fine print notices ... on the reverse side of the\" solicitation contained \"truthful disclosures.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3336776\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1196/#p1200\">\n    453 F.3d at 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Cyberspace\n   </em>\n   held that it was irrelevant that \"most consumers [could] understand the fine print on the back of the solicitation when that language [was] specifically brought to their attention.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3336776\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1196/#p1200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3336776\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1196/#p1200\">\n    at 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Just as in\n   <em>\n    Cyberspace\n   </em>\n   , consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances-here, by looking to the terms of the Loan Note to understand their obligations-likely could be deceived by the representations made there. Therefore, we agree with the Commission that the Loan Note was deceptive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Tucker further contends that the district court erred because its narrow focus on the Loan Note fails to capture the \"net impression\" on consumers. The district court found that \"any facts other than the terms of the Loan Note ... and their presentation in the document are immaterial to a summary judgment determination.\" But according to Tucker, the court should have considered all of his loan disclosures and all of his communications regarding those disclosures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Tucker's argument wrongly assumes that non-deceptive business practices can somehow cure the deceptive nature of the Loan Note. The Act prohibits deceptive \"acts\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   practices,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (emphasis added), so it gives the Commission flexibility to bring suit either for particular misleading representations, or for generally deceptive business practices.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

Under this standard, the district court's focus on the Loan Note-that is, on this particular deceptive \"representation\"-was perfectly permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Tucker next argues that summary judgment was also inappropriate because he demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact by presenting affirmative evidence from which a jury could find in his favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Tucker cites a host of evidence in support of this point, but only two of his arguments merit our attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   First, Tucker claims that the Commission introduced evidence that \"contradicted\" its theory of deception because four deposed consumers \"had not read the loan disclosures\" and \"understood the disclosures upon reading them at their depositions.\" Thus, Tucker argues that there is some evidence that consumers may not have regularly\n   <em>\n    read\n   </em>\n   the supposedly deceptive Loan Note. And if customers were not likely to read the Loan Note in the first place, the argument goes, then it cannot be likely to deceive them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   But Tucker once again misunderstands the consumer-friendly standards of \u00a7 5 of the FTC Act. We have held that \"[p]roof of actual deception is unnecessary to establish a violation,\" and thus Tucker can be liable if the Loan Note itself \"possess[es] a tendency to deceive.\"\n   <em>\n    Trans World Accounts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"512866\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/594/212/#p214\">\n    594 F.2d at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we held in\n   <em>\n    Cyberspace\n   </em>\n   that the terms of a solicitation alone were deceptive such that \"no reasonable factfinder could conclude that the solicitation was not likely to deceive consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3336776\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1196/#p1200\">\n    453 F.3d at 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . True enough, we also stated in\n   <em>\n    Cyberspace\n   </em>\n   that proof of actual deception is \"highly probative,\" but we did so only to \"bolster[ ]\" our conclusion that the solicitation itself \"created [a] deceptive impression.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3336776\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1196/#p1200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3336776\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1196/#p1200\">\n    at 1200-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, however, Tucker points to no evidence that consumers who\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   read the Loan Note understood its terms. Tucker therefore fails to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, Tucker claims that the expert testimony offered by Dr. David Scheffman demonstrated an \"absence of confusion or deception.\" Tucker's counsel retained Dr. Scheffman, who earned his doctorate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to \"opine on whether the economic evidence regarding borrower behavior\" was consistent with the Commission's theory of liability. He designed his analysis \"to test for any material difference in the behavior of inexperienced consumers that would indicate their understanding of the loan terms was different from highly experienced consumers.\" In other words, he wanted to determine whether first-time borrowers behaved like those who took out multiple loans. If first-time borrowers behaved just like the repeat borrowers, Dr. Scheffman reasoned, then the first-time borrowers could not have been misled about the loan terms. Because there was a \"near-perfect ... correlation between payoff behavior\" among borrowers, Dr. Scheffman concluded that the data were \"inconsistent with the allegation that borrowers were misled.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   But Dr. Scheffman's reasoning begs the question. Consistent payoff patterns among classes of consumers show, at best, that the consumers were similarly aware of their obligations. While Dr. Scheffman concludes that first-time borrowers were just as well informed as the repeat ones, it is equally plausible that the repeat borrowers were just as confused as those taking out their first loans. As the district court noted, the expert's analysis simply assumed that repeat borrowers \"plainly understood the loan terms.\" He did not, however, offer any evidence \"that repeat borrowers across loan portfolios knew they were dealing with the same enterprise.\" To survive summary judgment, Tucker must identify some specific factual disagreement that could lead a fact-finder to conclude that the Loan Note was not likely to deceive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stefanchik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5656737\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/559/924/#p928\">\n    559 F.3d at 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dr. Scheffman's testimony offers only speculative analysis that could cut either way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McIndoe v. Huntington Ingalls Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6814184\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/1170/#p1173\">\n    817 F.3d 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1173 (9th Cir. 2016) (\"Arguments based on conjuncture or speculation are insufficient....\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ).Therefore, Dr. Scheffman's testimony does not raise a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We conclude that the Loan Note was likely to deceive a consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances. We are therefore satisfied that the district court did not err in entering summary judgment against Tucker as to the liability phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Tucker next challenges the relief phase determination that he must pay the Commission $1.27 billion. He urges that the district court did not have the power to order equitable monetary relief under \u00a7 13(b) of the FTC Act. Alternatively, he argues that the order to pay $1.27 billion overstates his unjust gains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Tucker contends that the Commission \"improperly use[d] Section 13(b) to pursue penal monetary relief under the guise of equitable authority.\" After all, he points out, \u00a7 13(b) provides only that district courts may enter \"injunction[s].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2053\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). According to Tucker, an order to pay \"equitable monetary relief\" is not an injunction, so he concludes that the statute does not authorize the court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Tucker's argument has some force, but it is foreclosed by our precedent. We have repeatedly held that \u00a7 13 \"empowers district courts to grant any ancillary relief necessary to accomplish complete justice, including restitution.\"\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

The court arrived at such figure based on the calculations of one of the Commission's analysts. The analyst relied on data from Tucker's loan management software to determine how much money Tucker received from consumers in excess of the principal disbursed plus the initial 30-percent finance charge. This surplus represented the amount of money that Tucker had received over-and-above the amount disclosed in the TILA box, which the Commission argued represented Tucker's ill-gotten gains. The district court agreed, so the final sum it ordered Tucker to pay was calculated as follows: the sum of each consumer's payments to Tucker, minus the sum of each consumer's \"total of payments\" as disclosed in the TILA box, and minus certain other payments already made or to be made by other defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Tucker responds that the district court erred because it ignored evidence of non-deception that should have reduced\n   the award. Once again, Tucker reiterates the argument that repeat customers could not have been misled by the loan's terms. Therefore, he concludes, these customers should have been excluded from the calculation. As we said above, however, Tucker has not pointed to specific evidence that indicates one way or another whether repeat customers were actually deceived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.C. Further, Tucker has not offered \"a reliable method of quantifying what portion of the consumers who purchased [the product] did so free from deception.\"\n   <em>\n    Commerce Planet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146856\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/593/#p598\">\n    815 F.3d at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The general thread connecting these remedies was that they did not \"impose\n   <em>\n    personal liability\n   </em>\n   on the defendant, but ... restore[d] to the plaintiff\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   funds or property in the defendant's possession.\"\n   <em>\n    Great-West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108127\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/204/\">\n    534 U.S. at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108127\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/204/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Nevertheless, restitution under \u00a7 13(b) is still inapposite. Generally, a suit for an accounting was proper only if (1) \"the legal remedy was inadequate because of the complexity of the accounts\" or (2) \"there was a pre-existing equitable duty to account\" because of some fiduciary relationship. 1 Dobbs, \u00a7 4.3(5), at 609;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   4 S.

Neither is true here: the borrowers defrauded by Tucker could establish precisely how much they lost simply by producing bank statements, and the defendant was not in a \"fiduciary relationship\" with such borrowers. More fundamentally, however, the Commission cannot possibly claim that it seeks to recover \"monies owed by the fiduciary or other wrongdoer ... which in equity and good conscience belong[ ] to the\n   <em>\n    plaintiff\n   </em>\n   \"-here, the Commission. 1 Dobbs, \u00a7 4.3(b), at 608 (emphasis added).

In other words, in this case, to affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment, we must conclude from the proofs presented that no reasonable juror could find other than that a reasonable consumer would likely be deceived by the Loan Note. This is difficult to do when the whole of the Loan Note is read. It is undisputed that a careful reading of the Loan Note and its fine print reveals the automatic renewal feature, whereby borrowers' loans would be automatically renewed unless they navigated to a link sent to their email and chose to pay their total balance. Because the Loan Note includes truthful disclosures, we can say it is \"likely to deceive\" as a matter of law only by positing two scenarios: (1) it is unreasonable as a matter of law to expect the average consumer to read all the words of the Loan Note, including the fine print, or (2) as a matter of law, it is unreasonable to expect the average consumer to understand all the words of the Loan Note in the manner in which they are displayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As to the first point, I know of no authority that says consumers need not read the fine print of their contracts; such a holding would certainly imperil the validity of many insurance contracts. And as to the second point, to say it is unreasonable to expect the average consumer to understand the words of the Loan Note in the manner in which they are displayed, we would have to recognize either that the three judges of this panel are better text readers than is the average consumer or that judges are not average consumers. I don't know of any authority for recognizing either assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Indeed, we, a panel of three judges, have read and understood the terms of the Loan Note. We have not been deceived. Yet, we hold that the Loan Note is likely to deceive the average consumer\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Under this court's precedent, I accept that we may decide that the Loan Note is deceptive as a matter of law under \u00a7 5 of the FTC Act.\n   <em>\n    SeeFTC v. Cyberspace.com LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3336776\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1196/#p1200\">\n    453 F.3d 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1200 (9th Cir. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   What is determinative under\n   <em>\n    Cyberspace\n   </em>\n   is whether the \"net impression\" of the questioned text is likely to deceive.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3336776\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1196/#p1200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This rule seems to require a judge consciously to blur his eyes as to the actual print to gain an \"impression,\" or perhaps to see the print as French impressionist masters of the late Nineteenth Century saw objects. But whether we are guided by impressions from words or words themselves,\n   <em>\n    Cyberspace\n   </em>\n   defies logic when the words are actually understood by the judge to state something other than the \"net impression\" that is claimed \"likely to deceive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   If something is \"likely to deceive,\" it means it will more probably than not deceive. To predict what is \"likely\" to happen is to predict an event. An event is a fact, yet to occur. It did not occur when we read the Loan Note. I am at a loss to understand how we can find it would ineluctably occur in the case of an average reasonable consumer. It seems the event may occur or may not occur. If so, whether it occurs in every case can be disputed. Disputed factual questions are reserved for juries, not for district judges acting alone nor for a panel of appellate judges. Thus, while our precedent obliges me to concur in this case, I think our precedent is wrong. Courts should reserve questions such as whether the Loan Note is \"likely to deceive\" for the trier of fact.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Congress passed \u00a7 13(b) in 1973 and \u00a7 19 in 1975.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, \u00a7 408(F), Pub.
