Four years later, Petitioner, who is a dual citizen of Israel and Belgium, submitted a petition to the Transportation Security Administration (\"TSA\"). She sought removal from the watch list or an explanation for her presence on it. Several months later, TSA mailed a final disposition to Petitioner at her home in Israel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TSA Order of July 28, 2017 (\"Order\"),\n   <em>\n    reprinted in\n   </em>\n   Joint Appendix (\"J.A.\") 40-41. The Order stated that TSA would \"neither confirm nor deny any information about [Petitioner] which may be within federal watchlists or reveal any law enforcement sensitive information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40. Petitioner then petitioned this court, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2046110\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for review of the Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Petitioner contends that TSA's disposition of her inquiry violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") because the agency failed to explain whether or why she was still on a watch list. Petitioner's petition for review comes too late. Section 46110(a) provides that a petition for review of a disputed order must be filed not later than 60 days after the order is issued unless there are reasonable grounds for not filing by the 60th day. Petitioner's petition was filed after the statutory deadline and there are no \"reasonable grounds\" justifying her untimely filing. We therefore deny the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   TSA is tasked with ensuring safety in commercial airline travel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20114\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). In furtherance of that directive, TSA maintains two watch lists as part of the Secure Flight Program: a \"No Fly\" list and a \"Selectee\" list.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20114\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 44903(j)(2)(A), (C)(i)-(ii). Individuals on the No Fly list are prohibited from boarding airplanes that are traveling to the United States, while individuals on the Selectee list are subject to more rigorous screening. \"If an individual believes he or she has been improperly or unfairly delayed or prohibited from boarding an aircraft ... as a result of [TSA's] Secure Flight program,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201560.205\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1560.205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the individual may submit a petition to the Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (\"TRIP\"),\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1560.205(b).

Once it has gathered all the information it deems necessary, \"TSA, in coordination with the [Terrorist Screening Center] and other appropriate Federal law enforcement or intelligence agencies, if necessary, will review all the documentation and information requested from the individual, correct any erroneous information, and provide the individual with a timely written response.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201560.205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1560.205(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   An individual's placement on the No Fly or Selectee list, as well as any explanation for the placement, is \"Sensitive Security Information\" that is restricted from public access.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201560.205\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1520.5(b)(9)(ii).

The Order further stated that it constituted the \"final agency decision\" on Petitioner's redress request, and informed Petitioner of her right to seek review of the Order within sixty days under \u00a7 46110.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 41. The letter embodying the Order was dated July 28, 2017. Petitioner acknowledges that she received the Order at her address in Israel on August 13, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petitioner's Br. at 13. She filed this petition challenging the disposition of her redress request on September 28, 2017, sixty-two days after the letter's date of July 28, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Petitioner has received two other notifications from U.S. Government officials. First, around the same time when Petitioner received TSA's Order responding to her\n   redress request, she received a notification from U.S. Customs and Border Protection regarding the denial of her Electronic System for Travel Authorization (\"ESTA\") application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 44-45. ESTA determines whether a person qualifies to travel to the United States pursuant to the Visa Waiver Program (\"VWP\").\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 44. The VWP \"is administered by DHS and enables eligible citizens of certain countries to travel to the United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less without obtaining a visa.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . However, Petitioner was advised that \"individuals who are found ineligible to travel to the United States or those whose travel would pose a law enforcement or security risk are refused a travel authorization.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The letter also said that if Petitioner wished to dispute the ESTA denial, she could \"make an appointment at the U.S. Embassy and apply for a visa.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201560.205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, in July 2018, Petitioner was denied a non-immigrant visa on the ground that she had failed to demonstrate that she had sufficient \"ties [to] compel [her] to return to [her] home country after [her] travel to the United States.\" Letter of Respondent, Exh. A,\n   <em>\n    Matar v. TSA\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-1213 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 12, 2018). This determination cannot be appealed.

Petitioner also acknowledges that TSA did not respond to her fax and email communications or otherwise give her any false impressions that agency officials might address her concerns without resort to litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. TSA's Order plainly stated that it was final and appealable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, J.A. 41. That Petitioner attempted to contact TSA via email and fax of her own volition instead of filing a petition for review does not constitute reasonable grounds for delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Petitioner also argues that it was reasonable for her to believe that TSA would address her concerns without being ordered to do so by a court because TSA allegedly violated its own internal policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petitioner's Br. at 28-29. This is a perplexing argument. If, as Petitioner claims, TSA somehow violated its internal policies, that should have prompted her to file a timely petition for review under \u00a7 46110, not to delay. For this court to credit Petitioner's argument would require us to endorse an approach that would lead to the reasonable grounds exception swallowing the sixty-day filing period rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We recognize that mail-related delays might, on some occasions, constitute \"reasonable grounds\" for an untimely filing under \u00a7 46110. This case, however, is not one of those occasions. Petitioner - who was represented by counsel - had approximately six weeks from the time she received the Order from TSA to file a petition with this court. Yet, she failed to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avia Dynamics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206595,3556253\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/515/\">\n    641 F.3d at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Even if ignorance [of an order] could establish 'reasonable grounds,' it would not excuse Avia's continued inaction during the forty-nine days from ... the date of Avia's actual notice[ ] until the filing period closed ....\"). In addition, the Order expressly stated that it constituted a final decision and that Petitioner had sixty days to seek review of the Order pursuant to \u00a7 46110.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, J.A. 41. Under these circumstances, Petitioner had no good excuse, much less reasonable grounds, for her failure to file a petition for review not later than 60 days after TSA issued the disputed Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the reasons given above, the petition for review is hereby denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
