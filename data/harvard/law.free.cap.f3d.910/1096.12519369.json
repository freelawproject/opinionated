On April 30, 2010, Hoang refinanced the Wells Fargo home loan with Bank of America, N.A. and the Federal National Mortgage Association (collectively, the Bank). At the time of the refinancing, the Bank failed to give Hoang notice of the right to rescind the loan, thereby violating TILA's disclosure requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201635\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

On April 15, 2013 (within the three-year period), Hoang sent the Bank notice of intent to rescind the loan under TILA. The record reflects that the Bank took no action in response to receiving the notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February 2017, the Bank declared Hoang in default on the loan and initiated non-judicial foreclosure proceedings. To stop the non-judicial foreclosure proceedings, Hoang filed suit on May 9, 2017. Hoang requested enforcement of the loan rescission under TILA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201635\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f), through declaratory and injunctive relief. In addition, Hoang's prayer for relief requested monetary damages under the Washington Consumer Protection Act (WCPA), although reference to that statute appeared nowhere else in the complaint. The Bank moved to dismiss the case, arguing that Hoang's claims were time barred, because Hoang failed to bring a suit for rescission within three years of the loan's consummation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court held that Hoang timely rescinded the loan by sending notice of rescission to the Bank within three years of the loan's consummation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the district court granted the Bank's motion to dismiss, because Hoang's claims were time barred. To find the claims time barred, the district court adopted the one-year statute of limitations applicable to TILA claims for monetary damages,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201640\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). However, it adopted that statute, because it misread Hoang's request for damages under the WCPA (in Hoang's prayer for relief) as a claim for monetary relief under TILA. The district court dismissed Hoang's claim as untimely for failure to bring suit within one year. Neither party disputes that the district court erred in interpreting Hoang's complaint as requesting TILA damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As to Hoang's requests for declaratory and injunctive relief, the district court acknowledged that the limitations period applicable to TILA rescission enforcement claims is an \"unsettled issue of law\" post-\n   <em>\n    Jesinoski\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jesinoski v.

The district court determined that some statute of limitations must apply and borrowed the limitations period for monetary damages under TILA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201640\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (based, in part, on its misconception that Hoang asserted a claim under that section). Under the one-year statute of limitations, the district court found that Hoang's claim for injunctive and declaratory relief was also time barred. Because it found that all of Hoang's claims were time barred, the district court determined that any amendment would be futile. Accordingly, the district court granted the Bank's motion and dismissed the case without leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We review the district court's choice of the applicable statute of limitations de novo.\n   <em>\n    Hooper v.

However, the Supreme Court altered that usual procedure in\n   <em>\n    Jesinoski\n   </em>\n   . It eliminated the need for a borrower to bring suit within the three-year window to exercise TILA rescission. Instead, \"rescission is effected when the borrower notifies the creditor of his intention to rescind.\"\n   <em>\n    Jesinoski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594207\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/790/#p792\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[S]o long as the borrower notifies within three years after the transaction is consummated, his rescission is timely.

We are now presented with that question: when a borrower effectively rescinds a loan under TILA, but no steps are taken to wind up the loan, when must suit be brought to enforce that rescission?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hoang argues that no statute of limitations applies to such an action in the absence of an express statute of limitations set forth in TILA and in light of\n   <em>\n    Jesinoski\n   </em>\n   . Alternatively, the Bank agrees with the district court that a limitation period must apply but argues that the district court should have applied Washington's two-year catchall statute of limitations. Neither party on appeal argues that we should adopt the district court's view and borrow the TILA damage limitation period in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201640\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).

An action to rescind that loan (under TILA or otherwise) arises out of that written agreement. Because TILA rescissions necessarily require a contract to be rescinded, contract law provides the best analogy and we adopt the general contract law statute of limitations. The district court agreed, acknowledging that the Washington contract statute of limitations provided the closest state law analogy to TILA rescission enforcement (although it declined to borrow it).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no federal law that provides a closer analogy, nor do TILA policies at stake and the practicalities of TILA rescission litigation make federal law a more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We reject the district court's application of TILA's one-year statute of limitations for legal damages claims.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201640\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). First, the district court's choice to apply the TILA one-year legal damages statute of limitations was based primarily on a misreading of Hoang's complaint as requesting TILA relief rather than relief under the WCPA. More importantly,\n   TILA provides for both legal damages and equitable relief but only includes a statute of limitations for legal damages relief. The statute does not suggest that the statute of limitations for legal damages relief is also applicable to claims for equitable remedies. If Congress intended that statute to apply, Congress surely knew how to draft the statute accordingly. Thus, the district court erred when it declined to follow the \"norm for borrowing [state law] limitations periods.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494800\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/319/#p324\">\n    488 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494800\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/319/#p324\">\n    109 S.Ct. 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
