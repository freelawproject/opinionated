This case concerns the method by which Becker calculates benefits for employees who left Xerox, then later returned to Xerox, and then later retired (the\n   \"rehired employees\"). When they initially left Xerox, these rehired employees typically received a lump sum payment equal to the total value of their then-accrued pension benefit. Consequently, when these rehired employees ultimately retired, their final pension benefits were reduced by the lump sum that they had previously received upon their initial departure. During the period at issue in this case, however, Becker offset more than just this lump sum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also deducted from the rehired employees' benefits an additional sum approximating the interest that the previous disbursement would have earned had it remained in the pension plan. This hypothetical interest deduction has come to be known as the \"phantom account offset.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 1999, a group of more than one hundred plan participants sued the Xerox Plan, alleging that the terms of the Xerox Plan did not allow it to apply the phantom account offset. They argued that the phantom account offset violated ERISA's anti-cutback rule, which provides that \"[t]he accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan.\" ERISA \u00a7 204(g)(1),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201054\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1).

This spawned a new batch of rehired employee litigation-including this case. Plaintiff-Appellee-Cross-Appellant Robert Testa (\"Testa\") began working at Xerox in 1972. He left Xerox in 1983, taking a lump-sum distribution of roughly $30,000 from the Xerox Plan. He was rehired in 1985 and retired in 2008. When Testa retired, Becker applied the phantom account offset in his calculation of Testa's pension benefits. In January 2009, Testa received a \"pension calculation statement\" that informed Testa of the amount of benefits he would receive pursuant to the phantom account offset calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After contesting Becker's calculation of his benefits in two 2009 letters, Testa sued\n   Becker and the Xerox Plan in January in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. As relevant here, he alleged two principal claims for relief: denial of benefits under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) and breach of fiduciary duty under \u00a7 502(a)(3),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Devlin v. Empire Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9456495\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/274/76/#p89\">\n    274 F.3d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89 (2d Cir. 2001) (holding that plan participants may bring fiduciary-duty claims under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3) ). His denial-of-benefits claim was virtually identical to that of the\n   <em>\n    Frommert\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs: the phantom account offset impermissibly reduced his pension benefits. Testa then argued that it was a breach of fiduciary duty for Becker to continue to apply the phantom account offset in light of this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Frommert I\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Larimer,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   ) in April 2010. Becker then moved to dismiss both claims. On October 30, 2013, the district court granted Becker's motion in part, dismissing Testa's denial-of-benefits claim on timeliness grounds.\n   <em>\n    Testa v. Becker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4192575\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/979/379/#p383\">\n    979 F.Supp.2d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 383-84 (W.D.N.Y. 2013). The court first concluded that Testa's denial-of-benefits claim became untimely in 2004 because\n   <em>\n    Frommert I\n   </em>\n   held that the Xerox Plan had incorporated the phantom account offset in 1998, and the statute of limitations for a denial-of-benefits claim in New York is six years.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4192575\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/979/379/#p383\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4192575\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/979/379/#p383\">\n    at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the court did not dismiss Testa's fiduciary-duty claim. Testa had argued that Becker had a fiduciary duty to comply with the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Frommert I\n   </em>\n   , which, he maintained, held that \"the phantom account may not be applied to employees\"-like Testa-\"rehired prior to the issuance of the 1998 SPD.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881071\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/254/\">\n    433 F.3d at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court concluded that this claim was not untimely because the statute of limitations began running only when Becker's decision to ignore\n   <em>\n    Frommert I\n   </em>\n   \"became known to\" Testa, \"presumably\" January 2009 or earlier.\n   <em>\n    Testa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4192575\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/979/379/#p383\">\n    979 F.Supp.2d at 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the end of discovery, both parties moved for summary judgment. On May 9, 2017, the district court held for Testa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Testa v. Becker\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-CV-6229L,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201857384\">\n    2017 WL 1857384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D.N.Y. May 9, 2017). Becker had maintained that it was not a breach of fiduciary duty for him to continue to apply the phantom account offset to Testa because Testa could no longer bring a timely denial-of-benefits claim, as the court recognized in its October 30, 2013 decision. The district court rejected this argument, concluding that\n   <em>\n    Frommert I\n   </em>\n   directed Becker not to apply the phantom account offset to any employees rehired before 1998. Citing\n   <em>\n    Frommert I\n   </em>\n   's apparent mandate, the court concluded that Testa was entitled to summary judgment on his fiduciary-duty claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court entered final judgment on May 10, 2017. Becker appealed the district court's May 9, 2017 decision granting summary judgment to Testa, and Testa cross-appealed the district court's October 30, 2013 dismissal of his denial-of-benefits claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We begin our analysis with Testa's challenge to the district court's dismissal of his denial-of-benefits claim on timeliness grounds. We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   a district court's grant of a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    O'Donnell v.

To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516516\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/124/#p128\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Testa first challenges the district court's dismissal of his denial-of-benefits claim on timeliness grounds.

Testa does not contest any of this. This first issue therefore turns on when Becker clearly repudiated Testa's benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The district court held that Becker clearly repudiated Testa's claimed pension benefits in 1998 when he updated the SPD to state clearly that the phantom account offset would be used for all employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Testa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4192575\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/979/379/#p383\">\n    979 F.Supp.2d at 383-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For this reason, courts in this Circuit have routinely held that SPDs may constitute clear repudiations of benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   And most importantly, we held in\n   <em>\n    Frommert I\n   </em>\n   that Xerox's 1998 SPD clearly explained that the phantom account offset would be applied to all rehired employees participating in the Xerox Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881071\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/254/\">\n    433 F.3d at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"As the plaintiffs concede, the details of the phantom account offset functions were set out in full in the 1998 Summary Plan Description ....\"). That is why the\n   <em>\n    Frommert I\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs knew to challenge the phantom account offset after the 1998 SPD's publication. Accordingly, Testa's denial-of-benefits claim became untimely in 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Testa does not contest that an SPD can amount to a clear repudiation of benefits. Instead, he argues that the 1998 SPD did not meet this bar, notwithstanding our holding in\n   <em>\n    Frommert I\n   </em>\n   . Testa makes four\n   principal arguments in support of his position. All four are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, Testa maintains that \"Defendants repeatedly said that they would not apply the phantom account to\n   <em>\n    anyone\n   </em>\n   , including Testa, if they ultimately lost\n   <em>\n    Frommert\n   </em>\n   (which they did).\" Testa Br. 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29 (accusing Becker of making \"ongoing misrepresentations\" about whether the phantom account offset would be applied to Testa). In his view, these misleading statements by Becker both illustrate that the 1998 SPD was not unambiguous and judicially estop Becker and the Xerox Plan from asserting a timeliness defense. We apply judicial estoppel when \"a party both takes a position that is inconsistent with one taken in a prior proceeding, and has had that earlier position adopted by the tribunal to which it was advanced.\"\n   <em>\n    Uzdavines v.

Defs. Mem. in Opp'n at 16,\n   <em>\n    Kunsman v. Conkright\n   </em>\n   , No. 08-CV-6080 (W.D.N.Y. July 7, 2017). Testa has quoted Becker out of context. That memorandum repeatedly makes the same argument that Becker does in this case: that\n   <em>\n    Frommert I\n   </em>\n   permits him to apply the phantom account offset to rehired employees whose claims are untimely.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (opposing certification because \"there are statute of limitations defenses that will apply to individual plaintiffs\"). Moreover, Becker made this statement sixteen years after the Xerox Plan issued the 1998 SPD, ten years after Testa's claim went stale, and four years after Testa sued. Becker's\n   <em>\n    Kunsman\n   </em>\n   brief thus has no bearing on whether the 1998 SPD was ambiguous. Nor could this brief have been \"to the prejudice of\" Testa,\n   <em>\n    Uzdavines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931496\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/138/#p148\">\n    418 F.3d at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as his claims became untimely ten years before Becker filed it. We therefore stand by our decision in\n   <em>\n    Frommert I\n   </em>\n   that the 1998 SPD unambiguously repudiated Testa's benefits and reject Testa's judicial estoppel argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, Testa contends that when the 1998 SPD was issued, Becker failed to disclose that he would refuse to comply with our decision in the\n   <em>\n    Frommert\n   </em>\n   litigation. This is beside the point: even if Becker had failed to comply with\n   <em>\n    Frommert I\n   </em>\n   , this would not make the 1998 SPD any less of a clear repudiation of benefits. We also note that Testa's premise here is faulty because, as we explain below, Becker has not failed to comply with\n   <em>\n    Frommert I\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Third, Testa argues that it was illegal for Becker to apply the phantom account offset to Testa after the plaintiffs won in\n   <em>\n    Frommert I\n   </em>\n   because ERISA plans must be \"applied consistently with respect to similarly situated claimants.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). Yet the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Frommert\n   </em>\n   are not \"similarly situated\" to Testa: they sued before their limitations periods expired. Testa did not. As a result, this rule does not bar Becker from applying the phantom account offset to Testa or others like him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Testa maintains that his denial-of-benefits claim has been equitably tolled ever since 1999, when the\n   <em>\n    Frommert\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs sued. All ERISA denial-of-benefits claims, in his view, are \"akin to ... putative class action[s]\" because \"Defendants were under a duty to apply any remedy granted in the pending\n   <em>\n    Frommert\n   </em>\n   action to all Plan participants.\" Testa Br. 36. Therefore, he argues, his claims should be equitably tolled because the Supreme Court's original \"rationale\" for equitable\n   tolling in\n   <em>\n    Am. Pipe &amp; Constr. Co. v.

But even if equitable tolling did apply, Testa would almost certainly not qualify for it.
