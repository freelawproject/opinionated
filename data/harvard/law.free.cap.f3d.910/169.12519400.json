Because he had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter in Missouri, the district court applied a sentencing enhancement for a crime of violence (\"COV\"). Well represented by the Federal Public Defender, Reyes-Contreras appealed to challenge the enhancement.

The plea includes neither an elaboration of the facts nor the subsection of conviction.

That case is therefore irrelevant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The second and third cases cited by Reyes-Contreras are closer. In one, a man was charged under Subdivision (2) after entering into a suicide pact and providing a gun to his friend. A jury acquitted.

We need not decide whether either example shows \"that [state] courts have\n    <em>\n     actually applied\n    </em>\n    \" Subdivision (2), however, because even assuming they did, both crimes would ultimately satisfy the use-of-force clause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The use-of-force clause is satisfied where the state offense \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. 1(B)(iii) (2014).
