According to that precedent, the government in this case violated the First Amendment by prohibiting religious speakers from expressing religious viewpoints on topics that others were permitted to discuss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) is a governmental entity that operates the Metrobus public transportation system. During last year's Christmas season, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., sought to run the following ad on the exterior of Metrobuses:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The proposed ad was part of the Archdiocese's \"Find the Perfect Gift\" campaign, whose purpose was \"to share a simple message of hope, welcoming all to Christmas Mass or in joining in public service to help the most vulnerable in our community during the liturgical season of Advent.\" Decl. of Edward McFadden, Sec'y of Communications, Archdiocese of Wash., \u00b6 3 (Nov. 27, 2017). The campaign \"invite[d] the public to consider the spiritual meaning of Christmas, to consider celebrating Advent/Christmas by going to Mass at one of our parishes and/or joining in one of our many outreach programs that care for the most vulnerable and poor during Advent and beyond.\" Decl. of Susan Timoney, Sec'y for Pastoral Ministry &amp; Social Concerns, Archdiocese of Wash., \u00b6 6 (Nov. 27, 2017). To that end, the proposed ad included the address for the campaign's website, which provided schedules for local Masses and described many opportunities for charitable service.\n   <em>\n    Archdiocese of Wash. v.

According to WMATA, the ad ran afoul of that ban \"because it depicts a religious scene and thus seeks to promote religion.\" J.A. 115. During this litigation, WMATA further explained that its decision was based not on the ad alone, but also on the website referenced in the ad, which \"contained substantial content promoting the Catholic Church,\" including \"a link to 'Parish Resources,' \" \"a way to 'Order Holy Cards,' \" and \"videos and 'daily reflections' of a religious nature.\" Decl. of Lynn Bowersox, WMATA Assistant Gen. Manager for Customer Service, Communications &amp; Marketing, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20 (Dec. 1, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When the Archdiocese challenged WMATA's decision, the district court upheld the decision, as did a panel of this court on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Archdiocese of Wash. v.

In interpreting the First Amendment, the Court has long held that the government may place reasonable restrictions on the\n   <em>\n    subjects\n   </em>\n   discussed in a non-public forum, but the government may not impose restrictions based on a speaker's\n   <em>\n    viewpoint\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Minnesota Voters All. v.

In the context of religious speech, the Supreme Court has three times considered restrictions indistinguishable from the WMATA policy challenged here. In all three cases, the government argued, as WMATA does here, that the restrictions were permissible because they prohibited all views on a discrete subject: religion. In all three cases, the Supreme Court rejected that argument because the restrictions did more than attempt to ban the discussion of religion; they also barred the expression of religious viewpoints on topics that were otherwise permitted to be discussed. This case is no different, for WMATA's policy barred the Archdiocese from speaking from a religious viewpoint on subjects others were permitted to discuss, such as charitable giving and how best to spend one's time and money during the Christmas holiday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the University of Virginia\n   </em>\n   , the University of Virginia funded all sorts of extracurricular activities for students, but not the publication of a Christian magazine.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p825\">\n    515 U.S. 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 825-26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p825\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p825\">\n    132 L.Ed.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). Such funding was prohibited by a university policy that excluded \"religious activities,\" defined as any activity that \"primarily promotes or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate reality,\" which the University and the Supreme Court understood to bar not only speech that promoted religion but also speech that opposed religion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p825\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p825\">\n    at 825, 836-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p825\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to the magazine's mission statement, its purpose was \"to challenge Christians to live, in word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim and to encourage students to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p825\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p825\">\n    at 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p825\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

All four restrict speech based on its religious purpose: WMATA prohibits speech that \"promote[s] or oppose[s] any religion, religious practice or belief,\" while the Supreme Court cases involve restrictions barring speech \"for religious purposes\" (\n   <em>\n    Lamb's Chapel\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Good News Club\n   </em>\n   ) and speech that \"promotes or manifests a particular belie[f] [including non-belief] in or about a deity or an ultimate reality\" (\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger\n   </em>\n   ). Such restrictions, the Supreme Court has held, amount to viewpoint discrimination when they bar speech on an otherwise-permissible subject. That's what WMATA's policy does. WMATA allows entities like Walmart to speak on the subjects of the perfect Christmas gift (toys) and how to spend the Christmas season (buying gifts and visiting stores at specified hours). And WMATA permits the Salvation Army to run ads encouraging people to donate to certain charities. The Archdiocese would also like to express its views on the perfect Christmas gift (Christ), how to spend the holiday (caring for the needy and visiting churches for Mass at specified hours), and whether to contribute to charities (yes, and particularly to religious charities). By barring the Archdiocese from doing so, WMATA's policy discriminates against religious viewpoints no less than the restrictions in\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lamb's Chapel\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Good News Club\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I am not persuaded by the panel's efforts to distinguish these precedents. First, the panel emphasizes that the ad \"is not primarily or recognizably about charitable giving, as it is not primarily or recognizably about opening hours or places to visit\"; rather, it is \"a religious ad, an exhortation, repeatedly acknowledged by the Archdiocese to be part of its evangelization effort to attend mass at Catholic churches in connection with Advent.\"\n   <em>\n    Archdiocese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517840\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/897/314/#p320\">\n    897 F.3d at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The ad's imagery \"is evocative not of the desirability of charitable giving, but rather the saving grace of Christ, which is not a subject included in the WMATA forum.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517840\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/897/314/#p320\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the same could've been said in\n   <em>\n    Good News Club\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger\n   </em>\n   , where the restricted speech was \"quintessentially religious\" and \"decidedly religious in nature\" with an \"evangelical message.\"\n   <em>\n    Good News Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312877\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/98/\">\n    533 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   111-12 &amp; n.4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312877\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/98/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p825\">\n    515 U.S. at 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p825\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The panel opinion asks too much of this phrase, for the Supreme Court later explained, \"[I]n\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger\n   </em>\n   there was no prohibition on religion as a subject matter, [but] our holding did not rely on this factor.\"\n   <em>\n    Good News Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312877\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/98/\">\n    533 U.S. at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312877\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/98/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In any event, as already discussed, the University policy in\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger\n   </em>\n   and the WMATA policy are indistinguishable, so both policies-by their \"very terms\"-\"do[ ] not exclude religion as a subject matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p825\">\n    515 U.S. at 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p825\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, even if the government could craft a different regulation that validly excludes all discussion on the subject of religion, WMATA did not do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, the panel fears that the Archdiocese's position \"eviscerate[s] ... the long-standing recognition that the government may limit a non-public forum to commercial advertising.\"\n   <em>\n    Archdiocese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517840\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/897/314/#p320\">\n    897 F.3d at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That issue is not presented here, for WMATA permits both commercial and non-commercial ads.
