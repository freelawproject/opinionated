One critical tool in the Code aiding an orderly bankruptcy process is an automatic stay of creditor actions to collect preexisting debts from debtors who have filed for bankruptcy protection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

We now clarify that \u00a7 362(k) also authorizes attorneys' fees and costs to the debtor incurred on appeal in successfully\n   <em>\n    challenging\n   </em>\n   an initial award made pursuant to \u00a7 362(k).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs-Appellants Charles and Patricia Easley (Appellants) filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on October 31, 2012, which resulted in the imposition of an automatic stay pursuant to \u00a7 362. Appellants listed Bennett Medical Services (Bennett) as a Schedule F creditor holding unsecured, nonpriority claims for $3,535, even though Bennett had previously assigned the debt to Defendant-Appellee Collection Service of Nevada (CSN) in July 2012, and CSN had contacted Patricia Easley about the debt on September 20, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CSN, unaware of Appellants' bankruptcy proceeding, filed a collection action against Patricia Easley in July 2013. The parties set up a payment plan in August 2013, whereby Appellants paid $75 pursuant to the plan before stopping further payments. In April 2014, Appellants received a writ of execution on their earnings from CSN. On April 22, 2014, Appellants' attorney sent a fax to CSN's attorney demanding that CSN stop the garnishment in light of Appellants' bankruptcy. Still, CSN garnished wages from Patricia Easley on April 25, May 9, May 23, and June 9, 2014. CSN attempted to stop the garnishment on May 12, 2014 by faxing a release of execution to Patricia Easley's employer and the Las Vegas Constable, but the garnishment continued for several weeks more until CSN faxed another notice to Patricia Easley's employer and the Las Vegas Constable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Initial Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 13, 2014, Appellants filed a motion for contempt against CSN because of its violation of the automatic stay. The bankruptcy court granted Appellants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   unopposed motion on August 7, 2014. After an evidentiary hearing, the bankruptcy court found that CSN had willfully violated the stay, and it awarded $1,295 in damages to Appellants, in addition to $1,277 for attorneys' fees and costs. Appellants appealed the damages and attorneys' fees award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While Appellants' appeal to the district court was pending, we decided\n   <em>\n    Schwartz-Tallard\n   </em>\n   . Appellants did not make the argument to the district court that \u00a7 362(k) is properly interpreted as awarding attorneys' fees and costs incurred in prosecuting damages. Instead, they simply argued that the bankruptcy court erred in failing to account for several days of attorneys' work needed to end the stay violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court affirmed the actual damages award, but remanded to the bankruptcy court the attorneys' fees calculation in light of\n   <em>\n    Schwartz-Tallard\n   </em>\n   . The bankruptcy court then awarded attorneys' fees and costs of $16,324.40, in addition to the $1,277 initially awarded. The bankruptcy court refused to award attorneys' fees and costs incurred on appeal, claiming it lacked jurisdiction due to a pending application for these fees before the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The District Court's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 29, 2017, the district court denied Appellants' motion for attorneys' fees and costs for appellate work. The court concluded that Appellants failed to file points and authority pursuant to Local Rule 7-2(d). The court noted that it \"cannot determine which fees appellant[s] [are] seeking because the appellant[s] did not properly segregate their fees for the relief they have received,\" and therefore denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Alternatively, the court concluded that \u00a7 362(k) does not allow for recovery of appellate work when a party is prosecuting, and not defending, the judgment on appeal. The court cited\n   <em>\n    Schwartz-Tallard\n   </em>\n   when commenting, \"[A] party is entitled to an award of attorney's fees if they [sic] succeed in correcting the stay and then are successful in defending the judgment on appeal.\" The district court reasoned that because\n   <em>\n    Appellants\n   </em>\n   appealed the bankruptcy court's award of fees and costs, not CSN, Appellants could not recover their fees pursuant to \u00a7 362(k).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Appellants timely appealed to our court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"The rulings of the district courts regarding local rules are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    All. of Nonprofits for Ins., Risk Retention Grp. v.

However, when the principal issue raised on appeal is legal in nature, we review the district court's award de novo.\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Maricopa Cty.

The record shows that Appellants clearly indicated that the attorneys' fees and costs requested pertained solely to the appeal, and did not need to be further segregated. The itemized attorneys' fees provided in appellants' motion begins with \"Prepare Notice of Appeal,\" dated March 4, 2015. The entries continue through October 14, 2016 with additional, clear references to appellate work: \"Prepare Exhibits for Appeal,\" \"Meet w/ clients re: status of appeal,\" \"Prepare a FRAP 28j Letter of Supplemental Authority re: Schwartz-Tallard,\" and \"Meet w/ client re: appeal and order.\" The dates and entries clearly involve appeals work completed by Appellants' attorney, Christopher P. Burke. Further, Exhibit A is Burke's declaration, in which he states, \"[M]y total fees and cost\n   <em>\n    for this appeal\n   </em>\n   are $14,208.75.\" A quick reference back to the itemized sheet would show an equal number listed as \"Total Fees.\" The memorandum of points and authorities is unambiguously labeled a \"motion for attorney fees and cost for appellate work,\" and it repeatedly makes clear that the Easleys were seeking fees solely \"for work on this appeal,\" \"for this appeal\" and for \"all of the appellate work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Accordingly, the points and authorities filed with the district court sufficiently clarify the attorneys' fees and costs sought in Appellants' motion, and we therefore conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it denied the motion pursuant to Local Rule 7-2(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Appellate Attorneys' Fees and Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The district court also denied the motion because of its understanding of\n   <em>\n    Schwartz-Tallard\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Under the \"American Rule,\" we follow \"a general practice of not awarding fees to a prevailing party absent explicit statutory authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Key Tronic Corp. v.

Our holding changed what\n   <em>\n    Sternberg\n   </em>\n   concluded were recoverable attorneys' fees and costs because we determined that is what Congress intended.

Allowing for attorneys' fees and costs while prosecuting an action for damages is likely the only way debtors in bankruptcy can afford to pursue damages.

We then addressed the specific circumstances at issue in\n   <em>\n    Schwartz-Tallard\n   </em>\n   and held that \"[w]hen a party is entitled to an award of attorney's fees in the court of first instance, as [debtor] was here, she is ordinarily entitled to recover fees incurred in successfully defending the judgment on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350504,4346732\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/1095/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350504,4346732\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/1095/\">\n    at 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, the district court relied on this language from\n   <em>\n    Schwartz-Tallard\n   </em>\n   and held that Appellants should not be awarded attorneys' fees and costs for their appeal since\n   <em>\n    they\n   </em>\n   appealed to the district court, not CSN.

Indeed, almost every case cited by Appellants that awarded appellate attorneys' fees after a favorable judgment involved a party defending that judgment on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Legal Voice v.

Significantly,\n   <em>\n    Schwartz-Tallard\n   </em>\n   also reached this outcome after carefully considering the purpose of \u00a7 362(k). If a creditor unsuccessfully appeals a bankruptcy court's judgment in favor of a debtor, it stands to reason that the party who violated the stay should continue to pay for its harmful behavior by compensating the debtor for its appellate attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Notably, courts also grant appellate attorneys' fees in fee-shifting statute cases when, as here, parties successfully challenge initial judgments on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Christensen v.

Indeed, we are not aware of any authority suggesting that, although fees may be awarded under a fee-shifting statute for defending a judgment on appeal, they are not available for successfully challenging a judgment as inadequate. As noted, the firmly established principle is that \"attorneys fees may be awarded for time devoted in successfully defending appeals of\n   <em>\n    or challenges to\n   </em>\n   the district court's award of attorneys fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Se.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Legal Def.

Section 362(k) provides relief for debtors in the form of damages and attorneys' fees and costs when a creditor willfully violates an automatic stay. And, as previously noted, the provision of attorneys' fees and costs is critically important for \"the very class of plaintiffs authorized to sue-individual debtors in bankruptcy-[who] by definition will typically not have the resources to hire private counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Schwartz-Tallard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350504,4346732\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/1095/\">\n    803 F.3d at 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 362(k) thus seeks to make debtors whole, as if the violation never happened,\n   to the degree possible. This reasonably includes awarding attorney's fees and costs on appeal to a successful debtor, even when a debtor must bring the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Section 362(k) seeks to make debtors whole when a creditor willfully violates an automatic stay. This requires creditors to pay debtors reasonable damages and attorneys' fees and costs incurred in remedying the violation. When an appeal is necessary to secure such damages and attorneys' fees and costs, appellate attorneys' fees and costs should also be granted to a successful debtor, regardless of which party brings the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Accordingly, we REVERSE the order of the district court and REMAND to the district court with instructions to remand to the bankruptcy court to calculate appellate attorneys' fees and costs, as Appellants successfully challenged the bankruptcy court's award.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
