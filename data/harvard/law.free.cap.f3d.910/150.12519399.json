Baxter (collectively, with Ms. Baxter, \"Taxpayers\") appeal an opinion and decision of the United States Tax Court imposing back taxes and penalties attributable to Taxpayers' use of what appellee Commissioner of Internal Revenue (the \"Commissioner\") deemed to be an unlawful tax shelter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Curtis Inv. Co., LLC v. Comm'r\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20T.C.M.%20141\">\n    114 T.C.M (CCH) 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203314283\">\n    2017 WL 3314283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). On their 2000 tax return, Taxpayers claimed substantial capital losses attributable to a Custom Adjustable Rate Debt Structure (\"CARDS\") transaction, which Taxpayers relied on to offset capital gains attributable to the sale of their family business. The Commissioner argued-and the Tax Court agreed-that the CARDS transaction lacked \"economic substance\" and therefore that the Taxpayers improperly relied on the transaction to offset their capital gains. After careful review, we affirm the Tax Court's order and decision in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ms. Baxter is the great-granddaughter of Henry Russell Curtis, the founder of American Business Products, Inc. (\"ABP\"), a successful printing company. Prior to the transactions giving rise to the present dispute, Ms. Baxter directly held several shares of ABP stock. In 1961, the family formed Curtis Investment Company, LLC (\"Curtis Investment\"), to hold the family's ABP stock as well as to engage in\n   other investments. Ms. Baxter also held a beneficial interest in ABP stock by virtue of her ownership interest in Curtis Investment. In 1986, Ms. Baxter became the managing member of Curtis Investment. Ms. Baxter's son, Henry J. Bird (\"Bird\"), succeeded Ms. Baxter as managing member of Curtis Investment in 1998, and formed an investment committee-on which Ms. Baxter continued to serve-to oversee Curtis Investment's investment strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In late February 2000, Curtis Investment and Ms. Baxter sold their ABP stock as part of the sale of ABP. Ms. Baxter's sale of her ABP stock generated a $2,444,383 long-term capital gain and a $18,895 short-term capital gain. Faced with the prospect of a sizable tax bill attributable to this sale, Ms. Baxter and Curtis Investment's investment committee considered multiple approaches to sheltering the gain. One of Taxpayers' accountants, Barbara Coats, learned of the CARDS shelter and met with Roy Hahn, founder of Chenery Associates, Inc. (\"Chenery Associates\"), who marketed the CARDS shelter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Coats and another accountant at her firm, Matt Levin, presented the CARDS transaction to Bird. Bird asked Coats and Levin and two lawyers, Thomas Rogers and Ann Watkins, to review the transaction and its promoters. To that end, the advisers hired a private investigator to investigate Chenery Associates and Hahn. As part of its CARDS package, Chenery Associates marketed a model tax opinion letter prepared by R.J. Ruble of Brown &amp; Wood LLP, who also served as a reference for Hahn. Taxpayers' advisers spoke with Ruble on several occasions regarding the model opinion letter. After reviewing many, but not all, of the authorities cited in the letter, but without conducting additional research, Taxpayers' accountants \"independent[ly]\" advised the Taxpayers that they \"thought the tax effects were as outlined in the tax opinion letter.\" J.A. 2914. Neither Taxpayers' accountants nor their tax lawyers provided Taxpayers with separate opinion letters, however. Rogers walked through the tax effects of the CARDS transaction with Bird, who then conveyed his understanding of those effects to Ms. Baxter. Based on this review, Taxpayers decided to move forward with the CARDS transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Taxpayers' CARDS transactions-like all CARDS transactions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kerman v. C.I.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558581\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/849/#p853\">\n    713 F.3d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 853 (6th Cir. 2013) -proceeded in the following stages: origination, assumption, operation, and unwinding,\n   <em>\n    Curtis Inv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203314283\">\n    2017 WL 3314283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the origination stage, two residents of the United Kingdom (and, therefore, not subject to U.S. tax law)-Elizabeth Sylvester and Michael Sherry-organized a Delaware, LLC: Caledonian Financial Trading, LLC (\"Caledonian\"). Sylvester and Sherry participated in a similar manner in several other CARDS transactions. On December 14, 2000, Caledonian entered into a credit agreement with Hypo-Und Vereinsbank, AG (\"HVB\")-a German bank that regularly facilitated CARDS transactions\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -pursuant to which HVB loaned Caledonian \u20ac2.9 million. Caledonian's credit agreement with HVB had a 30-year term, but HVB retained the right to call the loan at the end of each year. Interest accrued annually at a rate equal to 12-month euro LIBOR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   plus 0.5 percent. Under the credit agreement, the \u20ac2.9 million loan was more-than-fully collateralized-if Caledonian's collateral consisted of cash, the agreement obliged Caledonian to deposit 102% of its loan obligations with HVB, and if Caledonian's collateral consisted of other assets, the agreement obliged Caledonian to deposit assets valued at 108% of its obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   HVB deposited eight-five percent (85%) of the proceeds of the loan in an HVB time-deposit account with a one-year term that HVB established for Caledonian. Under the then-applicable dollar-to-euro exchange rate, eighty-five percent of the \u20ac2.9 million loan closely approximated Taxpayers' approximately $2.4 million expected capital gain from Ms. Baxter's sale of her ABP stock. HVB dispersed the remaining loan proceeds-which amounted to fifteen percent (15%) of the loaned funds-in the form of a one-year promissory note to Caledonian. Caledonian then pledged the promissory note and the time deposit-i.e. the\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   proceeds it received from the loan-as collateral. Interest on both the time deposit and the promissory note accrued at a rate equal to 12-month LIBOR, meaning that interest accrued on the time deposit and the promissory note-Caledonian's entire proceeds from the loan-at a\n   <em>\n    lower\n   </em>\n   rate than Caledonian paid to borrow those proceeds (4.885% interest rate on time deposit and promissory note versus 5.335% interest on Caledonian loan). The loan agreement barred Caledonian from making withdrawals from its newly-form HVB account without providing substitute collateral. Caledonian further contracted not to request release of the collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the assumption stage, in late December 2000, Ms. Baxter acquired the promissory note HVB issued to Caledonian, which promissory note amounted to fifteen percent (15%) of the loan proceeds. As part of her acquisition of the promissory note, Ms. Baxter further agreed to assume 100% of Caledonian's liability under its loan with HVB on a joint and several basis. The parties agreed that the funds in Caledonian's time deposit at HVB would serve as the first source of payment for Caledonian's obligations under the loan. On December 28, 2000, Ms. Baxter-who had no prior relationship with HVB-redeemed the promissory note she purchased from Caledonian, depositing \u20ac435,000 into a newly formed HVB account in her name. Ms. Baxter then asked HVB to change the denomination of the funds in her account from euros to dollars, at the then-applicable dollar-to-euro exchange rate of 0.924, yielding approximately $401,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. Baxter further entered into a forward exchange contract with HVB, pursuant to which she was obligated to exchange approximately $442,000 for approximately \u20ac469,000 slightly less than one-year later, on December 14, 2001, the first-year call date for HVB's loan to Caledonian. That approximately \u20ac469,000 figure was nearly identical to the amount Caledonian, and therefore Ms. Baxter, would have to repay HVB if it exercised its contractual right to recall the loan after one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A taxpayer's currency exchange and note redemption are taxable events. Relying on Ms. Baxter's assumption of joint and several liability with Caledonian for 100% of the loan proceeds, Taxpayers claimed a $2,277,660 loss (\u20ac2.9 million in assumed liability less the \u20ac435,000 in loan proceeds she obtained, converted to dollars at the then-applicable exchange rate) on their 2000 tax return, offsetting nearly all their capital gain resulting from Ms. Baxter's sale of her ABP stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the operational phase, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (\"CIBC\")-with which Taxpayers had a long-standing relationship-issued\n   to Curtis Investment a $6.7 million letter of credit, with a stated termination date of December 27, 2001. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Curtis Investment was obliged to keep at least $6.7 million in its accounts at CIBC, meaning that the letter of credit was fully collateralized. CIBC charged Curtis Investment $241,000 for the letter of credit. Ms. Baxter then substituted the letter of credit as collateral for Caledonian's loan-pledging to HVB a first priority lien and security interest in the letter of credit-and in return HVB dispersed $401,940 to Ms. Baxter. Notwithstanding that Taxpayers had business relationships with CIBC and several other banks before they considered engaging in the CARDS transaction, Taxpayers did not approach any of those banks about obtaining a loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, the process to unwind the transaction began on November 13, 2001, when HVB notified Ms. Baxter of its intent to call its loan to Caledonian. Caledonian's time deposit at HVB covered most of the outstanding loan balance, with Ms. Baxter required to pay to HVB approximately \u20ac470,000 to retire Caledonian's loan. On December 14, 2001, pursuant to her forward exchange contract, Ms. Baxter exchanged approximately $442,000 for approximately \u20ac469,000, which she then applied against her obligation under the loan and assumption agreement. That exchange covered all but approximately \u20ac826 of Ms. Baxter's obligation to retire Caledonian's loan. Taxpayers unsuccessfully sought replacement loans from several other banks. Ms. Baxter paid Chenery Associates $154,375 in fees to facilitate her CARDS transaction. Put differently, aggregating CIBC's and Chenery Associates' fees, the Tax Court found that Taxpayers paid approximately forty-five percent (45%) of the loan proceeds in fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 8, 2008, the Commissioner issued a notice of deficiency to Taxpayers for tax years 2000 and 2001, asserting,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Taxpayers could not claim a taxable capital loss deduction as a result of the CARDS transaction because, in the Commissioner's view, the transaction lacked economic substance. The Commissioner further stated that Taxpayers were liable for forty-percent accuracy-related penalties for making gross valuation misstatements. Taxpayers timely filed a petition with the Tax Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following a four-day trial, during which the parties introduced lay and expert testimony and evidence, Tax Court Chief Judge L. Paige Marvel held that Ms. Baxter's CARDS transaction lacked \"economic substance.\"\n   <em>\n    Curtis Inv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203314283\">\n    2017 WL 3314283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9-12. In particular, the Tax Court found that the transaction did not provide Taxpayers \"with a reasonable possibility of profit\" and that Taxpayers' purported investment motive was \"not credible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10-11. The Tax Court further concluded that the Commissioner properly imposed the accuracy-related penalty because Taxpayers failed to show that there was a \"reasonable cause\" for their inaccurate claiming of the CARDS deduction or that Taxpayers took the deduction in good faith.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *14-16.

J.A. 300-01. After allowing voir dire and hearing argument, the Tax Court overruled Taxpayers' objection to admission of the report and Kolbe's testimony. Relying on standard financial calculations as well as historical data regarding then-applicable interest rates, Kolbe estimated the net present value of Ms. Baxter's loan obtained through the CARDS transaction, opining that, as a result of the high up-front fees, the net present value was \"at least \u20ac2.19 million\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   than it would have been with a normal loan, taxes aside.\" J.A. 311. Kolbe further opined that due to the high borrowing costs, use of the loan \"to purchase any investment would create a very material and entirely unnecessary, drag on the profitability of that investment.\" J.A. 313-14. The Tax Court credited that analysis in its opinion.\n   <em>\n    Curtis Inv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203314283\">\n    2017 WL 3314283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As they do with the Tax Court's economic substance analysis,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   Part II.B, Taxpayers argue that the district court erred in admitting Kolbe's analysis because he improperly \"segregat[ed] the finance costs from the investment returns on the loan proceeds.\" Appellants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Br. at 31. But it is within an economist's scope of expertise to opine that one can analyze the profitability of a loan by holding constant the likely returns to the proceeds of the loan, and then comparing the loan actually obtained with other available financing options-as Kolbe did here. As the Sixth Circuit held in rejecting a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   challenge to Kolbe's report in another CARDS case, \"Kolbe['s] compar[ison of] the net present values of ordinary loans at market rates against [Taxpayers'] loan\" is the \"type of economic analysis-calculating the actual cost of financing and comparing it against the market rate-[that] 'both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3558581\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/849/#p853\">\n    713 F.3d at 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

First, the Tax Court found that Taxpayers' claimed purpose of obtaining the loans so as to engage in leveraged investment was not credible in light of the extremely high fees and therefore the high costs of borrowing, which would constitute a long-term drain on investment profitability.\n   <em>\n    Curtis Inv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203314283\">\n    2017 WL 3314283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-11. Second, the Tax Court found that Taxpayers' claim that they expect the loan proceeds to be available for 30 years-which was essential to their expectation of profitability given that Taxpayers would pay the high fees up front-was not credible in light of the one-year terms for the time deposit, the promissory note, the letter of credit, and the forward currency exchange contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12.

Put differently, the Tax Court found that because the high-fees payable to Chenery Associates and CIBC during the first year of the transaction and the numerous transaction documents with one-year terms evidencing that HVB was likely to call the loan after one year-meaning that Taxpayers would incur all of the costs of the loan but obtain little of their anticipated benefits-Taxpayers' asserted reliance on the expected long-term profitability of the transaction was not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   These findings by the Tax Court are supported by facts in the record, and reflect reasonable inferences from those facts, and therefore are not subject to reversal under the applicable clear error standard of review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rice's Toyota\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"297073\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/752/89/#p91\">\n    752 F.2d at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, Taxpayers' assumption of the remaining eighty-five percent of Caledonian's liability under its loan with HVB was a \"meaningless and unnecessary incident\" to the loan transaction when Taxpayers never received\n   any of the loan proceeds giving rise to that liability and when that liability remained more than fully collateralized by funds Caledonian had on deposit with HVB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Even if the Tax Court had reversibly erred in disregarding Taxpayers' anticipated returns from investment of their loan proceeds-which it did not-the Tax Court's other factual findings would nevertheless support its ultimate determination that the broader CARDS transaction would not be profitable due to the high fees paid to Chenery Associates and CIBC. In particular, the Tax Court found that Taxpayers' testimony that they believed that the loan would remain in place for thirty years was not credible, given that many of the operative documents had a one-year term. As explained above, that finding is not clearly erroneous, and therefore will not-and cannot-be set aside by this Court.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.B.1. Accordingly, even assuming it is appropriate, in this particular case, to consider the profitability of Taxpayers' investment of the loan proceeds, we must consider the expected profitability of the investments during\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the first year of the transaction, when Taxpayers reasonably could have believed they would have access to the loaned funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Assuming Curtis Investment's historical average annual portfolio gain of 17.9 percent, then Taxpayers could have expected to turn the approximately $401,000 that they received in the CARDS transaction into approximately $472,000 by the end of the year. Even if we exclude Taxpayers' share of the fee Curtis Investment paid to CIBC to obtain the letter of credit, the more than $154,000 in up-front fees Ms. Baxter paid to Chenery Associates dwarfed that anticipated $71,000 return on the loaned funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Put differently, under the Tax Court's well-supported factual finding that Taxpayers' testimony that they expected the loan proceeds to be available for more than a year was not credible, Taxpayers could not have expected to profit from the transaction, given the high upfront fees. Accordingly, no \"reasonable possibility of profit from the transaction existed apart from the tax benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Rice's Toyota\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"297073\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/752/89/#p91\">\n    752 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   94 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klamath Strategic Inv.

These additional criteria further support the Tax Court's judgment that the CARDS transaction lacked objective economic substance. The purported loss-the difference between Taxpayers' liability for the entire Caledonian-HVB loan and the promissory note Taxpayers received, which was worth only fifteen percent of the loan-was \"artificial\" because that additional liability always remained more-than-fully collateralized with Caledonian funds deposited at HVB.

For example, the court found not credible Ms. Baxter's statement that she believed, based on the advice of her accountants and lawyers, that she \"would ultimately pay tax on the gain over time\" because the record was devoid of evidence that Ms. Baxter's advisers rendered such advice, which ran directly contrary\n   to the model Brown &amp; Wood opinion on which her advisers relied.\n   <em>\n    Curtis Inv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203314283\">\n    2017 WL 3314283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 n.12, *12.

And these adverse credibility determinations lend further support for the Tax Court's finding that Taxpayers' claim of good faith reliance on their professional advisers was not credible-i.e., that Taxpayers failed to show that they \"\n   <em>\n    actually relied in good faith\n   </em>\n   on [their] adviser[s'] judgment\" in engaging in the CARDS transaction and claiming the deduction on their tax return.\n   <em>\n    DeCleene v.

Cir. 2010) (noting \"the well-settled principle that false exculpatory statements are evidence-often strong evidence-of guilt\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Taxpayers nevertheless highlight several differences between their case and another CARDS case,\n   <em>\n    Gustashaw\n   </em>\n   , to argue that the Tax Court committed clear error in finding that Taxpayers failed to establish reasonable cause and good faith, including that (1) Gustashaw's adviser admitted he was unqualified to render advice on the transaction, whereas all of Taxpayers' advisers had expertise in the area; (2) neither Gustashaw nor his adviser directly dealt with Brown &amp; Wood, whereas Taxpayers' advisers did; and (3) Gustashaw's adviser did not offer an opinion (because he lacked expertise), whereas Taxpayers' advisers \"independently\" reviewed the Brown &amp; Wood opinion and advised that the opinion was what it purported to be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   These are potentially significant differences that may have allowed the Tax Court to reach a different finding as to good faith and reasonable reliance in this case. But Taxpayers' case also is distinguishable from Gustashaw's in meaningful ways as well. In particular, Gustashaw conceded that his CARDS transaction lacked economic substance and before the Tax Court challenged\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the accuracy related penalties.\n   <em>\n    Gustashaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5866448\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/1124/#p1139\">\n    696 F.3d at 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, both before the Tax Court and this Court, Taxpayers claimed that their CARDS transaction did not lack economic substance and, in doing so, made numerous claims as to their motive for entering into the transaction and the objective economic substance of the transaction that the Tax Court found false or non-credible.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.C. Those false and non-credible exculpatory statements constitute \"strong evidence\" of lack of good faith not present in\n   <em>\n    Gustashaw\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al-Adahi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552240,3702825\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/1102/\">\n    613 F.3d at 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More significantly,\n   <em>\n    Gustashaw\n   </em>\n   did not establish the threshold for distinguishing reasonable cause and good faith reliance from the absence of reasonable cause and good faith. Rather, under Treasury regulations, courts must consider all facts and circumstances in making the\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   determination as to whether a taxpayer met his burden of establishing reasonable cause and good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Here, the Tax Court properly considered all facts and circumstances-including numerous facts and circumstances relied on by courts in other cases in which taxpayers claimed they reasonably relied on the advice of a professional-and found that Taxpayers failed to meet their burden to establish their reasonable cause and good faith reliance on the advice of their professional advisers. That factual finding\n   is supported by record evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom. Accordingly, the Tax Court's finding as to Taxpayers' failure to establish reasonable and good faith reliance lies within the universe of permissible inferences and, therefore, is not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As to Taxpayers' second argument-that the tax issues raised by Ms. Baxter's CARDS transaction were \"novel\" and \"unsettled\" at the time Taxpayers claimed losses attributable to the transaction-even assuming novelty is, by itself, a basis for setting aside a penalty otherwise mandated by Section 6662(b)(3),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taxpayers' argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As the Tax Court noted, at the time Ms. Baxter entered in the CARDS transaction, it was well-established that transactions lacking economic substance must be disregarded for tax purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Curtis Inv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203314283\">\n    2017 WL 3314283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gregory v.
