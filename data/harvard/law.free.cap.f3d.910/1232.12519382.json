It acquires and maintains a reservoir of sensitive information about taxpayers. And time was, the President could-for any reason or no reason at all-order the IRS to make that sensitive information public. The arrangement worked out fine for decades. Then the Nixon administration compiled a list of political enemies and ordered the IRS to harass them. The resulting scandal prompted the Congress to enact sweeping legislation to protect taxpayer privacy. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) now mandates that tax \"[r]eturns and return information shall be confidential\" unless they fall within one of the statute's narrowly drawn exceptions. I.R.C. \u00a7 6103(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At first blush, the IRC stands in tension with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which vests the public with a broad right to access government records.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(A). One statute demands openness; the other privacy. But as we explain\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the statutes work well together. Not all records are subject to FOIA requests. An agency need not disclose records \"specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552(b)(3). Because the IRC is such a statute, records that fall within its confidentiality mandate are exempt from FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case presents the question whether a member of the public-here, a nonprofit organization-can use a FOIA request to obtain an unrelated individual's tax records without his consent. With certain limited exceptions-all inapplicable here-the answer is no. No one can demand to inspect another's tax records. And the IRC's confidentiality protections extend to the ordinary taxpayer and the President alike. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC)'s lawsuit seeking President Donald J. Trump's income tax records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   EPIC is a nonprofit organization dedicated to focusing \"public attention on emerging privacy and civil liberties issues.\" A few months after the 2016 election, EPIC sent the IRS a FOIA request seeking President \"Donald J. Trump's individual income tax returns for tax years 2010 forward, and any other indications of financial relations with the Russian government or Russian businesses.\" The IRS declined to comply with the request for two reasons. First, the requested \"documents, to the extent that any exist, [ ] consist of, or contain the tax returns or return information of a third party,\" which \"may not be disclosed unless specifically authorized by law.\" Second, the IRS's rules require that a request for a third party's tax returns include his consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20601.702\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(5)(iii)(C) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   I.R.C. \u00a7 6103(c). In fact, the IRS does not process a FOIA request that violates its rules.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20601.702\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 601.702(c)(4). Because EPIC failed to obtain President Trump's consent, the IRS did not process the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   EPIC then sent the IRS a second letter appealing the initial denial and renewing its request for President Trump's above-described tax information. The renewed request invoked\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206103\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k)(3),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which establishes an exception to the general rule that tax returns and return information are confidential. Under section 6103(k)(3), the IRS may \"disclose\" return information to correct a misstatement of fact, if doing so is necessary to serve a tax administration purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.R.C. \u00a7 6103(k)(3). Before releasing records under section 6103(k)(3), however, the IRS is statutorily required to obtain approval from the Joint Committee on Taxation-composed of members of the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8002(a). EPIC asserted that President Trump made misstatements of fact about his tax information and about his audit history. In EPIC's view, releasing the President's tax returns would promote public confidence in the IRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Again, the IRS declined to process the request, explaining that section 6103 prohibits the release of the requested records \"unless disclosure is authorized by Title 26.\" The second IRS letter stated that section 6103(k)(3)\"does not afford any rights to requesters under the FOIA to the disclosure of tax returns or return information of third parties.\" The letter concluded by telling EPIC \"any future requests regarding this subject matter will not be processed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   EPIC soon sued the IRS. Its complaint advanced three claims under FOIA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and two under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FOIA claims fault the IRS for failing to meet statutory deadlines for processing record requests (count one), failing to segregate nonexempt information (count two) and wrongfully withholding the President's tax returns and information (count three). The APA claims assert that the IRS wrongfully withheld the President's tax returns (count four) and failed to seek the Joint Committee's approval (count five). The IRS moved to dismiss the complaint and the district court granted the motion. It dismissed the FOIA claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and the APA claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In response, the IRS again rejected EPIC's arguments and notified it that \"any future requests regarding this subject matter will not be processed.\" The IRS's response manifests that the administrative process had run its course.

Second, the requested information allegedly falls under an exception to the section 6103(a) disclosure bar and therefore the IRS wrongfully withheld nonexempt documents.

In its request, as noted earlier, EPIC \"sought Donald J. Trump's tax returns for tax years 2010 forward and any other indications of financial relations with the Russian government or Russian businesses.\" The first half of the request seeks tax returns and thus is plainly covered by section 6103(a) 's bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   But what about EPIC's request for \"any other indications of financial relations\" with Russian entities? IRS records containing the described information could reveal \"return information,\" including the \"nature\" and \"source\" of President Trump's income.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702331,1530069\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6103(b)(2)(A). As the IRS correctly points out, \"EPIC has framed its FOIA request in such a way that acknowledging the existence of any responsive documents would itself violate section 6103 by disclosing whether the President has filed income tax returns for the years in question; whether the President has Russian income, assets, expenses, etc.; and/or whether the IRS was, is, or may be investigating the foregoing.\" Because any response to EPIC's requests would reveal \"[r]eturns [or] return information,\" we agree with the IRS that section 6103(a) prevented the IRS from complying with the requests unless an exception to the disclosure bar applied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702331,1530069\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6103(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The Secretary\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   , but only following approval by the Joint Committee on Taxation, disclose such return information or any other information with respect to any specific taxpayer to the extent necessary for tax administration purposes to correct a misstatement of fact published or disclosed with respect to such taxpayer's return or any transaction of the taxpayer with the Internal Revenue Service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517192\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/1234/#p1245\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6103(k)(3) (emphasis added).
