At stake is whether Ahmad Issa, an Ohio prisoner convicted of aggravated murder for his role in a murder-for-hire scheme in 1997, is entitled to habeas relief for an alleged Confrontation Clause violation. That clause gives a criminal defendant the right \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him\" at trial. U.S. Const. amend. VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In granting habeas relief, the panel erred in assessing what the Confrontation Clause required at the time of trial and in assessing what the Confrontation Clause requires today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , no constitutional violation occurred at the time of trial two decades ago-at least not one that AEDPA permits us to correct. The Ohio Supreme Court's decision rejecting Issa's claim was not \"contrary to, or ... an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). In 1997, Andre Miles shot Maher Khriss and Ziad Khriss with a high-powered rifle. The day after the murders, Miles told his friends Joshua and Bonnie Willis that Issa had agreed to pay him to kill Maher and described the details of the crime to them. Miles refused to testify at Issa's trial, prompting the State to call the Willises to testify about what Miles had told them. The jury convicted Issa of aggravated murder and recommended the death penalty. The trial court sentenced Issa to death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Unlike the declarants in\n   <em>\n    Lilly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Madrigal\n   </em>\n   , Miles was not talking to police as a suspect when he made the out-of-court statement. Miles's confession was made spontaneously and voluntarily to his friends in their home. Moreover, Miles had nothing to gain from inculpating appellant in the crime. In fact, by stating that appellant had hired him to kill Maher, Miles was admitting a capital crime,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , murder for hire. Furthermore, Miles's statement was clearly not an attempt to shift blame from himself because he was bragging about his role as the shooter in the double homicide.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   We therefore find that the circumstances surrounding the confession did \"render the declarant [Miles] particularly worthy of belief.\"\n   <em>\n    Madrigal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"176010\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/87/378/\">\n    87 Ohio St.3d at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=721%20N.E.2d%2052\">\n    721 N.E.2d at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219632\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/805/#p820\">\n    497 U.S. at 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219632\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/805/#p820\">\n    110 S.Ct. 3139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]....

As the panel saw it, \"the Ohio Supreme Court determined that Miles's statements were\n   trustworthy simply because he made them to his friends\" instead of the police, without \"considering any other facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Issa v. Bradshaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518673\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/446/#p457\">\n    904 F.3d 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 457 (6th Cir. 2018). That alleged deficiency became the springboard for the panel's decision to take a fresh look at the case, then to find that the statements were unreliable, then to hold them constitutionally inadmissible, then to grant the writ.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518673\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/446/#p457\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518673\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/446/#p457\">\n    at 457-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This approach cannot be squared with Congress's mandate that we may disregard state-court decisions only if they are \"contrary to\" or \"unreasonably apply\" decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. The Ohio Supreme Court invoked the relevant cases, quoted several of them, and fairly applied the\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   test to Issa's case. The worst that can be said of the decision is that it did not say \"totality\" in describing the test. But surely it applied an all-of-the-circumstances test in view of the many criteria-ten-that it mentioned and that reasonably supported the reliability of these statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For my part, I cannot identify any other material circumstance the court should have considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For its part, the panel identified two circumstances the Ohio Supreme Court should have considered. One is that Miles, long after the murders, testified at Linda Khriss's murder trial (the State believed Linda initially hired Issa to kill Maher, her husband) and at that point denied talking to the Willises. But we have no warrant to take the Ohio Supreme Court to task for neglecting to consider this factor. It is not a permissible factor. Under the\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   test, courts assess reliability based on the circumstances that \"render the declarant particularly worthy of belief\" at the time.\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219632\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/805/#p820\">\n    497 U.S. at 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219632\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/805/#p820\">\n    110 S.Ct. 3139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Just as one could not say an out-of-court statement became reliable based on corroborating evidence at trial,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219632\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/805/#p820\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , one cannot say a statement became unreliable based on statements at a later trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The other circumstance was this: The panel said that, in the course of Miles's friendship with the Willises, Miles often bragged and told stories the Willises weren't sure were true. But the Ohio Supreme Court did consider this possibility and simply drew a different conclusion about it-that he was boasting and that this reality added authenticity to (rather than subtracted authenticity from) the statements. Either possibility, it seems to me, is reasonable. What's not reasonable is to say that the Ohio Supreme Court's decision is \"contrary\" to\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   because it could have viewed this circumstance in a slightly different light than the panel viewed it. Find me a totality-of-the-circumstances test in which it is not possible-it's always possible-for the reviewer court to identify another consideration the reviewee court might have addressed or for that matter a consideration the reviewee court might have addressed differently. If we interpret AEDPA to mean that we may identify one factor a state court didn't mention in a totality-of-the-circumstances test, then use that failure to grant habeas relief, that amounts to circumvention of the law, not respect for the modest power it gives us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   How, then, could one conclude that the Ohio Supreme Court did not apply a totality-of-the-circumstances test? Or applied it unreasonably? I do not see a plausible explanation. To accept the panel's conclusion that the decision was contrary to\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   would be to accept that a state-court decision is contrary to clearly established law whenever it fails to mention one word from the U.S. Supreme Court's applicable test, emphasizes some factors over others under a totality test, or draws a different conclusion with respect to one factor under a totality test. Only a most ungenerous reading of the Ohio Supreme\n   Court's decision permits the conclusion that the court failed to consider all of the material circumstances surrounding the statements or applied the test unreasonably.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Issa is not eligible for habeas relief for another, freestanding reason: Miles's statements would be admitted today anyway. Under current Confrontation Clause jurisprudence, the statements were readily admissible, making any potential error (including the one identified by the panel) harmless. In\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. Washington\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court abrogated\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   and later cases applying the \"indicia of reliability\" test.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p60\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60-68,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p60\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p60\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).

The point does not stand up. Neither case discussed, or for that matter mentioned, whether\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   applied in this context. They asked only whether\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   applied retroactively because in those cases the decision\n   <em>\n    helped\n   </em>\n   the habeas applicants. Neither case thus had any explanation for addressing today's issue because the statements in both cases were testimonial-and therefore\n   <em>\n    also inadmissible\n   </em>\n   -under\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Stallings\n   </em>\n   said exactly that.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3729762\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/576/\">\n    464 F.3d at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

What makes it worse is to replace it with an approach that comes to the\n   opposite conclusion and violates AEDPA in the process. Congress has authorized federal courts to give habeas relief to a prisoner only when a State presently holds him in violation of his constitutional rights, not to someone who at some prior point was held in violation of the Constitution according to a later-overruled precedent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). There's no other way to read that provision. All in all, the panel's new rule runs headlong into the language of the habeas statute, buries a precedent (\n   <em>\n    Desai\n   </em>\n   ) that comes to the opposite conclusion, and has no provenance in\n   <em>\n    Fulcher\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Stallings\n   </em>\n   -the two decisions that allegedly gave the panel an explanation for looking anew at the issue in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Don't let the timing of\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   , or this two-decade-old trial distract you. There are\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   independent reasons for denying relief under AEDPA today: No eligible constitutional violation occurred under\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the tests at\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   time. Whether one considers the belt for denying relief (that the state-court decision did not contradict or unreasonably apply the\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   test) or the suspenders (that Issa is not currently in custody in violation of the Constitution under the\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   test), the conclusion is identical: The writ cannot issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   What to do? On the one hand, several considerations support en banc review of this decision. The panel ignored, indeed seemingly overruled, our decision in\n   <em>\n    Desai\n   </em>\n   . And in doing so, it precipitated a circuit split. At least one other circuit has followed\n   <em>\n    Desai\n   </em>\n   in denying confrontation claims under \u00a7 2254(a) when the statements are not testimonial under\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v. Superintendent Dallas SCI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518421\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/902/156/#p163\">\n    902 F.3d 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163-64 (3d Cir. 2018). Plus, I have a hard time looking the other way when the statute that gives federal courts this supervisory power requires a showing that the state courts \"contradicted\" or \"unreasonably applied\" Supreme Court precedent, and yet at least the same (if not more) can be said of our panel's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On the other hand, the dispositive hand for me, the number of cases presenting this issue is small and growing smaller.\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   was decided in 2004. It thus would seem to be the rare, perhaps non-existent, non-capital case that will raise the issue today. As for capital cases, the number of cases presenting this issue must be vanishingly small. Even with the snail-like pace of capital-habeas litigation, the number of capital-punishment convictions obtained under\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   leading to habeas claims looked at after\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   must be near zero as well. Consider what must happen. You need a capital case that turns on the out-of-court statement of a witness who does not testify. Then you need a federal habeas decision that the state court contradicted or unreasonably applied the\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   test in admitting the witness's statement. Then you need a situation in which the evidence, while inadmissible under\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   , would be admissible under\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   . One could add the condition that the witness must have crossed the international date line before trial without materially shrinking this tiny pool of cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Not every error, it's worth remembering, is worth correcting through the en banc process. That's why a decision not to vote for en banc rehearing, in the words of Judge Harry Edwards, does not \"sanction the result [the panel] reached\" but simply reflects that it does not justify such a \"significant expenditure of judicial energies.\"\n   <em>\n    Bartlett ex rel. Neuman v. Bowen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331153,1730402\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/824/1240/\">\n    824 F.2d 1240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1243-44 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (Edwards, J., concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc) (quotation omitted). The trust implicit in delegating authority to three-judge panels to resolve cases as\n   they see them would not mean much if the delegation lasted only as long as they resolved the cases correctly as others see them. Last but not least: We are not the court of last resort. From time to time, it's worth letting the United States Supreme Court decide whether a decision is correct and, if not, whether it is worth correcting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For these reasons, I concur in the denial of rehearing en banc.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
