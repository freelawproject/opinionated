Bilateral tax treaties between the United States and other nations reduce this tax rate to encourage cross-border investments and allow taxpayers to avoid double taxation. This case concerns an attempt by Swiss-domiciled Starr International Company, Inc.

After establishing residence in Switzerland in 2006, Starr sought to pay a reduced tax rate under the U.S.-Swiss Treaty. Because Starr did not automatically qualify for treaty benefits, it relied on Article 22(6) of the Treaty, a provision that allows for discretionary tax relief. Article 22(6) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   A person that is not [otherwise] entitled to the benefits of this Convention ... may, nevertheless, be granted the benefits of the Convention if the competent authority of the State in which the income arises so determines after consultation with the competent authority of the other Contracting State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   U.S.-Swiss Treaty art. 22(6). A Swiss taxpayer will be denied relief under Article 22(6) if the U.S. Competent Authority determines that obtaining benefits under the Treaty was one of the taxpayer's \"principal purposes\" in establishing itself in Switzerland. Dep't of the Treasury, Technical Explanation of the Convention Between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income (\"Technical Explanation\") 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Starr sought discretionary relief from the U.S. Competent Authority-the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") Deputy Commissioner for the Large Business and International Division-for the 2007 tax year. The IRS denied Starr's request after concluding that obtaining treaty benefits was a principal purpose of Starr's move to Switzerland. Objecting to this determination, Starr filed a claim for a refund of approximately $38 million in taxes improperly withheld. Starr then brought suit for a tax refund in the District Court, alleging that the IRS erred in denying Starr benefits under the U.S.-Swiss Treaty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The District Court dismissed Starr's tax refund claim on the ground that it raised a nonjusticiable political question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Starr Int'l Co., Inc. v.

Because we hold that Starr can proceed with its tax refund claim, we also hold that Starr does not have a cause of action under the APA. We therefore vacate the District Court's decision granting summary judgment against Starr on its APA claim, and remand with instructions to dismiss that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The U.S.-Swiss Treaty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Section 881(a) of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a 30 percent tax on the U.S.-source income, such as dividend income, of foreign corporations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20881\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). To collect this tax, the IRS requires U.S. corporations issuing dividends to withhold the tax from the foreign taxpayers and remit it directly to the IRS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Dividend income may be subject to a lower tax rate if the taxpayer is a resident of a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty. As relevant here, the U.S.-Swiss Treaty reduces the tax on U.S.-source dividend income for Swiss residents from 30 percent to either 5 or 15 percent, depending on the Swiss entity's percentage of ownership in the U.S. corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.-Swiss Treaty art. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   By reducing tax rates, bilateral tax agreements like the U.S.-Swiss Treaty serve several purposes, including removing impediments to trade and cross-border investment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tax Convention with Switzerland, S.

Treaty \"Limitation on Benefits\" provisions establish the criteria taxpayers must meet in order to obtain benefits. These provisions are designed to filter out \"treaty shoppers,\" or residents of third states who use legal entities established in a contracting state in order to obtain the benefits of a tax treaty. Technical Explanation 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Article 22 is the \"Limitation on Benefits\" section of the U.S.-Swiss Treaty. It begins with a series of objective, mechanical tests designed to identify those treaty-country residents who merit benefits because of legitimate, non-tax motives for their claimed state of residency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.-Swiss Treaty art. 22(1)-(3);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Technical Explanation 59. For example, individuals residing in Switzerland, certain Swiss family foundations, and companies engaged in business in Switzerland that meet specified criteria are automatically eligible for benefits. U.S.-Swiss Treaty art. 22(1)(a), (c), (g). The \"assumption\" underlying these tests is that a taxpayer who satisfies them \"probably has a real business purpose for the structure it has adopted, or has a sufficiently strong nexus\n   to the other Contracting State\" to warrant benefits, and such \"business purpose or connection outweighs any purpose to obtain the benefits of the Convention.\" Technical Explanation 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Treaty drafters recognized that certain entities with legitimate reasons for residing in a contracting state might fail the rigid mechanical tests of Article 22, which \"cannot account for every case in which the taxpayer was not treaty shopping.\" Technical Explanation 60. Accordingly, paragraph 6 of Article 22 leaves open the possibility of discretionary relief for persons who are not otherwise entitled to benefits \"if the competent authority of the State in which the income arises so determines after consultation with the competent authority of the other Contracting State.\" U.S.-Swiss Treaty art. 22(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Paragraph 6, like the mechanical tests, aims \"to identify investors whose residence in the other State can be explained by factors other than a purpose to derive treaty benefits.\" Technical Explanation 60. Therefore, in deciding whether a taxpayer qualifies for relief under Article 22(6), the competent authority of the treaty country in which the taxpayer's income arises\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   will base a determination under this paragraph on whether the establishment, acquisition, or maintenance of the person seeking benefits under the Convention, or the conduct of such person's operations, has or had as one of its principal purposes the obtaining of benefits under the Convention. Thus, persons that establish operations in one of the States with a principal purpose of obtaining the benefits of the Convention ordinarily will not be granted relief under paragraph 6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\"AIG\"). Starr continued to hold significant investments in AIG common stock, its principal asset, at all times relevant to this case. In 2004, Starr relocated to Ireland from Bermuda, where it had long resided. In Ireland, Starr paid a reduced rate of withholding tax on dividends under a bilateral income tax treaty between the United States and Ireland. In 2006, Starr established itself in Switzerland and subsequently sought to reduce its dividend tax rate by obtaining benefits under the U.S.-Swiss Treaty. Because Starr did not automatically qualify for benefits under the mechanical tests of Article 22, it requested discretionary relief under paragraph 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After a prolonged review process from 2007 to 2010, the U.S. Competent Authority issued a final determination letter denying Starr's request. The Competent Authority found it \"impossible ... to conclude that obtaining treaty benefits was not at least one of the principal purposes for moving [Starr's] management, and therefore its residency, to Switzerland.\" Joint Appendix (\"J.A.\") 256. The letter pointed to \"facts and circumstances regarding [Starr's] original structure and subsequent restructurings\" that the Competent Authority found \"troubling,\" including Starr's (1) legal organization and initial incorporation in Panama, (2) relocation to Ireland and enjoyment of tax treaty benefits shortly before the payment of AIG dividends, (3) brief residence in Ireland before moving to Switzerland, and (4) control by predominately U.S. individuals.

Explaining that it could not \"dictate the contents of any diplomatic communications in which the executive branch engages,\" the court assumed that a decision about Starr's eligibility for relief under Article 22(6) would impermissibly \"establish the outcome of any negotiation or consultation between an executive-branch official and representatives of a foreign country.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.

This understanding of Starr's tax refund claim and the political question doctrine was incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A District Court decision will have no impact on the consultation between the U.S. and Swiss Competent Authorities. Starr asks for a judicial determination as to whether the Government erred in denying Starr treaty benefits. As explained below, if the District Court finds the IRS's position indefensible, it can stay the case pending consultation between the Competent Authorities, as consultation is required before a refund can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.-Swiss Treaty art. 22(6). The IRS then can return to court and present any new evidence from consultation. Our holding does not grant Starr the right to review the consultation. Rather, consultation is merely one element of the IRS's deliberative process. The Government may use information that arises out of consultation as support for its ultimate decision, but Starr duly concedes that it has no right to challenge the consultation itself. And a foreign authority's views do not control any determination by the U.S. Competent Authority under Article 22(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Argument at 39:14-39:35, 45:13-45:35, No. 17-5238 (D.C.

The plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   sought prospective, non-monetary relief, so an APA action was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   , Starr challenges the validity of an individual tax, not IRS procedures, and requests retroactive monetary relief. We therefore remand the\n   case to the District Court to allow Starr to pursue its claim for a tax refund. One of four possible scenarios will likely play out, though the parties and the District Court may consider other ways to proceed:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   1. The U.S. Competent Authority could decide to proceed with consultation and might subsequently determine that Starr is entitled to benefits under the U.S.-Swiss Treaty. If the IRS awards Starr the monetary amount it seeks, the case will presumably be moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   2. The U.S. Competent Authority might consult with its Swiss counterpart and maintain its current position that Starr is not entitled to Treaty benefits. Engaging in consultation before further proceedings in the District Court could expedite resolution of this case and give the Government any additional information that might come from consultation. If the District Court finds that the IRS should have deemed Starr eligible for benefits under Article 22(6), then the court may award Starr the money it seeks, consultation having already occurred as required under the Treaty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   3. The IRS might choose to maintain its current position without engaging in consultation at this time. If the District Court finds the IRS's position indefensible, it can stay the case pending consultation between the U.S. and Swiss Competent Authorities, as no refund can be granted without consultation. The IRS can return to court and have the opportunity to present any new evidence that may have come to light during consultation. This posture would not afford Starr the right to seek review of the consultation, which is simply part of the IRS's deliberative process. But if the IRS returns to the District Court and cites information obtained during the consultation process as the reason for denying tax benefits, that decision would be reviewable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   4. If the refund action goes forward and the District Court finds the evidence supports the IRS's decision to deny benefits, then judgment may be granted in the Government's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In the last three scenarios above, appellate review may be sought by an aggrieved party, as appropriate. In reviewing any IRS decision to deny Starr benefits under the U.S.-Swiss Treaty, the District Court will use established principles of treaty interpretation in evaluating the IRS's application of Article 22(6). \"The interpretation of a treaty ... begins with its text.\"\n   <em>\n    Medellin v.
