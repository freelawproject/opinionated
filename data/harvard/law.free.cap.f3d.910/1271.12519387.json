The Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) dismissed Olivas-Motta's appeal from the IJ's order. Olivas-Motta now petitions for review of the Board's dismissal. We have\n   jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we deny the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Olivas-Motta is a citizen of Mexico who was admitted to the United States of America as a lawful permanent resident on or about October 12, 1976. He has since been convicted of two felonies. On August 11, 2003, he was convicted of facilitation to commit unlawful possession of marijuana for sale in violation of Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 13-1004, 13-3405. On November 26, 2007, he was convicted of felony endangerment under Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 13-1201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 2, 2009, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against Olivas-Motta under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(ii) as an alien convicted of two CIMTs. The IJ determined, and the parties no longer dispute, that the facilitation offense was a CIMT. As to the endangerment offense, the IJ determined that it was neither categorically a CIMT nor a CIMT under the modified categorical approach. However, the IJ examined evidence beyond the record of conviction, including police reports, and determined that the offense involved moral turpitude. The IJ then sustained the charge of removal. The Board relied on the same grounds to conclude that the endangerment offense was a CIMT and dismissed Olivas-Motta's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Olivas-Motta petitioned for review of the Board's decision. While the petition was pending, the Board published an opinion holding that felony endangerment under Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 13-1201 was categorically a CIMT.\n   <em>\n    In re Leal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2020\">\n    26 I. &amp; N.

He argues that the Board's application of\n   <em>\n    Leal I\n   </em>\n   was impermissibly retroactive, that preclusion bars the Board from reconsidering whether felony endangerment was categorically a CIMT, and that the phrase CIMT is unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Olivas-Motta also argues that we are not bound by\n   <em>\n    Leal II\n   </em>\n   because it was wrongly decided.

Olivas-Motta argues that, in this case, the\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   factors strongly counsel against retroactively applying\n   <em>\n    Leal I\n   </em>\n   to his case, and that the Board accordingly erred in concluding that Arizona felony endangerment is categorically a CIMT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As a threshold matter, we must address whether retroactivity is implicated by\n   <em>\n    Leal I\n   </em>\n   . The government argues that a change in law is a prerequisite to\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   balancing, and that we should not conduct a retroactivity analysis because no change in law occurred. Olivas-Motta argues that the\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   factors themselves account for whether a change in law has occurred, and that\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   balancing is therefore appropriate because\n   <em>\n    Leal I\n   </em>\n   was decided after his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We conclude that a change in law must have occurred before\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   is implicated. The requirement that the law have changed in some way is generally a settled principle of retroactivity analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James B. Beam Distilling Co. v.

It would be incongruous to apply a different rule here because the principles animating a statute's retroactivity - \"fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations\" - are equally animating in Olivas-Motta's immigration proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vartelas v.

Moreover, were we to adopt the rule that\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   balancing is required regardless of whether a change in law has occurred, the mere existence of a new published decision on an issue would always trigger retroactivity analysis. This too is contrary to settled law on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manhattan Gen. Equip. Co. v.

We therefore hold that\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   retroactivity analysis is only applicable when \"an agency consciously overrules or otherwise alters its own rule or regulation,\" or \"expressly considers and openly departs from a circuit court decision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Garfias-Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646486\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/504/#p514\">\n    702 F.3d at 518-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Olivas-Motta's primary argument against this conclusion is the language of the\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   factors. It is true that the second\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   factor is \"whether the new rule represents an abrupt departure from well established practice or\n   <em>\n    merely attempts to fill a void in an unsettled area of law\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1477898\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/1322/#p1333\">\n    691 F.2d at 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Retail, Wholesale and Dep't Store Union v.

But we must consider the\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   factors in light of the general rules of retroactivity, which require a change of law. In addition, the other\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   factors themselves contemplate a change from a \"former rule\" or \"old standard.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1477898\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/1322/#p1333\">\n    691 F.2d at 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Retail\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3587352,719726\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/466/380/\">\n    466 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   390 ). We therefore distinguish between cases where a rule, such as\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(ii), already exists, and an administrative decision simply clarifies the rule's application, and cases where the decision itself would \"take away or impair vested rights acquired under existing laws, or create a new obligation, impose a new duty, or attach a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past.\"\n   <em>\n    Vartelas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188982\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/257/#p273\">\n    566 U.S. at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188982\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/257/#p273\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Soc'y for Propagation of Gospel v.

In fact, as discussed below, the BIA's precedent in 2007 suggested that reckless endangerment under \u00a7 13-1201 would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be classified as a crime involving moral turpitude.

He therefore had his attorney explore the possibility of pleading guilty to a lesser offense. Olivas-Motta's defense counsel consulted with an experienced immigration lawyer, who surveyed the law as it then stood. She advised that having Olivas-Motta plead guilty to reckless endangerment under \u00a7 13-1201 would minimize the risk of deportation because that offense in all likelihood would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be regarded as a crime involving moral turpitude.

After all, placing someone in \"substantial risk of imminent death\" would certainly seem to qualify as reprehensible conduct. And indeed, in 2012, that is exactly what the BIA concluded in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Leal\n   </em>\n   , where the agency held for the first time that reckless endangerment under \u00a7 13-1201 constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2020\">\n    26 I. &amp; N.

To answer that question, we apply the test from\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v.

The fourth factor strongly favors Olivas-Motta, as the burden imposed by retroactively applying the law in effect in 2014 is severe: Under the rule adopted in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Leal\n   </em>\n   , his conviction for reckless endangerment would be regarded as a crime involving moral turpitude, subjecting him to removal from the United States and separation from his family.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646486\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/504/#p514\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646486\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/504/#p514\">\n    at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When he pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment in 2007, the BIA had an established standard for determining which recklessness offenses constitute crimes involving moral turpitude. The Attorney General's subsequent decision in\n   <em>\n    Silva-Trevino\n   </em>\n   represented an \"abrupt departure\" from that standard,\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1477898\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/1322/#p1333\">\n    691 F.2d at 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted), in the sense that it replaced the aggravating-circumstance requirement with a new, more expansive standard. That change in the governing standard was outcome determinative with respect to certain offenses, as we know from the way the BIA classified \u00a7 13-1201 before and after\n   <em>\n    Silva-Trevino\n   </em>\n   . Before the Attorney General's decision, the BIA had held (in non-precedential decisions) that reckless endangerment under \u00a7 13-1201 does not constitute a crime involving moral turpitude; afterward the BIA definitively held exactly the opposite. Because Olivas-Motta had no reason to anticipate elimination of the aggravating-circumstance requirement, his reliance on the pre-\n   <em>\n    Silva-Trevino\n   </em>\n   standard when deciding to plead guilty was eminently reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garfias-Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646486\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/504/#p514\">\n    702 F.3d at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (second and third factors weigh in favor of retroactive application when the petitioner \"could reasonably have anticipated the change in the law such that the new 'requirement would not be a complete surprise' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1477898\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/1322/#p1333\">\n    691 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1333-34 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   It's true, as the government argues, that the status of \u00a7 13-1201 had not been settled definitively in Olivas-Motta's favor prior to 2008. So this is not a case in which it is 100% clear that Olivas-Motta would have prevailed under the pre-\n   <em>\n    Silva-Trevino\n   </em>\n   standard. But, contrary to the majority's apparent assumption,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maj. op. at 1278, that is far from fatal under the second and third\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Miguel-Miguel v.

At the time he pleaded guilty, there was\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   a realistic chance that his reckless endangerment offense would not be classified as a crime involving moral turpitude; the BIA had already so held in two non-precedential decisions.

Indeed, in each of the pre-\n    <em>\n     Silva-Trevino\n    </em>\n    cases in which the BIA held that a reckless endangerment offense qualified as a crime involving moral turpitude, no one disputed that the aggravating-circumstance requirement applied.
