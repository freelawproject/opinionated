Years later, Wells Fargo discovered defects in UNB's underwriting and demanded that FAMC repurchase the loans or indemnify Wells Fargo for its losses. FAMC similarly demanded that UNB indemnify FAMC for its payments to Wells Fargo in accordance with their agreement. UNB refused. The district court granted summary judgment to FAMC on its breach of contract claims against UNB. We now AFFIRM that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FAMC and UNB entered into a Correspondent Loan Purchase Agreement (Agreement) in 2005, by which FAMC agreed to purchase mortgage loans from UNB. In exchange, UNB made certain representations and warranties about the loans it would sell, including that \"[t]here [would be] no fact or circumstance with respect to the Mortgage Loan that would entitle\" a subsequent purchaser \"to demand repurchase of a Mortgage Loan\" from FAMC. UNB also agreed to repurchase any mortgage loans if one of its representations or warranties turned out to be false or if a subsequent buyer required that FAMC repurchase the mortgage loan. Additionally, UNB promised to indemnify FAMC for \"any and all losses\" that FAMC incurred due to \"[a]ny misrepresentation\" or breach \"of any of the ... representations, warranties, or obligations under this Agreement\" by UNB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties agreed that Tennessee law would govern the Agreement. FAMC and UNB later modified the original Agreement\n   with a Delegated Underwriting Agreement (Modification) in which UNB agreed to perform the underwriting for loans it sold to FAMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At issue here are two loans UNB sold to FAMC-one sold in 2006 (the \"Salvino Loan\") and one sold in 2007 (the \"Turner Loan\"). Per the parties' arrangement, UNB underwrote both loans. FAMC promptly resold both to Wells Fargo. In February and March 2010, Wells Fargo notified FAMC that it had identified defects in the underwriting for both loans, including missing documents and income miscalculations. After internal appeals in which FAMC disputed some of the defects and tried to resolve others, Wells Fargo demanded that FAMC repurchase the Salvino Loan and indemnify Wells Fargo for its losses arising from the Turner Loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   FAMC did so in November 2010 (Salvino Loan) and August 2011 (Turner Loan), paying Wells Fargo a total of $231,225.33 for the two loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After satisfying its repurchase and indemnification obligations to Wells Fargo, FAMC invoked the Agreement to demand repurchase and indemnification from UNB. UNB refused to repurchase the Salvino Loan or indemnify FAMC for either. To cut its losses, FAMC resold the Salvino Loan to a third party for $42,278.48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2013, FAMC filed a complaint alleging that UNB's refusal to repurchase or indemnify had breached their Agreement. FAMC moved for summary judgment on its claims; UNB made a cross-motion for summary judgment on several affirmative defenses, including its claim that the statute of limitations had run. The district court granted summary judgment to FAMC, denied it to UNB, and awarded FAMC $188,858.71 in damages. UNB timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The primary issue in this appeal is whether the district court properly denied summary judgment to UNB on its statute of limitations defense (and, relatedly, whether the district court properly granted summary judgment to FAMC despite that defense). We review a district court's summary judgment decision de novo, applying the same standards the district court used.\n   <em>\n    Villegas v. Metro.

The claims accrued at this time, says UNB, because UNB made the allegedly false representations and warranties at the time of purchase. UNB further argues that the Agreement's repurchase and indemnification provisions did not create any independent obligations accruing after the purchase date; these provisions instead simply provided alternative remedies for any breach of warranty. In support of its view, UNB points to a body of cases addressing this precise issue-mortgage repurchase provisions-under New York law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    ACE Sec.

UNB would have us apply the same reasoning under Tennessee law and hold that the causes of action here accrued in 2006 and 2007, when FAMC purchased the defective Salvino and Turner loans. This would mean that Kansas' five-year statute of limitations barred FAMC's 2013 complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   FAMC argues in response that the causes of action accrued in 2010 and 2011, rather than in 2006 and 2007. FAMC reminds us that the New York cases are inapplicable to contracts governed by Tennessee law, and points to cases resolving related issues differently under Delaware, Missouri, and Minnesota law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bank of N.Y.

Mo. July 22, 2016). FAMC concedes that Tennessee has not addressed this precise question. Nevertheless, FAMC argues that under Tennessee law the repurchase and indemnification provisions created independent contractual obligations. Therefore, FAMC concludes, the causes of action for breach did not accrue until 2010 and 2011, when FAMC incurred its losses, and the 2013 complaint is timely regardless of whether the Tennessee or Kansas statute of limitations applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We are not convinced that Tennessee law would treat repurchase provisions any differently than New York law. FAMC has not identified any substantive differences between Tennessee and New York contract law that would lead to the conclusion that\n   <em>\n    ACE Securities\n   </em>\n   ' reasoning should not apply to the repurchase provisions of the contract. But we affirm the result below nonetheless because FAMC also alleged breaches of the Agreement's indemnification provision, which falls squarely into\n   <em>\n    ACE Securities\n   </em>\n   ' exception for contractual agreements that \"undertake a separate obligation, the breach of which does not arise until some future date.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n    15 N.Y.S.3d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n    36 N.E.3d at 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    ACE Securities\n   </em>\n   , the buyer of numerous mortgage loans demanded that the seller repurchase defective loans, as they had agreed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n    15 N.Y.S.3d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n    36 N.E.3d at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, the repurchase clause was only a remedial provision. \"The cure or repurchase obligation is an alternative remedy, or recourse, for the [buyer], but the underlying\n   <em>\n    act\n   </em>\n   the [buyer] complains of is the same: the quality of the loans and their conformity with the representations and warranties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n    15 N.Y.S.3d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n    36 N.E.3d at 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The repurchase provision in this Agreement is similar in all material respects to the one analyzed in\n   <em>\n    ACE Securities\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, FAMC cannot assert a claim for breach of the repurchase protocol separate from the alleged breaches of the representations and warranties, and any such claim would have accrued on the date those representations and warranties were made-at purchase, in 2006 and 2007.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n    15 N.Y.S.3d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n    36 N.E.3d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That conclusion does not end our inquiry, however, because FAMC also alleged breaches of the Agreement's indemnification provision. Pursuant to the indemnification provision, UNB agreed that it would \"indemnify [FAMC] and ... hold [FAMC], it[s] officers, directors, and shareholders harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, penalties, damages, or other harm or injury\" that FAMC might suffer because of UNB's error or misconduct. The Agreement also underscores the independent and distinct nature of the indemnification obligation, stating the obligation exists \"[i]n addition to the repurchase obligation of [UNB] and all other rights and remedies available to [FAMC]\" and \"shall survive any termination of the Agreement.\" That distinguishes the indemnification provision here from the repurchase provision in\n   <em>\n    ACE Securities\n   </em>\n   , which the court said \"could not reasonably be viewed as a distinct promise of future performance,\" in part because \"nothing in the contract specified that the cure or repurchase obligation would continue for the life of the loans.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, by contrast, the Agreement on its face demonstrates that FAMC and UNB intended to \"shift[ ] the entire burden of loss or responsibility\" to UNB, even after the rest of the Agreement no longer had effect.\n   <em>\n    Triangle Am.

The New York cases themselves do not discuss indemnification claims; the plaintiffs there had not asserted any. Nor could they have done so. The New York plaintiffs were trusts that had purchased and then pooled thousands of mortgage loans in order to sell residential mortgage-backed securities. When the mortgage borrowers defaulted or the trusts themselves discovered defects, the trusts sought repurchase to cut their losses. But since the trusts had not re-sold the actual loans to any third parties, there would have been no viable indemnification claims-just claims for breaches of the mortgages' warranties and representations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    ACE Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n    15 N.Y.S.3d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318626\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/581/\">\n    36 N.E.3d at 624-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (no mention of indemnification);\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr.

It argued indemnification to the district court; indeed, the district court's summary judgment order relied on FAMC's evidence that UNB had failed to fulfill its express indemnity obligation. We therefore conclude that FAMC properly pleaded contractual indemnity claims for statute of limitations (and accrual) purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As its last line of defense, UNB asserts that FAMC has no indemnification claims because the Modification executed by the parties (in which UNB agreed to underwrite loans it sold to FAMC) limited the remedies available to FAMC. UNB points to language in the Modification stating that \"[UNB] shall repurchase any loan purchased by [FAMC] hereunder, subject to the terms of\" the Agreement's repurchase provision. UNB would have us believe that this language amended the original Agreement to eliminate all remedies except repurchase because otherwise the language would merely restate a preexisting obligation and would be superfluous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We disagree. For one thing, we concluded above that the indemnification provision is not a mere remedial provision; it creates a separate, distinct obligation. Even so, the Modification did not abrogate the Agreement's indemnification provision. The Modification stated that it would \"supplement and[,] to the extent inconsistent, modify\" the original Agreement. It made clear that the original Agreement \"shall remain in full force and effect as supplemented and modified hereby.\" Nothing in the Modification, including the provision highlighted by UNB, indicates any intention to limit FAMC's remedies to repurchase alone. And the \"shall repurchase\" language is not inconsistent with the Agreement's indemnification obligations, which were explicitly \"[i]n addition to the repurchase obligation ... and any and all other rights and remedies available.\" We acknowledge that this Modification language thus merely restates UNB's preexisting repurchase obligation. But there is no general prohibition against redundant contract language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TMW Enters., Inc. v. Fed. Ins.

The Modification's \"shall repurchase\" language is not ambiguous, and we decline to create an ambiguity. We conclude, therefore, that the Modification did not eliminate the Agreement's indemnification obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court correctly concluded that FAMC's claims as to the Salvino and Turner Loans accrued in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The 2013 complaint was, therefore, filed well within the limitations period, regardless of whether Kansas's five-year or Tennessee's six-year limitations period applies. Accordingly, we need not address UNB's arguments regarding repurchase provisions or decide whether Tennessee law recognizes a discovery rule that would toll the limitations period for breach of contract actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Having resolved UNB's most compelling argument in FAMC's favor, we can now easily resolve the rest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   UNB first asserts that FAMC produced insufficient evidence of breach and causation for summary judgment. We disagree. In Tennessee, a \"plaintiff alleging breach of contract must prove: (1) the existence of an enforceable contract, (2) non-performance amounting to a breach of the contract, and (3) damages caused by the breached contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Nw.

R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Both sides admitted the existence of an enforceable contract. FAMC pointed to evidence in the record sufficient to show it suffered losses as a result of misrepresentations and miscalculations made by UNB in its underwriting. FAMC's evidence demonstrated that based on these defects, Wells Fargo demanded and received payment from FAMC. Finally, FAMC showed that UNB breached the Agreement by failing to indemnify FAMC for its losses and presented evidence of the exact amount of the damages caused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With this evidence, FAMC \"met its burden of raising sufficient facts to entitle its motion to be granted as a matter of law under Rule 56(c).\"\n   <em>\n    Chi.

But UNB's response to FAMC's motion for summary judgment did not directly address the evidence presented in FAMC's motion. Rather, UNB focused mainly on the same affirmative defenses and other ultimately unpersuasive arguments on which its appellate brief focused. Therefore, the district court correctly granted summary judgment to FAMC on the first and second elements of both causes of action (the existence of an enforceable contract, and breach).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (\"If a party ... fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the court may ... consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   UNB next argues that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether there actually were \"material misrepresentations\" in the loan documents, saying that \"the parties dispute whether the Salvinos and the Turners made material misrepresentations on their loan applications.\" UNB speculates that both loans might have been approved by the loan underwriting program anyway, even if there were no misrepresentations, so any breach was not material. According to UNB, to prove the misrepresentations, FAMC needed to \"present ... evidence to contradict the borrowers' certifications under penalty of perjury that the information in their loan applications were true and correct.\" But this argument misses the mark entirely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The relevant issue is not whether the Salvinos and Turners committed fraud, but whether the underwriting measured up to the standard required by the parties' agreements. FAMC presented more than enough evidence to show that the underwriting performed by UNB was deficient; the incomes had been miscalculated, and documents required to verify the homeowners' incomes were missing. This evidence directly contradicts UNB's contractual representation that \"no fact or circumstance with respect to the Mortgage Loan\" existed \"that would entitle\" a subsequent purchaser \"to demand repurchase of a Mortgage Loan.\" And whether or not the loans at issue \"would still ... have qualified for approval\" absent these defects is beside the point. There\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   defects, and those defects entitled Wells Fargo to demand payment from FAMC. Pursuant to the Agreement, UNB had an obligation to indemnify FAMC for these payments. Furthermore, FAMC presented evidence (never addressed by UNB) to show that the Turner Loan's mortgage insurance had been rescinded, in breach of UNB's warranty that it had (and would continue to have) such insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Calling the alleged defects \"insignificant technicalities,\" UNB asserts that the Agreement \"does not impose\n   <em>\n    strict liability\n   </em>\n   on UNB,\" but \"rather a defect must be\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   to rise to the level of triggering an actionable claim.\" But we search in vain for any contractual language that would support UNB's position. In some portions of the Agreement, the parties did use the word \"material\" to qualify their obligations. For example, the Agreement required repurchase if \"[a] post-closing quality control review\" revealed \"any\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   fraud or misrepresentation.\" There was no such limitation in the indemnification provision. Rather, UNB broadly agreed to indemnify FAMC for \"\n   <em>\n    any and all\n   </em>\n   losses ... arising out of ...\n   <em>\n    [a]ny\n   </em>\n   misrepresentation\" by UNB or \"\n   <em>\n    [a]ny\n   </em>\n   breach\" of UNB's \"representations, warranties, or obligations under this Agreement.\" We cannot infer a materiality requirement at odds with the indemnification provision's text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dick Broad. Co., Inc. of Tenn. v. Oak Ridge FM, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094688\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/395/653/#p659\">\n    395 S.W.3d 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659 (Tenn. 2013) (\"The literal meaning of the contract language controls if the language is clear and unambiguous.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, UNB failed to present evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact about whether Wells Fargo demanded repurchase\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   the defects. UNB pointed to testimony from FAMC's corporate representative, for example, that because of the economic climate of the time, \"not every instance of a default or delinquency with regard to these loans necessarily flowed from some poor quality underwriting.\" But that evidence does not show that something besides the loan defects caused Wells Fargo's repurchase and indemnification demands, and is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

App'x 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403 (6th Cir. 2014) (\"Evidence that is merely colorable\n   or not significantly probative is not sufficient ....\"). Similarly, UNB claims that the misrepresentations did not actually cause any damages or trigger the indemnity obligations because FAMC simply complied with Wells Fargo's demands, ostensibly in order to preserve goodwill with its largest purchaser. But UNB failed to point to any concrete evidence to show that this is true generally, and likewise has not shown that this case's particular repurchase and indemnity demands were paid merely out of obeisance to Wells Fargo. To the contrary, FAMC presented evidence showing that it appealed the demands within Wells Fargo's internal appeals process. In sum, summary judgment on both the breach and causation issues was appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Next, UNB argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact over whether FAMC properly mitigated its damages when, following UNB's refusal to repurchase the Salvino Loan, FAMC resold the loan at a significant discount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The problem for UNB is that failure to mitigate damages is an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    Aqua-Chem, Inc. v.

Ct. App. May 26, 2016). UNB thus bears the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether FAMC's mitigation efforts were reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Great Am.

And UNB failed to produce or point to any concrete evidence showing that FAMC's mitigation efforts were unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Rather, in both its response to FAMC's summary judgment motion and its brief on appeal, UNB merely described FAMC's resale process and then asked a series of questions about that process. For example, UNB asked why FAMC did not get an appraisal of the Salvino Loan; whether the amount of FAMC's payment to Wells Fargo was reasonable; whether FAMC requested supporting documents or clarification of vague or non-descriptive line items in Wells Fargo's expense statement; and why FAMC never \"pursued the borrowers for deficiency judgments.\" UNB points to deposition testimony where FAMC's representative stated that FAMC had not taken such steps. But that, without more, is simply insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To avoid summary judgment, UNB needed to do more than suggest possible problems with FAMC's mitigation. UNB needed to present and point to evidence that affirmatively demonstrated FAMC's mitigation efforts were not reasonable. For example, expert testimony on what the appraisal value of the property would have been might have been sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact; simply asking why no appraisal was done is certainly not enough. Expert testimony that industry custom dictates certain mitigation steps perhaps could create a genuine issue of material fact; simply pointing out that FAMC had not taken certain steps cannot. Under Rule 56(e), UNB needed to \"do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v.

Therefore, UNB says, FAMC could have immediately sought indemnification from UNB and any cause of action must have accrued at that time. But that is not true.

The document calls itself a \"Loan Modification Agreement,\" and explicitly states that \"except as otherwise specifically stated in this Agreement, the original Note and Mortgage\"-the Salvino Loan-\"will remain unchanged.\" UNB points out that FAMC's corporate representative called the as-modified Salvino Loan a \"new, different loan,\" but that is irrelevant to our analysis.
