At sentencing, the District Court applied a four-level enhancement to Hester's Guidelines range under the theory that Hester's possession itself constituted New Jersey evidence tampering. In light of the District Court's uncertainty regarding the proper application of the enhancement, the court varied downward to mitigate its effect, and sentenced Hester to 86 months' imprisonment. Hester appeals both the denial of the motion to suppress and the application of the enhancement at sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the denial of the motion to suppress. However, we hold that the application of the evidence tampering sentencing enhancement was erroneous. Accordingly, we will vacate the sentence and remand to permit resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 7, 2014 around 11:40 p.m., Hiddayah Muse parked a car in front of a corner store in Newark, New Jersey, in close proximity to a crosswalk. Muse left the car idling while she entered the store, with Appellant Michael Hester waiting in the passenger seat. Meanwhile, four officers in two police cars-one marked, one not-were on patrol in the area and noticed that the idling vehicle was illegally parked fewer than twenty-five feet from the crosswalk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The officers remained to investigate in light of the parking violation and the vehicle's location in front of a store with a known history of narcotics sales. Several of the officers had specific knowledge of the store's history. One had made multiple drug arrests there; another testified that he was \"very familiar\" with the store because it had \"been the subject of many investigations\" connected to \"distribution of many various narcotics.\" App. 242. The officers also knew that the store had a buzzer system, which would allow staff to deny them permission to enter without a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As soon as Muse exited the store and re-entered the vehicle, the marked police car pulled up along the driver's side of the car, and the unmarked car pulled up behind it. The officers exited their cruisers and approached both sides of the vehicle on foot. One of the officers from the marked police car approached Muse at the driver's side window; the other three approached and stood at the passenger's side of the vehicle-in this case, on Hester's side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When an officer began his questioning of Muse, she admitted that she did not have a driver's license and that the car was not registered in her name. At that point, the officer directed Muse to turn off the engine\n   and step out of the car. Hester-who had remained in the passenger seat as the officers pulled up, approached the car on foot, and began questioning Muse-interjected, \"We're good, officer. I can drive.\" App. 11. Hester then began to rise and exit the vehicle but, as he did so, one of the officers heard what sounded to him like the familiar thud of a gun hitting the floorboards of a vehicle. Another officer, who had been observing Hester's hands and testified to seeing him drop the gun, verbally alerted the other officers to the presence of a weapon. At the verbal signal, Hester attempted to run, but one officer reached for and caught Hester's shirt and Hester was quickly apprehended. In the interim, one of the officers near the vehicle confirmed the presence of a gun at the foot of the passenger's seat and remained with the weapon per police protocol. Hester was then arrested and taken into custody. Because of the rapid turn of events, the officers did not search Muse and ultimately allowed her to drive away, notwithstanding her lack of a license to drive the vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because Hester had previously been convicted of a felony, he was indicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Hester moved to suppress the firearm, arguing that the police had seized him the moment that they parked, with lights flashing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   alongside and behind the car in which he sat, and that the stop had not been supported by reasonable suspicion. The District Court denied the motion, concluding that the interaction with the police up until Hester's attempt to flee was a consensual encounter. In the alternative, the District Court determined that, even if it assumed Hester had been seized when the officers boxed in the vehicle, such seizure was a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop supported by reasonable suspicion because the car was illegally parked in front of a known narcotics front late at night in a high crime area. The parties thereafter stipulated to the facts and proceeded by bench trial. Hester was convicted on the sole count of the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At Hester's sentencing, the parties disputed the applicable Guidelines range. The pre-sentence report calculated an offense level of 26, which included a four-level enhancement for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). Without the enhancement, the applicable Guidelines range would have been 84 to 105 months; with the enhancement, the range increased to 120 to 150 months. The Government sought the enhancement on the grounds that Hester's cousin had previously used the same firearm in an unrelated crime and had given it to Hester for disposal. In support of this theory, the Government cited recordings of calls Hester made to relatives from jail in which he expressed regret that he had still been in possession\n   of the firearm when he encountered the officers, having intended to dispose of it. The Government argued that this was tantamount to evidence tampering, a separate felony under New Jersey law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:28-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although the District Court twice described the Government's proposed application of the sentencing enhancement as \"a little crazy,\" the Court nevertheless applied the enhancement. App. 357. To mitigate its effect, however, the Court varied downward by four offense levels-the exact number added by the enhancement. The District Court sentenced Hester to 86 months' imprisonment, the Guidelines range that would have applied without the enhancement was 84 to 105 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hester timely appealed both the denial of the motion to suppress and his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The District Court had jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We have so held, because a traffic stop necessarily entails the communication by police of a \"show of authority\" and, by virtue of a vehicle's slowing down, ceasing to move, or refraining from reentering the roadway, submission to that authority. The circumstances under which a parked vehicle may be seized, however, is a question we have answered to different effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two cases in particular are instructive here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

One police car pulled in front of the convertible, and the second pulled behind to box it in and inhibit an escape attempt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"573061\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/53/616/#p617\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   One officer exited his car and approached the passenger's side on foot, and a second crouched behind his cruiser.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Soon thereafter, a third patrol car arrived, and a third officer approached with a police dog. Under that set of circumstances, we considered not whether the situation involved a consensual encounter or a seizure, but rather, a seizure or an arrest. We then recognized that the police conduct in\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   was unquestionably a show of authority, at a minimum.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"573061\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/53/616/#p617\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"573061\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/53/616/#p617\">\n    at 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because \"the van was parked in a public place with the rear doors open\" in the mid-afternoon, the officers could see the van's occupant bagging a substance that appeared to be marijuana even from a distance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8968841\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/413/347/#p353\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8968841\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/413/347/#p353\">\n    at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Only once the patrol cars were stationed at the perimeter of the vehicle did the officers approach on foot. The officers, too, positioned themselves around the vehicle, near any potential exit points-one officer at the driver's side, and three officers on the passenger's side.

We have previously held that the \"[p]roper application of the four-level enhancement under [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) requires finding, by a preponderance of the evidence ... that the defendant committed another felony offense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, the District Court's application of the enhancement to the specific facts of this case was clearly erroneous, because the Government did not show by a preponderance of the evidence that Hester had committed New Jersey evidence tampering. Second, the District Court incorrectly interpreted the Guidelines provision, as a matter of law, by finding that the possession itself-which was coextensive with the alleged secondary felony-occurred \"in connection with\" the subsequent felony offense. We hold that the application of the enhancement in such\n   a manner is erroneous under any circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Even if the only issue before this Court were whether Hester had tampered with evidence, the Government did not meet its burden to show that Hester committed such a crime. The secondary offense at issue during sentencing was tampering with evidence under New Jersey law. N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:28-6. The New Jersey Supreme Court has held that \"the crime of tampering with evidence of a possessory crime\n   <em>\n    includes as a necessary element the permanent alteration, loss, or destruction of the evidence itself\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Mendez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1010118\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/175/201/\">\n    175 N.J. 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1010118\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/175/201/\">\n    814 A.2d 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1049 (2002) (emphasis added). The Government could not establish that Hester had effectuated the loss or destruction of the weapon, precisely because the Government\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   recover it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Therefore, in order for the enhancement to apply, the Government would have had to show that Hester effectuated the permanent alteration of the gun in a manner that deprived the police of its evidentiary value, or that he took affirmative steps to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . The Government argues that Hester attempted to tamper with evidence, by virtue of his apparent intention to dispose of the gun, expressed after-the-fact in telephone conversations while Hester was incarcerated. But we cannot agree that\n   <em>\n    ex post\n   </em>\n   expressions of regret about not having committed a potentially criminal act amounts to an attempt to commit that same criminal act. Accordingly, because the Government failed to meet its burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that Hester committed or attempted to commit evidence tampering as defined by New Jersey law, the District Court committed clear error by applying the sentencing enhancement to the facts in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   However, even without regard to whether the Government met its burden to show that Hester tampered with evidence, the sentencing enhancement under (b)(6)(B) would not apply to Hester's circumstances as a matter of law. The Guidelines provide for a four-point offense level enhancement \"[i]f the defendant ... used or possessed any firearm or ammunition\n   <em>\n    in connection with\n   </em>\n   another felony offense; or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed\n   <em>\n    in connection with\n   </em>\n   another felony offense.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) (emphasis added). Supreme Court precedent, this Court's case law, and the Guidelines all make clear that, in this particular context, the phrase to use or possess \"in connection with\" means the facilitation of the secondary felony offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Smith v.
