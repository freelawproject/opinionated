This is surely common for legislative bodies, which students visit on field trips to observe democratic proceedings, or in which students work or volunteer as government pages or other similar positions. Besides, how does the demographic of the audience on a given day alter the nature of a deliberative body's meeting?

The prayers and invocations occurred prior to the start of the meeting and were not included on the meeting minutes.

The Board policy contains no religious preference, and no statement regarding religious preference was made at the time the Board adopted the policy. The panel relies on statements of individual Board members who did not author or sponsor the Board policy and which did not reference the Board's prayer or invocation policy.
