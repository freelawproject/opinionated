The court rejected Soltysik's contention that\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   balancing is inherently \"fact-intensive\" such that the court should allow the parties to proceed to discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As to Soltysik's associational claim, the district court concluded as a matter of law that the statutes' party-label restriction was not a \"severe\" burden, reasoning that the statutes neither barred ballot access to any candidate nor infringed on a candidate's ability to associate with nonqualified political bodies. The court also noted that candidates lack the right to use the ballot \"to convey a political message or even a voter cue.\" The district court then considered the State's purported interests in (1) \"protecting the integrity, fairness, and efficiency of [its] ballots and election processes\"; (2) \"prevent[ing] 'frivolous or fraudulent candidacies' \"; (3) \"establish[ing] minimum qualifications for political parties to participate in the election and to appear on the ballot to avoid confusion, deception, and frustration of the democratic process\"; and (4) preventing \"sloganeering designations.\" The district court did not mention election costs. The district court concluded that the State's interests were, as a matter of law, \"sufficiently weighty to justify the slight burden that the party designation restrictions ... place[d] on [Soltysik's] rights to association and equal protection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As to Soltysik's viewpoint-discrimination claim, the district court rejected Soltysik's argument that the ballot is a limited public forum such that strict scrutiny applies. Applying the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   balancing test again, the court held that the statutes were \"viewpoint neutral\" because the requirements of Section 5100, which govern the difference between qualified and nonqualified parties, regulated all parties regardless of viewpoint and were thus themselves neutral. Concluding there was no burden \"by way of viewpoint discrimination,\" the district court did not consider the State's interests again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, the district court rejected Soltysik's compelled-speech claim for two reasons. First, the court reasoned, the label \"Party Preference: None\" was accurate in the context of the California Elections Code, since \"party\" refers only to a\n   <em>\n    qualified\n   </em>\n   party, which the Socialist Party USA is not. Therefore, the court said, \"it is accurate to describe [Soltysik's] 'Party Preference' as 'None.' \" Second, the court continued, because ballots were not \"candidate speech,\" the party preference label was not \"compelled speech.\" And with no \"restriction on [Soltysik's] right to be free of compelled speech,\" reexamination of the State's interests was, in the court's view, unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Soltysik timely appealed.

Most obviously, as applied to Soltysik and other candidates who prefer nonqualified parties, California's party-preference regime is potentially misleading in at least two ways. First, \"Party Preference: None\" suggests that Soltysik, an avowed Socialist, has no political preferences, affiliations, or beliefs, which is simply untrue. Second, even if we assume that a reasonable California voter is aware that the Elections Code defines \"party\" to mean \"qualified party,\" the phrase \"Party Preference: None\" suggests that Soltysik has no preference as among the six qualified parties, which may or may not be true. Stated differently, the \"Party Preference: None\" label suggests that Soltysik, and other candidates like him, have affirmatively chosen to eschew the views of all six qualified parties, regardless of any actual ideological overlap.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chamness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063079\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/1110/#p1116\">\n    722 F.3d at 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting possibility that \" 'No Party Preference' might ... evoke a neutral or even negative view-that the candidate is apathetic to the views of the other parties;\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., while he does not identify with them, he does not reject them.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   These two suggestions are not only factually misleading. Given the potential power of the party-preference label as a signal to voters of a candidate's ideological bona fides, a label suggesting affirmative dissociation from any political ideology is also a potentially significant handicap \"at the climactic moment of choice\" in the voting booth.\n   <em>\n    Rosen v.

But the California statutes here grant an accurate party label-and thus the benefit of a potentially powerful voting cue-to candidates who affiliate with a qualified party, while denying that label and that benefit to candidates who do not. \"A burden that falls unequally on new or small political parties or on independent candidates impinges, by its very nature, on associational choices protected by the First Amendment\" and \"discriminates against those candidates and-of particular importance-against those voters whose political preferences lie outside the existing political parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/\">\n    460 U.S. at 793-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, we conclude that the burden on candidates like Soltysik is neither severe nor minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   That the statutes permit Soltysik to convey his political preferences to voters outside the ballot is not enough to neutralize the burden the misleading party-preference label allegedly imposes. Soltysik avers that when he told voters on the campaign trail that the \"Party Preference: None\" label would appear beside his name on the primary ballot, voters questioned the authenticity of his affiliation with the Socialist Party USA. If these allegations are true-and at this stage of the litigation we must assume they are-then his ability to promote his views through other means was meaningless. To borrow another court's phrasing, \"the absence of a label for a candidate\"-or in this case, the use of a misleading one-\"gives rise to mistrust and negative inferences\" and denies a candidate \"the identification he had worked to establish at the crucial moment of choice in the election campaign.\"\n   <em>\n    Rosen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514014\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/970/169/#p175\">\n    970 F.2d at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Having established the extent of the burden Soltysik has pleaded, we turn now to the other side of the scale. Without factual support at this early stage, the Secretary's arguments for the \"Party Preference: None\" requirement do not warrant dismissal of Soltysik's claims. The Secretary and CADOP's primary purported justification\n   for the statutes-avoiding voter confusion-is an important government interest.\n   <em>\n    Chamness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063079\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/1110/#p1116\">\n    722 F.3d at 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet we struggle to understand how this regime-which requires Soltysik, the National Male Co-Chair and California State Chair of the Socialist Party USA, to be listed as having no \"party preference\"-advances that goal. Indeed, it seems self-evident that this regime has precisely the opposite consequence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Nor is it clear why less burdensome (and less misleading) alternatives would not accomplish the goal of reducing voter confusion or, as the Secretary and CADOP also assert, preventing candidates from disguising political slogans or commercial advertisements as party-preference labels or from circumventing California's ban on \"status designations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2013107\">\n    Cal.

For example, the Secretary could place an asterisk by the name of any candidate who does not affiliate with one of the six qualified parties, directing the voter to a short and clear explanation that the candidate is not so affiliated. Or the ballot could list the political body with which a candidate identifies (such as the Socialist Party USA), and, again using an asterisk, specify that that body does not qualify as a \"party\" under California law. These techniques may accommodate whatever continued interests California may have in maintaining the distinction between qualified and nonqualified groups,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chamness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063079\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/1110/#p1116\">\n    722 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1118-19 &amp; n.5, while avoiding mischaracterizations of candidates affiliated with the latter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Of course, there may be other (and better) ways of accommodating California's interests without the potentially misleading \"Party Preference: None\" designation. But without any factual record at this stage, we cannot say that the Secretary's justifications outweigh the constitutional burdens on Soltysik as a matter of law. A fully developed evidentiary record will permit a court to evaluate whether the \"Party Preference: None\" requirement is a constitutionally permissible means of combatting voter confusion, or whether there are more precise ways to accomplish this goal that do not falsely describe the preferences of candidates like Soltysik.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Chamness\n   </em>\n   , which featured a similar (but meaningfully different) California ballot requirement, illustrates why a remand for further factual development is warranted here.

Reviewing the grant of summary judgment in the Secretary's favor, our court rejected Chamness's First and Fourteenth Amendments claim because he \"failed to provide any\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   that the two phrases are actually likely to be understood by voters to convey ... different meanings, and, if they do, that the distinction would tend to affect the way voters cast their votes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1117-18 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, because the district court dismissed his complaint, Soltysik never had\n   the opportunity to develop such evidence, and on the record before us we cannot say as a matter of law that the \"Party Preference: None\" designation is a sufficiently unobtrusive means of clarifying to voters that Soltysik's preferred political body does not qualify as a \"party\" under California election law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Duke v.
