Plaintiffs-appellants (\"the Flight Attendants\") all work or worked for defendant-appellee SkyWest Airlines, Inc., an airline owned by co-defendant-appellee SkyWest, Inc. (collectively \"SkyWest\"). The Flight Attendants filed suit alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . (\"FLSA\"), and various state and local wage laws, seeking to certify a class of similarly situated SkyWest employees. The district court dismissed the complaint in its entirety, finding that the Flight Attendants had failed to allege a FLSA violation, and that the dormant Commerce Clause barred the state and local claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Flight Attendants plausibly allege they were not paid for certain hours of work. We agree with other federal circuits, however, that under the FLSA the relevant unit for determining a pay violation is not wages per hour, but the average hourly wage across a workweek. Because the Flight Attendants failed to allege even a single workweek in which one of them received less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, we affirm the dismissal of those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We do not agree, though, with the application of the dormant Commerce Clause in this case. States possess authority to regulate the labor of their own citizens and companies, so we apply that doctrine sparingly to wage regulations. The dormant Commerce Clause does not preclude state regulation of flight attendant wages in this case, particularly when the FLSA itself reserves that authority to states and localities. Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of the state and local wage claims and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

SkyWest employs over 2,600 people as cabin crew, and either currently employs or formerly employed the eight plaintiffs-appellants in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   SkyWest flight attendants are based out of airports in ten different states, including these Flight Attendants' home states of Arizona, California, Illinois, and Washington. A new flight attendant at SkyWest earns $17.50 per hour, and wages increase with experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A flight attendant's typical workday is long and varied, including time onboard the aircraft as well as in airports before, between, and after flights. SkyWest Flight attendants are paid only for their time in the air, known in the industry as \"block time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amount of block time worked in a given day is much shorter than the \"duty day.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The eight Flight Attendants each pleaded, with varying specificity, times during which they were not paid for portions of their duty days. For example, plaintiff-appellant Stover alleged a two-week period in October 2012 during which she was paid $656.25 for 86.07 hours of duty time, resulting in an average hourly wage of $7.62 per hour. In contrast, plaintiff-appellant Lozano alleged only that he worked many hours of duty time and included no wage-specific information. The common thread underlying the various Flight Attendants' allegations, though, is that none of them alleged a single workweek in which they were paid, on average, less than $7.25 per hour, the federal minimum wage under FLSA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs-appellants Hirst, Stover, and Stroble Sze sued in March 2015 in the Northern District of Illinois alleging that SkyWest violated the FLSA and the Illinois Minimum Wage Law by failing to pay minimum wage. Several months later, plaintiffs-appellants Tapp, Sitavich, Hudson, Colson, and Lozano filed a similar action in the Northern District of California under the FLSA and state and local minimum wage laws and ordinances in California, Arizona, and Washington. Both complaints sought class certification of nationwide, state, and local classes. The two cases were consolidated in the Northern District of Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After allowing multiple amended complaints and limited discovery, the district court dismissed all of the Flight Attendants' claims with prejudice. The court determined that, in assessing violations of the federal minimum wage, an employee's wage is calculated as the average hourly wage across the workweek. Because none of the Flight Attendants pleaded a single workweek in which they were paid an average\n   wage of less than $7.25 per hour, the court concluded they had not properly pleaded a FLSA violation. The district court also held that their state and local wage claims were preempted by the dormant Commerce Clause. Applying the approach the Supreme Court delineated in\n   <em>\n    Pike v.

They contend compliance for flight attendants should be measured by \"pairing,\" or work trip out and back from their base airport, instead of by workweek. SkyWest points out that every other federal circuit to reach this issue has applied the workweek measure to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   industries, and FLSA compliance should therefore be determined from the average hourly pay over a given workweek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The text of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   does not state what measure should be used to determine compliance with the minimum wage, nor do any of the surrounding provisions provide guidance.

SkyWest is subject to many minimum wage laws that impose serious compliance costs. But the existence of a great regulatory burden on an employer does not necessarily mean minimum wage laws have a discriminatory effect on interstate commerce. State and local wage laws can burden companies within their own localities just as much, if not more, than out-of-state ones.
