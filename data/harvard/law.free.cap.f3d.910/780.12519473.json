Aggrieved at their portrayal in the film, appellants-Virginia Citizens Defense League and two of its members, Daniel L. Hawes, and Patricia Webb-filed this action. They alleged defamation by the film's creators, appellees Katie Couric, Stephanie Soechtig, Atlas Films LLC, and Studio 3 Partners, LLC (doing business as Epix Entertainment LLC). The district court dismissed their complaint, and appellants appeal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2016, journalist Couric and filmmaker Soechtig released a documentary titled\n   <em>\n    Under the Gun\n   </em>\n   . The documentary concerns gun policy in America, and it takes a perspective favoring regulation. Couric narrated the film, interviewed participants, and served as an executive producer. Soechtig directed and edited the film, which Atlas Films produced and Epix distributed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although the film advocates for gun control, its creators assertedly sought to present viewpoints from organizations that opposed measures like universal background checks. To that end, a producer employed by Atlas Films contacted the Virginia Citizens Defense League (\"VCDL\"), a non-profit gun-rights organization, and set up an interview with members of the VCDL. Nine members, including Hawes and Webb, agreed to participate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The final cut of the film includes portions of Couric's interview with these VCDL members. The segment lasts just over three minutes. At its outset, Couric thanks the VCDL members for participating, noting that they \"have a specific point of view on this issue and some of the issues that we're tackling.\" Couric then poses a series of questions on gun policy. She asks about the appeal of owning a gun, and whether a person should have to pass a background check to purchase a gun. She also asks whether anyone in the group feared that the government would take their guns. These questions prompt detailed responses from the panel members, which are included in the film. Apart from the filmmakers' lighting choices, appellants do not object to this portion of the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Instead, this suit centers on a twelve-second clip at the close of the three-minute VCDL interview. In it, Couric asks the following question: \"If there are no background checks for gun purchasers, how do you prevent felons or terrorists from purchasing a gun?\" Approximately nine seconds of silence follow, during which the VCDL members, including Webb, a gun store owner, and Hawes, an attorney, sit in silence and shift uncomfortably in their seats, averting their eyes. The film cuts to a revolver chamber closing. Couric then says: \"The background check is considered the first line of defense, and 90% of Americans agree it's a good thing.\" Neither the VCDL nor its members are mentioned again in the 105-minute film.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although the film accurately portrays most of the interview with VCDL members,\n   the twelve-second clip described above did not transpire as depicted. In the unedited footage, Couric's background check question prompted approximately six minutes of responses from the VCDL members. Hawes responded by suggesting that the government cannot, consistent with the Constitution, prevent crimes through prior restraint. Webb commented that background checks are unlikely to prevent motivated criminals from obtaining guns or committing crimes. These responses were followed by approximately three minutes of related discussion between Couric and the panel. Rather than use these responses, the filmmakers spliced in b-roll footage taken prior to the interview in which Couric asked the VCDL interviewees to sit in silence while technicians calibrated the recording equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shortly after the film's showing at various film festivals, the VCDL released unedited audio of the interview. In the public backlash that followed, Couric issued a statement admitting that the edited version of the film did \"not accurately represent [the VCDL members'] response\" and that the segment was \"misleading.\" Believing the misleading segment to be defamatory, the VCDL and two of its featured members, Hawes and Webb, brought this action. The district court dismissed their complaint for failure to state a claim, reasoning that the film was neither false nor defamatory and that, as to claims brought by the VCDL, the film was not \"of and concerning\" the organization. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We review de novo a district court's grant of a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Reyes v.

Accepting Hawes' defamation per se claim would require us to extend mere silence into professional ineptitude. Thus, his claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Similarly, the film is not reasonably capable of suggesting that Webb is unfit to own a gun store. Arguing otherwise, Webb contends that her \"business requires her to be knowledgeable ... about the right of individuals to purchase firearms,\" and that the edited footage suggests that \"she lacks knowledge regarding integral aspects of her business.\" But of course, no part of Webb's job as a gun store owner requires her to have nuanced views on gun\n   <em>\n    policy\n   </em>\n   . Had the film suggested that Webb did not know, for instance, whether a gun store owner must perform a background check, this might be a different case. But as the district court explained, \"[n]ot having an answer to a specific question about effective alternatives to background checks does not imply anything about fitness to own a gun store and to sell guns.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We also agree with the district court that the edited footage cannot reasonably be construed as implying, as appellants argue, that the VCDL is unfit as a \"pro-Second Amendment advocacy organization.\" At most, the film suggests that a handful of VCDL members, none of whom are identified as leaders within the organization, could not immediately answer a difficult gun policy question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Resisting this conclusion, the VCDL argues that the footage implies that it \"failed to deliver on its mission, thereby casting aspersion on the VCDL's prestige and standing in the field of Second Amendment advocacy.\" Once again, this argument requires a court to extend the film's meaning well beyond what the clip shows.\n   <em>\n    Schaecher\n   </em>\n   , 772 S.E.2d at 595. Even for an organization steeped in gun policy, the essential message that VCDL members failed to respond instantly to a complex question is simply not defamatory. For the same reasons, the film cannot reasonably be understood as defaming Webb and Hawes in their respective capacities as executive members of the VCDL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Having resolved appellants' per se claim, we consider their contention that the film implied other actionable defamatory meanings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Appellants maintain that the edited footage suggests that the VCDL and its members have no basis for opposing background checks or are otherwise uninformed in their areas of expertise.

The disputed segment comes on the heels of several other questions concerning background checks, and the panelists' answers to all of those questions are included in the film.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To be sure, the film gives the impression that Couric's final question stumped the panelists. But at worst, the plain, ordinary meaning of this edit conveys that these particular members of the VCDL, after answering a series of related questions, did not have a ready-made answer to a nuanced policy question.

Regardless of how certain media outlets covered the short-lived frenzy surrounding this incident, the Supreme Court of Virginia has consistently stressed that it is the province of courts to perform the \"gatekeeping\" role of distinguishing defamatory speech from mere insults.\n   <em>\n    Schaecher\n   </em>\n   , 772 S.E.2d at 595 ;\n   <em>\n    Webb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20S.E.2d%20808\">\n    752 S.E.2d at 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Courts should not-indeed, cannot-abdicate this role in hopes that a member of the press or public will answer the question for them. Instead, Virginia law requires courts to exercise independent legal judgment as to whether challenged statements are susceptible to the defamatory meaning alleged.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Perk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=485%20S.E.2d%20140\">\n    485 S.E.2d at 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that challenged statements were not \"sufficiently defamatory on their face to permit a fact finder to decide whether in fact the statements were actually defamatory\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   If any doubt remained on this point, the Supreme Court of Virginia's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Webb v. Virginian-Pilot\n   </em>\n   closes the\n   door. There, the court considered an appeal from a jury verdict that rested on testimony from several witnesses suggesting that they inferred defamatory meaning from the challenged news article.\n   <em>\n    Webb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20S.E.2d%20808\">\n    752 S.E.2d at 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notwithstanding this evidence, the court reversed, holding as a matter of law that the article was not reasonably capable of the defamatory meaning ascribed.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Applying these principles, we conclude that the district court properly performed its independent gatekeeping role in this case. And on the merits of that question, the district court reached the correct result.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The crux of appellants' defamation claims is that the edited interview \"manufacture[d] a false exchange ... that made [appellants] look ridiculous, incompetent, and ignorant about firearm ownership and sales, including the policies surrounding background checks.\" Although we agree that the filmmakers' editing choices were questionable, the edited footage simply does not rise to the level of defamation under Virginia law. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Appellants' attempt to modify this standard by relying on the Restatement's suggestion that it suffices for a statement to injure one's reputation in the mind of \"a substantial and respectable minority\" of the community,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 559 cmt. e, rather than \"in the common estimation of mankind,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Schaecher\n    </em>\n    , 772 S.E.2d at 594. This argument fails. Virginia courts have never articulated such an approach or applied this portion of the Restatement. Moreover, the Restatement comment does not alter the central requirement that a given statement must be capable of\n    <em>\n     defamatory\n    </em>\n    meaning, a high bar that appellants cannot clear regardless of how we frame the relevant population.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    \"Unlike most states, Virginia makes no distinction between actions for libel and those for slander.\"\n    <em>\n     Fleming v.
