In particular, they claim the MDOC's policies expose the class to a substantial risk of serious harm. The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   granted class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We granted the Defendants' Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f) petition for interlocutory appeal of the grant of class certification, and now affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Postawko, Baker, and Jamerson (the Named Plaintiffs) are each incarcerated in the MDOC. They filed an action asserting that they received inadequate medical care for their HCV infections and sought class certification. The following facts were contained in the Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint. HCV is a viral infection that can cause liver damage and other extremely serious side effects. Those who contract HCV may suffer inflammation of the liver, known as hepatitis. In turn, those with hepatitis may suffer significantly impaired liver functioning. A decrease in liver function may result in symptoms such as severe pain, fatigue, difficulty or pain with urination, and an increased risk of heart attacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   HCV may be either acute or chronic. While some acute HCV infections are resolved naturally, others develop into chronic HCV. Individuals suffering from chronic HCV develop fibrosis of the liver, in which healthy liver tissue is replaced with scar tissue. Patients are said to suffer from cirrhosis when a significant portion of the liver has been converted into scar tissue. Cirrhosis is irreversible. Determining exactly when significant fibrosis amounts to cirrhosis is not always an easy task, complicating treatment. Cirrhosis often causes \"painful complications, including arthritic pain throughout the body, kidney disease, jaundice, fluid retention with edema, internal bleeding, easy bruising, abdominal ascites, mental confusion, lymph disorders, widespread itching, and even more extreme fatigue.\" Some of these complications can cause death if left untreated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At least half of all those who suffer from chronic HCV will develop either cirrhosis or liver cancer. Each day without treatment increases the risk that an HCV infection will either develop into a serious condition such as chronic liver disease, fibrosis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer, or cause death from liver failure. HCV causes the death of more American citizens than any other infectious disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In recent years, significant medical advancements have been made in the treatment of HCV, which gives rise to the Plaintiffs' case. While previous treatments demonstrated only low rates of success and often caused substantial side effects, new direct-acting antiviral drugs (\"DAA drugs\") are estimated to cure over 90% of patients who receive them as treatment. DAA drugs are also estimated to cause a 90% reduction in the risk of liver-related mortality. Those effects, however, may diminish if treatment is delayed. The medical standard of care put forward by organizations such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases now recommends that almost all persons with chronic HCV receive DAA drug treatment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To know whether or not treatment is required, patients must undergo reliable screening for liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. One method for determining the presence and degree of cirrhosis or fibrosis is the AST to Platelet Ratio Index, or APRI. The APRI is derived by analyzing a blood sample of the patient and determining the ratio of a particular enzyme to the number of platelets. While a high APRI score\n   (above 2.0) reliably indicates the presence of cirrhosis or severe fibrosis, a low APRI does not provide conclusive evidence in the other direction; in fact, over half of all patients suffering from cirrhosis will not have an APRI score of 2.0. For this reason, the use of other methods (such as liver biopsies) may be required to reliably determine whether an individual is suffering from fibrosis or cirrhosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The rate of HCV infection among the population of the MDOC is estimated to be at least 10% to 15%. As a highly communicable disease, HCV often spreads among the incarcerated population. The MDOC has provided DAA medications to less than one-half of one percent of inmates in their custody with a known HCV infection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants Precythe, MDOC, and Corizon, LLC have the following policies or customs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (1) not providing DAA drug treatment to all inmates with chronic HCV;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (2) using an APRI score, which measures the progression of fibrosis or cirrhosis, to determine whether a person should be treated;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (3) relying exclusively on APRI score to determine the stage of fibrosis or cirrhosis ; rather than using other more accurate methods of determining its progression through liver biopsies, FIB-4, or FibroScan;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (4) failing to consider providing treatment to HCV-positive inmates unless they have an APRI score above 2.0 that persists for several months, even though more than half of persons with cirrhosis will not have an APRI score at or above 2.0, and they know that AST levels are transient;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (5) disregarding independent diagnoses of cirrhosis or significant hepatitis fibrosis in making their treatment decisions; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (6) basing treatment decisions on cost, rather than on need for treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs alleged that instead of receiving DAA treatment, inmates with HCV but who have an APRI score below 2.0 are given a blood draw every six months and potential counseling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Defendants in this case opposed class certification, arguing in part that the Plaintiffs had not submitted sufficient evidence in conjunction with their motion for certification to allow the district court to conduct the \"rigorous analysis\" that is required under Rule 23.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gen.

In response, Plaintiffs attached evidence to their reply to the Defendants' opposition to class certification supporting their compliance with Rule 23 's requirements. That evidence included multiple records indicating that inmates were denied DAA drug treatment exclusively due to their low APRI scores-even when a Plaintiff had received an independent diagnosis of cirrhosis. For example, one record stated, \"Your APRI score is 0.562 and per protocol the APRI score needs to be greater than 2 to be considered for treatment.\" The district court granted the Defendants leave to file sur-replies to address the Plaintiffs' new evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court granted certification of a class comprised of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   All those individuals in the custody of MDOC, now or in the future, who have been, or will be, diagnosed with chronic HCV, as that term is defined medically, but who are not provided treatment with direct acting antiviral drugs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The district court relied on evidence submitted by both the Plaintiffs and the Defendants to support its certification decision. For example, the court found that the size of the proposed class was likely to number at least 2,000 persons, relying on evidence from one of the Defendants' experts to determine how many of the roughly 5,000 inmates with HCV were likely to develop chronic HCV. The court found that evidence submitted by the Defendants bolstered Plaintiffs' typicality arguments by confirming the Named Plaintiffs' allegations that they were diagnosed with chronic HCV and had not received treatment with DAA drugs. After closely examining the evidence put forward by both sides regarding the existence of a class wide policy, the court concluded that the records submitted by the Plaintiffs showing that they were rejected for DAA treatment and the Defendants' own evidence referencing standardized \"protocols\" for the treatment of chronic HCV satisfied the requirement that Plaintiffs be able to show that the party opposing the class acted or refused to act on grounds applying generally to the class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs initially sought injunctions that would require Defendants to: (1) \"formulate and implement an HCV treatment policy that meets the prevailing standard of care, including identifying persons with HCV\"; (2) \"treat members of the class with appropriate DAA drugs\"; and (3) \"provide members of the class an appropriate and accurate assessment of the level of fibrosis or cirrhosis they have, counseling on drug-drug interactions, and ongoing medical care for complications and symptoms of HCV.\" The district court modified the scope of those proposed injunctions, replacing the direction to \"treat members of the class with appropriate DAA drugs\" with a prohibition on \"delaying or denying DAA drug treatment to class members for any nonmedical reason,\" due to the court's recognition that DAA treatment might conflict with other medical indicators. Plaintiffs also seek a declaratory judgment that the Defendants' policy of withholding treatment with DAA drugs from inmates diagnosed with HCV violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and the ADA. We granted the Defendants' Rule 23(f) petition for interlocutory appeal of the district court's grant of class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
