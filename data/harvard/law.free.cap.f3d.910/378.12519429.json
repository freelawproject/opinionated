We deny the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pedro Olea Camacho is a Mexican citizen who first entered the United States without inspection in 1987. He has been married twice since entering the country. He adjusted his status to lawful permanent resident on December 7, 2000, on the basis of his first marriage. During his application process for adjustment of status, Camacho failed to disclose that he was convicted of fifth-degree theft in Iowa on September 17, 1993.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March of 2015, Camacho was convicted in Iowa of two counts of indecent contact with a child. The charges related to alleged sexual misconduct between 1999 and 2002. The victims were the grandchildren of his first wife. Camacho pled guilty to both counts. Following Camacho's conviction, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") served Camacho a Notice to Appear charging him with removability under:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony (his sexual abuse of a child conviction); \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), as an alien convicted of a crime of domestic violence; \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), as an alien convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude; and \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(A), as an alien who obtained admission via fraud in 2000 by failing to disclose his 1993 theft conviction. Camacho responded by disputing his prior conviction for theft and denying all grounds for removability. On May 26, 2015, the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") issued a decision finding Camacho removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. Camacho then applied to adjust status through his second wife (a US citizen), and sought a waiver of his inadmissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the hearing to evaluate Camacho's application, Camacho testified that he was innocent of the underlying conduct of indecent contact with a child. Camacho explained that he pled guilty to the charges in order to avoid the possibility of a lengthy mandatory minimum sentence if convicted at trial, but that he had not actually engaged in the alleged activity. He\n   said the charges were the result of a plot by his ex-wife to frame him. Other members of his community testified to his good character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The IJ granted Camacho's application, finding that Camacho merited a favorable exercise of discretion. The IJ acknowledged that ordinarily a conviction for sexual abuse of a minor would weigh heavily against granting discretionary relief. However, the IJ found that Camacho's testimony and that of his witnesses \"render[ed] the conduct underlying the [sexual contact] conviction dubious.\" As a result, the IJ announced he would not afford the conviction its ordinary \"full adverse weight.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Neither would the IJ ignore the conviction. Testimony elicited by the government suggested that one of Camacho's victims had attempted suicide following the alleged sexual misconduct. In particular, Camacho's wife acknowledged the attempted suicide during her testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Q: What happened was one of the victims tried to kill herself, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A: Uh-huh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The IJ did not directly quote Ms. Camacho's testimony. The IJ explained, however, that testimony mentioning an \"apparent suicide attempt by one of the victims in concert with the accusations\" led him to consider the conviction (while still giving it less weight to account for the possibility that Camacho was innocent). The IJ found that the other equities, including Camacho's long ties to his community and family, merited relief. The IJ also considered the possibility that Camacho's wife could commit suicide if the pair were separated, writing that \"the potential suicide that completes this analysis balances the alleged suicide that began it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   DHS successfully appealed the grant of discretionary relief to the BIA. The BIA found that the IJ, in crediting testimony suggesting that Camacho may not have committed his crime, impermissibly went \"behind a record of conviction to reassess [Camacho's] ultimate guilt or innocence.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20294\">\n    20 I. &amp; N.

Dec. 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B.I.A. 1990) ). The BIA considered Camacho's denial of the underlying conduct a\n   <em>\n    negative\n   </em>\n   factor weighing against relief, as it demonstrated that he had failed to take responsibility for his misconduct. The BIA also \"found significant\" that one of Camacho's victims \"attempted suicide following this offense.\" The BIA concluded that Camacho was not entitled to a discretionary grant of adjustment of status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Camacho filed a motion asking the BIA to reconsider its decision. In particular, Camacho argued that the BIA's statement that one of his victims \"attempted suicide following this offense\" was not supported by the IJ's fact-finding and that the BIA had violated the clear error standard of review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201003.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(i) and (iv). The BIA denied the motion. The BIA disagreed that its original order committed error in stating that one of Camacho's victims attempted suicide, citing the IJ's discussion of testimony relating to the suicide attempt, as well as Camacho's testimony.

The IJ explicitly admitted that the testimony concerning the attempted suicide would weigh into his consideration of the equities, so that he would not \"ignore\" the conviction. At the same time, the IJ stated that he was unsure the sexual misconduct had, in fact, occurred. Read in context, the only plausible conclusion that can be drawn from the IJ's analysis is that he partially credited testimony regarding the existence of the attempt but was unsure how much weight to give it in his analysis, given his underlying suspicion that Camacho had not actually committed the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, the IJ was not entitled to go behind Camacho's record of conviction to reassess his \"ultimate guilt or innocence\" (as the BIA correctly pointed out when considering DHS's appeal).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   , 20 I. &amp; N.

Removing the possibility that Camacho was innocent of the underlying offense immediately alters the \"balancing\" the IJ performed regarding the conviction. When evaluating the IJ's initial finding of facts, the BIA could correctly reject the IJ's suppositions regarding whether the offense occurred as erroneous as a matter of law. At the same time, the BIA was entitled to weigh other facts-including the evidence regarding the attempted suicide-that the IJ relied on in conducting his analysis. Furthermore, the BIA could give greater weight to those facts in its\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review than the IJ had in his original review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201003.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The BIA's order denying Camacho's motion to reconsider directly addressed the question of sufficiency of the evidence regarding the suicide attempt and whether the BIA violated the clear error standard. In response to Camacho's arguments, the BIA cited the portion of its original order explaining why it weighed the conviction and its attendant circumstances differently than the IJ had in his original review, along with record testimony on that subject. While brief, the BIA's explanation is \"rational\" and reveals that it sufficiently considered the issues raised by Camacho.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Camarillo-Jose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3756698\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/1140/#p1143\">\n    676 F.3d at 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Averianova\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5687402\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/931/#p935\">\n    592 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   936 ).

But the IJ made no factual findings about the alleged suicide attempt. The IJ simply stated: \"[T]estimony mentioned an apparent suicide attempt by one of the victims in concert with the accusations leveled against [Camacho].\" This is not a factual finding, much less a finding that Camacho's actions caused a suicide attempt. Indeed, the IJ's choice of language-later referring to the \"alleged\" suicide attempt-suggests a deliberate effort to\n   <em>\n    avoid\n   </em>\n   making a finding on this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The alleged suicide attempt was mentioned only twice at the hearing. The IJ likely avoided evaluating this testimony because it was so limited and unreliable. Camacho was asked, \"Do you remember in your criminal case that they told that story after [the victim] attempted suicide?\" To which he replied, \"I don't remember that, because when I went to court, that's when they told me everything. That's it.\" Camacho's current wife, Ms. Olea, was also asked about the victim's apparent suicide attempt. Although Ms. Olea acknowledged that she had heard about the apparent suicide attempt, she \"wasn't there\" to hear the child's allegations firsthand so only reported what she had heard from others. Even if it were proper for the BIA to engage in factfinding, its conclusion would not have been supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On reconsideration, the BIA stated simply that the record supported its finding \"that one of [Camacho's] victims attempted suicide following his offense.\" This unsupported factual finding was not made by the IJ, violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201003.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3). Nonetheless, the BIA afforded the fact significant weight in overturning the IJ's decision.
