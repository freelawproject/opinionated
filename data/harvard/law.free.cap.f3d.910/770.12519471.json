Hallembaek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n    824 F.3d 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2016). In that case, Mangum had appealed the district court's denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   challenging his federal sentence. Specifically, Mangum's petition challenged the refusal of the BOP to designate\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   a state facility for service of his federal sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203621\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mangum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n    824 F.3d at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This designation would have effectively run Mangum's federal and state sentences concurrently rather than consecutively, allowing him to credit the time he spent in state prison serving his state sentence toward the previously imposed federal sentence that he had not yet served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This Court agreed with Mangum and held that the BOP abused its discretion in denying his request for\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   designation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203621\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). We therefore vacated in part the district court's judgment and instructed the court on remand to return the matter to the BOP so that the agency could consider Mangum's request again, this time in a manner consistent with the views expressed in this Court's opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mangum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n    824 F.3d at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On remand, the BOP denied Mangum's request for a second time in a decision that contradicts this Court's mandate in\n   <em>\n    Mangum\n   </em>\n   . Because the BOP failed to comply with our mandate, we reverse the district court's denial of Mangum's motion to compel compliance and remand this matter once again. The district court on remand shall enter an order directing the BOP to reconsider Mangum's request for\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   designation in light of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2006, Mangum was indicted for conspiracy to distribute cocaine base in the Middle District of North Carolina.\n   <em>\n    Mangum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n    824 F.3d at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A few months later, in June 2006, Oklahoma state authorities arrested Mangum and charged him with felony assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, misdemeanor possession of a fictitious driver's license, misdemeanor resisting an officer, and misdemeanor obstructing an officer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In August, a federal magistrate judge requested that Oklahoma transfer Mangum to federal custody for his North Carolina proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n    at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mangum ultimately pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine base and was sentenced to 262 months' imprisonment and a five-year term of supervised release.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   During sentencing, the district court did not state whether the federal sentence was to be served concurrently with or consecutive to any other sentence of imprisonment that might result if Mangum were convicted of other offenses in a separate proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the federal proceedings, Mangum was returned to Oklahoma custody in October 2007. He pleaded guilty to the four state charges and was sentenced concurrently to terms of ten years on count one, seven years on count two, and one year each for counts three and four.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The state court specifically ordered that the state sentences run concurrently with the previously imposed federal sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mangum remained in Oklahoma custody while serving his state sentences. He was\n   paroled to a federal detainer on January 13, 2011, and the BOP, in preparing a sentence computation for Mangum, determined that his service of the federal sentence began on this date.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 3, 2013, Mangum requested that the BOP consider whether to designate\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   the Oklahoma prison where he served his state sentence as the place for service of his federal sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203621\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Mangum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n    824 F.3d at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fourth statutory factor the BOP considers in this analysis is \"any statement by the court that imposed the sentence.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203621\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4). The BOP thus attempted to contact Mangum's federal sentencing court to inquire whether the court intended to treat the federal sentence as concurrent with or consecutive to the subsequently imposed state sentence.\n   <em>\n    Mangum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n    824 F.3d at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court never responded to this inquiry, however, and the BOP went on to deny Mangum's\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   request after considering the other statutory factors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n    at 100-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In a letter dated October 14, 2016, the federal court began by acknowledging that Mangum had no state sentence at the time the court imposed the federal sentence.

After acknowledging that its original review \"was not consistent with the views expressed in the Fourth Circuit's opinion in this case,\" the BOP explained that it had \"conducted another review of [Mangum's] request\" on December 23, 2016, \"this time consistent with the Fourth Circuit's directive.\" J.A. 111-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 4, 2017, the district court denied Mangum's motion to compel. J.A. 144-49.

Addressing the fourth factor, the district court noted that the BOP contacted \"the sentencing court, which did not express an opinion at sentencing, ... to obtain an opinion regarding retroactive designation.\" J.A. 148. The district court then reproduced the sentencing court's statement that it would not have ordered that the sentences run concurrently. The district court in its review did not mention that the BOP included the following in the \"Comments\" section at the end of the Factors Worksheet:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   It appears that dicta in the opinion of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Mangum v.

Because the federal sentencing court's views were legally irrelevant, and because it was undisputed that the state court clearly intended for the state sentence to run concurrently with the federal sentence, we stated that \"one might reasonably expect the BOP to exercise its discretion to weigh heavily what the state judge\n   <em>\n    did say\n   </em>\n   rather than what the federal judge\n   <em>\n    did not and could not say\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We then ordered that the BOP on remand \"shall fully evaluate all relevant factors under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203621\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) in a fashion consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The BOP disregarded these instructions on remand. In a letter sent less than three months after this Court's decision issued, the BOP again asked the federal sentencing court whether it would have ordered that Mangum serve his federal sentence concurrently with or consecutive to his state sentence. The BOP's letter clearly indicates that its\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   determination would ultimately turn on the federal sentencing court's response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the federal court indicated that it would not have ordered that the sentences run concurrently \"since the conduct in Oklahoma was not actually increasing his [federal] sentence,\" the BOP recorded this response in its Factors Worksheet as a basis for denying Mangum's\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   request, even though Mangum had not been convicted of the Oklahoma offenses at the time of federal sentencing and thus his conduct in Oklahoma could not have increased his federal sentence. By contrast, the BOP gave the state court's sentencing views only token consideration. It characterized as \"dicta\" this Court's instruction that the BOP consider the state court's views and indicated that it \"has done so in this case\" without elaborating on this assertion or otherwise engaging with the state court's clear preference for concurrent sentences. The district court, overlooking the flaws in the BOP's analysis, concluded that the agency had \"evaluated all of the relevant factors ... in a manner that is consistent with the Fourth Circuit's opinion.\" J.A. 149.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The BOP's actions on remand were directly contrary to this Court's holding that\n   the federal sentencing court's views on Mangum's\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   request were legally irrelevant, and that the BOP thus could give no weight to these views and must instead \"weigh heavily\" the state court's statement that the sentences should run concurrently.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mangum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n    824 F.3d at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather than comply with this directive, the BOP considered each court's position on sentencing and determined that the federal court's views were entitled to more weight than the state court's statement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Resp. Br. 10 (asserting that \"the BOP ... took care to note that, in reaching its designation decision, it had reflected on the state court's wishes\" but \"[t]hat wish was outweighed by other considerations, including that ... the federal sentencing judge would not have ordered its sentence to be concurrent with the unrelated state sentence\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (explaining that \"the clear intent of Mangum's state court sentencing judge was that Mangum's state sentence should run concurrently with his federal sentence, but the federal sentencing court judge indicated that he would not have ordered the sentences to run concurrently\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Under our mandate, however, the state court's statement was entitled\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   to receive more weight than the federal court's views, which could be given no weight under binding circuit precedent at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The BOP thus could not have properly concluded that the state court's clear preference for concurrent sentences was outweighed by any statement from the federal sentencing court. And yet that is precisely what it did. The BOP's weighing of the federal court's sentencing views and its perfunctory consideration of the state court's statement-an assertion that it \"has done so in this case\" with no accompanying reasoning to explain why it was declining to honor the state court's wishes-mark an improper deviation from our mandate and require that we reverse the district court's denial of Mangum's motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Invention Submission Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969029\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/413/411/#p414\">\n    413 F.3d at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"the lower court may not deviate from th[e] mandate but is required to give full effect to its execution\");\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507607\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/5/64/#p66\">\n    5 F.3d at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a district court must \"implement both the letter and spirit of the ... mandate, taking into account [our] opinion and the circumstances it embraces\" (alterations in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It is true, as the respondents contend, that the BOP is not bound by the state court's sentencing preference in the\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barden v.

But as we have explained, the state court's statement that the sentences should run concurrently is entitled to more weight than the BOP gave it, especially because the BOP's Factors Worksheet on its face provides little indication of what factors would justify overriding the state court's preference and denying Mangum's\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   request once the federal court's views are properly excluded from the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The respondents' remaining arguments likewise prove unavailing. The respondents\n   contend that Mangum \"has mischaracterized the scope of the mandate to include dicta,\" but this Court's determination that the federal court's sentencing views were legally irrelevant, and that the state court's preference for concurrent sentences was thus entitled to weight in the\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   analysis, was central to the holding in our prior opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mangum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n    824 F.3d at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The clarity of the BOP's error is made even more plain by [this] second compelling consideration.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/\">\n    at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"one might reasonably expect the BOP to exercise its discretion to weigh heavily\" the state court's statement because the federal court's views are legally irrelevant and directing the BOP on remand to \"fully evaluate all relevant factors ... in a fashion consistent with the views expressed in this opinion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Relying heavily on our unpublished decision in\n   <em>\n    Trowell v. Beeler\n   </em>\n   , the respondents also argue that the BOP conducted a proper\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   analysis because it completed the Factors Worksheet and took into account each of the relevant statutory factors before exercising its broad discretion to deny Mangum's request.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1152329\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/135/590/#p596\">\n    135 F.

Contrary to the respondents' suggestion, however, this case does not involve a routine review of the BOP's exercise of discretion in ruling on a\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   request. This case instead requires us to define the scope of our mandate and determine whether the BOP, in our\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   judgment, \"faithfully executed it.\"\n   <em>\n    Invention Submission Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969029\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/413/411/#p414\">\n    413 F.3d at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We hold that it did not. That the BOP typically enjoys broad discretion in analyzing\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   requests in the first instance bears little relevance to our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, the respondents defend the BOP's actions by contending that \"one might [ ] reasonably expect BOP to follow up with the federal sentencing judge\" given that \u00a7 3621(b) includes as a factor for consideration \"any statement by the court that imposed the sentence.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203621\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4). But this argument runs contrary to our conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Mangum\n   </em>\n   that any statement by the federal sentencing court here would be legally irrelevant because the court could not have ordered that its sentence run consecutively to a future state sentence under binding circuit precedent at the time.

We therefore reverse the district court's denial of Mangum's motion to compel compliance. On remand, the district court shall enter an order directing the BOP to reconsider Mangum's request for\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   designation in light of this opinion.
