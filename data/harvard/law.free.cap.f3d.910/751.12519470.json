Beginning in 2011, West Virginia enacted various laws to limit the reimbursement rates of air ambulance companies. Air Evac, an air ambulance company and registered air carrier, sued to enjoin the enforcement of these provisions, arguing that the state's laws were preempted by the ADA. The district court agreed with Air Evac and enjoined the challenged provisions.

In 1938, the federal government developed a comprehensive scheme to support the growing use of the nation's skies for commercial aviation. Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, Pub. L. No. 75-706,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Stat.%20973\">\n    52 Stat. 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

VI, \u00a7\u00a7 601-610 (civil aeronautics safety regulation). Twenty years later, federal authority over commercial aviation, which had previously been scattered among different agencies, was consolidated under the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) and Civilian Aeronautics Board (CAB). Federal Aviation Act, Pub. L. No. 85-726,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Stat.%20731\">\n    72 Stat. 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1958) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 85-1811, at 10 (1958) (\"The proposed legislation abolishes the present unnatural division of responsibilities.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the subsequent decades, the CAB and the FAA pursued both the economic and safety goals set by Congress. The CAB continued setting strict rates for interstate passenger air travel and controlled entry into the market through its rigorous approval process for new routes, while the FAA oversaw air travel safety. State governments, for their part, actively regulated intrastate air travel as well. The law at the time contemplated dual regulatory regimes and collaboration between the federal and state governments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Federal Aviation Act of 1958, Pub. L. No. 85-726, \u00a7 302(k); H.R. Rep. No. 85-2360, at 14 (1958) (\"The [Federal Aviation Act] gives the Administrator appropriate administrative powers relating to ... cooperation with ... state governments.\"). Many airlines operated both interstate flights and flights within a single state, such as those from Houston to El Paso.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 95-1211, at 2-3 (1978). Because the law permitted two layers of regulation, these airlines were \"required to charge different fares for passengers traveling between cities, depending on whether these passengers were interstate passengers whose fares are regulated by the CAB, or intrastate passengers, whose fare is regulated by a State.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. This administrative system, which included both independent state and federal regulation and strict control over prices and market entry, was \"oriented toward the creation and governmental promotion of [an] air industry\" that had not previously existed. S. Rep. No. 95-631, at 52 (1978).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the decades following the passage of the Federal Aviation Act, air travel continued to grow under the dual oversight of federal and state regulators.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   By the 1970s, Congress found that the air industry had outgrown the old regime. Commercial air travel had become common and accessible. Air carriers had developed the resources and infrastructure to compete with one another on open terms in a free market. In Congress's view, the prior economic framework, characterized by two layers of regulation and rigid economic oversight, was ill-suited to the new competitive landscape. Congress responded by enacting the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), which applied the principles of the free market to the commercial aviation sector.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 95-504,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Stat.%201705\">\n    92 Stat. 1705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Congress's deregulatory goals were embodied in the statute itself, which directed federal regulators to \"place[ ] maximum reliance on competitive market forces\" in carrying out their responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Stat.%201705\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The ADA achieved its market-oriented ends by transforming the federal economic regulation of air carriers, removing entry barriers and allowing prices to respond to consumer demand. The ADA also ensured that these economic reforms would not be unwound by duplicative and inconsistent state regulation. Instead, air travel would be subject to only one layer of regulation. Economic regulation would be overseen by the Department of Transportation (replacing the CAB), while safety regulations would remain with the Federal Aviation Administration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2040101\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 40101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 40109(a) - (b), 41102, 44103 (2012). Whereas before the states were separate regulators, they now became partners in a unified regulatory framework, consulting with the federal government on local needs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Airline Deregulation Act, \u00a7 33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Stat.%201732\">\n    92 Stat. 1732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -34 (providing for consultation on air service determinations in small communities). In the years following passage of the ADA, Congress's deregulatory aims bore fruit as consumer prices fell, even as costs to the industry rose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Accountability Office, GAO-06-630, Airline Deregulation 18-19 (June 2006); Stephen Breyer, Regulation and its Reform 197-98 (1982) (\"Experience since the passage of the [ADA] suggests that [Congress'] diagnosis [was] correct, because prices in real terms have fallen despite rising fuel costs and the industry's profitability has not been significantly affected.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It is in this deregulatory context that the ADA's preemption clause was enacted. The text of the provision now reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [A] State ... may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier that may provide air transportation under this subpart.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041713\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the U.S. Code was reorganized in 1994, the clause now appears in Subpart II of the amended Federal Aviation Act, which includes \"economic regulations\" and is administered by the Department of Transportation. Pub. L. No. 103-272 (1994) (amending Title 49 of the U.S. Code \"without substantive change\"). As the plain language of the preemption clause demonstrates, Congress sought to prevent states from imposing a wide variety of regulations on the aviation industry. The provision accordingly expressed a \"broad pre-emptive purpose\" that is consistent with the deregulatory aims of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p383\">\n    504 U.S. 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 383,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p383\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/#p383\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   It is now forty years since the passage of the ADA, and commercial aviation has\n   continued to grow with and adapt to market forces. One area of active innovation has been healthcare aviation, where air ambulances are now a familiar part of emergency healthcare response. All over the country, but particularly in rural areas, air ambulances can play a vital and life-saving role in responding to medical emergencies. At the federal level, these companies are regulated as air carriers. Like all other regulated air carriers, air ambulances operate under both safety and economic regulation. The FAA, as the agency responsible for administering federal safety regulations generally, provides air ambulance safety authorizations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2044702\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 14 C.F.R. pt. 135 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The economic authorization for air ambulances is more complex. Because these companies are considered \"air taxi operators,\" they are subject to less extensive regulations than larger carriers, like major commercial airlines or cargo transportation.

In response, some insurance companies have refused to pay the full reimbursement costs. The air ambulance companies have in turn sought payment directly from the patients, a practice known as \"balance-billing.\" To prevent covered patients from receiving these bills, some insurers have agreed to pay more to the air ambulance company. For those insurers that did not agree, covered patients were regrettably often stuck with the bill for the remainder. The costs of these services have not gone unnoticed. The Government Accountability Office provided Congress with a report on air ambulance pricing in July of 2017, specifically noting consumer concerns related to balance-billing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Accountability Office, GAO-17-637, Air Ambulance: Data Collection and Transparency Needed to Enhance DOT Oversight (July 2017). Just a few months ago, Congress took action on the issue. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which became law during this appeal, addresses air ambulances directly. Pub. L. No. 115-254 (2018). First, it empowers the Secretary of Transportation to collect more data on air ambulance pricing and provide additional information to consumers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266345\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/893/#p903\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 314. Second, it invites stakeholders, including states, into the policymaking process by forming a committee to advise the Secretary of Transportation on air ambulance billing practices.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266345\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/893/#p903\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 418(a)-(b). Third, the law gives the Secretary authority to regulate air ambulance companies directly, both to ensure transparency around costs and \"to provide other consumer protections for customers of air ambulance operators.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266345\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/893/#p903\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 418(f)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Many states have also responded, attempting to both lower their own costs and prevent the balance-billing of their citizens. In recent years, states have tried to lower prices either by regulating the amount that air ambulance companies can charge private parties,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Air Evac EMS, Inc. v. Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527194\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/331/650/#p655\">\n    331 F.Supp.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 655-56 (W.D. Tex. 2018), or by requiring air ambulance companies to accept lower\n   reimbursement rates,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Valley Med Flight, Inc. v. Dwelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344215\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/171/930/#p934\">\n    171 F.Supp.3d 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 934-35, 941-42 (D.N.D. 2016) (enjoining a state law that incentivized an air ambulance provider to contract with a private insurance company).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   West Virginia, the appellant here, is no exception. Beginning in 2011, the state enacted new laws and regulations aimed at air ambulance expenses. As it now stands, the West Virginia scheme targets air ambulance costs in two contexts. The first is the state workers' compensation system, which covers employees of private companies and is managed by the state's Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2023-4-3\">\n    W. Va. Code \u00a7 23-4-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2016). The West Virginia workers compensation system is now privatized, such that private insurers are able to reach separate agreements on reimbursement rates with medical service providers, including air ambulance companies. For private insurers that have not reached separate agreements, however, the reimbursement rates developed by the OIC apply to air ambulance services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20R.%20%C2%A7%2085-20-9\">\n    W. Va. Code R. \u00a7 85-20-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). The second context is West Virginia's program for paying the medical expenses of its own government employees, administered by the Public Employees Insurance Agency (PEIA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-16-5\">\n    W. Va. Code \u00a7 5-16-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The measures used to lower costs are similar across the two programs. For both the OIC and the PEIA, the state has adopted a fee schedule covering reimbursement rates for air ambulance services that is pegged to the federal Medicare schedule. In 2011, the rate for the PEIA was set at the Medicare rate exactly, while the OIC rate was 35% higher.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-16\">\n    W. Va. Code \u00a7 5-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -8a(a) ; J.A. 203. The state has also provided that these reimbursement rates are the maximum allowable recovery for air ambulance services reimbursed under the two programs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-16\">\n    W. Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 5-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -8a(a) ; 23-4-3(a)(2). These provisions are then backed up by a ban on balance-billing, such that employees covered under the OIC or PEIA plans cannot be billed directly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    W. Va. Code \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -29D-4. Violations of these regulations subject an air ambulance company to criminal and civil enforcement actions by the state.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205-16-12\">\n    W. Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 5-16-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; 16-29D-8 ; 23-1-19(a). As a final cost containment measure, West Virginia also enacted a law stating that the PEIA will not reimburse any air ambulance costs for covered employees who entered into a separate subscription agreement with an air ambulance provider like Air Evac.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-16\">\n    W. Va. Code \u00a7 5-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -8a(b). For these patients, the law effectively caps the reimbursement at the subscription price agreed to by the individual patient and the air ambulance company, typically about $100 per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Through this combination of low reimbursement rates, refusals to pay for certain services, and prohibitions on directly billing patients, West Virginia avoids the problems faced by private insurers in the marketplace. Whereas an insurer might ordinarily have to agree to higher reimbursement rates to prevent an air ambulance company from billing its patient, West Virginia has simply dictated a relatively low reimbursement rate and prohibited any additional recovery. Under these regulations, the state faces no pressure to bargain up front, and no threat of patients being directly billed on the back end, thereby lowering total reimbursement costs. For its part, Air Evac contends that the state regulations are not only duplicative of and contrary to federal law, but also prevent air ambulance companies from recovering anything like a fair return for their services. Appellee Br. 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Air Evac, the appellee here, is a provider of air ambulance services in the state of\n   West Virginia. Air Evac has objected to the air ambulance reimbursement rates for years. See Appellee Br. at 7-8. When the company attempted to bill state employees directly, however, the matter was referred to the state Attorney General for possible enforcement. J.A. 550-52. In response, Air Evac stopped balance-billing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This litigation began in June 2016, when Air Evac sued state administrators to enjoin the West Virginia scheme. Air Evac argued that the state's regulations were both preempted by the Airline Deregulation Act and a violation of the U.S. Constitution's Contracts Clause. Air Evac's suit specifically challenged the fee schedules and other regulations used to cap reimbursement rates covered by the PEIA and the OIC. The separate prohibition on balance-billing was only challenged in the alternative if the PEIA and OIC regulations were upheld. In response, West Virginia first argued that Air Evac lacked standing to challenge the OIC fee schedule. The state also defended its scheme on the merits, arguing both that the challenged provisions were not preempted and that, if they were, the ADA would violate the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled in favor of Air Evac, finding that the state's air ambulance regulations were preempted by the ADA. Specifically, the district court enjoined the state from enforcing the maximum reimbursements caps and fee schedules for both the PEIA and the OIC, as applied to air ambulance companies.\n   <em>\n    Air Evac EMS, Inc. v.

The district court did not enjoin the balance-billing prohibition, which had only been challenged in the alternative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On appeal, the constitutional issues have fallen out of the case. The only questions left for us to resolve are whether Air Evac has constitutional standing to challenge the workers' compensation scheme and whether the state's regulations are preempted by the Airline Deregulation Act. We review both questions de novo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We begin with the question of standing. West Virginia argues that Air Evac lacks standing to challenge the OIC fee schedule, which sets default rates of reimbursement for the state workers' compensation system. According to West Virginia, the schedule has no effect on Air Evac since the state privatized the workers' compensation system and allowed private insurers to enter into their own agreements with medical providers. Under the privatized program, the OIC pays no claims directly to Air Evac and its fee schedule, which sets reimbursement at 135% of the Medicare rate, does not bind any private insurer. According to the state, this change prevents Air Evac from challenging the OIC regulations. We believe that West Virginia asserts an overly restrictive view of standing, one that is at odds with both the controlling law and the facts of this case, and accordingly hold that Air Evac has standing to pursue its claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To establish standing under Article III of the Constitution, a plaintiff must have \"(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial\n   decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

On the facts of this case, the question is whether Air Evac can demonstrate that its lower reimbursement rates are attributable to the state's role in administering the workers' compensation system. We conclude that it can.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The OIC regulations constrain Air Evac's ability to seek full reimbursement for its services, thereby causing Air Evac's alleged injury. While West Virginia is correct that the OIC does not directly reimburse Air Evac under the new system, that fact is not dispositive. Traceability does not require that the state cut a check directly to the plaintiff. Instead, the effect of the state's chosen course of action must be considered as an integrated whole. When viewed in the proper light, the causal connection between the OIC regulations and Air Evac's reimbursements is undeniable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, the OIC fee schedules set the default rate for air ambulance reimbursement. While private insurers can and do negotiate different rates, they are not required to do so. In fact, Air Evac has in the past been paid the 135% rate provided in the OIC schedule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 566-67. Even among those private insurers who do negotiate for a different payment, the OIC rate informs the negotiation by establishing a default. Second, the statute governing the OIC prevents air ambulance companies from recovering directly against patients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2023-4-3\">\n    W. Va. Code \u00a7 23-4-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Taken together, the challenged provisions set a default rate lower than what Air Evac would otherwise charge and prevent Air Evac from billing the patient for the difference. This scheme clearly inhibits Air Evac's ability to recover the full charges that it bills for services. Even without a single direct payment from the state to Air Evac, the alleged injury is therefore traceable to the OIC regulations. The injunctive relief sought here, moreover, would redress that injury by allowing Air Evac to collect more of the fees it has billed. As a result, we agree with the district court that Air Evac has demonstrated each of the requirements of constitutional standing with respect to the OIC provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Since this court has jurisdiction over all of Air Evac's claims, the only question left to resolve is whether the Airline Deregulation Act preempts West Virginia's regulation of air ambulance companies.

Patients need not be subscribers or have a preexisting contract to receive services. There is no individual bartering between the air ambulance company and the medical provider over whether to provide life-saving services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To argue otherwise, West Virginia makes much of the fact that Air Evac, like other air ambulance companies, relies on referrals from medical providers to dispatch its aircraft, rather than responding to calls directly from the public. The state, however, has offered no reason to think that the law turns on any such matter, especially when interpreting a general term like \"common carrier.\" A train does not cease to be a common carrier simply because its tickets are exclusively sold through a third-party vendor. Air Evac, just like its industry competitors, serves the public indiscriminately and on equal terms, and that is what counts here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Since air ambulance companies are air carriers within the meaning of the ADA, we must now ask whether they are the sort of air carriers the preemption clause was intended to reach. The text of the ADA preemption clause does not sweep in all forms of air transportation, only those air carriers \"who may provide air transportation under this subpart.\" The \"subpart\" at issue here is Subpart II of the amended Federal Aviation Act. Subpart II is entitled \"economic regulations\" and is administered by the Department of Transportation. If air ambulances companies \"provide air transportation under [subpart II],\" they are protected by the preemption clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On this question, the plain text of the law, the overall structure of the federal aviation laws, and the subsequent acts of Congress all point in the same direction: air ambulances are within the scope of the ADA.

The dispute here turns on the meaning of the phrase \"under this Subpart.\" The parties agree that air ambulance companies like Air Evac are subject to some regulation contained in Subpart II, such as those related to reporting and non-discrimination obligations.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2041705\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 41705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 41709; 42112. The parties similarly agree that these companies are not certified under Subpart II, like many other air carriers. Instead, air ambulances have been exempted from the requirement to obtain a \"certificate of public convenience and necessity,\" an exemption which has been granted by the Secretary of Transportation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20298.1\">\n    14 C.F.R. \u00a7 298.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Even with this exemption, air ambulance companies hold a registration issued by the Secretary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14 C.F.R. pt. 298.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This web of certificates, exemptions, registrations, and other regulations gives rise to the interpretive disagreement between the parties. Air Evac argues that an air carrier provides transportation \"under\" the subpart when they are subject to the subpart's regulations. Appellee Br. 28. On its view, air ambulance companies operate \"under\" subpart II because they hold a registration from the Secretary, granted pursuant to the Secretary's authority to administer subpart II, and must comply with some of the subpart's regulations. West Virginia, on the other hand, believes that certification under Subpart II is dispositive. Appellant Br. 16-18. If an air carrier is exempt from the certification requirement, the state contends, they do not \"provide air transportation under\" subpart II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We agree with Air Evac that the phrase \"under this subpart\" includes all air carriers regulated by the Secretary of Transportation under subpart II, rather than those specifically certified under the subpart. By its plain meaning, the word \"under\" does not suggest it is limited to certain regulations or certain certificates. If Congress wished the preemption clause to only apply to certain certificate-holders, it knew how to do so. For instance, a separate provision of the statute explicitly defines \"major air carrier[s]\" as those air carriers \"holding a Chapter 411 certificate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041720\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The preemption clause, however, does not borrow this language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The ADA's preemption provision further demonstrates that Congress was fully capable of tying preemption to certification if it so desired. Immediately following the preemption clause at issue here, the next sentence of the ADA reads, \"[the preemption clause] do[es] not apply to air transportation provided entirely in Alaska unless the transportation is air transportation ... provided under a certification issued under Section 41102 of this title.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041713\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Put simply, this language clarifies that, in Alaska only, preemption does not apply to air carriers that do not hold Chapter 411 certificates. Despite the fact that Congress chose to tether preemption to certification in this one discrete context, West Virginia asks us to adopt a certification-based reading of the preemption clause across the board. We see no need to adopt such a cumbersome interpretation of the statute's text when a more natural one is available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Apart from the plain text, the overall structure and operation of the federal aviation laws further support reading the preemption clause to reach air ambulances. The exemption for air ambulance companies from the certification requirements of Chapter 411 is granted by the Secretary of Transportation. The authority to grant this exception is discretionary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040109\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) (\"[T]he Secretary\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   exempt ...\"). As West Virginia sees it, an exemption from certification is also an exemption from preemption. If we were to adopt this\n   view, however, the Secretary would be empowered to unwind the preemptive effect of the ADA for air carriers as he sees fit. We do not see any basis for inferring such a vast authority, when that authority was never expressly provided and could be used to subvert one of the ADA's principal deregulatory goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   West Virginia's limited reading of the preemption clause, moreover, would reach well beyond the air ambulance sector. For instance, small commuter air carriers are eligible for the same exemption as air ambulance companies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20298.11\">\n    14 C.F.R. \u00a7 298.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, small Canadian air taxi operators that frequently travel to the United States are exempt from the permitting requirement for other foreign air carriers under subpart II.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20294.1\">\n    14 C.F.R. \u00a7 294.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If these exemptions from certification were also exemptions from preemption, states would be free to regulate these carriers. For the foreign carriers in particular, this second layer of regulation would undermine the State Department's prominent role in approving uniform national agreements for international air travel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041309\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (2012). Even if the text were not clear, these implications, which cut against the core aim of the ADA to place the aviation industry under a single regulator, counsel against adopting West Virginia's proposed reading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, we note that recent federal legislation related to air ambulances reinforces our view that the ADA preemption clause reaches this industry. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 took many steps to respond to steep air ambulance prices and valuable consumer complaints, but the Act kept regulatory authority firmly in the hands of the federal government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 115-254, \u00a7\u00a7 314, 418-20 (2018). For instance, the Secretary of Transportation was directed to \"issue a final rule ... to provide other consumer protections for customers of air ambulance operators.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041309\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 418(f). The statute, moreover, invited state governments to participate in the development of a single federal policy, which is consistent with the uniform system of regulation that the ADA set up in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041309\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 412(b). In all events, Congress's decision to leave the preemption clause intact in the FAA Reauthorization Act, notwithstanding other amendments to subpart II, stands as one more reason not to import a strained and unnatural reading into the words of the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Taking together the text and structure of the statute, we conclude that the preemption clause reaches air ambulance companies like Air Evac.

We think the best course is simply to follow as faithfully as we can the wording of the express preemption provision, without applying a presumption one way or the other. And in all events, we need not enter the great preemption presumption wars here because the text of the preemption provision, as discussed\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , governs the disposition of this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Because we find that the regulations here are squarely related to price, we need not consider whether they also relate to routes or services.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The district court enjoined the statutes and regulations related to both the PEIA and OIC fee schedules and reimbursement caps. J.A. 112-13. It dismissed Air Evac's alternative claim that the balance-billing provisions were preempted. J.A. 113. Neither party on appeal sought review of that dismissal.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    Reply Br. at 20 (noting only that the fee schedule should not be preempted\n    <em>\n     if\n    </em>\n    both the balance-billing provisions and reimbursement caps were enjoined). Thus, the question of whether the fee schedule could be maintained without either the reimbursement caps or balance-billing provisions is not before us now, and we need not consider here whether the fee schedule, standing alone, has the force and effect of law. Nothing in our analysis forecloses the possibility that West Virginia, acting as a market participant, could use a uniform fee schedule to structure its own payments for air ambulance services in the absence of both the caps and the balance-billing prohibitions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     EagleMed LLC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266345\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/893/#p903\">\n     868 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    906 n.3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
