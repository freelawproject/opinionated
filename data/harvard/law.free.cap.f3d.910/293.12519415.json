(\"Arrow\"). In this complaint, NewSpin brought several contract-and tort-based claims against Arrow relating to allegedly defective goods Arrow manufactured and shipped pursuant to a contract between the parties. The district court dismissed the original complaint in its entirety as untimely and entered judgment against NewSpin on the same day. The district court also denied NewSpin's motion for reconsideration and for leave to file an amended complaint. For the reasons below, we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court's dismissal of NewSpin's complaint. We also reverse the district court's denial of NewSpin's request to amend its complaint in its reconsideration motion, and we remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We take the following facts from NewSpin's complaint. Plaintiff-appellant NewSpin provides technology products to help athletes, like golfers and tennis players, analyze and improve their swings. In 2010, NewSpin began the process of producing and launching its flagship \"SwingSmart\" product. SwingSmart is a sensor module that attaches to sports equipment and analyzes the user's swing technique, speed, and angle. To initiate the production process, NewSpin searched for manufacturers and distributors that could provide the necessary electronic components to make SwingSmart work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant-appellee Arrow deals in the type of electronic components NewSpin sought to include in SwingSmart. Arrow sales representatives met with NewSpin representatives at least seven times in 2010 and 2011; the parties discussed NewSpin's requirements for the product and Arrow's ability to meet these requirements. Based on these discussions, NewSpin believed that Arrow knew how SwingSmart would function and understood NewSpin's specifications for SwingSmart. Arrow employees further represented to NewSpin that Arrow had \"successfully manufactured and provided substantially similar components for other customers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on these representations, NewSpin signed a contract with Arrow in August 2011 entitled \"Materials and Manufacturing Management Agreement Board Assembly\" (the \"Agreement\"). Arrow agreed to \"use reasonable commercial efforts\" to perform \"Work\" pursuant to\n   NewSpin purchase orders. Arrow's work as defined in the Agreement was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [T]o procure components and other supplies (Components) and to engage a sub-assembly house for the manufacture and assembly of Products (or Boards) through a subcontractor ... on [NewSpin's] behalf pursuant to detailed, written specifications ... which are provided by [NewSpin] and accepted by Arrow, and to deliver such products to a [NewSpin] designated location.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Agreement left many of the specifics of each product shipment for NewSpin's future purchase orders: \"As [NewSpin] requirements dictate, and on a case by case basis, [NewSpin] will issue a purchase order to Arrow setting forth the quantities, descriptions, prices, and requested delivery dates for the Products to be supplied and Work to be performed.... Each purchase order will reference the applicable Specifications.\" The price for Arrow's work was also left to be \"agreed upon by Arrow and [NewSpin] from time to time as set forth in purchase orders issued by [NewSpin] and accepted by Arrow.\" However, the Agreement did contain provisions that addressed, among other issues: Arrow's warranty for the products shipped to NewSpin; Arrow's inspection of products; sales tax and shipment terms; and NewSpin's ability to return shipped products. The Agreement further provided it would \"in all respects be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In late 2011, NewSpin sent its first purchase orders to Arrow for fulfillment, and Arrow shipped some components to NewSpin in mid-2012. NewSpin alleges, however, that the components Arrow sent were defective and did not conform to their specifications. A manufacturing expert later identified \"pad cratering\" as one reason for these defects. NewSpin alleges pad cratering is a common manufacturing issue that Arrow should have known about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Initially unaware of these defects, NewSpin used Arrow's defective components to build 7,500 SwingSmart units. Of those 7,500 units, only 3,219 could be shipped to customers and, of the 3,219 shipped units, 697 were wholly inoperable. In sum, of the 7,500 SwingSmart units NewSpin initially built, 4,281 units were inoperable or defective. NewSpin alleges it paid Arrow a total of $598,488 for these defective and nonconforming components, and it also incurred over $200,000 in other damages in the form of customer support efforts, module testing, and repair. Furthermore, its receipt of these defective components damaged its brand equity, reputation, and vendor relationships. Additionally, Arrow never delivered over $130,000 worth of components to NewSpin, despite billing NewSpin for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   NewSpin filed a complaint against Arrow on January 17, 2017, bringing claims for breach of contract (Count I); breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count II); breach of warranty (Count III); fraud (Count IV); fraudulent misrepresentation (Count V); unjust enrichment (Count VI); and negligent misrepresentation (Count VII).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Arrow moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing all of these claims were time-barred. The district court agreed and granted the motion to dismiss in its entirety on July 26, 2017. Specifically, the court determined the Agreement was predominantly a contract for the sale of goods subject to the four-year statute of limitations for such contracts set out in Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\"). It made this determination based on NewSpin's complaint; per the court,\n   \"NewSpin's breach of contract allegations make clear that the essence of the contract was for the components and the components' specific parts.\" The district court also noted the \"title\" of the Agreement found in the lower left-hand corner of each page, \"New Spin Golf LLC Turnkey Agreement 08-10-2011F (2),\" reflected that the contract fell within Article 2 of the UCC because it demonstrated Arrow's obligation to deliver \"turnkey\" goods.\n   <em>\n    See Turnkey,\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (term refers to a product \"provided in a state of readiness for immediate use\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because the court determined NewSpin filed its complaint more than four years after the alleged breach-the delivery of allegedly defective goods in mid-2012-it concluded the contract-based claims were untimely. And, since it determined the tort-based claims were predicated on the same allegations underlying the contract-based claims, the court also dismissed those claims as time-barred. The court entered judgment in Arrow's favor on the same day it issued its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   NewSpin timely moved for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e). It argued the district court erred in its decision in several ways, including by not granting leave to amend the original complaint before disposing of the case. NewSpin attached a proposed amended complaint to its reconsideration motion that, it contended, overcame the pleading defects the district court had identified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court denied NewSpin's reconsideration motion in a two-page order on January 29, 2018. The court rejected NewSpin's claims of error in its judgment; it did not address NewSpin's amended complaint except to state that NewSpin had improperly sought \"to amend the complaint after the dismissal of the instant action.\" NewSpin appeals the district court's orders granting the motion to dismiss and denying the motion for reconsideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Dismissal of Contract-Based Claims (Counts I-III)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The district court dismissed as time-barred NewSpin's claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of warranty. Specifically, the district court determined the Agreement is a contract for the sale of goods subject to the UCC's four-year statute of limitations, and NewSpin's claims based on a mid-2012 contractual breach were untimely by NewSpin's January 2017 filing. NewSpin argues this is error; it says the Agreement is a contract for services subject to a longer limitations period. We agree the Agreement is primarily a contract for the sale of goods, and therefore, because the contract-based claims in the complaint only allege a mid-2012 breach, the district court properly dismissed Counts I-III as time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    1. Choice of Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Before turning to the substantive issues, we must determine the correct state law to apply. Because we sit in diversity, we apply the choice-of-law rules used by the state in which the federal district court where the case was filed sits-here, Illinois.\n   <em>\n    Midwest Grain Prods. of Ill., Inc. v.

In this case, the Agreement states it will be governed by New York law. We accordingly apply New York law to the substance of NewSpin's contract-based claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   However, as to procedural matters, the law of the forum controls, and in Illinois, \"[s]tatutes of limitations are procedural, merely fixing the time in which the remedy for a wrong may be sought, and do not alter substantive rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Belleville Toyota, Inc. v.

To be sure, at the core of the parties' Agreement is the \"Work\" Arrow agreed to perform. This work involved certain services on Arrow's part. Arrow agreed to \"procure components\" and \"engage a sub-assembly house for the manufacture and assembly of Products (or Boards) through a subcontractor\" according to NewSpin's specifications. The provision of services as well as the sale of goods is to be expected in a mixed contract, though, and that does not answer the question of which purpose is the \"primary\" or \"predominant\" one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1565251\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/785/174/#p179\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1565251\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/785/174/#p179\">\n    at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We do not doubt that the design, engineering, and purchase-agency services rendered by [defendant] in furtherance of the Agreement were substantial. That alone, though, is not sufficient to determine the predominant character of a contract....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Looking further at the definition of Arrow's work, the end result expects that Arrow will \"deliver ... Products to a [NewSpin] designated location.\" In other words, NewSpin would provide specifications to Arrow, Arrow would engage a subcontractor to assemble a product based on these specifications, and Arrow would deliver the finished product to NewSpin. The Agreement sets out a purchase-order process by which NewSpin, as its requirements dictate, \"will issue a purchase order to Arrow setting forth the quantities, descriptions,\n   prices, and requested delivery dates for the Products to be supplied and Work to be performed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   According to NewSpin's reading of these provisions, Arrow would create a prototype of the component it needed using the provided specifications and, if satisfied with Arrow's work, NewSpin would issue purchase orders for the component Arrow created. The Agreement clarifies, though, that Arrow was not obligated to perform any work until NewSpin issued a purchase order for the components it sought. In other words, any \"procur[ing],\" \"engag[ing],\" or \"assembl[ing]\" services by Arrow would only be incidental to its provision and delivery of a finished good to NewSpin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Numerous other Agreement provisions confirm that the parties contracted primarily for a sale of goods. For instance, there is no separate payment from NewSpin to Arrow for its work: instead, the price would be \"as agreed upon by Arrow and [NewSpin] from time to time as set forth in purchase orders issued by [NewSpin] and accepted by Arrow.\" In other words, NewSpin would pay for the finished products requested in purchase orders and would not pay separately for Arrow's services; this lack of a price breakdown strongly indicates the predominant purpose of the Agreement is the sale of goods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bruel &amp; Kjaer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=360%20Ill.%20Dec.%20635\">\n    360 Ill.Dec. 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20N.E.2d%20445\">\n    969 N.E.2d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (payment of one price after delivery and installation of equipment, rather than multiple payments based on services, indicated contract's predominant purpose was for the sale of goods).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Arrow also provided a warranty in the Agreement that the products it would deliver \"are manufactured or assembled pursuant to [NewSpin's] Specifications\" and they \"shall be free from defects in workmanship.\" There is no warranty running to the services Arrow would provide, further indicating the Agreement primarily concerns goods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tivoli Enters., Inc. v.

Additionally, the Agreement makes NewSpin responsible for payment of sales tax, which \"is found in the sale of goods, but not services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Next, Arrow would ship products to NewSpin \"F.O.B.,\" which means \" 'free on board,' a term used in transactions in tangible goods.\"\n   <em>\n    Bruel &amp; Kjaer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=360%20Ill.%20Dec.%20635\">\n    360 Ill.Dec. 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20N.E.2d%20445\">\n    969 N.E.2d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, title of delivered goods passes to NewSpin upon shipment, and \"the passing of title\" is another hallmark of sales contracts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20N.E.2d%20445\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   810 Ill.

Instead, NewSpin alleges \"the components sent by Arrow were defective and not in conformance with the specifications [NewSpin] had\n   provided to Arrow, the representations Arrow had made, or the Agreement,\" and Arrow breached the Agreement \"by providing [NewSpin] with defective components which failed to perform.\" NewSpin sought damages for the amount it paid to Arrow for defective components, the amount it was billed for components it did not receive, and the amount it incurred in shipping and replacing defective units. In other words, NewSpin only claims it suffered damages relating to faulty goods, not to any faulty services. This further confirms the predominant purpose of the Agreement is to provide NewSpin with physical goods rather than with assembly services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Republic Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1565251\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/785/174/#p179\">\n    785 F.2d at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plaintiff's argument that contract was not for a sale of goods \"ignores the language of ... its complaint\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   NewSpin nevertheless points to three characteristics of the Agreement it contends demonstrate the parties bargained for services only: (1) the Agreement states no quantity, price, or delivery date of goods to be produced, ordered, or sold; (2) the Agreement's title demonstrates the parties contracted for management services; and (3) there were no \"goods\" in existence when the parties signed the Agreement as required for the UCC to apply. However, none of NewSpin's arguments can overcome the plain language of the Agreement itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   First, although the Agreement does not set out exact quantities, prices, or delivery dates for the goods at issue, the Agreement does address these terms. Per the Agreement, NewSpin's purchase orders must \"set[ ] forth the quantities, descriptions, prices, and requested delivery dates for the Products to be supplied and Work to be performed.\" There is no need to include this provision in a pure services contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   NewSpin emphasizes the Agreement contains an integration clause providing that \"[t]his Agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified except in a writing signed by both parties.\" Therefore, according to NewSpin, any terms in later purchase orders (that both parties did not sign) are separate contracts. However, a closer reading of the integration clause demonstrates the purchase orders are part of the Agreement. This provision goes on to state: \"When interpreting this Agreement precedence will be given to the respective parts in the following order: (i) this Agreement; (ii) any exhibits to this Agreement; and (iii) if purchase orders are used to release Products,\n   <em>\n    those portions of the purchase order that are not pre-printed\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added). Thus, the integration clause does not preclude introduction of evidence in the purchase orders themselves to supplement the Agreement's interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dujardin v. Liberty Media Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9178198\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/359/337/#p356\">\n    359 F.Supp.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (\"It is generally understood that the purpose of an integration clause 'is to require full application of the parol evidence rule in order to bar the introduction of extrinsic evidence to vary or contradict the terms of the writing.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Primex Int'l Corp. v. Wal-Mart Stores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"320231\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/89/594/\">\n    89 N.Y.2d 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"320231\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/89/594/\">\n    657 N.Y.S.2d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"320231\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/89/594/\">\n    679 N.E.2d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 627 (1997) ) ). The Agreement therefore does include specific price, quantity, and delivery terms through the explicitly-integrated purchase orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Second, NewSpin points out the Agreement's title (\"Materials and Manufacturing Management Agreement Board Assembly\") refers to manufacturing \"management\" but does not reference any \"sale\" of products. True, courts look to the labels parties use in order to determine contracts' predominant purposes.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bruel &amp; Kjaer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=360%20Ill.%20Dec.%20635\">\n    360 Ill.Dec. 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20N.E.2d%20445\">\n    969 N.E.2d at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (contract was for sale of goods where it referred to parties as \"buyer\" and \"seller\"). However, the Agreement's title is only one aspect of its terms; this is not enough to overcome the overwhelming focus of the rest of the contract on the completed products Arrow was to deliver to NewSpin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, NewSpin's argument that no \"goods\" existed at the time of the Agreement is also of little consequence. The term \"goods\" in the UCC refers to \"all things, including specially manufactured goods, which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale.\" 810 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-105(1). \"Goods must be both existing and identified before any interest in them can pass. Goods which are not both existing and identified are 'future' goods. A purported present sale of future goods or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20N.E.2d%20445\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   5/2-105(2). In the absence of agreement otherwise, identification of goods occurs, in the context of a contract for the sale of future goods, \"when goods are shipped, marked or otherwise designated by the seller as goods to which the contract refers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20N.E.2d%20445\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   5/2-501(1)(b);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Servbest Foods, Inc. v.

Although no products existed at the time the parties signed the Agreement, the components did exist when Arrow shipped them to NewSpin. The Agreement contains no provision for identification, so the electronic components became \"identified\" when shipped. At that time, the products subject to the Agreement were \"movable\" goods subject to the UCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In sum, the contractual provisions the parties agreed to, along with the allegations in NewSpin's complaint, demonstrate the Agreement's predominant purpose is the sale of goods to NewSpin. Any breach-of-contract claims relating to the Agreement are accordingly subject to the UCC's four-year statute of limitations. We now assess the timeliness of NewSpin's contract-based claims using this limitations period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Thus, NewSpin only alleges Arrow breached the Agreement, if at all, in mid-2012. However, NewSpin did not file the complaint until January 17, 2017. No matter what month is considered \"mid\" 2012, NewSpin did not file its claims until after the four-year window provided for in the statute of limitations. NewSpin makes no argument that this alleged mid-2012 breach would be timely using a four-year limitations period.

We affirm the district court's dismissal of NewSpin's unjust enrichment and negligent misrepresentation claims in Counts VI and VII.

The exact date on which NewSpin could have discovered Arrow's alleged fraud is unclear from the face of the complaint, but it could not have happened before the first shipment in mid-2012.

NewSpin's original complaint states valid fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation claims against Arrow based on Arrow's alleged precontractual misrepresentations, and the proposed amended complaint realleges these claims. Moreover, while NewSpin's new allegations cannot change the Agreement's primary purpose and the resultant four-year limitations period for contract-based claims, the amended complaint alleges further defective deliveries in 2013 that could be timely if they relate back to the original 2017 complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.
