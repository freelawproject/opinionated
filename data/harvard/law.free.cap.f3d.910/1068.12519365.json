The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   imposed concurrent sentences of 151 months' imprisonment on the controlled substance offense and 120 months' imprisonment on each of the weapons charges. Lomax argues that the court erroneously applied a four-level enhancement for trafficking in firearms under United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G. or Guidelines) \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A confidential source alerted law enforcement in Texarkana, Arkansas, that Lomax was attempting to sell an automatic weapon, ammunition, and a live hand grenade. The source provided investigators with a photograph sent by Lomax depicting the items in a blue tool case, whereupon law enforcement officers initiated a controlled purchase. The source contacted Lomax and agreed to meet him in a field near a chemical plant in Texarkana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lomax arrived at the plant at approximately 3:30 p.m. The source, a felon, retrieved a box from the back of Lomax's truck and signaled to law enforcement that the transaction had taken place. Agents confirmed that the source had received a blue tool case containing a hand grenade and an automatic weapon with four magazines and two boxes of ammunition. A waiting arrest team was able to take Lomax into custody after a two-mile, crash-ending pursuit. Neither the firearm nor the grenade was registered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205861\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At sentencing the district court overruled Lomax's objection to the application of Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), which applies if a defendant\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (i) transported, transferred, or otherwise disposed of two or more firearms to another individual ... ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (ii) knew or had reason to believe that such conduct would result in the transport, transfer, or disposal of a firearm to an individual-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (I) whose possession or receipt of the firearm would be unlawful; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (II) who intended to use or dispose of the firearm unlawfully.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n.13(A). The district court determined that Lomax had transferred two weapons to someone he knew or had reason to believe was a felon and who he had reason to believe intended to use the weapons unlawfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lomax argues on appeal that the facts set forth in the presentence report (PSR) show neither his knowledge that the source was a felon, nor any reason for him to suspect that the source intended to use the weapons unlawfully. We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the district court's application of the Guidelines, and we review its factual findings\n   for clear error.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Birdine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644080\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/842/#p845\">\n    515 F.3d 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 845 (8th Cir. 2008). Because we conclude that the facts presented here satisfy the unlawful use prong, we need not decide whether Lomax knew that the source was a felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on the circumstances known to Lomax at the time of the sale, he had reason to believe that the source intended to use the weapons unlawfully.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Asante\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054420\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/639/#p644\">\n    782 F.3d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 644 (11th Cir. 2015) (holding that knowledge of intent was not required if the circumstances gave the defendant reason to believe that the weapons would be used unlawfully). Neither the automatic firearm nor the hand grenade was registered with the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, as required by law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205861\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). This fact alone rendered possession of the weapon by both Lomax and the confidential source \"necessarily unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pepper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180722\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/520/#p525\">\n    747 F.3d 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525 (8th Cir. 2014). Moreover, the nature of the sale was clandestine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Juarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053077\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/246/#p252\">\n    626 F.3d 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 252 (5th Cir. 2010) (concluding that the clandestine nature of a transaction involving military-style assault weapons supported an inference of unlawful intent);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203720\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/180/#p189\">\n    640 F.3d 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 189 (6th Cir. 2011) (deciding that there was evidence of unlawful intent when the defendant exchanged guns for drugs in the wee hours of the morning). Lomax and the source met in their vehicles in the middle of an open field near a chemical plant. They exchanged $1,000 in cash for unregistered, highly dangerous, military-style weapons that were concealed in a tool case. Based on the nature of the weapons and the circumstances under which they were exchanged, Lomax had reason to believe that the confidential source, whose mere possession of the weapons was unlawful, also intended to use the weapons unlawfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The sentence is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The firearms trafficking enhancement, USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), applies only under specific circumstances. It is applicable if the defendant \"knew or had reason to believe that [his] conduct would result in the transport, transfer, or disposal of a firearm to\" one of two types of individuals: \"(I) [an individual] whose possession or receipt of the firearm would be unlawful; or (II) [an individual] who intended to use or dispose of the firearm unlawfully.\" USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n.13(A)(ii). Each of these two subparts has its own narrow set of requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court concluded that Lomax's conduct satisfied subpart (I), the \"possession\" prong. In order for the possession prong to apply, the type of \"individual\" whose possession or receipt of the firearm would be unlawful is limited: The defendant must know or have reason to believe the individual is one \"who (i) has a prior conviction for a crime of violence, a controlled substance offense, or a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence; or (ii) at the time of the offense was under a criminal justice sentence, including probation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203720\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/180/#p189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   cmt. n.13(B). The district court reasoned that this prong applied because Lomax sold the firearms to a \"known felon.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court does not rely on this rationale to affirm application of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement, and neither would I. There is no evidence that Lomax knew or had reason to believe he was selling firearms to a \"known felon,\" much less someone with one of the specific predicate felony convictions required to trigger application of the possession prong. The district court apparently\n   relied on testimony from an FBI agent that the buyer had \"been a convicted felon for quite a while,\" but there was no evidence that Lomax knew, or should have known, this fact. There is also nothing in the record about the nature of the purchaser's prior conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Francis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517155,12517156\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/888/\">\n    891 F.3d 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 898 (10th Cir. 2018) (vacating sentence where there was no evidence defendant \"had reason to believe that the [purchaser] had a conviction in one of the listed categories of offenses\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Instead, the court concludes that Lomax satisfied subpart (II)-the \"use\" prong of the enhancement-in part because two of the firearms in question were unregistered. But a purchaser's desire to\n   <em>\n    possess\n   </em>\n   an unregistered firearm is not sufficient to infer that the purchaser \"intend[s] to\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   ... the firearm unlawfully.\" USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n.13(A)(ii)(II) (emphasis added). \"Use\" and \"possess\" have different meanings. \"Use\" means \"to put into action or service\" or to \"employ\" the object in question,\n   <em>\n    Use\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2012), which is distinct from mere possession. \"Use\" and \"possess\" appear in \u00a7 2K2.1 multiple times; inclusion of both terms would be unnecessary if they were interchangeable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) (\"If the defendant ... used or possessed ....\"); USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1) (\"If the defendant used or possessed ....\"). Otherwise subpart (I) of the enhancement is rendered superfluous. The possession of a firearm by a person with almost any felony conviction-not just one of the listed types that trigger application of subpart (I)-is unlawful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). If any unlawful possession can trigger the \"use\" prong, then any activity that would satisfy subpart (I) would also constitute unlawful \"use\" under subpart (II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bailey v.
