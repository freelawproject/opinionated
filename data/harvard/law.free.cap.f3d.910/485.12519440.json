ASARCO asserts that the award is invalid because the arbitrator reformed the Basic Labor Agreement (\"BLA\") between the Union and ASARCO in contravention of a no-add provision in that agreement. The Union argues that the arbitrator did not contravene the no-add provision because he was required to reform the BLA upon finding that the parties were mutually mistaken as to its terms when they agreed to it. The district court affirmed the award, holding that ASARCO properly preserved its objection to the arbitrator's jurisdiction, but the arbitrator was authorized to reform the BLA, despite the no-add provision, based on a finding of mutual mistake. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ASARCO is a miner, smelter, and refiner of copper and other precious metals with facilities in Arizona and Texas. ASARCO's employees are represented by the Union. ASARCO and the Union are parties to the BLA, which was originally effective January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2010. The BLA was modified and extended through two Memoranda of Agreement (\"MOA\") negotiated in 2010 and 2011. Article 9, Section B of the BLA provides that a Copper Price Bonus (\"Bonus\") will be paid quarterly to employees who participate in ASARCO's pension plan. The Bonus is calculated based on the price of copper and is significant, at times as much as $8,000\n   annually per employee. The 2011 MOA modified Article 12, Section Q of the BLA to make employees hired on or after July 1, 2011 ineligible for ASARCO's pension plan, and thus ineligible for the Bonus. The Union, unaware of the link between the pension plan and the Bonus,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a grievance disputing ASARCO's refusal to pay the Bonus to employees hired after July 1, 2011. The case proceeded to arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the beginning of the arbitration hearing the parties stipulated that the matter was properly before the arbitrator and that the arbitrator had jurisdiction to decide the grievance. The Union claimed there was a mutual mistake in the 2011 MOA: the parties failed to recognize that Article 9, Section C of the BLA tied eligibility for the Bonus to participation in the pension plan, and both parties intended for all employees to remain eligible for the Bonus when they negotiated the 2011 MOA. Accordingly, the Union argued that reformation of the BLA was the appropriate remedy. ASARCO offered no evidence to the contrary, but argued that the arbitrator lacked authority to reform the BLA because Article 5, Section I(6)(c) contained the following no-add provision: \"The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from or alter in any way the provisions of this Agreement.\" After hearing six days of evidence the arbitrator concluded that neither party anticipated that the 2011 MOA modification would impact new hires' eligibility for the Bonus. Because he found that the parties were mutually mistaken as to the terms of the 2011 MOA, the arbitrator ordered that the BLA be reformed to provide that new hires, though ineligible for ASARCO's pension plan, remain eligible for the Bonus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ASARCO filed a Petition to Vacate Arbitration Award in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. ASARCO did not challenge the arbitrator's findings of fact or conclusions of law, but argued that the no-add provision deprived the arbitrator of authority to reform the BLA. The district court confirmed the arbitration award, but rejected the Union's argument that ASARCO had waived any argument regarding the limits of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. In confirming the award, the district court noted the degree of deference due to the arbitrator's decision and concluded that the arbitrator did not violate the no-add provision because the reformation corrected a defect in the BLA, which was the product of mutual mistake, to reflect the terms the parties had agreed upon. ASARCO timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely limited, the Supreme Court and this Circuit have articulated three exceptions to the general rule of deference to an arbitrator's decision: \"(1) when the arbitrator's award does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement and the arbitrator is dispensing his own brand of industrial justice; (2) when the arbitrator exceeds the boundaries of the issues submitted to him; and (3) when the award is contrary to public policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538015\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/886/1200/#p1205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Given the great deference due to arbitrator's decisions, ASARCO wisely does not challenge the arbitrator's findings of fact or conclusions of law, but instead argues that the arbitrator's award does not warrant deference based on all three exceptions. The first two exceptions are interrelated, and we will address them simultaneously before turning to the third exception. ASARCO argues that the no-add provision in the BLA deprived the arbitrator of authority to reform the BLA,\n   and the arbitrator's award does not draw its essence from the BLA because it ignores this provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In deciding whether the arbitrator's award draws its essence from the BLA, \"the quality - that is the degree of substantive validity - of [his] interpretation is, and always has been, beside the point.\"\n   <em>\n    Sw.

He also recognized that arbitrators do not generally have the authority to rewrite CBAs or ignore their provisions. He noted, however, that arbitrators can reform a contract to correct an obvious mutual mistake. Citing a substantial amount of evidence that he heard over six days, the arbitrator concluded that the parties presented precisely this scenario: in negotiating the 2011 MOA, they never discussed or even acknowledged that if the BLA were amended to make new hires ineligible for the pension plan, they would also be ineligible for the Bonus.

Assuming ASARCO has stated an \"explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy,\" its argument still fails for a very simple reason. The arbitrator did not distort the BLA; he reformed it so that it no longer distorted the agreement that the parties made during collective bargaining. For the reasons discussed above, the arbitrator was authorized to do so upon finding the parties were mutually mistaken about the terms they agreed to. The award does not violate public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We conclude that the arbitrator was acting within his authority when he crafted a remedy to cure the parties' mutual mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The \"no-add\" language in the collective bargaining agreement (the Basic Labor Agreement, or BLA) signed by ASARCO and United Steel (the Union) is unmistakably clear:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from or\n   alter in any way the provisions of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   And yet, in defiance of this plain language, the majority holds today that the arbitrator\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   have the authority to rewrite the terms of the agreement under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The majority's conclusion is flat wrong. First, ASARCO did not clearly and unmistakably agree to let the arbitrator decide the scope of his own authority, and so the arbitrator lacked the power to decide whether the BLA authorized him to rewrite the BLA. Second, when mistakenly exercising authority he did not have, the arbitrator reached the wrong answer: the no-add provision makes clear that the arbitrator does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have the power to rewrite the BLA. Because the arbitrator ignored the no-add provision, his award fails to draw its essence from the BLA and is invalid. I dissent from the majority's contrary conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   ASARCO and the Union are parties to a collective bargaining agreement, the BLA, which provides for the arbitration of grievances. The BLA explains the scope of the arbitrator's authority as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The member of the Board [of Arbitration] chosen in accordance with Paragraph 7(a) below [providing for selection on a case-by-case basis] shall have the authority to hear and decide any grievance appealed in accordance with the provisions of the grievance procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The BLA includes a \"no add\" provision that limits the arbitrator's authority: \"The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from or alter in any way the provisions of this Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   A different section of the BLA provides that certain employees are entitled to a Copper Price Bonus, a quarterly bonus based on the price of copper. Only those employees covered by the pension plan are eligible for the Copper Price Bonus. When the BLA was updated in 2011, the Union and ASARCO added the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Employees hired on and after the Effective Date [July 1, 2011] are not eligible to participate in the pension plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A dispute between ASARCO and the Union arose after the 2011 BLA was signed. Because the new employees were not covered by the pension plan, ASARCO took the position they were not eligible for the Copper Price Bonus. The Union disagreed and filed a grievance, which the parties submitted to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The subsequent arbitration decision set forth a statement of the issue and summarized the positions of each party. According to the arbitration decision, the parties were unable to agree upon a statement of the issue before the arbitrator, and instead agreed to allow the arbitrator to frame the issue. The arbitrator determined that the proper statement of the issue was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Are employees hired on and after July 1, 2011 entitled to receive the Copper Price Bonus?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Union's position in arbitration was that there was a mutual mistake which required a reformation of the BLA. Both parties had failed to recognize that eliminating the pension plan for new employees would make them ineligible for the Copper Price Bonus, the Union claimed, and neither party intended this result. Therefore, according to the Union, the BLA must be reformed to make such new employees eligible, and the no-add provision did not prevent this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   ASARCO's position in arbitration was that the BLA clearly states that new employees are not eligible for the Copper\n   Price Bonus, and the arbitrator must give effect to the BLA as written. With respect to the Union's preferred remedy of reformation, ASARCO asserted that the arbitrator does not have the authority under the clear language of the BLA to order that new employees be made eligible for the Copper Price Bonus or to rewrite the BLA to make them eligible for the bonus. According to ASARCO, \"a mistake does not authorize an arbitrator to exceed the authority granted to the arbitrator and limited by the parties themselves.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Without addressing ASARCO's position that the arbitrator lacked authority to rewrite the BLA, and without any discussion of the no-add provision or the limits of his jurisdiction, the arbitrator amended the pension provision to include five additional lines of text:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Employees hired on and after the Effective Date are not eligible to participate in the pension plan.\n   <em>\n    However, the Company shall treat such Employees as if they were accruing Continuous Service under the Retirement Income Plan for Hourly Rated Employees of ASARCO Inc. on the same terms as other Employees, only for purposes of determining eligibility for the Copper Price Bonus pursuant to Article 9, Section C.5 of the BLA.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, the arbitrator doubly erred. First, whether the arbitrator had the authority to resolve the parties' dispute over the no-add provision is an issue for judicial determination unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise. The arbitrator erred in implicitly concluding he had such authority. Second, the arbitrator's decision to rewrite the BLA does not \"draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement,\"\n   <em>\n    Federated Emp'rs of Nev., Inc. v.

Applying\n   <em>\n    First Options\n   </em>\n   's framework, there were two disputes regarding the merits. ASARCO and the Union disputed both whether new employees were entitled to the Copper Price\n   Bonus and whether the arbitrator had the authority to revise the BLA. Both of these issues are Merits Questions. While ASARCO agreed that it would arbitrate the dispute over the Copper Price Bonus, it did not agree to arbitrate its dispute about whether the arbitrator had the authority to revise the BLA (the Arbitrability Question). Rather, ASARCO repeated its position that the arbitrator had no such authority. Nor did ASARCO agree that the BLA gave the arbitrator the power to decide the scope of its authority to revise the BLA (the Delegation Question).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As explained in\n   <em>\n    First Options\n   </em>\n   , we must presume that the parties did not agree that the arbitrator should decide this Delegation Question, unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary. There is no such evidence here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Because arbitration is a matter of consent, we must first look to \"the language of the contract\" to \"define[ ] the scope of disputes subject to arbitration,\"\n   <em>\n    EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108200\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/279/#p289\">\n    534 U.S. 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 289,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108200\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/279/#p289\">\n    122 S.Ct. 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108200\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/279/#p289\">\n    151 L.Ed.2d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). While the BLA states that the arbitrator has the authority \"to hear and decide any grievance appealed\" by the parties, the BLA provides that the arbitrator lacks the authority to \"add to, detract from or alter in any way the provisions of\" the BLA. It is silent on the Arbitrability Question (whether ASARCO and the Union have agreed to arbitrate the question whether the arbitrator may \"add to, detract from or alter in any way the provisions of\" the BLA). It is equally silent on the Delegation Question (whether the parties have agreed that the arbitrator can determine the Arbitrability Question). Because the parties did not clearly and unmistakably agree to arbitrate the question whether the arbitrator has the authority to revise the BLA, that question \"is to be decided by the court, not the arbitrator.\"\n   <em>\n    AT&amp;T\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206747\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/643/#p648\">\n    475 U.S. at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206747\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/643/#p648\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In implicitly reaching a contrary conclusion, the majority asserts that \"the parties stipulated that the matter was properly before the arbitrator and that the arbitrator had jurisdiction to decide the grievance.\" Maj. Op. at 489. This characterization is wholly unsupported by the record. ASARCO did not stipulate that the arbitrator had the authority to decide whether it could reform the BLA. Rather, from the beginning ASARCO vociferously and repeatedly pointed out that the BLA precluded the arbitrator from reforming the contract. While the parties agreed to submit their grievance regarding whether new employees were eligible for the Copper Bonus to the arbitrator, and allowed the arbitrator to frame the Copper Bonus issue, the issue submitted to arbitration did not include the scope of the arbitrator's authority to revise the contract. Rather, as the arbitrator himself explained, \"the proper statement of the issue is as follows: Are employees hired on and after July 1, 2011 entitled to receive the Copper Price Bonus?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Further, because ASARCO did not clearly agree to submit the question of the arbitrator's authority to rewrite the BLA to arbitration, the court must decide the Delegation Question. I would reach this issue, and hold that the arbitrator had no authority to decide that ASARCO and the Union agreed to arbitrate the question whether the BLA could be revised. The parties' contract clearly establishes that the arbitrator lacks the authority to modify the agreement even when there is a mutual mistake,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W. Coast Tel.

There is no \"clear and unmistakable\" evidence that the parties contemplated that an arbitrator could reconsider\n   the BLA's prohibition of any arbitral revisions of the BLA and reach a different conclusion. I therefore would reverse the district court's conclusion to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Even if the majority were right in assuming that ASARCO had agreed to delegate to the arbitrator the question whether the arbitrator had the authority to rewrite the BLA, the majority errs in upholding the arbitration award here because the arbitrator plainly exceeded the authority granted to him by the BLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The BLA's no-add provision says: \"The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from or alter in any way the provisions of this Agreement.\" But the arbitrator amended the pension provision to include five additional lines of text:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Employees hired on and after the Effective Date are not eligible to participate in the pension plan.

The majority does not really dispute this point: it concedes that the arbitrator \"did not specifically cite the no-add provision when explaining the basis of his award,\" but concludes it was sufficient for the arbitrator to \"quote it directly\" in the section of the arbitration decision entitled \"Relevant Language of the BLA,\" which it deems to be an \"acknowledgment of the no-add provision.\" Maj.

While arbitrators may have power to reform an agreement where permitted to do so by the collective bargaining agreement, the arbitrator\n   <em>\n    in this case\n   </em>\n   clearly lacked that power. Rather, \"the terms the parties actually agreed upon\" in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   collective bargaining agreement expressly state that the arbitrator may not add provisions to the agreement. Because \"an arbitrator's authority derives solely from the contract,\"\n   <em>\n    McDonald v. City of W.

The majority fails to explain why the arbitrator here could exercise a power directly contrary to the express restrictions on the arbitrator's authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Indeed, the majority cites no case supporting its proposition that an arbitrator can reform a contract based on mutual mistake when the parties expressly prohibit the arbitrator from adding to or modifying the agreement. To the contrary, we have held that a no-add provision prohibits an arbitrator from modifying an agreement even when there is a mutual mistake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W. Coast Tel.

In\n   <em>\n    West Coast Telephone\n   </em>\n   , we considered a union's demand to compel arbitration of the question whether its collective bargaining agreement should be reformed to reflect the parties' intent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2228223\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/431/1219/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2228223\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/431/1219/\">\n    at 1220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded \"with positive assurance\" that the issue of reformation due to mutual mistake was not arbitrable because \"[t]he arbitration clause of the contract expressly provides that the arbitrator 'shall have no\n   power to destroy, change, add to or delete from its terms.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2228223\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/431/1219/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2228223\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/431/1219/\">\n    at 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, a no-add provision in a collective bargaining agreement precludes the arbitrator from rewriting the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The majority attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    West Coast Telephone\n   </em>\n   because it addressed whether a dispute over reformation was arbitrable, rather than whether the arbitrator lacked authority to reform the contract, and therefore does not definitively resolve the issue whether the arbitrator's award here drew its essence from the agreement. Maj. Op. at 493. But\n   <em>\n    West Coast Telephone\n   </em>\n   's holding was based on its conclusion that a no-add provision deprives the arbitrator of the authority to modify the agreement, and this ruling is binding on us.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2228223\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/431/1219/\">\n    431 F.2d at 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We need not consider whether we would defer to an arbitrator who erroneously construed a no-add provision as allowing reformation of a contract in a particular case. That issue is not before us because-as mentioned above-the arbitrator here did not construe the no-add provision. Because under our precedent the arbitrator's modification was contrary to the no-add provision and is therefore not a \"plausible interpretation\" of the contract, and because there is no basis for deferring to the arbitrator's construction of the no-add provision in this case, his award must be vacated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Federated Empr's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1453306\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/600/1263/#p1264\">\n    600 F.2d at 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The arbitrator here dispensed his own brand of industrial justice by exceeding the scope of his delegated powers and modifying the agreement \"in the interest of justice and fairness.\" Because \"an arbitrator has no authority to ignore the plain language of a collective bargaining agreement that limits the scope of his authority,\" the award fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.\n   <em>\n    Haw.
