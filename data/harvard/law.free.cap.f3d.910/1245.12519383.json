It singles out for especially heavy penalties those defendants who not only induce a minor to engage in \"sexually explicit conduct,\" but who do so \"\n   <em>\n    for the purpose of\n   </em>\n   \" producing pornography.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Related provisions target possession of child pornography and sex with a minor-see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2252;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-3009.01\">\n    D.C.

The first concerns the requirement that pornographic intent must have been \"\n   <em>\n    the dominant motive\n   </em>\n   \" of the\n   defendant's sexual conduct.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517483\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/305/#p319\">\n    894 F.3d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 319-20 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Williams, J., dissenting) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mortensen v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6143408\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/369/#p374\">\n    322 U.S. 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 374,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6143408\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/369/#p374\">\n    64 S.Ct. 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6143408\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/369/#p374\">\n    88 L.Ed. 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1944) ). As my dissent explains (at 320), the panel wrongly diluted this requirement by adopting the oxymoronic notion of \"a\" dominant motive, see\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 315 (majority opinion). Other circuits, however, had already taken this path, see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lebowitz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755748\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/1000/#p1014\">\n    676 F.3d 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1014 (11th Cir. 2012), so the panel's decision-wrong as it is-cannot be said to have created a circuit split.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   But on the second issue, the panel broke new ground. Until now, the courts of appeals have insisted (rightly, in my view) that the government link the defendant's \"purpose\" to his \"sexually explicit conduct,\" taken as a coherent whole. Our sister circuits have thus resisted any analysis under which an encounter's photographic purpose is proven simply by the picture-taking itself. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Palomino-Coronado,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356587\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/805/127/#p132\">\n    805 F.3d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 132 (4th Cir. 2015). Instead they have rested on evidence connecting the defendant's photographic purpose to a more broadly conceived encounter-evidence that he sent the victim money for a webcam,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For good reason. Apart from running (as my dissent explains at 322) headlong into\n   <em>\n    Mortensen\n   </em>\n   , this \"artificial and unrealistic view of the nature and purpose,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6143408\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/369/#p374\">\n    322 U.S. at 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6143408\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/369/#p374\">\n    64 S.Ct. 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , of sexual intercourse all but reads the \"purpose\" element out of the statute-for lovers and predators alike. As the panel sees it, any picture-snapping during an assembly of two or more people (including at least one minor) that displays \"any person['s]\" pubic region will be virtually certain to support the inference that\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   instance of \"sexually explicit conduct\"-a so-called \"lascivious exhibition\"-was \"for the purpose of\" producing pornography. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 2256(2)(A)(v). That is so even when the \"lascivious exhibition\" was but one part of a continuous sexual encounter whose overall purpose-pleasure, perhaps-was plainly not photography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To downplay the novelty of its decision, the panel plucks a few words from\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But\n   <em>\n    Ortiz-Graulau\n   </em>\n   (it seems to me) concerned not \"some of\" the disaggregated steps of a single sexual encounter-as the majority would have it-but \"some of\" the sexual encounters themselves, viewed as a coherent whole.

But the need for a mens rea requirement hardly depends on that problem alone. There is no principled difference between the injustice of \"(1) punishing a person who, but for the [court's downplay of the mens rea element] would have received zero punishment ... and (2) punishing with\n   <em>\n    more years of imprisonment\n   </em>\n   a person who, but for the [court's downplay of the mens rea element] would still have received substantial punishment.\" See\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The contrast is hardly apt. Both statutes deal with a serious social problem, on which Congress can take action because of the problem's links to a federal interest-interstate commerce or travel. But the Court has seen Congress as \"traditionally [ ] reluctant to define as a federal crime conduct readily denounced as criminal by the States.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

I therefore respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
