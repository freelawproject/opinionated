To answer this question, we must decide what \"encourages or induces\" means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties have widely divergent views about how to interpret the statute. Sineneng-Smith and several\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   contend that encourage and induce carry their plain meaning and, therefore, restrict vast swaths of protected expression in violation of the First Amendment. The government counters that the statute, in context, only prohibits conduct and a narrow band of unprotected speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We do not think that any reasonable reading of the statute can exclude speech. To conclude otherwise, we would have to say that \"encourage\" does not mean encourage, and that a person cannot \"induce\" another with words. At the very least, it is clear that the statute potentially criminalizes the simple words - spoken to a son, a wife, a parent, a friend, a neighbor, a coworker, a student, a client - \"I encourage you to stay here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The statute thus criminalizes a substantial amount of constitutionally-protected expression. The burden on First Amendment rights is intolerable when compared to the statute's legitimate sweep. Therefore, we hold that Subsection (iv) is unconstitutionally\n   overbroad in violation of the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Underlying Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sineneng-Smith operated an immigration consulting firm in San Jose, California. Her clients were mostly natives of the Philippines, unlawfully employed in the home health care industry in the United States, who sought authorization to work and adjustment of status to obtain legal permanent residence (green cards). Sineneng-Smith assisted clients with applying for a \"Labor Certification,\" and then for a green card. She signed retainer agreements with her clients that specified the purpose of the retention as \"assisting [the client] to obtain permanent residence through Labor Certification.\" The problem was that the Labor Certification process expired on April 30, 2001; aliens who arrived in the United States after December 21, 2000, were not eligible to receive permanent residence through the program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Esquivel-Garcia v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3518637\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/593/1025/\">\n    593 F.3d 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1029 n.1 (9th Cir.2010). Sineneng-Smith knew that the program had expired. She nonetheless continued to sign retainer agreements with her clients and tell them that they could obtain green cards via Labor Certifications. And she also continued to sign new retainer agreements purportedly to assist additional clients in obtaining Labor Certification. At least two of Sineneng-Smith's clients testified that they would have left the country if Sineneng-Smith had told them that they were not eligible for permanent residence. Sineneng-Smith's words and acts which allegedly violated the statute were alleged to have occurred from 2001 to 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On July 14, 2010, a grand jury returned a ten-count superseding indictment charging Sineneng-Smith with, as relevant to this appeal, three counts of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201324\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A)(iv) &amp; \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(B)(i) - encouraging or inducing an alien to reside in the country, knowing and in reckless disregard of the fact that such residence is in violation of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Before trial, Sineneng-Smith moved to dismiss the immigration counts of the superseding indictment. Sineneng-Smith argued that: (1) her conduct was not within the scope of Subsection (iv); (2) Subsection (iv) is impermissibly vague under the Fifth Amendment; and (3) Subsection (iv) violates the First Amendment because it is a content-based restriction on her speech. The district court denied the motion to dismiss, but did not explicitly address the First Amendment argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After a twelve-day trial, the jury found Sineneng-Smith guilty on all three counts of violating Subsection (iv) and \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(B)(i), and all three counts of mail fraud. Sineneng-Smith then moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c), renewing the arguments from her motion to dismiss and contending that the evidence elicited at trial did not support the verdicts. The district court concluded that sufficient evidence supported the convictions for two of the three \u00a7 1324 counts and two of the three mail fraud counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Sineneng-Smith timely appealed, again arguing that the charges against her should have been dismissed for the reasons asserted in her motion to dismiss, and that the evidence did not support the convictions. We first held oral argument on April 18, 2017, and submitted the case for decision. Subsequent to submission, however, we determined that our decision would be significantly aided by further briefing. On September 18, 2017, we filed an order inviting interested\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   to file briefs on the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1. Whether the statute of conviction is overbroad or likely overbroad under the First Amendment, and if so, whether any permissible limiting construction would cure the First Amendment problem?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   2. Whether the statute of conviction is void for vagueness or likely void for vagueness, either under the First Amendment or the Fifth Amendment, and if so, whether any permissible limiting construction would cure the constitutional vagueness problem?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   3. Whether the statute of conviction contains an implicit mens rea element which the Court should enunciate. If so: (a) what should that mens rea element be; and (b) would such a mens rea element cure any serious constitutional problems the Court might determine existed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We received nine\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   briefs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as supplemental briefs from both Sineneng-Smith and the government. On February 15, 2018, we again held oral argument and resubmitted the case for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The government urges us to review Sineneng-Smith's First Amendment overbreadth claim for plain error, arguing that she waived the issue by not raising it until we requested supplemental briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although Sineneng-Smith never specifically argued overbreadth before our request for supplemental briefing, she has consistently maintained that a conviction under the statute would violate the First Amendment. Sineneng-Smith's motion to dismiss argued that \"[t]he crime alleged here is rooted in speech\n   <em>\n    content\n   </em>\n   - performing immigration consultancy work on behalf of aliens and their employers by petitioning the government on their behalf - not in conduct lacking any First Amendment protection.\" Likewise, her opening brief on appeal reasserted a First Amendment challenge: \"Such communication is 'pure' speech entitled to the highest level of protection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Once a federal claim is properly presented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below.\"\n   <em>\n    Yee v. City of Escondido\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6234399\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/519/#p534\">\n    503 U.S. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6234399\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/519/#p534\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6234399\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/519/#p534\">\n    118 L.Ed.2d 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). Because Sineneng-Smith has asserted a First Amendment claim throughout the litigation, her overbreadth challenge \"is - at most - a new argument to support what has been a consistent claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Citizens United v. FEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p331\">\n    558 U.S. 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 331,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p331\">\n    130 S.Ct. 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p331\">\n    175 L.Ed.2d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Alternatively, Sineneng-Smith asserts that even if the statute targets some conduct, it sweeps in too much protected speech and is therefore unconstitutionally overbroad.

As discussed above, both encourage and induce can be applied to speech, conduct, or both. Therefore, unlike the string of verbs in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , neither of these verbs has clear non-speech meanings that would inform and limit the other's meaning. In other words, when read together, they do not provide a more precise definition or one that excludes speech. Nor are the words necessarily transactional like those in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   . Thus, the application of\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   to the two operative verbs here, does not narrow our search; our conclusion that Subsection (iv) could cover speech, as well as conduct, remains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Beyond their immediate neighbors in Subsection (iv), encourage and induce also \"keep company\" with the verbs in the other subsections of \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A). The neighboring subsections prohibit: (i) \"bring[ing]\" an alien to the United States \"at a place other than a designated port of entry;\" (ii) \"transport[ing] or mov[ing]\" an alien in furtherance of a violation of the immigration laws; and (iii) \"conceal[ing], harbor[ing], or shield[ing] from detection\" an alien in the country in violation of the immigration laws.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201324\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A)(i), (ii), &amp; (iii).

So understood, \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A) [ (iv) ] serves as a 'catch-all' provision that covers actions other than 'bringing,' 'transporting,' etc., that might facilitate illegal immigration.\" (Citation omitted.)

While we agree that the statute is intended to restrict the facilitation of illegal immigration and that subsections (i)-(iii) prohibit specific actions, it does not follow that Subsection (iv) covers only actions. Instead, the structure of the section lends itself to the more obvious conclusion that the verbs in the subsections must mean different things because they form the basis of separate charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064462\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/1143/#p1147\">\n    749 F.3d at 1146-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In \u00a7 1324, \"Congress created several discrete immigration offenses including,\" among others, the crimes outlined in subsections (a)(1)(A)(i)-(iv).\n   <em>\n    United States v.

If encouraging or inducing cannot mean bringing, transporting, moving, concealing, harboring, or shielding, what is left?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The government offers a few limited examples of other actions that could potentially be covered under Subsection (iv), but not reached by subsections (i)-(iii). These examples include: (1) providing aliens with false documents; (2) selling a border-crossing kit to aliens, including a map of \"safe crossing\" points and backpacks filled with equipment designed to evade border patrol; (3) duping foreign tourists into purchasing a fake \"visa extension;\" or (4) providing a \"package deal\" to foreign pregnant women who wish to give birth in the United States that includes a year of room and board, a six-month tourist visa, and instructions on how to overstay the visa without detection. But we doubt Congress intended to limit Subsection (iv) to actions such as these, as the provision does not appear necessary to prosecute any of these actions. Subsection (i), (iii), and (v)(II), which, respectively, restrict bringing, shielding from detection, and aiding and abetting the commission of any of these acts, cover the examples raised by the government. Additionally, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324c and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201546\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   provide broad criminal prohibitions against document fraud in violation of the immigration laws. These few, unpersuasive examples therefore do not convince us that \"encourage\" and \"induce\" can be read so as not to encompass speech, even though their plain meaning dictates otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In sum, the structure of the statute, and the other verbs in the separate subsections, do not convince us to stray from the plain meaning of encourage and induce - that they can mean speech, or conduct, or both. Although the \"encourage or induce\" prong in Subsection (iv) may capture some conduct, there is no way to get around the fact that the terms also plainly refer to First Amendment-protected expression. In fact, in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , one of the seminal overbreadth cases, Justice Scalia used the statement, \"I encourage you to obtain child pornography\" as an example of protected speech.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/#p293\">\n    553 U.S. at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/#p293\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We see no reason why \"I encourage you to overstay your visa\" would be any different. And interpreting \"encourage or induce\" to exclude such a statement would require us to conclude that \"encourage\" does not mean encourage. The subsection is not susceptible to that construction. Subsection (iv), therefore, criminalizes encouraging statements like Justice Scalia's example and other similar expression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    b.

We would not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the Government promised to use it responsibly.\"\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582194,12448252\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/460/\">\n    559 U.S. at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582194,12448252\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/460/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the absence of convictions based purely on protectable expression is not evidence that the statute does not criminalize speech. Just because the government has not (yet) sought many prosecutions based on speech, it does not follow that the government cannot or will not use an overbroad law to obtain such convictions. Further, the lack of convictions says nothing about whether Subsection (iv) chills speech. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   exemplifies why we cannot take the government's word for how it will enforce a broadly written statute, and suggests that any would-be speaker who has thought twice about expressing her views on immigration was not being paranoid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. \"An alien\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The government contends that Subsection (iv) is limited to encouraging \"a particular alien or aliens,\" rather than \"the\n   general public.\" For the purposes of this appeal, and to avoid serious constitutional concerns, we think the government's proposed interpretation is reasonable, but not ultimately dispositive to our overbreadth analysis. And while it is easy to foresee arguments about what constitutes a group of particular aliens versus the \"general public,\" we accept that Subsection (iv) requires a defendant to direct his or her encouragement or inducement toward some known audience of undocumented individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4. \"In Violation of Law\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Recognizing the breadth of the statute, the government admits that \"in violation of law\" refers not only to criminal law, but also to civil violations of the immigration laws. We agree.\n   <em>\n    Amicus\n   </em>\n   Professor Eugene Volokh argues that we could narrow the scope of the statute by reading \"violation of law\" to mean only violations of the criminal law. But, because simple residence in the United States without legal status is not a crime, and the statute reaches inducing or encouraging an alien to \"reside\" in the United States, the subsection is not susceptible to this limiting construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p407\">\n    567 U.S. 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 407,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p407\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p407\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (\"As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States.\"). The proposed limiting construction would render \"reside\" superfluous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5. Construction of the Statute\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   To recap, we interpret Subsection (iv) as follows: to violate the subsection, a defendant must knowingly encourage or induce a particular alien - or group of aliens - to come to, enter, or reside in the country, knowing or in reckless disregard of whether doing so would constitute a violation of the criminal or civil immigration laws. As construed, \"encourage or induce\" can mean speech, or conduct, or both, and there is no substantiality or causation requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Ultimately, the government asks us to rewrite the statute. Under no reasonable reading are the words \"encourage\" and \"induce\" limited to conduct. We think the statute is only susceptible to a construction that affects speech. As an illustration - under the government's reading of the statute, it would argue that a mother telling an undocumented adult child \"If you leave the United States, I will be very lonely. I encourage you to stay and reside in the country\" would not subject the mother to prosecution. But, in this example, the mother is merely repeating the words of the statute in an attempt to get her child to stay. We think any reasonable person reading the subsection would assume that the mother's statement makes her vulnerable to prosecution, that the words of the statute have their plain meaning, and that a person can encourage or induce another by verbally, explicitly encouraging or inducing her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Subsection (iv) Restricts Protected Speech\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The conclusion that Subsection (iv) reaches speech does not end our inquiry. We must now examine: (1) whether the statute reaches protected speech and, if so, (2) whether the statute restricts a substantial amount of such speech in relation to the statute's legitimate sweep.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897431\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/113/#p122\">\n    539 U.S. at 118-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897431\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/113/#p122\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Not all speech is protected under the First Amendment.

In the government's reading, Subsection (iv) is analogous to an aiding and abetting statute. But, to repeat, continuing to reside in the U.S. is not a criminal offense; therefore, assisting one to continue to reside here cannot be aiding and abetting a crime.

For one, as explained above, the statute is not limited only to speech that substantially assists an alien in violating the immigration laws.\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   exposes the relevant distinction. The statute in\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   prohibited \"[w]illfully aid[ing] or assist[ing] in, or procur[ing], counsel[ing], or advis[ing] the preparation or presentation\" of false tax returns.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207206\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). On the twelve counts for which the court reversed Freeman's convictions, the court focused on the fact that Freeman may have generally advocated the filing of false returns.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207206\">\n    at 551-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, for the two convictions that the court affirmed, it emphasized that Freeman \"not only counseled but also\n   <em>\n    assisted\n   </em>\n   in the filing of false returns.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207206\">\n    at 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The assistance on the two affirmed counts, even if only words, was more directly related to the completed crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus,\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   's conclusion is that only some speech that the statute restricted was so related to the predicate crime that it was considered \"integral.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, here, the statute criminalizes speech beyond that which is integral to violations of the immigration laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Second, as the government recognizes, aiding and abetting convictions require the government to prove certain elements\n   that are not present in Subsection (iv):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   In this circuit, the elements necessary for an aiding and abetting conviction are: (1) that the accused had the specific intent to facilitate the commission of a crime by another, (2) that the accused had the requisite intent of the underlying substantive offense, (3) that the accused assisted or participated in the commission of the underlying substantive offense, and (4) that someone committed the underlying substantive offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    Thum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064462\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/1143/#p1147\">\n    749 F.3d at 1148-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Shorty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3898765\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/961/#p969\">\n    741 F.3d 961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 969-70 (9th Cir.2013) ). The first obvious difference is that aiding and abetting requires the commission of a crime by another, but Subsection (iv) applies to both criminal and civil violations of the immigration laws. The government asserts that the civil/criminal distinction should not matter in the First Amendment context, but points to no case where a defendant was convicted for aiding and abetting a civil offense. We are not aware of any case that upholds a statute restricting such speech. Therefore, even if certain speech would constitute aiding and abetting when directed toward the commission of a crime, it would be constitutionally protected when aimed at inducing a civil violation of law. And because unauthorized presence in the country is a civil violation rather than a crime, Subsection (iv) reaches beyond speech integral to a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Next, aiding and abetting requires that the accused \"assisted or participated\" in the commission of the offense. For the reasons described above, we cannot construe Subsection (iv) as applying only to assistance for or participation in a violation of the immigration law; it is enough to encourage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Further, aiding and abetting requires that a principal actually commit the underlying offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1149. There is no such requirement in Subsection (iv). The government argues that this should not matter for the First Amendment analysis because, citing the Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.06(3)(a)(ii), Subsection (iv) resembles an attempted aiding and abetting statute. The government's argument fails, however, because \"[t]here is no general federal 'attempt' statute. [A] defendant ... can only be found guilty of an attempt to commit a federal offense if the statute defining the offense also expressly proscribes an attempt.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hopkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1851535\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/703/1102/#p1104\">\n    703 F.2d 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1104 (9th Cir.1983). Subsection (iv) does not restrict attempt, unlike the other subsections of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Most fundamentally, Subsection (iv) looks nothing like an aiding and abetting statute. Just two lines below Subsection (iv)'s text, Congress required that anyone who \"aids or abets the commission of any of the preceding acts\" shall be punished as a principal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201324\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A)(v)(II). Further, Congress authored a general aiding and abetting statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which states that \"[w]hoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\" Clearly, if Congress wanted Subsection (iv) to be an aiding and abetting statute, it would have included the words aiding and abetting. The statute instead manifests Congress' intent to restrict a broader range of activity, and that activity stretches beyond unprotected speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Subsection (iv) Restricts A Substantial Amount of Protected Speech in Relation to its Legitimate Sweep\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Because we conclude that Subsection (iv) reaches protected speech, we\n   must now analyze whether the amount of protected speech the statute restricts is substantial in relation to its legitimate sweep. In plain terms, are the statute's improper applications too numerous to allow the statute to stand? \"The concept of 'substantial overbreadth' is not readily reduced to an exact definition.\"\n   <em>\n    Members of City Council of L.A. v.

While we are aware that the Supreme Court is skeptical of \"fanciful hypotheticals\" in overbreadth cases, we do not think that the scenarios raised here are fanciful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/#p293\">\n    553 U.S. at 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/#p293\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We think that they are part of every-day discussions in this country where citizens live side-by-side with non-citizens. Buttressing our assessment that the following hypotheticals are not overly speculative, the government has already shown a willingness to apply Subsection (iv) to potentially protected speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3574281\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/857/191/#p204\">\n    857 F.Supp.2d at 193-94, 203-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   We begin with an obvious example from one of the\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   briefs: \"a loving grandmother who urges her grandson to overstay his visa,\" by telling him \"I encourage you to stay.\" Nothing in Subsection (iv) would prevent the grandmother from facing felony charges for her statement. Again, in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court used almost identical language - \"I encourage you to obtain child pornography\" - to describe abstract advocacy immune from government prohibition.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/#p293\">\n    553 U.S. at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674164\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/285/#p293\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government has not responded persuasively to this point; it simply argues that the grandmother would not be subject to criminal charges because\n   her statement was \"not accompanied by assistance or other inducements.\" However, as we have detailed above, Subsection (iv) does not contain an act or assistance requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Further, implying a\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement into the statute, and applying it only to speech to a particular person does not cure the statute's impermissible scope. Just because the grandmother wanted her words to encourage her grandson and said them directly to him does not render those words less protected under the First Amendment. We think that situations like this one, where a family member encourages another to stay in the country, or come to the country, are surely the most common form of encouragement or inducement within Subsection (iv)'s ambit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The government similarly dismisses \"marches, speeches, publications, and public debate expressing support for immigrants,\" as being subject to Subsection (iv)'s restrictions. Again, however, the government relies on its faulty construction of the statute to argue that such speech does not \"assist\" or \"incentivize\" an immigrant to come to, enter, or reside in the United States in violation of law. The statute, however, does not criminalize assistance or incentivizing; it makes it a felony to \"encourage\" or \"induce.\" A speech addressed to a gathered crowd,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   or directed at undocumented individuals on social media,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which the speaker said something along the lines of \"I encourage all you folks out there without legal status to stay in the U.S.! We are in the process of trying to change the immigration laws, and the more we can show the potential hardship on people who have been in the country a long time, the better we can convince American citizens to fight for us and grant us a path to legalization,\" could constitute inducement or encouragement under the statute. But, this general advocacy could not be considered incitement because there is no imminent breach of the peace. It would not be aiding and abetting or solicitation because it is general and is not advocating a crime. Instead, it is pure advocacy on a hotly-debated issue in our society. Such \"speech on public issues occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values, and is entitled to special protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Snyder v.

The most common example cited is an attorney who tells her client that she should remain in the country while contesting removal - because, for example, non-citizens within the United States have greater due process rights than non-citizens outside the United States, or because, as a practical matter, the government may not physically\n   remove her until removal proceedings are completed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas v.

Under the statute's clear scope, the attorney's accurate advice could subject her to a felony charge. The government's arguments to the contrary are unavailing. First, undoubtedly, the attorney would\n   <em>\n    know\n   </em>\n   that telling an immigrant she would have greater rights if she remained here or that she may not be removed while in removal proceedings would encourage the immigrant to stay.

An attorney can knowingly encourage a course of action without aiding or abetting it. Moreover, as we have explained, remaining in the country while undocumented, without more, is not a crime. More fundamentally, though, the government has already shown its intent to prosecute those citizens (attorneys or sympathetic lay persons) who give even general immigration advice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3574281\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/857/191/#p204\">\n    857 F.Supp.2d at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The foregoing examples are not some parade of fanciful horribles.

And, as the meaning of \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv) does not vary depending upon whether the financial gain enhancement also applies, the chilling effect of the \"encourage or induce\" statute extends to anyone who engages in behavior covered by it, whether for financial gain or not.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    \"Criminal intent\" is an amorphous term that can signify different levels of culpability.

First, we decline to read a specificity or directness requirement into the statute because the plain meanings of encourage and induce do not include such principles.
