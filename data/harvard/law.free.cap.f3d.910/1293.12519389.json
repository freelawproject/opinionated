Lane was accused by the Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") of sending threatening letters from prison and was disciplined under BOP Prohibited Acts Code 203. Code 203 prohibits \"[t]hreatening another with bodily harm or any other offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.3\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Table 1. On appeal, Lane contends that the term \"another\" and the phrase \"any other offense\" are so broad and vague as to violate his rights under the First Amendment. We hold that when read reasonably in the context of the prison setting, and limiting the phrase \"any other offense\" to criminal offenses or violations of BOP rules, Code 203 is sufficiently narrow and clear to protect inmates' First Amendment rights. We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 27, 2002, Lane was sentenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana to 360 months in prison for drug and money-laundering offenses. The BOP lists his release date as January 23, 2028. This Opinion addresses three \u00a7 2241 petitions filed by Lane in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Although the cases have different underlying facts, the appeals raise the same legal issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Lane v.

The letter stated, \"I want to make sure you, and the proper authorit[ies] have what they need, in the event, I'm forced to kill a prison guard.\" A BOP Discipline Hearing Officer (\"DHO\") subsequently conducted a hearing and concluded that Lane had violated Code 203. Based on that finding, the DHO sanctioned Lane with lost good time credits, disciplinary segregation, and the loss of telephone, commissary, email, and visiting privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Lane v.

Based on that finding, the DHO sanctioned Lane with the loss of good conduct time credits and disciplinary segregation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Lane v. Swain\n    </em>\n    , Case No. 17-55582\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In July 2013, Lane mailed a second letter to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Portland, Oregon, in which he wrote: \"The letter that I sent June 25, 2013, did you forward to local law enforcement? No matter what, my family has your name, address, and phone number.\" The U.S. Attorney's office read the letter as posing a threat, and sent it to Lane's prison for administrative action. A DHO conducted a hearing, concluded that Lane had violated Code 203, and sanctioned him with lost good conduct time credits and a $50 monetary fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

In the instant cases, the Magistrate Judge concluded on remand that Code 203 satisfies\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   , and therefore recommended that Lane's petitions be dismissed.

In\n   <em>\n    Abbott\n   </em>\n   , however, the Supreme Court specifically preserved the holding in\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   as it applies to outgoing prisoner mail.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605806\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/401/\">\n    490 U.S. at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605806\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/401/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (limiting\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   \"to regulations concerning outgoing correspondence\"). Here, the district court concluded that Code 203 addresses both prison security and prisoner rehabilitation, and Lane does not contest those specific findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Lane instead focuses his attack on the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   test: that the regulation be no greater than necessary to protect those legitimate governmental interests. Lane questions the broad scope of the regulation, arguing first that it prohibits all threatening statements regardless of their context. This argument ignores the setting in which Code 203 is applied: a federal prison. Seen in that light, the regulation prohibits communications in a context where threats by inmates may give rise to reasonable concerns about institutional security and individual rehabilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   More specifically, Lane submits that Code 203 is overly broad because it does not narrowly define the prohibited targets of threats beyond the term \"another.\" He suggests that an inmate could therefore be disciplined under Code 203 for threatening, for example, fictional or historical characters such as Superman or Joseph Stalin. To discipline an inmate for threatening those types of characters would defy common sense. There is no indication in the record that the BOP has ever taken such a broad view of Code 203, and we are reluctant to invalidate a rule based upon such hypotheticals. The term \"another\" as set forth in Code 203 is commonly understood to be another living person, and is not impermissibly broad.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Lane's next attack on Code 203 submits that the phrase \"any other offense\" is without limitation. His examples of potentially punishable offenses include threats of frivolous lawsuits, copyright infringement, or defamatory language. Again applying common sense, threatening an \"offense\" cannot mean posing a threat of civil suit. Rather, the regulation is reasonably construed as threatening either a criminal violation or an offense punishable under BOP regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   supports that construction. Footnote 15 of the Supreme Court's decision commented on a set of revised regulations, drafted while that case was on appeal, that \"are indicative of one solution to the [First Amendment] problem\" posed in that case.\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/\">\n    416 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   416 n.15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The revised regulations included a provision allowing disapproval of outgoing inmate mail containing \"threats of physical harm against any person or threats of criminal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The cited provision nearly mirrors the language in Code 203, with \"criminal activity\" being the parallel to \"any other offense.\" Although the legitimacy of that specific provision was not before the Supreme Court, its commentary provides useful guidance for this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court acknowledged that \"[t]raditionally, federal courts have adopted a broad hands-off attitude toward problems of prison administration\" because \"courts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/\">\n    416 U.S. at 404-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, courts afford \"deference to the appropriate prison authorities,\" but will nonetheless \"discharge their duty to protect constitutional rights\" when a prison regulation \"offends a fundamental constitutional guarantee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 405-06,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84368\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/396/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The regulation in\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   was impermissible because it infringed on inmates' First Amendment rights to air complaints and grievances. The language of Code 203 is clearly distinguishable, curbing threats of harm and other offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As Lane's own cases illustrate, legitimate governmental interests are at stake, since allowing inmates to threaten a warden, prison guard, or any other person with bodily harm or other criminal conduct is clearly unacceptable. In light of the regulation's limited language, read reasonably in the context of federal prisons, we find that Code 203 is a sufficiently \"close fit\" with those legitimate interests to pass the\n   <em>\n    Procunier\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    We note that the term \"another\" is widely used in statutes that prohibit threatening conduct.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%203701\">\n     18 Pa.
