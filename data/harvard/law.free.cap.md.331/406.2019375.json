It is the issue that we did not reach in <em>St. Paul </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number><em>Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. House, </em>315 Md. 328, 554 A.2d 404 (1989), but which the dissenting judges in <em>House </em>would have reached. In deciding the issue in this case we apply, in substance, the analysis presented in Chief Judge Murphy\u2019s diss\u00e9nt in <em>House. </em>Under that analysis \u00a7 482 does not produce coverage in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">One of the three appellees, P.T.P. Incorporated (P.T.P.), operated a go-kart track near Ocean City, Maryland. On August 27, 1987, nine year old Lisa Buckley (Buckley) was injured at P.T.P.\u2019s track when the go-kart in which she was riding with her uncle struck a barrier. Buckley was ministered to by her mother at the scene and left the premises with her, without receiving any other medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">At that time P.T.P. was insured under a comprehensive general liability policy issued in April 1987 by the appellant, T.H.E. Insurance Company (T.H.E.). The policy was the first one issued to P.T.P. by T.H.E. P.T.P. purchased the policy through Atlantic Insurance Associates (Atlantic), whose president is Alfred Melson (Melson). Both are appellees. At the time of Buckley\u2019s accident, P.T.P. did not report the 'occurrence to T.H.E., Atlantic, or Melson.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The policy acquired by P.T.P. from T.H.E. was written on a claims made basis. The policy period was from April 2, 1987, to April 2, 1988, with a retroactive date of April 2, 1987.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the following year T.H.E. issued to P.T.P. a comprehensive general liability \u201crenewal\u201d policy for the period May 27, 1988, to May 27, 1989, with a retroactive date of May 27, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">On June 6, 1988, counsel for Buckley, by letter, made a claim for damages against P.T.P. based on the accident of August 27,1987. This claim letter was sent some nine months after the accident and more than sixty days after the policy period that ended April 2, 1988. P.T.P. informed Atlantic of the claim, and Atlantic mailed notice of the claim to T.H.E. The insurer\u2019s response of June 23, 1988, stated that the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>was received on June 20, 1988. In that response T.H.E. denied coverage for the Buckley claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Thereafter, Buckley sued P.T.P. and others in an action that ultimately was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. T.H.E. did not defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">On April 18, 1990, P.T.P. filed in the Circuit Court for Worcester County a complaint for declaratory judgment and damages against T.H.E., Atlantic, and Melson. P.T.P. sought a judgment declaring that under either the initial or renewal policy T.H.E. provided indemnity for, and had a duty to defend, the Buckley claim. P.T.P. also claimed damages for breaches of the insurance contract. The complaint further alleged that Atlantic and Melson were negligent in failing to place proper insurance coverage. Atlantic and Melson cross-claimed against T.H.E.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">All parties to the state court action moved for summary judgment, raising a multitude of issues. The circuit court decided only one issue, and that by reliance on only one legal ground. The circuit court entered a judgment declaring that the original T.H.E. policy, <em>ie., </em>the policy for the period April 2, 1987, to April 2, 1988, obliged T.H.E. to defend the Buckley claim. The trial judge reasoned that under Art. 48A, \u00a7 482, the burden was on T.H.E. to show that it had been prejudiced by the fact that the Buckley claim was reported to it sometime after June 1, 1988, but that there was no evidence that T.H.E. had been prejudiced by late reporting of the claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Art. 48A, \u00a7 482 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">\u201cWhere any insurer seeks to disclaim coverage on any policy of liability insurance issued by it, on the ground that the insured or anyone claiming the benefits of the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>through the insured has breached the policy by failing to cooperate with the insurer or by not giving requisite notice to the insurer, such disclaimer shall be effective only if the insurer establishes, by a preponderance of affirmative evidence that such lack of cooperation or notice has resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In concluding that \u00a7 482 applied in that fashion to claims made policies, the circuit court relied entirely upon the opinion by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. House, </em>73 Md.App. 118, 533 A.2d 301 (1987). Although it recognized that decisions in other states supported <em>St. Paul\u2019s </em>contention, the intermediate appellate court read \u201cany insurer\u201d in \u00a7 482 to mean every insurer, including those writing claims made policies. 73 Md.App. at 135, 533 A.2d at 309. The decision by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>House </em>was affirmed, in a 4-3 decision by this Court, on policy construction grounds and not by applying \u00a7 482 in the fashion approved by the Court of Special Appeals. 315 Md. 328, 554 A.2d 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">While the Buckley action was pending in the federal court, the parties to the action before us stipulated to P.T.P.\u2019s cost of defense of the Buckley action. Based on that stipulation and on its prior grant of partial summary judgment, the circuit court entered judgment in favor of P.T.P. against T.H.E. in the stipulated amount for breach of the duty to defend. At the request of all parties to this action, the circuit court certified as a final judgment its declaration that T.H.E. was obliged under the original policy to defend P.T.P. against the Buckley claim, and the court certified as a final judgment its award of damages for that breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">T.H.E. appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We granted certiorari on our own motion prior to consideration of the matter by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">T.H.E.\u2019s argument rests on the original policy provisions, and P.T.P.\u2019s argument in support of the circuit court\u2019s ruling necessarily rests on \u00a7 482. Relevant to these arguments are the following policy provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">\u201cSECTION I\u2014COVERAGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">\u201cCOVERAGE A. BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">\u201c1. Insuring Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">a.

A Basic Extended Reporting Period is automatically provided -without additional charge. This period starts with the end of the policy period and lasts for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-16\">a. Five years for claims arising out of an \u2018occurrence\u2019 reported to us, not later than 60 days after the end of the policy period, in accordance with paragraph 2.a. of SECTION IV ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-17\">b. Sixty days for all other claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-18\">\u201c4. Extended Reporting Periods do not extend the policy period or change the scope of coverage provided. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>apply only to claims for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 that occurs before the end of the policy period (but not before the Retroactive Date ...).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">Claims for such injury or damage which are first received and recorded during the Basic Extended Reporting Period ... will be deemed to have been made on the last day of the policy period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">T.H.E.\u2019s argument is basic. Although the accident occurred (8/27/87) after the retroactive date (4/2/87), and before the end of the policy period (4/2/88), the claim was not first made until more than sixty days after the end of the policy period. Under the policy involved here, for a claim to be first made, it must be received by the insurer. Policy, \u00a7 I.A.l.b(l). The outside time limit within which either the occurrence of Buckley\u2019s accident or a claim asserted by Buckley was to be reported to the insurer was not later than sixty days after the end of the policy period, <em>i.e., </em>on or before June 1, 1988. The occurrence, as an occurrence, was not reported and, under the evidence, the claim made could not have been reported prior to June 6, 1988. Thus, submits T.H.E., there is no coverage because the insuring agreement applies only to claims for damages \u201cfirst made against any insured during the policy period,\u201d or during its sixty day extension.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">P.T.P. relies on \u00a7 482, quoted above. P.T.P.\u2019s argument, in the posture in which this case comes to us, is that T.H.E.\u2019s disclaimer of coverage rests on P.T.P.\u2019s failure to give the requisite notice, in that notice should have been given by June 1, 1988, but was not given until later.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 482, P.T.P. submits, T.H.E. must show actual prejudice resulting from the delay measured from June 1,1988, to the date T.H.E. received the report. Because the circuit court held, correctly in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>P.T.P.\u2019s view, that T.H.E. has not shown prejudice, T.H.E. may not disclaim coverage based on P.T.P.\u2019s failure to give the requisite notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In rebuttal T.H.E. argues that \u00a7 482 does not enlarge the policy period, or the extended reporting period, of a claims made policy to create coverage for a claim that was first made after the policy had expired by its terms. Rather, the purpose of \u00a7 482 is to prevent forfeitures of coverage that had attached and not to create coverage that never attached.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Section 482 was enacted by Chapter 185 of the Acts of 1964, in apparent response to <em>Watson v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>231 Md. 266, 189 A.2d 625 (1963). <em>House, </em>315 Md. at 332, 554 A.2d at 406. <em>Watson </em>applied a strict condition precedent analysis to the insured\u2019s obligation to give notice of an accident under an occurrence coverage, automobile liability policy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">\u201cThe response of \u00a7 482 [to <em>Watson </em>], in substance, makes policy provisions requiring notice to, and cooperation with, the insurer covenants and not conditions. The statute measures by the standard of actual prejudice the materiality of any breach of those covenants by the insured for the purpose of determining if the breach excuses performance by the insurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>Id. </em>Section 482 accomplishes its objective by requiring two elements: First, there must be a specified type of breach by the insured; and second, the insurer must show the materiality of the breach by demonstrating that the lack of notice or cooperation has resulted in actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Here, T.H.E. does not deny coverage because of an alleged material failure by P.T.P. to perform a covenant to give notice, or to satisfy a policy provision that might be phrased as a condition that must be satisfied to prevent the loss of coverage that otherwise would apply. In this case the extended reporting period under the original policy had expired before P.T.P. reported the Buckley claim to T.H.E. The original policy had come to an end with respect to newly reported claims. Section 482 could no more revive the original policy to cover the Buckley claim than \u00a7 482 could reopen an occurrence policy to embrace a claim based on an accident that happened after the end of the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">This analysis was well developed by Chief Judge Murphy in his dissent in <em>House, </em>portions of which we set forth below with modifications adapted to the facts of the instant case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">\u201cThe fundamental question now is whether, at the time [P.T.P.] reported the [Buckley] claim, there existed a contract between the parties, for one cannot breach a contract which is not in existence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">\u201cTo answer this question, [we] look again to the nature of claims made and occurrence policies. Both types of policies include provisions which define (1) the events for which coverage is provided and (2) when and how coverage can be initiated. For example, an occurrence policy has a fixed time period defining what specific events or occurrences will be covered. When this time period ends, however, the insurer\u2019s responsibilities under the policy do not end, for it may be held liable for the covered events, barring statutes of limitations, at any time thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">\u201cClaims made policies are almost the mirror image of occurrence policies in that they often cover claims based on events which occurred many years <em>before </em>the policy came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>into effect, but limit the scope of coverage to claims based on these events which are made within the limited time period of the policy. Unlike the occurrence policy, the insurer\u2019s potential liability ends when the policy expires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cTherefore, when the claims made policy at issue here expired there was nothing left. The policy could not be breached because there was no longer a policy to be breached. Any claim made after its expiration is of the same effect as an accident or event which occurs after the \u2018expiration\u2019 of an occurrence policy. There was no breach; there was simply no coverage. [We] therefore think that \u00a7 482 is inapplicable to a \u2018reporting\u2019 type of claims made policy when the claim is made after the expiration of the policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_D\"><em>House, </em>315 Md. at 355-56, 554 A.2d at 418 (Murphy, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The foregoing analysis is consistent with the overwhelming weight of authority, measured both numerically and by persuasiveness. The notice-prejudice rule is the law of many states, having been adopted either legislatively or judicially. Typically, a state\u2019s notice-prejudice rule was adopted when the insuring agreements of liability policies covered occurrences during the policy period. After claims made coverages began to be written, and when insureds, who had reported their claims after their claims made policies had expired, sought to have the notice-prejudice rule applied to their claims made policies, the nearly universal response of courts was to reject the argument of the insureds. This is because the effect of the argument is to enlarge the policy to embrace claims that it was never intended to cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In Massachusetts the notice-prejudice rule, like that of Maryland, was enacted by the legislature. Massachusetts General Laws ch. 175, \u00a7 112 (1987), dealing with automobile and \u201cany other\u201d liability policies that insure against personal injury and property damage, in relevant part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">\u201cAn insurance company shall not deny insurance coverage to an insured because of failure of an insured to seasonably notify an insurance company of an occurrence, incident, claim or of a suit founded upon an occurrence, incident or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>claim, which may give rise to liability insured against unless the insurance company has been prejudiced thereby.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqm\"><em>Johnson Controls, Inc. v. Bowes, </em>381 Mass. 278, 409 N.E.2d 185 (1980), had held that the rule enunciated in the statute was also the common law of Massachusetts, and that the rule applied to all types of insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In <em>Chas. T. Main, Inc. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>406 Mass. 862, 551 N.E.2d 28 (1990), an engineer, the insured under a claims made policy expiring May 1, 1985, did not report a claim until March 1987. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts pointed out that the purpose of giving notice \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d in an occurrence policy \u201cis to permit an insurer to make an investigation of the facts and occurrence relating to liability,\u201d while, in claims made policies, \u201cfairness in rate setting is the purpose of a requirement that notice of a claim be given within the policy period or shortly thereafter.\u201d 551 N.E.2d at 29. The court then explained the significance of the different purposes, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">\u201cThe closer in time that the insured event and the insurer\u2019s payoff are, the more predictable the amount of the payment will be, and the more likely it is that rates will fairly reflect the risks taken by the insurer. The purpose of a claims-made policy is to minimize the time between the insured event and the payment. For that reason, the insured event is the claim being made against the insured during the policy period and the claim being reported to the insurer within that same period or a slightly extended, and specified, period. If a claim is made against an insured, but the insurer does not know about it until years later, the primary purpose of insuring claims rather than occurrences is frustrated. Accordingly, the requirement that notice of the claim be given in the policy period or shortly thereafter in the claims-made policy is of the essence in determining whether coverage exists. Prejudice for an untimely report in this instance is not an appropriate inquiry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Of even more significance here is that the court in <em>Chas. T. Main, Inc., </em>expressly rejected the argument that the Massa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>chusetts notice-prejudice statute applied to the claims made policy at issue. Such a requirement, the court said, \u201cwould defeat the fundamental concept on which claims-made policies are premised.... It would be unreasonable to think that the Legislature intended such a result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted); <em>see also National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Talcott, </em>931 F.2d 166, 167-68 (1st Cir.1991) (applying Massachusetts law).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">New Jersey adopted a notice-prejudice rule in <em>Cooper v. Government Employees Ins. Co., 51 </em>N.J. 86, 237 A.2d 870, 874 (1968), a case involving automobile liability insurance. In <em>Zuckerman v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>100 N.J. 304, 495 A.2d 395 (1985), the Supreme Court of New Jersey refused to apply that rule to a claims made policy. The court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">\u201cBy contrast, the event that invokes coverage under a \u2018claims made\u2019 policy is transmittal of notice of the claim to the insurance carrier. In exchange for limiting coverage only to claims made during the policy period, the carrier provides the insured with retroactive coverage for errors and omissions that took place prior to the policy period. Thus, an extension of the notice period in a \u2018claims made\u2019 policy constitutes an unbargained-for expansion of coverage, <em>gratis, </em>resulting in the insurance company\u2019s exposure to a risk substantially broader than that expressly insured against in the policy. Obviously, such an expansion in the coverage provided by \u2018claims made\u2019 policies would significantly affect both the actuarial basis upon which premiums have been calculated and, consequently, the cost of \u2018claims made\u2019 insurance. So material a modification in the terms of this form of insurance widely used to provide professional liability coverage both in this State and throughout the country would be inequitable and unjustified. The <em>Cooper [v. Government Employees Ins. Co., 51 </em>N.J. 86, 237 A.2d 870 (1968) ] doctrine has a clear application to policies analogous to the automobile liability policy there involved. It has, however, no application whatsoever to a \u2018claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>made\u2019 policy that fulfills the reasonable expectations of the insured with respect to the scope of coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">495 A.2d at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The Supreme Court of Florida adopted a notice-prejudice rule in the automobile liability insurance case of <em>Tiedtke v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of N.Y., </em>222 So.2d 206, 209 (Fla.1969). The contention advanced by P.T.P. to us was advanced by an insured to the Supreme Court of Florida in <em>Gulf Ins. Co. v. Dolan, Fertig &amp; Curtis, </em>433 So.2d 512 (Fla.1983). The court rejected the argument as one seeking an extension of coverage, by the court, which was different from \u201ca mere condition of the policy,\u201d and which would \u201cin effect rewrite[ ] the contract between the two parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The Supreme Court of Rhode Island adopted a notice-prejudice rule in <em>Pickering v.

The application of \u00a7 482 recognized in <em>House </em>can be illustrated by using the provisions from the T.H.E. policy quoted above. Assume that P.T.P. received Buckley's attorney's claim letter in late May and reported it to T.H.E. on or before June 1, 1988. Assume further that T.H.E. disclaimed coverage by contending that P.T.P. had breached \u00a7 IV.2.a of the policy by failing to notify T.H.E. \"as soon as practicable\u201d of the occurrence of the accident on August 27, 1987.

T.H.E. does not argue that there is no coverage because of P.T.P.'s failure to report the <em>occurrence. </em>Hence, P.T.P.'s effort to characterize the disclaimer as the result of a breach by P.T.P. of \u00a7 IV.2.a of the policy misses the critical deficiency. <em>See also </em>n. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b460-11\">.

The Court today, however, would permit an insurance company to circumvent the statute by the simple expedient of defining terms in an insurance policy in a manner contrary to the ordinary meaning of those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Under the insurance policy at issue in this case, the policy period was from April 2, 1987, to April 2, 1988.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The accident occurred within this period. A claim was made by the third party to the insured on June 6, 1988, after the expiration of the policy period and the expiration of the extended reporting period for claims made. Immediately thereafter, the insured reported both the occurrence and the claim to the insurer. As later explained, the insurance policy had elements of both a claims made policy and an occurrence policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The majority\u2019s analysis with respect to \u00a7 482 and the policy in this case is flawed for two reasons. First, the majority does not distinguish between the provisions of a claims made policy which establish coverage and the provisions which require notice. Second, the majority does not acknowledge the occurrence provisions of the policy and the applicability of \u00a7 482 to these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Article 48A, \u00a7 482, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">\u201cDisclaimer of coverage because of lack of notice or cooperation from insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">\u201cWhere any insurer seeks to disclaim coverage on any policy of liability insurance issued by it, on the ground that the insured or anyone claiming the benefits of the policy through the insured has breached the policy by failing to cooperate with the insurer or by not giving requisite notice to the insurer, such disclaimer shall be effective only if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>insurer establishes, by a preponderance of affirmative evidence that such lack of cooperation or notice has resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">By its terms the statute applies to <em>any </em>policy of liability insurance. The majority holds that \u00a7 482 does not apply to reporting type claims made policies. The majority\u2019s broad brush reasoning, however, extends beyond the context of this case in a way that might well undermine the effectiveness of \u00a7 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In a claims made policy, the event which normally triggers coverage is a third party making a claim upon an <em>insured. </em>The ordinary meaning of \u201cclaims made\u201d in insurance parlance is that the critical moment for establishing coverage is the time at which the injured third person\u2019s claim is made against the insured. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. v. House, </em>315 Md. 328, 333, 554 A.2d 404, 407 (1989) (\u201cThe ordinary meaning of \u2018claim made\u2019 refers to the assertion of a claim by or on behalf of the injured person against the insured\u201d). In an occurrence policy the critical moment for establishing coverage is the injury causing accident itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Whether the insured event is the filing of a claim by the injured third person in a claims made policy, or the happening of an occurrence in an occurrence policy, notice provisions exist for both kinds of policies. In a claims made policy, notice to the insurer by the insured that a claim has been made against him typically is required. In an occurrence policy, notice to the insurer by the insured of the covered accident usually is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Section 482 deals with a liability policy\u2019s <em>notice </em>provision, <em>i.e., </em>notice by the <em>insured to the insurer </em>of the happening of an event triggering coverage. It does not apply to the portion of the policy which establishes the essential terms for coverage, <em>i.e., </em>an accident/occurrence or the making of a claim by the injured third party. In a claims made policy the requirement that a claim against the insured be made during the policy period essentially defines the coverage available. The <em>notice </em>of which \u00a7 482 speaks, in a claims made policy, is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>notice by the insured to the insurer that a claim against the insured has been made during the policy period. Both the language and purpose of \u00a7 482 require that it be applied to the clause in a claims made policy providing for notice to the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The majority, however, contends that, because T.H.E. Insurance Co. defined the time at which a claim is made as \u201cwhen written notice of such claim is received and recorded by us,\u201d this claims made policy makes the reporting of the claim by the <em>insured </em>to the <em>insurer </em>the insurable event. By allowing the insurer to define claims made in terms of notice to the insurer, and by holding that \u00a7 482 does not apply to this provision in a claims made policies, the majority opens the door for insurers to circumvent the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">As previously stated, the triggering event for coverage in a claims made policy is the making of a claim by an injured person. By attempting to alter the ordinary meaning of \u201cclaims made\u201d to create coverage which hinges on receiving notice of such a claim from its insured, the insurance company is attempting to create a condition precedent to insurance coverage. This is precisely the situation the statute was designed to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Section 482 was enacted in response to the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Watson v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>231 Md. 266, 189 A.2d 625 (1963). In that case, this Court held that the policy provision requiring the reporting of an accident \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d was a condition precedent to any action on the policy. In <em>Watson, </em>the Court held that the condition was unsatisfied and that the insured was not entitled to coverage. In <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. v. House, supra, </em>we considered the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in enacting \u00a7 482, stating that the statute \u201cmakes policy provisions requiring notice to, and cooperation with, the insurer covenants and <em>not </em>conditions. The statute measures by the standard of actual prejudice the materiality of any breach of those covenants by the insured for the purpose of determining if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>breach excuses performance by the insurer.\u201d 315 Md. at 332, 554 A.2d at 406 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The obvious purpose of the statute was to prevent an insurance company from refusing to cover a matter on the sole ground that the company failed to receive timely notice from its insured. As we stated in <em>House, </em>\u201c[a] policy defense resting on [the] covenant to give notice is foursquare within Art. 48A, \u00a7 482.\u201d 315 Md. at 341, 554 A.2d at 411. Yet the majority, by accepting the insurers\u2019 contorted definition of \u201cclaims made,\u201d has signaled to the insurance industry that it may, by mere drafting, avoid the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The majority opinion suggests that its holding is limited to claims made policies. The majority\u2019s rationale, however, is not limited to claims made policies. An insurance company, in an occurrence policy, could define \u201coccurrence\u201d as notice to the insurer of the event or the accident. Under such a policy and the majority\u2019s rationale, if there were no notice to the insurer during the policy period, there would be no occurrence for purposes of coverage and thus no disclaimer of coverage within the meaning of \u00a7 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Of course, \u00a7 482 only applies if, during the pertinent time, there existed a contract of insurance between the parties. In this case the claim was made by the injured person to the insured after the expiration of the original policy. Thus, the claims made provisions of the original policy were not in effect. It is for this reason that \u00a7 482 would not apply. Contrary to the majority\u2019s view, \u00a7 482 is not rendered inapplicable because the claim was reported by the insured to the insurer after the end of the policy period or because \u00a7 482 does not apply to reporting type claims made policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">If the above-discussed policy provisions were the only provisions implicated in the case, I would concur with the majority\u2019s result although not its reasoning. This policy, however, is not strictly a claims made policy; it has occurrence policy ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>ments. Under the circumstances, \u00a7 482 applies. The insurance contract states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">\u201cCOMMERCIAL LIABILITY CONDITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">sjc * * * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">\u201c2.

Five years for claims arising out of an \u2018occurrence\u2019 reported to us, not later than 60 days after the end of the policy period, in accordance with paragraph 2. a. of Section VI\u2014Commercial General Liability Conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWd\">Under the policy if the insured notifies the insurer of an occurrence during the policy period or within 60 days thereafter, any claim made within five years of the expiration date is covered. The insured failed to provide notice to the insurer of the occurrence in this case. If the insured had provided notice of the occurrence, the claim, filed within five years of the end of the policy period, would have been covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-17\">This is precisely the type of situation that \u00a7 482 was designed to encompass. Section 482 provides that when an insured breaches an insurance policy by failing to give requisite notice of the event triggering coverage, the insurer must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>prove actual prejudice in order to rely on the breach to disclaim coverage. Since the trial court found as a fact that there was no actual prejudice, its judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The majority\u2019s broad opinion fails to effectuate the purpose of \u00a7 482 of the Insurance Code and allows insurers to establish conditions precedent to coverage based upon a failure to \u201ccooperate with the insurer\u201d or a failure to give \u201crequisite notice to the insurer.\u201d The majority\u2019s opinion and decision cannot be squared with the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in enacting \u00a7 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Judge ROBERT M. BELL has authorized me to state that he concurs with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-11\">. Because the trial judge did not address issues relating to the \"renewal\u201d policy, I do not comment on them here. I agree with the majority that a substantial controversy remains to be resolved with respect to the renewal policy and its May 27, 1988, retroactive date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
