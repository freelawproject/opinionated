They challenge the validity of the Governor\u2019s action reducing appropriations pursuant to Maryland Code (1985, 1988 Repl-Vol.), \u00a7 7-213 of the State Finance and Procurement Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">Section 7-213 of the State Finance and Procurement Article authorizes the Governor, with the approval of the Board of Public Works, to reduce, by not more than 25%, any appropriation that the Governor deems unnecessary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u00a7 7-213, on September 30, 1992, the Governor submitted a plan for the reduction of many appropriations for Fiscal Year (FY) 1993 to the Board of Public Works for approval. A reduction of $30.8 million appropriated to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) and a reduction of approximately $20 million appropriated to the Department of Human Resources (DHR) were proposed. The $30.8 million DHMH reduction represented the elimination of health care coverage under the grant for Medical Assistance State Only. The $20 million DHR cut resulted from reducing grants to disabled indigents in the General Public Assistance program and from reducing assistance to families under the Ad to Families with Dependent Children program. The Board of Public Works approved the Governor\u2019s proposed reductions with amendments not relevant to this case. Thereafter, pursuant to an order signed by the Governor, the Comptroller adjusted the accounts of all state agencies to reflect the reduced appropriations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>On November 2, 1992, the petitioners filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a complaint seeking to enjoin the Governor, the Treasurer, the Comptroller, the Secretary of the Department of Human Resources and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene from reducing their public assistance benefits and from eliminating their medical coverage. On November 16, 1992, the circuit court issued an interlocutory injunction preventing these officials from implementing the challenged reductions. On November 18, 1992, in response to a petition by the State, the Court of Special Appeals stayed the circuit court\u2019s interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Thereafter, the parties filed in the circuit court cross motions for summary judgment. The plaintiffs argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u00a7 7-213 was inconsistent with Art. Ill, \u00a7 52, of the Maryland Constitution and was thereby unauthorized. They further argued that the General Assembly\u2019s grant of authority to the Governor to reduce appropriations under \u00a7 7-213 violated the principle of separation of powers set forth in Art. 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights because it failed to set forth sufficient standards to guide the Governor\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs contended that the Governor\u2019s action in reducing these appropriations and the Board of Public Works\u2019s action in approving them was arbitrary, capricious and unsupported by substantial evidence. Finally, the plaintiffs claimed that the 25% limitation on reductions under \u00a7 7-213 was violated when the sum appropriated to DHMH was reduced by eliminating the Medical Assistance State Only grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The State contended that \u00a7 7-213 did not violate the principle of separation of powers and was consistent with Art. Ill, \u00a7 52, of the Maryland Constitution. It further asserted that action of the Governor and the Board of Public Works pursuant to \u00a7 7-213 was not judicially reviewable for arbitrariness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>capriciousness or lack of evidentiary support. The State also argued that the elimination of the Medical Assistance State Only grant did not violate the terms of \u00a7 7-213.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">On December 2, 1992, the circuit court granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied that of the plaintiffs. The trial court expressed the reasons for his action as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">\u201cIt is my conclusion from the undisputed facts in evidence that the Governor\u2019s action and that of ... the Board of Public Works, on September 30th was lawful and constitutional. I believe that the Governor and the Board of Public Works took the actions that they did on September 30th pursuant to Section 7-213, and, I believe .that Section 7-213 was constitutionally enacted pursuant to the provisions of Article III, Section 52, Subsection 13 of the Maryland Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">\u201cI also believe that not only did the Governor act pursuant to that statute which I find to be lawful and constitutional, but I find that he exercised the authority and powers vested in him under that statute properly and in accordance with the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">4: # sfc iH 4*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">\u201cI do not think there has been any violence done in these enactments to the separation of powers of the State of Maryland____ I think that the total picture that emerges from our constitution is, as the defendants suggest, a very strong and powerful Governor, particularly when it comes to budgetary matters____ So I think that our mothers and fathers over the years constructed the type' of separation of powers on the state level that vests considerable power and authority to the Governor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-14\">V <em>H* H* H*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-15\">\u201cI think we have to look at Section 7-213 in that light and harmonize it with the overall budgetary process that the Maryland Constitution sets forth. To me, the Legislature, with all of this framework in mind, I believe did have the authority to say that in view of our framework, and for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>more orderly government, we believe the Governor should have this power, that is to the peoples\u2019 interest that he have this power, and that we not have gridlock. I don\u2019t think its surrendering legislative power to the Governor. I think it is the Legislature\u2019s intent to further define and expurgate just what the Governor is able to do with a State budget, and reinforces the preeminent role which ... the Governor has in the State of Maryland in the budgetary process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEq\">The plaintiffs noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals on December 17, 1992, and then filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari. Prior to argument in the Court of Special Appeals, we issued a writ of certiorari to consider the important issues presented. 329 Md. 168, 617 A.2d 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">As the trial court recognized, fundamental to the resolution of this dispute is the nature of Maryland\u2019s executive budget system. This Court, on several occasions, has discussed the requirements and history of that system. <em>See Kelly v. Marylanders for Sports Sanity, </em>310 Md. 437, 450-461, 530 A.2d 245, 251-257 (1987); <em>Bayne v. Secretary of State, </em>283 Md. 560, 567-569, 392 A.2d 67, 71-72 (1978); <em>Md. Act. for Foster Child. v. State, </em>279 Md. 133, 140-153, 367 A.2d 491, 495-502 (1977); <em>Panitz v. Comptroller, </em>247 Md. 501, 505-509, 232 A.2d 891, 893-895 (1967); <em>McKeldin v. Steedman, </em>203 Md. 89, 96-103, 98 A.2d 561, 563-567 (1953); <em>Dorsey v. Petrott, </em>178 Md. 230, 241-244, 13 A.2d 630, 636-647 (1940); <em>Baltimore v. O\u2019Conor, </em>147 Md. 639, 644-646, 128 A. 759, 761, 40 A.L.R. 1058 (1925). We have not, however, dealt with the authority of the Governor to reduce an appropriation after the budget bill has passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">In 1916, in response to fiscal irresponsibility which led to deficits, the voters of the State of Maryland ratified an amendment to the Constitution which established an executive budget system, Art. Ill, \u00a7 52, of the Maryland Constitution. <em>See Md. Act. for Foster Child. v. State, supra, </em>279 Md. at 145, 367 A.2d at 497-498; <em>McKeldin v. Steedman, supra, </em>203 Md. at 96, 98 A.2d at 564; Goodnow Commission Report, <em>Journal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>of Proceedings of the Senate of Maryland, </em>for the Legislative Session of 1916, at 129-134 (\u201cGoodnow Commission Report\u201d); Hooper S. Miles, <em>The Maryland Executive Budget System and a Review of its Administration, </em>1916-1941, at 7-8 (1942) (\u201cMiles\u201d). The amendment had been proposed by the \u201cCommission on Economy and Efficiency on the Budget System\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and was designed \u201cto bring about a fundamental change in State appropriations\u201d by vesting in the Governor responsibility for the fiscal affairs of the State. <em>Md. Act. for Foster Child. v. State, supra, </em>279 Md. at 145, 367 A.2d at 498. The driving force behind the implementation of a budget system in which the executive plays a dominant role was the desire to avoid further deficits and to ensure a balanced budget. In order to fully understand the context of the constitutional arguments raised in this case, a description of the budgetary process under \u00a7 52 is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">There have been some changes to the budget amendment since 1916. Currently, the system functions as follows. Ordinarily, on the third Wednesday in January, the Governor submits to the General Assembly a comprehensive budget and a budget bill for the ensuing fiscal year, Art. Ill, \u00a7 52(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>this budget, the Governor estimates the State\u2019s revenues and establishes the fiscal priorities of the State by setting forth a complete plan of proposed expenditures. <em>Ibid. </em>The authority to revise estimates received from State agencies and to propose expenditures was granted solely to the Governor in order to establish responsible executive control over budgetary matters.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Goodnow Commission Report discussed the reasoning of the Commission for the concentration of both power over and responsibility for the budget in the Governor, stating (Goodnow Commission Report, <em>supra, </em>at 131):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">\u201cIt will also be noted that the party platform providing for the Commission limited its choice in determining the responsibility for making the final estimates for submission to the Legislature, to the Board of Public Works on the one hand, and to the Governor on the other. We have concluded that this responsibility should be placed on the Governor. We have felt that to make use of the Board of Public Works as a Budget Commission would have the disadvantage of dissipating personal responsibility for financial propositions, and would also run the risk of not securing party responsibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Thus, neither the General Assembly nor the Board of Public Works has the authority, in the initial budget process, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>propose an expenditure. Only the Governor may propose an expenditure in the initial budget. Upon receipt of the Governor\u2019s proposed budget and budget bill, the presiding officer of each House must introduce the bill. Art. Ill, \u00a7 52(5).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, the Governor may amend or supplement the budget bill by revising, adding or eliminating any appropriation. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The General Assembly is authorized to amend the Governor\u2019s budget bill under certain circumstances. The General Assembly may not amend the bill in such a way as to affect the obligations of the State under Art. Ill, \u00a7 34, of the Maryland Constitution, or to affect the public schools or the salaries required by the Constitution to be paid. It may increase or reduce the items in the Governor\u2019s budget relating to the General Assembly and the Judiciary. It may reduce but not increase all other items in the Governor\u2019s budget. Art. Ill, \u00a7 52(6).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When both houses of the General Assembly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>pass the budget bill, it becomes law without further action by the Governor. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">These limitations were seen as essential to the task of devising a system that would avoid the accumulation of a deficit and ensure that the Governor\u2019s plan of proposed expenditures could not be amended in such a way as to exceed estimated revenues. Article III, \u00a7 52(5a), expressly mandates that the Governor propose and maintain a balanced budget.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Goodnow Commission Report, supra, at 129-130, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARB\">\u201cIt will be noted that the [Democratic Party] platform provides for a budget system prepared by the Governor or the Board of Public Works, the items of which can be reduced or eliminated, but not increased, by the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">\u201cThis limitation is fundamental in our judgment for a sound budget system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Although the broad authority of the Governor was essential and virtually unanimously supported, the Goodnow Commission grappled with what it described as \u201cthe most difficult problem in connection with the formulation of a budget plan, ... the determination of the powers of the Legislature rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>tive to the estimates to be submitted by the Governor.\u201d Goodnow Commission Report, <em>swpra, </em>at 131. To address this concern the Commission proposed that the Legislature be given \u201cthe power to initiate appropriations for objects for which the Governor has made no estimates\u201d but that that power be restricted so that it could not be used \u201cin such a manner as to produce a deficit in the State\u2019s finances.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, the Goodnow Commission proposed a method whereby, after the budget bill has passed, the General Assembly may consider other appropriations in the form of supplementary appropriation bills. Art. Ill, \u00a7 52(8).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These supplementary appropriation bills originate in the General Assembly. Each must address a single work, object or purpose and must contain a tax provision to provide the revenue necessary to pay the appropriation. <em>Ibid. </em>The supplementary appropriation bills are presented to the Governor for his signature as any other bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In this manner the Governor and the General Assembly together, with the Governor having a preeminent role, enact a budget for the ensuing fiscal year based on departmental estimates of needs and on estimated revenues. The fiscal year begins on July 1 of a calendar year and ends on June 30 of the next calendar year, \u00a7 2-101 of the State Finance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Procurement Article. Thus, there is a substantial period of time between the submission of revenue estimates and the expiration of the fiscal year. During part of this time the General Assembly is not in session.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Given the complex and changing needs of the State over the course of a year, a system was needed to administer the budget.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Article III, \u00a7 52(13), of the Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he General Assembly may, from time to time, enact such laws not inconsistent with this section, as may be necessary and proper to carry out its provisions.\u201d In the first budget bill passed under Art. Ill, \u00a7 52, the General Assembly began to enact a statutory scheme for the administration of the budget.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Until 1939, this statutory scheme was reenacted bi-annually as part of the budget bill.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Consistent with the constitutional provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>sions, the bulk of the responsibility for the fiscal affairs of the State during the fiscal year was vested by this statutory scheme in the Governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The first budget bill passed after the ratification of the budget amendment to the Maryland Constitution provided (Ch. 206 of the Acts of 1918, \u00a7 3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">\u201cThat the items and amounts which hereinafter follow the sums appropriated, and which are, respectively, entitled \u2018Schedule,\u2019 do not constitute appropriations but represent the initial plan of distribution and apportionment of the appropriations to which they, respectively, refer. Each appropriation shall be paid out only in accordance with the Schedule therefor, if any, unless such Schedule be amended in the following manner: Any department, board, commissioner or officer may at any time submit in writing to the Governor an amended Schedule for the distribution and apportionment of the appropriations made to it or him, or any unexpended balance thereof, different from the manner set forth in the Schedule contained in this Act. The Governor may himself make such an amended Schedule, if the same be necessary, with respect to the appropriations for the Executive Department. If the Governor shall make such an amended Schedule with respect to the appropriations for the executive Department or if he shall approve an amended Schedule when submitted to him as aforesaid, then he shall transmit the same with his certificate of approval to the Comptroller, and thereafter the appropriation, or the unexpended balance thereof, shall be paid out in accordance with such amended Schedule. Any amended Schedule, so submitted to the Governor may be withdrawn and amended to meet any objections of the Governor, and then resubmitted. Any such amended Schedule may be again amended, at any time, in like manner and with like effect. All amendments in Schedules thus made or approved by the Governor shall be reported by him to the next session of the General Assembly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Thus, the concept of the budget bill being an \u201cinitial plan of disbursement\u201d has been an element of the executive budget <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>system since its enactment. As Judge Alan M. Wilner, now Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals, explained in his book <em>The Maryland Board, of Public Works: A History, </em>at 85 n. 20 (1984),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">\u201cThis authority [to reduce an appropriation deemed unnecessary by 25%] was in addition to the even more comprehensive control delegated to the governor. In the 1931 budget (Acts of 1931, ch. 150), the General Assembly had stated that the items enumerated in the bill constituted only an \u2018initial plan of disbursement\u2019 and that the governor could, if he chose, amend that schedule with respect to executive agencies. Sec. 7 of the 1933 budget retained the concept of \u2018initial plan of disbursement,\u2019 but in contrast to its predecessors it <em>required </em>all executive agencies to submit to the governor an amended itemized schedule and permitted disbursement only to the extent the governor approved the amended schedule. This, in effect, made the budget bill a mere starting point and gave the governor total control over the state budget...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In the 1920 Budget Bill, the General Assembly added that the Legislature \u201cmay by resolution provide for or authorize the amendment of its schedule.\u201d Ch. 487 of the Acts of 1920, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Similar provisions for the administration of the budget were passed as part of every budget bill from the inception of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the budget system to their codification in 1939 as \u201cthe Budget and Procurement Act.\u201d <em>See </em>Ch. 206 of the Acts of 1918; Ch. 487 of the Acts of 1920; Ch. 500 of the Acts of 1922; Ch. 176 of the Acts of 1924; Ch. 654 of the Acts of 1927; Ch. 134 of the Acts of 1929; Ch. 150 of the Acts of 1931; Ch. 597 of the Acts of 1933; Ch. 92 of the Acts of 1935; Ch. 515 of the Acts of 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">An additional measure for the administration of the budget was included in Ch. 597 of the Acts of 1933 and Ch. 92 of the Acts of 1935, as the General Assembly attempted to deal with \u201cthe devastating effects of the economic depression.\u201d Miles, <em>supra, </em>at 28. In the period prior to the 1935 legislative session, the State Treasury faced the first deficit since the establishment of the executive budget system. Miles, <em>supra, </em>at 29-30. On January 2, 1935, Governor Ritchie addressed the General Assembly, stating (Miles, <em>supra, </em>at 31):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">\u201c \u2018In this State the estimates of revenues and disbursements for Budget purposes must be prepared more than two and a half years before the close of the two-year budgetary period.\u2019 \u2018At best this is a difficult thing to do\u2019 and the effects of the economic depression began \u201cwithin the past year or more\u2019 to be reflected in a decline in State revenues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In order to allow for greater flexibility between legislative sessions for the administration of the budget, especially in times when the State\u2019s revenues had been greatly overestimated in the budget bill, the General Assembly enacted as \u00a7 11 of the Budget Bills of 1933 and 1935, the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARn\"><em>\u201cAnd be it further enacted, </em>That the Board of Public Works is hereby authorized and empowered to supervise the expenditure of all appropriations contained in this budget and for that purpose the said Board shall have power to reduce or eliminate any appropriation which it may deem unnecessary, except the appropriation for the payment of interest and the retirement of the State debt and the appropriation to the Legislature and the judiciary and no officer, department, commission or employee shall be authorized to expend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>any appropriation or part of an appropriation which the Board of Public Works deems to be unnecessary. The said Board shall have full power and authority to establish rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, to carry out the powers conferred by this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">By Ch. 64 of the Acts of 1939 the General Assembly enacted Article 15A of the Maryland Code, entitled \u201cBudget and Procurement Act.\u201d In addition to codifying the sections passed in previous budget bills, the Act also recast the above-quoted \u00a7 11 of the 1933 and 1935 Budget Bills. The new language was described by then Treasurer of Maryland, Hooper S. Miles, as follows (Miles, <em>supra, </em>at 66-67, 79):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\u201cBefore adjourning <em>sine die </em>on April 3, 1939, the Legislature passed another Administration Bill, known as the \u2018Budget and Procurement Bill\u2019 .... Under the Act, the Governor now may, with the approval of the Board of Public Works, impound up to 25% \u2018of any item of appropriation which he may deem unnecessary except appropriations for the payment of interest and the retirement of the State debt and appropriation to the Legislature, the Public Schools and the Judiciary.\u2019 ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">The Act also strengthened and broadened the authority of the Board of Public Works in exercising control over the fiscal practices and related administrative policies of the departments, institutions and agencies of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">\u201cThe adoption of the \u2018Budget and Procurement Act\u2019 by the Legislature of 1939 constituted not only a noteworthy step forward in support of the Budget System, but <em>should </em>mark the beginning of a more effective and enlightened administration of the Budget System and the fiscal affairs of the State than at any time in the past.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Most of this \u201cBudget and Procurement Act\u201d is currently codified as Division I, State Finance, of the State Finance and Procurement Article. Title seven of Division I deals with appropriations and subtitle two of title seven addresses the distribution of appropriations by the executive branch of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>State government. These sections provide that \u201c[mjoney may be disbursed from the State Treasury only in accordance with the current appropriation for a program as amended from time to time in accordance with this title,\u201d \u00a7 7-205 of the State Finance and Procurement Article.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, while the \u201cinitial appropriation for a program is set forth in the appropriation act ... the appropriation for a program may be increased or reduced as provided in this subtitle.\u201d \u00a7 7-206 of the State Finance and Procurement Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The subtitle goes on to describe various amendments which can be made during the fiscal year. Section \u00a7 7-208 provides that when the General Assembly is not in session, \u201cthe President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Delegates jointly may authorize an amendment of an appropriation for a program of the Legislative Branch of the State Government.\u201d Likewise, \u00a7 7-208.1 provides that the \u201cChief Judge of the Court of Appeals may authorize an amendment of an appropriation for a program of the Judicial Branch.\u201d In either case, the amendment \u201cmay not increase the sum of the appropriations for all the programs\u201d of the Legislative or Judicial Branches respectively. \u00a7\u00a7 7-208(e) and 7-208.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Sections 7-209 and 7-213 detail the Governor\u2019s authority to change the amounts appropriated. The Governor may alter an appropriation for a program of the Office of the Governor, \u00a7 7-209(a). Whenever an officer or unit of the Executive Branch of the State Government requests a change in an appropriation, the Governor may approve the change, \u00a7 7-209(b).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Such an amendment \u201cmay not increase the sum of the appropriations for all the programs of the officer or unit,\u201d \u00a7 7-209(c). The Governor also may amend an appropriation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>by reducing, by not more than 25%, any appropriation which he deems to be unnecessary, \u00a7 7-213. The Governor may not, under this provision, reduce an appropriation for the Legislative or Judicial Branches, for the payment of principal of or interest on the state debt, for the public schools, for the salary of a public officer during the term of office, or for the salary of an employee in the classified or unclassified service, except as provided in the Merit System Law. \u00a7 7\u2014213(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Each one of the above-described amendments to appropriations is subject to the restriction that it \u201cmay not change any language or substantive provision in the State budget,\u201d \u00a7 7-210(a). The post-legislative \u201cbudget amendment\u201d process applies primarily to the \u201cmonetary figures of an appropriation,\u201d \u00a7 7-210(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">This comprehensive scheme for an executive budget system, including the administration by the executive of appropriations, has, as its main objective, the maintenance of a balanced budget as required by Art. Ill, \u00a7 52(5a), of the Maryland Constitution. <em>See McKeldin v. Steedman, supra, </em>203 Md. at 98, 98 A.2d at 564 (\u201cThe constitutional objective ... [is] to prevent the possible disturbance of the balanced budget which the plan contemplated\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The plaintiffs present several challenges to the action of the Governor and the Board of Public Works in this case. They argue that \u00a7 7-213 is inconsistent with Art. Ill, \u00a7 52, and thus is unauthorized. In addition, they contend that the statute violates the principle of separation of powers set forth in Art. 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights because it constitutes a delegation of legislative power to the Chief Executive and lacks sufficient standards to guide the Governor\u2019s exercise of authority. If this Court determines that \u00a7 7-213 is consistent with \u00a7 52 and does not violate the principle of separation of powers, then the plaintiffs urge this Court to overturn the action of the Governor and Board on the ground that it was arbitrary, capricious or unsupported by substantial evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Finally, the plaintiffs maintain that the action with respect to the Medical Assistance State Only grant did not comply with the 25% limitation in \u00a7 7-213.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">As the summary in Part I of the requirements and history of the executive budget system demonstrates, the budget system as it has evolved in Maryland imposes the power over and the responsibility for the fiscal affairs of the State primarily in the Governor. Article III, \u00a7 52(13), authorizes the General Assembly to enact statutes which are \u201cnot inconsistent\u201d with the constitutional budget process and which are \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d for the process to function.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The statutes providing for the administration of the budget process, including \u00a7 7-213, were enacted in accordance with \u00a7 52(13) of Art. III. The budget bills beginning with 1918 acknowledged that, given the dynamic economic needs of the State, flexibility in the distribution of appropriations was needed. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ch. 206 of the Acts of 1918 (\u201cthe items and amounts which hereinafter follow the sums appropriated ... do not constitute appropriations, but represent the initial plan of distribution and apportionment of the appropriations\u201d); Commission on Administrative Organization of the State, <em>First Interim Report: The Maryland Budget System, </em>at 8 (1951) (\u201cWhatever the figures used, [in the budget bill,] sound administration will require that they be changed by budget amendment according to changed conditions when the spending time comes\u201d). The enactment of \u00a7 7-213 \u201cconstituted not only a noteworthy step forward in support of the Budget System, but [also] mark[ed] the beginning of a more effective and enlightened administration of the Budget System and the fiscal affairs of the State.\u201d Miles, <em>supra, </em>at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 contend that \u00a7 7-213 is inconsistent with Art. Ill, \u00a7 52, because it allows the Governor to reduce appropriations. According to the plaintiffs, the authority to reduce appropriations was assigned solely to the General Assembly by Art. Ill, \u00a7 52. In apparent disregard of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Governor\u2019s major role in every aspect of the budgetary process, the plaintiffs state (brief at 7):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">\u201cThe power to amend legislation and the power to reduce appropriations are ... functions committed solely to the legislative branch under our state constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">This is simply an inaccurate statement. Section 52 of Art. Ill allows the Governor to revise departmental estimates and, in the event that departmental requests exceed estimated revenues, \u00a7 52(5a) mandates that the Governor reduce those departmental estimates. <em>Md. Act. for Foster Child. v. State, supra, </em>279 Md. at 151, 367 A.2d at 501 (\u201c[T]he Constitution itself gives the Governor authority to reduce estimated appropriations in all categories except those for the General Assembly, for the Judiciary and for the public schools as provided by law\u201d). In addition, the Constitution expressly provides that the Governor may amend or supplement the budget bill, Art. Ill, \u00a7 52(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The authority given to the Governor in \u00a7 7-213 corresponds to the power vested in the Governor by Art. Ill, \u00a7 52. Section 7-213 merely allows the Governor to accomplish at the end of the budget process what he is required to do when he submits his initial budget. If the revenue estimates for FY 1993 had been accurate at the time the budget bill was being prepared for submission to the General Assembly, the Governor would have been required to impose the reductions at that juncture. The revenue estimates for FY 1993 turned out to be inaccurate after the enactment of the budget bill, just as they turned out to be inaccurate in the 1930\u2019s. The General Assembly, well aware of the problem in the 1930\u2019s and the possibility of its recurrence, enacted \u00a7 7-213 in 1939 in order to forestall the accumulation of deficits in subsequent fiscal years.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">Section 7-213 comports with Art. Ill, \u00a7 52, because the statute recognizes and perpetuates the preeminent role of the Governor in the budget process, a role considered by the Goodnow Commission to be \u201cfundamental ... for a sound budget system.\u201d Goodnow Commission Report, <em>supra, </em>at 130. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Furthermore, because \u00a7 7-213 furthers the requirement of maintaining a balanced budget throughout the fiscal year, it is precisely the type of legislation which the framers of Art. Ill, \u00a7 52, contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The plaintiffs also contend that the balanced budget requirement was intended to apply only during the preparation of the budget and its passage. This argument is inconsistent with the language and history of Art. Ill, \u00a7 52. The single unifying theme of the move to develop a budget system was to avoid a deficit and to maintain a balanced budget. <em>See </em>Goodnow Commission Report, <em>supra, </em>at 130-131; Miles, <em>supra, </em>at 7-8; <em>Md. Act. for Foster Child. v. State, supra, </em>279 Md. at 145, 367 A.2d at 497-498. Every budget bill since 1918 has contained language prohibiting State officials from spending money in excess of their appropriations. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ch. 206 of the Acts of 1918; Ch. 487 of the Acts of 1920; Ch. 500 of the Acts of 1922; Ch. 176 of the Acts of 1924; Ch. 654 of the Acts of 1927; Ch. 134 of the Acts of 1929; Ch. 150 of the Acts of 1931; Ch. 597 of the Acts of 1933; Ch. 92 of the Acts of 1935; Ch. 515 of the Acts of 1937. In times of revenue shortfall, the General Assembly charged the Governor or the Board of Public Works with the unpleasant task of impounding appropriations to prevent a deficit. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ch. 597 of the Acts of 1933; Ch. 92 of the Acts of 1935; Ch. 64 of the Acts of 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Article III, \u00a7 52, sets forth a detailed process for the submission of a budget and the passage of a budget bill. It does not address specifically the administration of that budget. Rather, Art. Ill, \u00a7 52(13), allows the General Assembly to enact legislation for the administration of the budget that is consistent with Art. Ill, \u00a7 52. The General Assembly has enacted statutes for the administration of appropriations; executive control over the administration of appropriations during the portion of the year in which the General Assembly is not in session has been part of the executive budget system since 1918.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Thus, the authority of the Governor in \u00a7 7-213 mirrors the authority of the Governor in \u00a7 52 of Art. III. As the above summary of the history of appropriations in this State demonstrates, flexibility is needed in the administration of the budget in order for the State to run efficiently and to avoid deficits. Therefore, the statute is consistent with Art. Ill, \u00a7 52, and is a \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d means of administering the budget and maintaining a balanced budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">With respect to the constitutional requirement of separation of powers generally, this Court has repeatedly pointed out that Art. 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights does not impose \u201ca complete separation between the branches of government,\u201d and that delegation of legislative power to the executive branch is constitutionally permissible \u201cwhere sufficient safeguards are legislatively provided for the guidance ... in ... administration of the statute.\u201d <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, </em>311 Md. 64, 81, 72, 532 A.2d 1056, 1064, 1060 (1987). <em>See also Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. v. Linchester, </em>274 Md. 211, 218-220, 334 A.2d 514, 520-521 (1975); <em>County Council v. Investors Funding, </em>270 Md. 403, 441-442, 312 A.2d 225, 244-246 (1973); <em>Baltimore v. State, </em>15 Md. 376, 459 (1860).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Moreover, traditional principles of separation of powers were modified by the enactment of Art. Ill, \u00a7 52, of the Maryland Constitution, particularly in light of the preeminent role of the Governor in the budgetary process. <em>See Mandel v. O\u2019Hara, </em>320 Md. 103, 132, 576 A.2d 766, 780 (1990). As Hooper S. Miles stated, (Miles, <em>supra, </em>at 9-10):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">\u201cThe present Budget System, which is technically known as the \u2018State Executive Budget System,\u2019 was designed ... to impose upon the Governor the primary responsibility of controlling the fiscal policies and operations of the State .... The present System, therefore, effectively deprives the Legislature of the almost unlimited power of appropriation that it formerly possessed, and at the same time greatly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>enhances the responsibility of the Governor in the conduct of the State\u2019s fiscal affairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Article III, \u00a7 52, allows the Governor to act in a way that would otherwise be considered legislative; the Governor has a major legislative-type role with respect to the budget.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Mandel v. O\u2019Hara, supra, </em>320 Md. at 121-125, 576 A.2d at 775-777 (Governor\u2019s action in vetoing legislation is a legislative act). The plaintiffs\u2019 argument concerning separation of powers must be addressed in the context of the executive budget system created by Art. Ill, \u00a7 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The plaintiffs advance the contention that the delegation is improper because authority is vested in the person of the Governor and not an executive branch principal department or administrative agency. This argument turns the budget process on its head. The plaintiffs\u2019 overall delegation argument might have more merit if the delegation were to anyone but the Governor. As previously stated, the Governor has a preeminent constitutional role with respect to appropriations. Concentrating this power and responsibility in the person of the Governor is consistent with the Goodnow Commission\u2019s desire to establish a strong executive budget system. The Goodnow Commission Report, <em>supra, </em>at 133-134, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANr\">\u201cOur thought in drafting the proposed amendment has been:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">First\u2014To impose upon the Governor the sole responsibility, within the limits of the Constitution and the provisions of existing law, of presenting to the Legislature a complete and comprehensive statement of the needs and resources of the State ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">Second\u2014To make it impossible for the Legislature so to change the plans proposed by the Governor as to produce a deficit; but</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">Third\u2014To permit the Legislature to make provision for any purpose not included in the Governor\u2019s plan on the condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>that it provide also for the revenue which the accomplishment of its purpose necessitates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Section 7-213 specifically reflects the Governor\u2019s constitutional role with respect to appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">This Court has held that delegations of legislative power ordinarily do not violate the principle of separation of powers when sufficient safeguards are provided. <em>See, e.g., Department of Transportation v. Armacost, supra, </em>311 Md. at 72, 532 A.2d at 1060; <em>Sullivan v. Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs, </em>293 Md. 113, 121, 442 A.2d 558, 563 (1982); <em>Governor v. Exxon Corp., </em>279 Md. 410, 440-441, 370 A.2d 1102, 1119 (1977), <em>aff'd, </em>437 U.S. 117, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 (1978); <em>County Council v. Investors Funding, supra, </em>270 Md. at 442, 312 A.2d at 244-246; <em>Davis v. Montgomery County, </em>267 Md. 456, 466-469, 298 A.2d 178 (1972); <em>McBriety v. Baltimore City, </em>219 Md. 223, 238, 148 A.2d 408, 418 (1959); <em>Givner v. Commissioner of Health, </em>207 Md. 184, 191-192, 113 A.2d 899, 902-903 (1955). In some instances the delegation was to an administrative agency, as was the case in <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, supra, </em>and in some instances the delegation was to an executive officer, as was the case in <em>Governor v. Exxon Corp., supra, </em>279 Md. 410, 370 A.2d 1102 (upholding delegation of legislative authority to the Comptroller).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Moreover, in <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, supra, </em>we noted that the \u201ctrend of the cases ... \u2018is toward greater liberality in permitting grants of discretion to [executive branch] officials ... in order to facilitate the administration of the laws as the complexity of governmental and economic conditions increase.\u2019 \u201d 311 Md. at 72, 532 A.2d at 1060, quoting, <em>County Council v. Investors Funding, supra, </em>270 Md. at 442, 312 A.2d at 246. We also acknowledged that we had \u201crelaxed the general rule that a statute vesting discretion in administrative officials without fixing any standards for their guidance is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.\u201d <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, supra, </em>311 Md. at 73-74, 532 A.2d at 1060. <em>See also Governor v. Exxon Corp., supra, </em>279 Md. at 440, 370 A.2d at 1119 (\u201cOrdinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>when legislative authority is delegated to administrative officials, there must be sufficient standards for the guidance of the administrative officials. However, it has been recognized that the complexity of modern economic conditions may make it impossible to tailor specific guidelines for every conceivable situation and that latitude in granting discretion is necessary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The General Assembly, in the statutory scheme for the administration of the budget, has provided sufficient safeguards with respect to the Governor\u2019s exercise of authority. For example, in order for the Governor to reduce an appropriation under \u00a7 7-213, he must obtain the approval of the Board of Public Works.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In addition, \u00a7 7-210 provides that the Governor may not make any substantive changes to the budget bill pursuant to \u00a7 7-213. Furthermore, \u00a7 7-213(b) delineates various types of appropriations which the Governor may not reduce. As to the other appropriations, the statute itself provides that the Governor may only reduce items which he deems \u201cunnecessary.\u201d Finally, the statute only allows a reduction of 25%. These provisions circumscribe the Governor\u2019s exercise of authority while allowing a necessary degree of flexibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">As previously mentioned, the sufficiency of the safeguards must be considered in light of the constitutional relationship between the Governor and the General Assembly with respect to the budget. In light of the Governor\u2019s role in the budgetary process, and the safeguards set forth in the statute, \u00a7 7-213 does not violate the principle of separation of powers set forth in Art. 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The plaintiffs, characterizing the Governor\u2019s and the Board of Public Works\u2019 authority under \u00a7 7-213 as \u201cadminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>trative,\u201d contend that their action pursuant to \u00a7 7-213 is subject to normal judicial review and that, in this case, the action should be overturned on the grounds that it is arbitrary, capricious and unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In <em>Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. v. Linchester, supra, </em>274 Md. at 224, 334 A.2d at 523, this Court described the types of review that it would undertake of \u201cadministrative\u201d actions, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">\u201cIn those instances where an administrative agency is acting in a manner which may be considered legislative in nature (quasi-legislative), the judiciary\u2019s scope of review of that particular action is limited to assessing whether the agency was acting within its legal boundaries---- [But] when an agency is acting in a ... capacity [that is] quasi-judicial ...[,] the courts review the appealed conclusions by determining whether the contested decision was rendered in an ... arbitrary, capricious, [or] oppressive ... manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\"><em>See also Sugarloaf v. Waste Disposal, </em>323 Md. 641, 672-673, 594 A.2d 1115, 1130 (1991) (nonadjudicatory administrative decisions \u201care not subject to judicial review in the usual sense of that term\u201d). Thus, characterizing the action of the Governor and the Board of Public Works as \u201cadministrative\u201d does not subject the action to judicial review on the ground that it is arbitrary or capricious or unsupported by substantial evidence. Rather, the inquiry is whether the action is adjudicatory or quasi-judicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">As plaintiffs acknowledged in oral argument before this Court, the action by the Governor and the Board of Public Works was not a contested case under the Administrative Procedure Act, Code (1984), \u00a7 10-201 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article. Furthermore, the action was not the type <em>of </em>administrative determination which has been deemed \u201cadjudicatory\u201d or \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d under our cases. <em>See Mossburg v. Montgomery County, Md., </em>329 Md. 494, 506, 620 A.2d 886, 892 (1993); <em>Medical Waste v. Maryland Waste, </em>327 Md. 596, 610-611, 612 A.2d 241, 248 (1992); <em>Sugarloaf v. Waste Disposal, supra, </em>323 Md. at 670, 594 A.2d at 1129; <em>Montgomery County v.

Consequently, the action is not subject to judicial review to determine whether it was arbitrary, capricious, or unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The determination of the Governor and Board obviously was quasi-legislative in nature. Our review, consequently, \u201cis limited to assessing whether the [Governor and Board were] acting within [their] legal boundaries.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. v. Linchester, supra, </em>274 Md. at 224, 334 A.2d at 523. The action was consistent with relevant law. The Governor did not reduce any appropriations which were exempted from reduction under \u00a7 7-213(b). The Governor did not make any substantive changes to the Budget Bill, and he only reduced appropriations which he deemed \u201cunnecessary.\u201d The reductions were approved by the Board of Public Works. As we shall explain below, the 25% limitation on the reduction of any appropriation was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final argument is that the Governor and the Board of Public Works did not act in accordance with the statutory scheme when they eliminated the Medical Assistance State Only grant. The plaintiffs claim that the 25% limitation was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">When Art. Ill, \u00a7 52, was adopted, it required that the Governor submit in the budget an itemized estimate of all appropriations. Art. Ill, \u00a7 52(4). It also required that he submit \u201cthe Budget and a bill for all of the proposed appropriations of the Budget classified in such detail as he shall determine or as may be prescribed by law.\u201d Art. Ill, \u00a7 52(5). The early budget bills reflected the practice of the Governor to submit a detailed and itemized budget bill. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ch. 487 of the Acts of 1920; Ch. 654 of the Acts of 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">In 1951, the Commission on Administrative Organization of the State, also known as the \u201cSobeloff Commission\u201d after the name of its chairman, recommended the implementation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u201cprogram\u201d budget system. By Ch. 20 of the Acts of 1952, ratified by the voters on November 4,1952, Art. Ill, \u00a7 52, was amended to allow the Governor greater flexibility in determining the form of the budget bill. Section 52(4) was amended to excise the requirement that the budget estimates submitted by the Governor be \u201citemized\u201d and to allow the Governor to submit a budget \u201cin such form and detail as the Governor shall determine ...\u201d Ch. 20 of the Acts of 1952 also amended \u00a7 52(5) to provided that the Governor may determine the \u201cform and detail\u201d of the budget bill. These changes do not mandate a specific form or level of detail in the budget and budget bill but allow the Governor the flexibility to determine the form and level of detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">By Ch. 377 of the Acts of 1986, title seven, subtitle two of the State Finance and Procurement Article was amended \u201c[f]or the purpose of conforming the State Finance and Procurement Article to certain constitutional provisions and current State budget practices ...\u201d The changes reflected the current practice, by which the Governor no longer submits itemized appropriations in the budget bill. Rather, budget bills in recent times have reflected \u201cprogram\u201d level detail.

The Medical Assistance State Only grant is part of the category \u201cMedical Care Provider Reimbursements.\u201d The Medical Assistance State Only grant, as well as every other grant in the general category of \u201cMedical Care Provider Reimbursements,\u201d are not listed in the Budget Bill, nor is there a sum of money listed for any of these items. Instead, the Budget Bill lists one sum for \u201cMedical Care Provider Reimbursements,\u201d and that sum is part of the total appropriation for the \u201cMedical Care Programs Administration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The funds for Medical Assistance State Only represent a small portion of the funds listed in the Budget Bill under \u201cMedical Care Provider Reimbursements.\u201d The category of \u201cMedical Care Provider Reimbursements\u201d represents a significant portion of the sum appropriated under the heading \u201cMedical Care Programs Administration.\u201d The elimination of the Medical Assistance State Only grant reduced the sum listed under the \u201cMedical Care Provider Reimbursements\u201d by less than one and one-half percent. Similarly, it reduced the sum listed as the total appropriation to the \u201cMedical Care Programs Administration\u201d by less than one and one-half per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>cent. Whether we assess the reduction in terms of the total appropriation to the \u201cMedical Care Programs Administration\u201d or in terms of the portion of that total appropriation listed under the category of \u201cMedical Care Providers Reimbursements,\u201d it is clear that the reduction did not exceed 25%. The action of the Governor and the Board of Public Works conformed to the requirements of law.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Section 7-213 provides a mechanism by which the Governor can fulfill his constitutional obligation to maintain a balanced budget and to avoid a deficit when the estimated revenues used in the budget bill are too high. The power of the Governor to reduce appropriations under \u00a7 7-213 is consistent with the power of the Governor in the budgetary process, and, as proven in 1933 and 1935 as well as in the 1990\u2019s, is \u201cnecessary ... to carry out\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the balanced budget requirement of Art.
