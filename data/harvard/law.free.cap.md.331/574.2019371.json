In May, 1991, he appointed a five-member advisory committee to assist him; the committee came to be known as the Governor\u2019s Redistricting Advisory Committee (GRAC).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The GRAC first met on May 30,1991 in Annapolis, where it adopted a schedule for the redistricting process and the attendant public hearings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 11, the Committee acknowledged the legal criteria which would constrain its decisions: equality of population between districts, minority representation, compactness, contiguity, and respect for natural boundaries and the boundaries of political subdivisions. These criteria stem from the mandates of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the federal Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. 1971, <em>et seq. </em>(1993), and Article III, \u00a7\u00a7 <em>2-4 </em>of the Maryland Constitution, which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">Section 2: The membership of the Senate shall consist of forty-seven (47) Senators. The membership of the House of Delegates shall consist of one hundred forty-one (141) Delegates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">Section 3: The State shall be divided by law into legislative districts for the election of members of the Senate and the House of Delegates. Each legislative district shall contain one (1) Senator and three (3) Delegates. Nothing herein shall prohibit the subdivision of any one or more of the legislative districts for the purpose of electing members of the House of Delegates into three (3) single-member delegate districts or one (1) single-member delegate district and one (1) multi-member delegate district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Section 4: Each legislative district shall consist of adjoining territory, be compact in form, and of substantially equal population. Due regard shall be given to natural boundaries and the boundaries of political subdivisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The GRAC also indicated it would keep several other redistricting factors in mind, namely, established precinct lines, communities of interest, existing district lines, and the possibility of subdistricting to further accommodate minority representation and the boundaries of political subdivisions. Importantly, the GRAC recognized, even before the redistricting process began, that the legal requirements \u201cmay foreclose a uniform application of [the non-legal] guidelines ..., and that the application of one or more of those guidelines may be precluded, in given situations, by the application of other guidelines.\u201d The Chairman of the GRAC also observed early in the process that while the redistricting procedure would not alter any actual borders of the political subdivisions, \u201cnew ... legislative districts will in some instances cross jurisdictional boundaries just as existing districts do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The GRAC then held a series of thirteen public hearings throughout June and July of 1991, in Salisbury, Easton, Centreville, Annapolis, Bel Air, Towson, Columbia, Frederick, Hancock, Rockville, Hyattsville, Hughesville, and Baltimore. The public was invited to attend these hearings through press releases in local newspapers and was encouraged to comment on the redistricting process and to submit alternative districting plans. At each hearing, every attendee received a packet of materials which included: (1) the 1990 census results for each of the existing legislative districts; (2) the redistricting and hearing schedules; (3) the legal and non-legal criteria bearing on the redistricting process; (4) background information concerning the 1990 census results and data sources useful for developing alternative districting plans; and (5) guidelines for the submission of alternative plans. Governor Schaefer attended the July 16 meeting in Hyattsville.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The public responded enthusiastically to the GRAC\u2019s open invitation to participate in the redistricting process. Approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>mately three hundred people testified in the 1991 summer hearings. Many other citizens submitted written testimony to the GRAC. The Committee and its staff at the Maryland Office of Planning also reviewed over forty separate districting plans submitted by the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The GRAC worked throughout the fall, keeping Governor Schaefer constantly apprised of its progress. Ronald M. Kreitner, director of the Planning Office, met with the Governor no fewer than eleven times throughout late 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">On November 19, the GRAC chairman announced that, in the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, the federal Voting Rights Act required the creation of a new minority district along the Liberty Road corridor in western Baltimore City and southwestern Baltimore County. The GRAC asked the House and Senate delegations from both of those jurisdictions to work together and submit their preferred plan for the region\u2019s districts, taking account of the new minority district.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">On December 2, 1991, the GRAC released its proposed redistricting plan to the public. It rescheduled its final public hearing from December 5 to December 10, at which the public was asked to comment on the plan. In his opening remarks at the December 10 hearing, the GRAC Chairman discussed the Committee\u2019s considerations in developing the plan. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMm\">Paramount to our recommendations is the function of a state legislature. It is to represent people. And a plan for legislative districts is to provide people with a fair system of representation. State legislative districts are not substitute or a proxy for local government. The interest of state policy transcends that of local government and local political jurisdictions. As such, state legislative districts are drawn to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">1) Represent people fairly\u2014Legislative districts fall within 5 percent of the ideal population of 101,733.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>2) To be compact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">3) To provide minority voters the opportunity to elect candidates of their choosing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">4) Recognize communities of interest\u2014where districts cross local jurisdictional lines and to group communities that share interests (interests such as shopping centers, utility systems, transportation, and other community facilities).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">5) To keep municipalities whole where possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">6) To support regional interests through the intra-regional sharing of districts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Following the Chairman\u2019s opening remarks, approximately 100 people spoke on the proposed plan, including numerous members of the General Assembly as well as private citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">After making several changes to the plan in light of testimony from the December 10 hearing, the GRAC submitted the plan to the Governor on December 17. The Governor, in turn, submitted the plan to the General Assembly on January 8, 1992, in accordance with Article III, \u00a7 5 of the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Another provision of \u00a7 5 allows the General Assembly to adopt a redistricting plan of its own, but if it fails to do so by the 45th day of its regular session in the second year after the census, the Governor\u2019s plan becomes law. Early in 1992, the General Assembly did consider several alternative redistricting schemes, but none passed. On February 23, Governor Schaefer\u2019s plan became law.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">This development, predictably, left a number of people dissatisfied. Ten of them originally stepped forward to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>plain to this Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They availed themselves of our review under yet another provision of Article III, \u00a7 5 which specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHW\">Upon petition of any registered voter, the Court of Appeals shall have original jurisdiction to review the legislative districting of the State and may grant appropriate relief, if it finds that the districting of the State is not consistent with requirements of either the Constitution of the United States of America, or the Constitution of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">In Miscellaneous No. 37, September Term 1991, Theodore Levin, a Baltimore County resident and a member of the House of Delegates, launched two primary attacks on the Governor\u2019s redistricting plan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> First, Levin argued that the GRAC failed to provide adequate public notice of the redistricting hearings, in violation of the constitutional provision, quoted earlier, that the Governor must prepare a plan \u201cafter public hearings.\u201d Second, Levin claimed that the Governor\u2019s plan created districts which improperly crossed the Baltimore City/Baltimore County boundary, in violation of the constitutional provision, quoted earlier, that \u201c[d]ue regard shall be given to ... the boundaries of political subdivisions.\u201d Three other petitioners, all Baltimore County residents whom Levin represented as counsel, joined Levin\u2019s arguments. They were: Bruce Harris, in Miscellaneous No. 1, Robert Goldman, in Miscellaneous No. 5, and Joseph DiPierto, in Miscellaneous No. 6 (hereinafter subsumed in all references to \u201cLevin\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In Miscellaneous No. 16, Richard Rynd, another Baltimore County resident and member of the House of Delegates, echoed Levin\u2019s attacks on the Governor\u2019s plan and added several of his own. In addition to alleging \u201cdue regard\u201d violations and inadequate notice of the public hearings, Rynd charged that the plan failed to create districts of \u201csubstantially equal population,\u201d that it violated the federal Voting Rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Act, and that it resorted to impermissible partisan gerrymandering.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">In Miscellaneous No. 17, William Skinner and Sidney Weiner, Montgomery County residents, reiterated the charge that the Governor\u2019s redistricting plan violates the \u201cdue regard\u201d provision, and that the plan creates districts of impermissibly unequal population. Skinner and Weiner further contended that the plan violates their First Amendment rights, and that it does not comprehensibly describe the districts it establishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Finally, in Miscellaneous No. 19, Dana Dembrow, a member of the House of Delegates from Montgomery County, joined other petitioners in arguing that the Governor\u2019s redistricting plan violates the \u201cdue regard\u201d provision, improperly deviates from population equality, contravenes the Voting Rights Act, and engages in unlawful partisan gerrymandering. Dembrow also asserted that certain districts in the plan violate the constitutional requirement that districts \u201cbe compact in form.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">To deal with these various petitions, we appointed Marvin H. Smith, a retired judge of this Court, as a Special Master to receive evidence, hear arguments, and make a report to serve as the basis for our review. Throughout the fall of 1992, the Special Master received stipulations of fact and memoranda of law from the petitioners and from the State. On December 14 and 18, the Special Master heard oral argument from all parties. In a thorough report dated February 2, 1993, he organized the petitioners\u2019 contentions into ten distinct issues, evaluating each one in turn. He found no merit in any of the petitioners\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">In accordance with guidelines we issued, all but one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>petitioners filed exceptions to the Special Master\u2019s report.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Eight issues remain before this Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> From the procedural to the substantive, they are: (1) notice of public hearings; (2) district descriptions; (3) compactness; (4) population equality; (5) First Amendment; (6) Voting Rights Act; (7) partisan gerrymandering; and (8) due regard for boundaries.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">(1) Notice of public hearings</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Petitioners Levin and Rynd take exception to the Special Master\u2019s finding that the GRAC provided proper public notice of the redistricting hearings. They argue that the GRAC violated the constitutional requirement that the Governor prepare a redistricting plan \u201cafter public hearings\u201d in that the public was not provided with adequate notice of the scheduled hearings. Levin charges that though there was \u201cample opportunity\u201d for public input at the summer hearings in 1991, those hearings were an \u201cempty gesture\u201d because the GRAC provided no notice that it was contemplating a scheme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>of regional representation in which districts might cross jurisdictional boundaries. Levin also claims that the GRAC substantially altered the plan in a late \u201cflurry of activity\u201d without adequately publicizing its endeavors. Finally, Levin attacks the GRAC\u2019s decision to advertise the redistricting hearings through press releases to local newspapers instead of through paid advertising notices in newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Rynd challenges the GRAC\u2019s failure to announce the factors it would consider in developing the plan in advance of the final hearing on December 10. He also asserts that notice of the December 10 hearing was not published far enough before the hearing, and he joins Levin\u2019s claim that the hearing was not announced in proper fora. Lastly, Rynd says that the Governor was obliged to attend the .final hearing, which he failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We agree with the Special Master that there is no merit in any of these claims. On July 2, 1991, the GRAC held a redistricting hearing in Towson for the benefit of residents of Baltimore County, the political subdivision from which both Levin and Rynd were elected. In the ten days preceding the hearing, the GRAC sent press releases to the Baltimore <em>Sun </em>for publication on five separate dates, to the Baltimore <em>Evening Sun </em>for publication on six dates, and to the <em>Afro-American </em>for one date. The GRAC also published notice of the hearing in the calendar of the Department of Legislative Reference. This quantity of publication was typical for all the summer 1991 hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The final hearing on December 10 was publicized twice in both the Baltimore <em>Sun </em>and Department of Legislative Reference calendar and once each in the Baltimore <em>Evening Sun </em>and <em>Sunday Sun, </em>the Annapolis <em>Capital, </em>the Prince George\u2019s <em>Journal, </em>the <em>Jeffersonian, </em>the Towson <em>Times, </em>and the Washington <em>Post. </em>With this degree of publication, and considering that, as mentioned earlier, some three hundred people spoke during the summer hearings and another hundred at the final hearing, we cannot conclude that notice of the redistricting hearings was generally inadequate. We also observe that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>though Levin and Rynd complain that notice of the redistricting hearings was insufficient, both petitioners attended, and spoke at, the Baltimore County hearing on July 2, 1991. Levin also attended and spoke at the final hearing on December 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">As to the petitioners\u2019 specific claims, both Levin and Rynd argue that the GRAC should have published notice of the hearings in legal periodicals or legal columns of newspapers. But we agree with the Special Master that \u201cthe general public is much more likely to read and to comprehend\u201d general newspaper announcements than legal advertisements. Levin responds that \u201cpublication by press release depends upon the good will of the news media as to whether the matter will even be published.\u201d Even if this is true, in this case the media <em>did </em>provide ample notice of the redistricting hearings. Undoubtedly, the newspaper notice in this case reached at least as many people as legal advertisements would have reached. Thus, the petitioners cannot legitimately complain that the substitution of press releases for legal advertisements significantly eroded public notice in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Levin maintains that the GRAC did not provide proper notice of its last-minute activities. In this regard, we note that Governor Schaefer charged the GRAC with, first, conducting public redistricting hearings and, second, developing a plan. The GRAC did just that. Levin seems to imply that the GRAC should have actually drafted the plan in a public forum, but of course the cacophony of opinion would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>precluded significant progress. In what Levin terms a \u201cflurry of activity,\u201d two events occurred late in the fall of 1991: the Attorney General informed the GRAC that the Voting Rights Act mandated the creation of a minority district in west Baltimore City/Baltimore County; then, a fortnight later, the GRAC released the plan. It is unclear what public notice the GRAC could have provided\u2014or what Levin sought\u2014during its final weeks of preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Rynd argues, similarly, that the GRAC did not announce its final public hearing far enough in advance. Rynd cites this Court\u2019s order on July 31, 1973, in which we struck down a redistricting plan for failure to comply with the public hearings requirement. <em>See In re Legislative Districting, </em>271 Md. 320, 317 A.2d 477 (1974). In that case, however, the public was invited to offer its views at only one redistricting hearing, which was announced in a solitary press release two days earlier. Here, by contrast, there were fourteen public hearings in all, widely announced through numerous press releases. The GRAC postponed the final public hearing for five days to ensure ample time for public assimilation of its proposal, then released that proposal eight days before the rescheduled hearing. Nearly a hundred people spoke at that hearing, and more presumably attended. These facts subvert Rynd\u2019s claim that the GRAC provided inadequate advance notice of its final public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Levin denounces the public redistricting hearings as generally unsatisfactory because the GRAC failed to announce that it was considering a scheme of regional representation, in which some legislative districts might cross jurisdictional boundaries. This claim is unfounded, for, as mentioned earlier, the GRAC\u2019s chairman announced shortly after the hearings began that \u201cnew .... legislative districts will in some instance cross jurisdictional boundaries just as existing districts do.\u201d Moreover, testimony at the Baltimore County hearing referred to the possibility of districts crossing boundary lines, and Levin himself proposed a district that would cross the Baltimore City/Baltimore County line to preserve the Orthodox Jewish community in one district.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Rynd argues that the GRAC undermined proper notice of the redistricting hearings by neglecting to foretell the factors it would consider in developing the plan, which the GRAC chairman articulated at the final hearing. This too is incorrect. As explained earlier, the GRAC published the legal and non-legal criteria which would guide its decisions well in advance of even the first redistricting hearing, and these criteria encompassed the factors which the GRAC listed on December 10 as integral to the development of the plan. The first four factors announced on December 10 were explicitly mentioned in the guidelines published on June 11, and the last two\u2014the goals of keeping municipalities whole and supporting regional interests\u2014were logically subsumed within the June 11 guidelines of respecting the boundaries of political subdivisions and recognizing communities of interest. Without yet assessing the legitimacy of these considerations, we believe the GRAC gave ample public notice of them; at most, Rynd is quibbling with the GRAC\u2019s usage of different phrases to describe the redistricting factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Finally, Rynd argues that the Governor was obliged to attend the final hearing on December 10. He was not. There is no statutory or constitutional provision spelling out the proximity the Governor must maintain to the redistricting process; we believe the Governor\u2019s attending one meeting and remaining closely apprised of the GRAC\u2019s work on the redistricting plan was sufficient. As the Special Master eloquently observed, \u201cIn today\u2019s age it is simply necessary for the Governor to do many things through his agents, things which in an earlier, less busy, less harried generation, he might have done himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reject the petitioners\u2019 claims that the GRAC provided insufficient notice of the redistricting hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">(2) District descriptions</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Petitioners Skinner and Weiner contest the Special Master\u2019s finding that the Governor\u2019s redistricting plan de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>scribes the districts it creates in a manner comprehensible to the ordinary citizen. They contend that the plan\u2019s reference to precincts and census tracts and blocks to specify districts requires voters to assimilate too much information to determine district boundaries. Skinner and Weiner claim that the plan should refer to visible geographical features, and that \u201cif words cannot be used to describe boundaries, the simple solution ... would be for the Court of Appeals to ... publish the 47 maps setting forth the redistricting plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Skinner and Weiner cite no law specifying how districts are to be described, for indeed there is none. Article III, \u00a7 5 merely specifies that the Governor shall prepare a plan \u201csetting forth\u201d the boundaries of the districts, which the plan at issue here does. The Governor might reasonably prefer precinct and census references to actual geographical features in describing districts, for as legal creations those entities will not change before the next census, whereas natural or artificial landmarks may erode or succumb to development.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We agree with the Special Master that the Governor\u2019s plan adequately describes the districts it creates.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">(3) Compactness</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Petitioner Dembrow alleges that the 20th legislative district created by the Governor\u2019s plan is not compact.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Dembrow asserts that \u201cnew political boundaries [of the 20th\u2019 district] were skewed to such a degree that any observer would readily conclude a gerrymandered design upon first glimpse of a map. The district is anything but compact in form.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">We pondered the meaning of the compactness requirement in some detail in the 1982 redistricting case, which involved a number of compactness challenges. After surveying the views of other jurisdictions, we found that \u201cthe ideal of compactness, in geometric terms, is a circle, with the perimeter of a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>equidistant from its center.\u201d <em>In re Legislative Districting, supra, </em>299 Md. at 676, 475 A.2d 428. However, we recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">the compactness requirement must be applied in light of, and in harmony with, the other legitimate constraints which interact with and operate upon the constitutional mandate that districts be compact in form. Thus, it cannot ordinarily be determined by a mere visual examination of an electoral map whether the compactness requirement has been violated \u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 680, 475 A.2d 428. We concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A001\">it is not the province of the judiciary to strike down a district as being noncompact simply because a more geometrically compact district might have been drawn.... [T]he function of the courts is limited to assessing whether the principles underlying the compactness and other constitutional requirements have been fairly considered and applied in view of all relevant considerations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 688, 475 A.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">These principles indicate that there is no merit in Dem-brow\u2019s suggestion that district 20 is not compact. He has not shown, nor is there evidence of, any unconstitutional considerations factoring into the creation of district 20. Dembrow baldly alleges that district 20 was drawn to include certain potential candidates and to exclude others, but he offers no proof that such considerations led to its peculiar configuration. Just as plausibly, district 20 assumed an unusual shape in order to comply with the various other legal requirements for districts, such as population equality and due regard for political boundaries.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Moreover, we note that district 20 is confined entirely to the southeastern corner of Montgomery County. Its shape, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>unusual, is no more odd than the rest of the districts in Montgomery County, or, indeed, in the whole State. In other words, contrary to Dembrow\u2019s assertion, \u201cupon first glimpse of a map\u201d district 20 does not appear any more \u201cskewed\u201d or \u201cgerrymandered\u201d than any of the other districts. Also, district 20 under the Governor\u2019s plan is very similar in appearance to the former district 20, which survived a compactness challenge in the 1982 case. <em>In re Legislative Districting, supra, </em>299 Md. 658, 475 A.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">We agree with the Special Master that district 20 satisfies the constitutional compactness requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">(4) Population equality</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Petitioners Dembrow and Skinner/Weiner object to the Special Master\u2019s finding that the Governor\u2019s plan complies with federal and state constitutional requirements that districts be of equal population. Dembrow asserts that even though the population disparities between districts do not <em>prima facie </em>invalidate the Governor\u2019s plan under applicable Supreme Court precedent, the plan is nonetheless impermissible because the districts could have been made more equal. Skinner and Weiner argue that the plan is not even <em>prima facie </em>valid under the federal constitution, and that it also violates the state constitution. The Special Master found no merit in these claims, and neither do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">\n<em>(a) The Federal Constitution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">After finding the general issue of legislative reapportionment justiciable in <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962), the Supreme Court first announced the \u201cone person, one vote\u201d principle in <em>Gray v. Sanders, </em>372 U.S. 368, 83 S.Ct. 801, 9 L.Ed.2d 821 (1963). This principle, which is rooted in the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, prevents states from diluting any citizens\u2019 political power by assigning them fewer legislative representatives <em>per capita </em>than other citizens in the state. The one person, one vote principle, we noted in 1982, \u201cis the <em>sine qua non </em>of fair representation, assuring that the vote of any citizen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>is approximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen in the State.\u201d <em>In re Legislative Districting, supra, 299 </em>Md. at 672, 475 A.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s major explication of the one person, one vote principle as it applies to the apportionment of state legislatures came in <em>Reynolds v. Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964). There, the Court held that the principle requires a state to \u201cmake an honest and good faith effort to construct districts, in both houses of its legislature, as nearly of equal population as is practicable.\u201d 377 U.S. at 577, 84 S.Ct. at 1390. The Court tempered its decision, however, by allowing that \u201csomewhat more flexibility may ... be constitutionally permissible with respect to state legislative apportionment than in congressional districting.\u201d 377 U.S. at 578, 84 S.Ct. at 1390. Chief Justice Warren explained for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">A State may legitimately desire to maintain the integrity of various political subdivisions, insofar as possible, and provide for compact districts of contiguous territory in designing a legislative apportionment scheme.... So long as divergences are based on legitimate considerations incident to the effectuation of a rational state policy, some deviations from the equal-population principle are constitutionally permissible with respect to the apportionment of seats in either or both houses of a bicameral state legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">377 U.S. at 578-79, 84 S.Ct. at 1390.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">In subsequent cases, the Supreme Court affirmed and refined the rule that states have greater latitude in apportioning their own legislatures than their allotted federal congressional districts. In <em>Mahan v. Howell, </em>410 U.S. 315, 93 S.Ct. 979, 35 L.Ed.2d 320 (1973), the Court upheld a 16.4% deviation from population equality in the Virginia House of Delegates, based on that State\u2019s policy of maintaining the integrity of political subdivision boundaries. The Court stated, \u201cwhile [a 16.4% deviation] may well approach tolerable limits, we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>believe it exceeds them.\u201d 410 U.S. at 329, 93 S.Ct. at 987.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Two months later, in <em>Gaffney v. Cummings, </em>412 U.S. 735, 93 S.Ct. 2321, 37 L.Ed.2d 298 (1973), the Court decided that \u201cminor deviations from mathematical equality among state legislative districts are insufficient to make out a prima facie case of invidious discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment so as to require justification by the State.\u201d 412 U.S. at 745, 93 S.Ct. at 2327.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">A decade later, in <em>Brown v. Thomson, </em>462 U.S. 835, 103 S.Ct. 2690, 77 L.Ed.2d 214 (1983), the Court held that maximum deviations of under 10% fall within the category of \u201cminor deviations\u201d that do not require justification by the state. In a companion case, <em>Karcher v. Daggett, </em>462 U.S. 725, 103 S.Ct. 2653, 77 L.Ed.2d 133 (1983), the Court listed some of the permissible rationales which may justify deviation from pure population equality in legislative districts, \u201cfor instance, making districts compact, respecting municipal boundaries, preserving the cores of prior districts, and avoiding contests between incumbent Representatives.\u201d 462 U.S. at 740, 103 S.Ct. at 2663. Recently, the Court reaffirmed the \u201c10% rule\u201d it announced in <em>Brown. Voinovich v. Quilter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1149, 122 L.Ed.2d 500 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">In the instant case, as noted earlier, the 1990 census established that Maryland has 4,781,468 inhabitants. Each of the 47 legislative districts, therefore, should ideally contain 101,-733 residents. It is uncontested that the smallest district in the Governor\u2019s plan is district 40, which contains 96,682 people, and that the largest is district 30, which encompasses 106,690 persons. The population disparity between these districts\u201410,008 people\u2014is 9.84% of the ideal district of 101,-733 persons. Thus, the Governor\u2019s plan has a maximum deviation from population equality of less than 10%; therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>under the plain language of the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings, it satisfies the federal constitutional requirement of one person, one vote. The population disparities in the Governor\u2019s plan are sufficiently minor so as not to require justification by the State.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Skinner and Weiner dispute this analysis. They attempt to distinguish the cases creating the \u201c10% rule\u201d on factual grounds. They argue that the plan does not adhere to the <em>Reynolds </em>requirement that States must \u201cmake and honest and good faith effort to construct districts ... as nearly of equal population as is practicable.\u201d 377 U.S. at 577, 84 S.Ct. at 1390. But the Supreme Court has unequivocally built a 10% degree of flexibility into the one person, one vote requirement so that states can accommodate important concerns in reapportioning their legislatures. The Governor\u2019s plan undeniably remains within that degree of flexibility, and is therefore valid under federal equal protection principles.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Dembrow asserts that, though the Supreme Court\u2019s cases establish that a maximum deviation under 10% does not make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of voting discrimination, we must examine the deviations in the Governor\u2019s plan for possible equal protection violations anyway. We do not so read the Court\u2019s rulings. <em>Brown, supra, </em>specifies that deviations under 10% do not ordinarily require justification by the State. 462 U.S. at 842, 103 S.Ct. at 2695-96. Dembrow\u2019s assertion that the districts could have been made more equal is simply irrelevant. The Governor\u2019s plan passes federal constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Before turning to the state constitution, however, both Dembrow and Skinner/Weiner make an additional claim that must be addressed. They argue that the Governor\u2019s plan intentionally created population disparities between districts to discriminate against certain regions in the State and in favor of others. Specifically, they point out that of the ten smallest districts in the Governor\u2019s plan (those with fewer than 97,000 persons), eight he either wholly or partly in Baltimore City, and a ninth lies close by in Baltimore County. They assert that even though the population of Baltimore City is smaller than that of Montgomery County, the City \u201ccontrols\u201d eight senators, while Montgomery County only \u201ccontrols\u201d seven. This leads the petitioners to allege that the Governor\u2019s plan intentionally deviates from population equality to discriminate against Montgomery County and in favor of Baltimore City. Skinner and Weiner present a statistical analysis to this effect by petitioner Weiner, a professional statistician.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We agree with the petitioners that the Governor\u2019s plan appears to favor Baltimore City. By packing that region with districts containing barely more than the minimum constitutionally permissible population, the Governor\u2019s plan appears to systematically afford the City the maximum number of representatives in the legislature as its population can support. However, we are not prepared to say that this favorable result for the City rises to the level of a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>By its very name, the one person, one vote principle affords the right of equal representation to persons as opposed to regions. As the Special Master observed, \u201csince the time of <em>Reynolds </em>..., it is <em>people, </em>not <em>territory, </em>which are to be represented in the General Assembly.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) As long as the population disparities between legislative districts adhere to the requirements of <em>Reynolds </em>and its <em>progeny\u2014i.e. </em>as long as maximum deviations are under 10%\u2014 disparities in the number of representatives from the various regions or political subdivisions in the State are <em>prima facie </em>immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Possibly, there may be room under <em>Reynolds </em>and its progeny for a plaintiff to overcome the \u201c10% rule,\u201d if the plaintiff can present compelling evidence that the drafters of the plan ignored all the legitimate reasons for population disparities and created the deviations <em>solely </em>to benefit certain regions at the expense of others.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We need not consider this question, because such is not the case here. Petitioners offer no evidence, other than the Governor\u2019s plan itself, that the plan discriminates against certain regions. While the plan does appear to favor Baltimore City, the petitioners cannot demonstrate that the disparities in the plan did not result from the GRAC\u2019s effort to accommodate legitimate policy concerns in redistricting.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">More importantly, the petitioners cannot show that the Governor\u2019s plan unconstitutionally harms other regions in favoring the City. The petitioners claim that the plan discriminates against Montgomery County, but this is not true. Of the ten largest districts in the plan (those with more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>105,695 people), only one lies in Montgomery County; the rest are scattered throughout the State. With a population of 757,027 people, Montgomery County should expect to have 7.44 senators. In fact, the County will control almost precisely that number; under the plan, Montgomery County residents will elect 7 senators alone and will share an eighth with Howard County.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Had the petitioners shown that the GRAC\u2019s only concern in creating population deviations in the Governor\u2019s plan was to promote the interests of Baltimore City, a different result might obtain.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Had the plan systematically discriminated against one region in favoring the City, a different result might also obtain. As it is, the Governor\u2019s plan complies with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">\n<em>(b) The State Constitution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Skinner and Weiner also challenge the Special Master\u2019s finding that the Governor\u2019s plan does not violate the state constitutional requirement that districts be \u201cof substantially equal population.\u201d Dembrow, impliedly, does likewise, when he suggests that \u201c[i]t is time for the Maryland Court of Appeals to review the 10% rule, and to impose stricter standards for legislative equalization in our state.\u201d We have previously reserved the question whether the state constitution imposes a tougher standard of population equality than the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>In re Legislative Districting, supra, </em>299 Md. at 683, n. 17, 475 A.2d 428. We must address it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">As the Special Master explained, the \u201csubstantially equal population\u201d language of Article III, \u00a7 4, which was adopted in 1972, was derived from identical language in \u00a7 3.04 of the proposed Maryland Constitution of 1968. The discussions in the Constitutional Convention of 1967-68 which led to the development of \u00a7 3.04 are therefore relevant in interpreting the \u201csubstantially equal\u201d phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Initially, the Constitutional Convention Commission proposed in its draft constitution that legislative districts \u201cshall be as nearly equal as practicable.\u201d However, the Committee on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the Legislative Branch substituted the phrase \u201csubstantially equal\u201d when it brought the provision to the floor of the Convention. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\">The Constitutional Convention Commission draft uses the language \u201cas nearly equal as practicable.\u201d This language might be construed instead to mean \u201cas equal as possible.\u201d Any language that might be construed as requiring districts to be \u201cas nearly equal as possible\u201d should be avoided. The reason is that perfect arithmetic equality <em>is </em>possible\u2014all the way down to percentage deviations of less than one percent. Under such a standard many reasonable and \u201csubstantially equal\u201d plans could be challenged and upset merely by showing that a further \u201ctinker\u201d could reduce the arithmetic deviation by an additional percentage point or two. Such nit-picking invalidations of carefully devised plans have occurred in a number of states where lower courts have used the \u201cas nearly equal as possible\u201d arithmetic standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">To avoid this possibility, the Committee recommends that the phrase \u201csubstantially equal\u201d be used instead of \u201cas nearly equal as practicable\u201d in the new Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">It should be kept clearly in mind, however, that the Committee on the Legislative Branch intends \u201csubstantially equal\u201d to mean that \u201cthe difference between the populations of the largest and smallest districts in the State shall not exceed fifteen percent of the mean population of all districts.\u201d The committee intends that differences greater than fifteen percent should be tolerated only in those few rare and exceptional cases where natural boundaries or existing political subdivision lines make variance from the normal fifteen percent standard reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Committee Memorandum LB at 2-3 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">This passage indicates that the original drafters of the \u201csubstantially equal population\u201d language in the Maryland Constitution contemplated that the district planners should have a 15% degree of flexibility from perfect population equality. While we do not necessarily embrace such a \u201c15% rule\u201d under the Maryland Constitution, we do hold that Article III, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\u00a7 4 does not impose a stricter standard for population equality than the 10% rule imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">In <em>Reynolds, </em>the Supreme Court instructed states to construct their legislative districts \u201cas nearly of equal population as is practicable.\u201d 377 U.S. at 577, 84 S.Ct. at 1390. Then, without rejecting that standard, the Court built a 10% degree of flexibility into it. By contrast, the Maryland Constitution explicitly rejected the \u201cas nearly equal as practicable\u201d formulation in favor of the looser \u201csubstantially equal\u201d provision. We will not now hold that the looser provision allows less flexibility than the tighter one which Maryland rejected. Nor do we believe that the drafters of the Maryland Constitution intended to forfeit the flexibility which the <em>Reynolds </em>Court afforded the states for the purpose of accommodating important redistricting concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">We agree with the Special Master that the Governor\u2019s plan satisfies both the federal and state constitutional requirements as to population equality.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">(5) First Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Skinner and Weiner claim that the population disparities among the legislative districts in the Governor\u2019s plan also violate their First Amendment right to freedom of speech. They argue that by assigning them fewer representatives per resident than other areas, the Governor\u2019s plan dilutes their vote\u2014and hence their \u201cpolitical expression\u201d\u2014relative to other Maryland citizens. The Special Master rejected this assertion \u201cas simply another way of framing the contentions under the 14th Amendment\u201d with regard to population equality. The Special Master was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">For nearly thirty years now since <em>Reynolds </em>the Supreme Court has regularly reiterated that the Fourteenth Amendment permits states, in districting their legislatures, to deviate from pure equality of population between districts in order to accommodate important state interests. Thus, we do not believe that the First Amendment has ever forbidden states that latitude. There is no case holding that the First Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>ment visits greater scrutiny upon a districting plan than the Fourteenth. Rather, the cases uniformly counsel the opposite. <em>See e.g. Anne Arundel County, supra, </em>781 F.Supp. at 401, <em>aff'd, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 2269, 119 L.Ed.2d 197 <em>Badham v.

Finlay, </em>664 F.2d 913, 927-28 (4th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">There is no merit in petitioners\u2019 First Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">(6) Voting Rights Act</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Petitioners Dembrow and Rynd contend that the Governor\u2019s redistricting plan runs afoul of the federal Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1971,1973 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Dembrow argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">one or more single-member districts could be formed in the southeastern portion of Montgomery County in which Caucasians could constitute less than a majority of the total census counts, thereby making it easier and more attractive for minority candidates of Asian, African-American or Hispanic extraction fairly and fully to compete for public office in the state legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">Rynd asserts that several \u201cminority\u201d districts in the Governor\u2019s plan do not in fact contain sufficiently large minority populations to ensure the election of minority representatives. Rynd also laments the fact that the Governor\u2019s plan did not create more minority seats in Baltimore City. The Special Master rejected these claims. We do too.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">In an effort to eradicate persistent assaults, on the ability of minorities to vote, Congress enacted the sweeping Voting Rights Act of 1965. Congress\u2019 goal was to finally and firmly enforce the Fifteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that \u201c[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">The Voting Rights Act has two main provisions. Section 2 proscribes states and their subdivisions from enforcing any qualification, prerequisite, or practice on the right to vote which undermines minority voting strength. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973. Section 5 prevents certain states and subdivisions from <em>changing </em>their election laws in a manner detrimentally affecting minority voting power. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c. Thus, \u00a7 5 applies only to certain \u201ccovered\u201d jurisdictions having a history of discrimination, which must \u201cpreclear\u201d any changes in their election laws with either the Attorney General or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Since neither Maryland nor any of its subdivisions is a covered jurisdiction, <em>see </em>the appendix to 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 51 (1990), we deal here only with \u00a7 2 of the Act. As originally adopted, \u00a7 2 provided in full: \u201cNo voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\u201d This language, which mirrored the Fifteenth Amendment, did not appear to reach state and local practices having only an <em>unintended </em>detrimental impact on minority voting ability. However, the Supreme Court in <em>White v. Regester, </em>412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), held that practices which, in the totality of the circumstances, infringed minority electoral participation and success could not survive review under either the Fifteenth Amendment or the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth. Lower federal courts interpreted this to mean that, to prevail under the Voting Rights Act, a minority need only show that the challenged practice or system had a discriminatory <em>effect </em>on minority voting strength. <em>See e.g. Zimmer v. McKeithen, </em>485 F.2d 1297 (5th Cir.1973) (en banc), <em>aff'd sub nom. East Carroll Parish School Board v. Marshall, </em>424 U.S. 636, 96 S.Ct. 1083, 47 L.Ed.2d 296 (1976) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">But in <em>Mobile v. Bolden, </em>446 U.S. 55, 100 S.Ct. 1490, 64 L.Ed.2d 47 (1980), the Supreme Court declared that <em>White </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>had actually required a showing of discriminatory <em>intent </em>to prevail in a \u00a7 2 claim. This ruling prompted Congress in 1982 to amend \u00a7 2 to make it conform to the \u201ceffects\u201d test that had been widely understood as the law in the <em>pre-Bolden </em>period. Thus, \u00a7 2 now prohibits any practice \u201cwhich <em>results </em>in a denial or abridgement of\u2019 minority voting rights, and a new subsection (b) codifies the original connotation of <em>White </em>that a minority need only show, in the <em>totality </em>of the circumstances, that it has less opportunity for electoral participation and success in order to establish a Voting Rights Act violation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The Supreme Court delivered its major exegesis of the amended \u00a7 2 in <em>Thornburg v. Gingles, </em>478 U.S. 30, 106 S.Ct. 2752, 92 L.Ed.2d 25 (1986). In <em>Gingles, </em>the Court found that the important question in Voting Rights actions \u201cis whether \u2018as a result of the challenged practice or structure plaintiffs do not have an equal opportunity to participate in the political processes and to elect candidates of their choice.\u2019 \u201d 478 U.S. at 44, 106 S.Ct. at 2763, quoting the Senate Judiciary Committee majority Report accompanying the \u00a7 2 amendments (S.Rep.) at 28. To answer this question, courts must look to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201cobjective factors,\u201d including but not.limited to those which the Senate deemed specifically probative of a \u00a7 2 violation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auq\">\u201c1. the extent of any history of official discrimination in the state or political subdivision that touched the right of the members of the minority group to register, to vote, or otherwise to participate in the democratic process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">\u201c2. the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is racially polarized;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">\u201c3. the extent to which the state or political subdivision has used unusually large election districts, majority vote requirements, anti-single shot provisions, or other voting practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">\u201c4. if there is a candidate slating process, whether the members of the minority group have been denied access to that process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">\u201c5. the extent to which members of the minority group in the state or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education, employment and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">\u201c6. whether political campaigns have been characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">\u201c7. the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\">\u201cAdditional factors that in some cases have had a probative value as part of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence to establish a violation are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-11\">whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the particularized needs of the members of the minority group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-12\">whether the policy underlying the state or political subdivision\u2019s use of such voting qualification, prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice or procedure is tenuous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">478 U.S. at 36-37, 106 S.Ct. at 2759, quoting S.Rep. at 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">Despite the number and flexibility of these \u201cSenate factors\u201d which could show a \u00a7 2 violation, the Court recognized three limits on the process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>First, electoral devices, such as at-large elections, may not be considered <em>per se </em>violative of \u00a7 2....

Third, the results test does not assume the existence of racial bloc voting; plaintiffs must prove it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avv\">478 U.S. at 46, 106 S.Ct. at 2764 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The Court then turned to the specific question of multimember districts. \u201cMultimember districts and at-large election schemes ... are not <em>per se </em>violative of minority voters\u2019 rights.\u201d 478 U.S. at 48, 106 S.Ct. at 2765. The Court found that multimember districts \u201cgenerally will not impede the ability of minority voters to elect representatives of their choice,\u201d except through the confluence of three specific factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">First, the minority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district.... Second, the minority group must be able to show that it is politically cohesive.... Third, the minority must be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it ... usually to defeat the minority\u2019s preferred candidate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">478 U.S. at 50-51, 106 S.Ct. at 2766.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Finally, the Court addressed the merits of the case before it and, except as to one district, affirmed the lower court\u2019s determination that several districts in a North Carolina reapportionment plan violated the Voting Rights Act. The Court has twice recently reaffirmed the principles it developed in <em>Gingles. Growe v. Emison, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1075, 122 L.Ed.2d 388 (1993); <em>Voinovich, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1149. In <em>Growe, </em>the Court held that a plaintiff must make the same three showings to challenge a single-member districting scheme as are necessary to challenge a multimember scheme. \u2014 U.S. at -, 113 S.Ct. at 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\"><em>Gingles </em>immediately disposes of Dembrow\u2019s claim. He argues that the Voting Rights Act mandates the creation of at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>least one minority single-member district in southeastern Montgomery County. He concedes, however, that in that region \u201cneither race nor racial polarization have contributed to previous elective outcomes, ... nor have the two disparate racial and cultural communities otherwise acted in the past as a single or unified political bloc.\u201d The effect of this concession is clear. As the foregoing discussion illustrates, <em>Gingles </em>requires\u2014both generally and in the specific context of multimember districts\u2014that plaintiffs in \u00a7 2 actions prove that the minority groups in question are politically cohesive and vote as a bloc. Dembrow, therefore, has failed to state even a <em>prima facie </em>violation of the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Rynd\u2019s claims, while more difficult, are also without merit. He says that the 10th and the 43rd districts in the Governor\u2019s plan are not viable minority districts because they contain insufficiently large black populations to create \u201csafe\u201d black seats. Rynd also urges that district 47A in the Governor\u2019s plan, a two-member district with a 32.6% black population, should have been subdivided to ensure at least one minority single-member district. Finally, Rynd complains generally that the Governor\u2019s plan does not create any single-member districts to promote minority representation in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The 10th district in the Governor\u2019s plan has a 62.8% black population, while the 43rd district is 57.9% black. Rynd maintains that these percentages are inadequate to assure minority predominance. He is mistaken. As a matter of law, there is no established minority population figure above 50% which is deemed to ensure a \u201csafe\u201d minority district. <em>United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, </em>430 U.S. 144, 162, 97 S.Ct. 996, 1008, 51 L.Ed.2d 229 (1977). Rather, the appropriate percentage will turn on minority voting patterns and cohesiveness. Federal courts have frequently ordered the creation of \u201cminority\u201d districts in which racial minorities constitute barely more than a majority of the population. <em>See e.g. McGhee v. Granville County, N.C., </em>860 F.2d 110 (4th Cir.1988) (51.8% black voting age population sufficient); <em>Jordan v. Winter, </em>604 F.Supp. 807 (N.D.Miss.1984), <em>aff'd, </em>469 U.S. 1002, 105 S.Ct. 416, 83 L.Ed.2d 343 (1984) (52.8% total black population <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>sufficient); <em>Smith v. Brunswick County, Va., Bd. of Sup\u2019rs, </em>984 F.2d 1393, 1401 (4th Cir.1993) (\u201cwhen a racial (or language) minority becomes the voting majority in a single-member district, it is empowered with the vote in that district\u201d); <em>Burton v. Sheheen, </em>793 F.Supp. 1329, 1354 (D.S.C.1992) (\u201ca district may be considered a black opportunity district if the percentage of the black voting age population is greater than 50 percent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Moreover, the 10th and 43rd districts are viable minority districts as a matter of fact. The 10th district is not a remnant of any existing legislative district; it is a wholly new creation, designed specifically to ensure regional compliance with the Voting Rights Act. As such, the 10th will have no white incumbent in the 1994 elections, improving the possibility that its minority residents will be able to elect a senator and delegates of their choice. The 43rd, meanwhile, contains two incumbent black delegates (one of whom currently plans to seek the senatorial seat), which increases the prospect of black representatives following the 1994 elections. <em>See Burton, supra, </em>793 F.Supp. at 1355 (presence of black incumbent enhances effectiveness of voting rights district). Also, a precinct analysis by the Planning Office shows that Jesse Jackson would have carried both the 10th and the 43rd districts in 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Rynd\u2019s complaints that district 47A, and the City generally, should have been subdistricted to ensure further minority representation also fail. As noted earlier, <em>Cingles </em>instructs that multi-member districts are not <em>per se </em>violative of the Voting Rights Act. 478 U.S. at 48, 106 S.Ct. at 2765. Rynd nevertheless insists that district 47A, a two-member district with a 32.6% black population, could have been subdivided to create a majority black single-member district, and that the Governor\u2019s plan fails to employ any single-member districts in Baltimore City to promote minority representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">However, as <em>Cingles </em>makes clear, Rynd must do more than simply allege that a minority district could have been created to establish a \u00a7 2 violation. Rynd must show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>32.6% black population in district 47A is sufficiently compact to form a majority in a single-member district, that it is politically cohesive, and that the white voters in district 47A vote sufficiently as a bloc to enable them to defeat the minority\u2019s preferred candidate. Rynd makes none of these showings, either with respect to district 47A or any other potential single-member districts in the City. The Voting Rights Act simply does not require a state to create every conceivable minority district. <em>Turner v. State of Ark., </em>784 F.Supp. 553, 573 (E.D.Ark.1991), <em>aff'd, </em>- U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 2296, 119 L.Ed.2d 220 (1992) (\u00a7 2 is not an affirmative action statute, and a state need not enact a districting plan that maximizes black political power or influence); <em>Burton, supra, </em>793 F.Supp. at 1362 (\u201c[District by district enhancement [of majority black districts] is not constitutionally mandated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">We agree with the Special Master that the Governor\u2019s plan does not violate the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">(7) Partisan gerrymandering</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Petitioners Rynd and Dembrow asserted before the Special Master that the Governor\u2019s plan engages in impermissible partisan gerrymandering. Rynd argued that district 9B in Baltimore County evinced such gerrymandering because, as a single-member district, it contains a slightly higher proportion of registered Democrats than district 9 as a whole. Dembrow argued that the plan gerrymandered districts in Montgomery County to protect certain incumbents and to harm the prospects of other potential candidates. The Special Master rejected these claims. So do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Before examining the petitioners\u2019 specific claims, we mention that general principles of legislative apportionment will usually cast doubt upon claims that a redistricting plan produces unfair political results. In <em>Gaffney v. Cummings, supra, </em>the Supreme Court observed that \u201c[politics and political considerations are inseparable from districting and apportionment .... The reality is that districting inevitably has and is intended to have substantial political consequences.\u201d 412 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>at 753, 93 S.Ct. at 2331. We have noted that \u201cthe <em>districting </em>process is a political exercise for determination by the legislature and not the judiciary.\u201d <em>In re Legislative Districting, supra, </em>299 Md. at 688, 475 A.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Dembrow says that the Governor\u2019s plan gerrymanders districts in Montgomery County to protect incumbents. In <em>Karcher v. Daggett, supra, </em>462 U.S. 725, 103 S.Ct. 2653, the Supreme Court specified that avoiding contests between incumbents is a permissible reason for states to deviate from creating districts with perfectly equal populations. <em>Id. </em>at 740, 103 S.Ct. at 2663. Obviously, it is therefore permissible for states to consider incumbents in crafting districts in the first place. Dembrow even concedes that \u201c[ijncumbent residency is a factor which may legitimately be considered in redistricting negotiations and plans.\u201d Thus, his claim that the Governor\u2019s plan constructs districts with a view toward protecting incumbents states no redressable wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Dembrow\u2019s and Rynd\u2019s assertions that the plan gerrymanders district 9 and several Montgomery County districts to undermine certain candidacies, while legally redressable, are without merit. On the same day it handed down <em>Gingles, </em>the Supreme Court issued its major explication of the question of political gerrymandering in <em>Davis v. Bandemer, </em>478 U.S. 109, 106 S.Ct. 2797, 92 L.Ed.2d 85 (1986). In <em>Davis, </em>only six justices found the question of partisan political gerrymandering to represent a justiciable controversy. Of these six, a four-justice plurality held that while the equal protection clause proscribes voting discrimination on the basis of political affiliation, plaintiffs must carry an extremely heavy burden to show a discriminatory effect. The Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHK\">[Ujnconstitutional discrimination occurs only when the electoral system is arranged in a manner that will consistently degrade a voter\u2019s or a group\u2019s influence on the political process as a whole.... [E]ven if a state legislature redistricts \"with the specific intention of disadvantaging one political party\u2019s election prospects, we do not believe that there has been an unconstitutional discrimination against members of that party unless the redistricting does in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>disadvantage it at the polls.... The mere lack of control of the General Assembly after a single election does not rise to the requisite level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">478 U.S. at 132, 139\u201440, 106 S.Ct. at 2810, 2814. The plurality\u2019s rationale for creating such a high threshold was that \u201ca court cannot presume ... that those who are elected will disregard the disproportionately underrepresented group.\u201d 478 U.S. at 132, 106 S.Ct. at 2810.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\"><em>Davis </em>quickly lays to rest the petitioners\u2019 gerrymandering claims. Neither Dembrow nor Rynd has come close to making the requisite showing that the districts in question will \u201cconsistently degrade\u201d one party\u2019s or group\u2019s electoral prospects. <em>Davis </em>establishes that, absent flagrant partisan abuse of the redistricting process, the political consequences of that process will remain in the hands of the legislature and not the judiciary. The petitioners\u2019 partisan gerrymandering claims lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">(8) Due regard for boundaries</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Lastly, all of the petitioners attack the Governor\u2019s plan as violative of the command in Article III, \u00a7 4 of the State Constitution that \u201c[d]ue regard shall be given to natural boundaries and the boundaries of political subdivisions.\u201d In various guises, the petitioners complain that too many districts in the Governor\u2019s plan breach the Baltimore City/Baltimore County boundary.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Some of the petitioners presented alternative districting plans to the Special Master which contained fewer breaches of the City/County border. The Special Mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>ter said that the \u201cdue regard\u201d question is \u201cby far the thorniest issue before the Court,\u201d but he proceeded to reject the petitioners\u2019 assertions. We agree with the Special Master\u2014 on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">We have not before had reason to consider extensively the \u201cdue regard\u201d provision, which arises exclusively under the State Constitution. In <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, the Supreme Court laid the foundation for Maryland\u2019s \u201cdue regard\u201d provision, and its counterpart provisions in other states, by allowing that attention to subdivision boundaries is a legitimate reason for states to deviate from creating districts with perfectly equal populations. The Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">A consideration that appears to be of more substance in justifying some deviations from population based represent\u00e1tion in state legislatures is that of insuring some voice to political subdivisions, as political subdivisions.... Local government entities are frequently charged with various responsibilities incident to the operation of state government. In many States much of the legislature\u2019s activity involves the enactment of so-called local legislation, directed only to the concerns of particular political subdivisions. And a State may legitimately desire to construct districts along political subdivision lines to deter the possibilities of gerrymandering.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">377 U.S. at 580-81, 84 S.Ct. at 1391.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">In the 1982 redistricting litigation, we offered another justification for Maryland\u2019s \u201cdue regard\u201d provision: \u201cto preserve those fixed and known features which enable voters to maintain an orientation to their own territorial areas.\u201d <em>In re Legislative Districting, supra, </em>299 Md. at 681, 475 A.2d 428. While we noted that \u201cthe \u2018due regard\u2019 requirement is of mandatory application,\u201d <em>Id., </em>we warned that \u201cby its very verbiage it would appear to the most fluid of the constitutional components outlined in \u00a7 4.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also cautioned that it is \u201ca plain fact\u201d that the \u00a7 4 requirements\u2014contiguity, compactness, substantially equal population, and \u201cdue regard\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>boundaries\u2014will \u201ctend to conflict in their practical application.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">In the instant case, five legislative districts in the Governor\u2019s plan\u20148, 10, 42, 46, and 47\u2014cross the Baltimore City/Baltimore County border. In districts 8 and 10, a majority of the population resides in Baltimore County, while the City dominates districts 42, 46, and 47. District 47, however, is subdistricted; 47A is a two-member district lying wholly within Baltimore City, while 47B is a single-member district wholly within the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">At the outset, we note that, contrary to the suggestions of some petitioners, the breaches of the City/County boundary in the Governor\u2019s plan do not manifestly harm the County. Of the five districts which cross the border, two favor the City, two favor the County, and the fifth, though it may favor the City, is subdistricted to assure that the County controls at least one delegate. Moreover, the County\u2019s population of 692,134 persons suggests that it should ideally contain 6.8 legislative districts. In fact, the County contains three districts completely (7, 9, and 11), the overwhelming majority of three more districts (6, 8, and 10), and one-third to one-half of three more districts (12A, 42, and 47B). A small portion of district 46 also spills over into Baltimore County. These figures indicate that the County will effectively control at least 6.8 legislative districts in the 1994 elections, if not more. All things considered, Baltimore County fared well under the Governor\u2019s redistricting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Nevertheless, the petitioners complain that the Governor\u2019s plan failed literally to heed the mandatory \u201cdue regard\u201d requirement by breaching the City/County boundary in so many places. They point to the opening remarks of the GRAC chairman at the final public hearing, when he announced that the GRAC had designed districts, <em>inter alia, </em>to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJT\">4) Recognize communities of interest\u2014where districts cross local jurisdictional lines and to group communities that share interests....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>6) To support regional interests through the intra-regional sharing of districts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">See Part I, <em>supra. </em>Petitioners argue emphatically that these considerations were improper, given our opinion in the 1982 litigation that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">[t]he [\u201cdue regard\u201d] provision does not, in our view, encompass protection for a concept as nebulous and unworkable as \u201ccommunities of interest,\u201d involving as it does concentrations of people sharing common interests. We think it apparent that the number of such communities is virtually unlimited and no reasonable standard could possibly be developed to afford them recognition in the formulation of districts within the required constitutional framework.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\"><em>In re Legislative Districting, supra, </em>299 Md. at 692-93, 475 A.2d 428. Petitioners assert that the chairman\u2019s comments indicate that the GRAC deliberately jettisoned the mandatory \u201cdue regard\u201d provision in favor of improper \u201ccommunities of interest\u201d and \u201cregional interests\u201d criteria. Rynd calls the chairman\u2019s comments a \u201csmoking gun,\u201d and says that \u201cdue regard\u201d is the issue to which all others in this case are subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">We agree that the GRAC appears to have relied to some extent on improper non-legal criteria in formulating the City/Baltimore County region of the Governor\u2019s plan. We explicitly stated in 1982 that \u201ccommunities of interest\u201d are an unworkable basis on which to apportion districts. While the Governor\u2019s plan enjoys a \u201cpresumption of validity,\u201d <em>In re Legislative Districting, </em>299 Md. at 688, 475 A.2d 428, that presumption may be overcome when compelling evidence demonstrates that the plan has subordinated mandatory constitutional requirements to substantial improper alternative considerations. Here, the GRAC chairman publicly announced that the GRAC created districts to \u201ccross local jurisdiction lines and to group communities that share interests,\u201d thereby possibly diluting the full application of the \u201cdue regard\u201d provision. Thus, the Governor\u2019s plan in the City/Baltimore County region comes perilously close to running afoul of Article III, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>The danger lurking in legislative districts which cross jurisdictional boundaries, of course, is that representatives from those districts may face conflicting allegiances as to legislative initiatives which benefit one of their constituencies at the expense of the other. As discussed above, the five districts which breach the City/County boundary are 8, 10, 42, 46, and 47. Districts 8 and 46 lie almost wholly within, respectively, Baltimore County and Baltimore City, with minimal overlap into the other jurisdiction. District 47 is subdistricted, with a two-member district in the City and a single-member district in the County. Thus, as to these three districts, the danger of divided loyalties is minimized, because no legislator other than the senator from district 47 will represent numerous persons in two different jurisdictions. District 10, meanwhile, is a minority district whose creation was mandated by the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">That leaves district 42, which is probably the most egregious district in the Governor\u2019s plan. It lies approximately half in northwest Baltimore City and half in Baltimore County. The encroachment of district 42 into Baltimore County will force petitioners Levin and Rynd to vie with each other for reelection to the House of Delegates in a newly drawn district 11. District 42\u2019s overlap into Baltimore County also has the effect of dividing the tightly-knit Jewish community in the Pikesville area between three different legislative districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">As we observed in 1982, the constitutional requirements for legislative districting tend to conflict with one another. When they do, the \u201cdue regard\u201d provision, as the \u201cmost fluid\u201d of the requirements, will often be the first to yield. Here, the due regard provision <em>vis a vis </em>district 42 must mesh with the other constitutional requirements which factored into the development of the plan as a whole. And while the fact that district 42 splits the Jewish community may be regrettable, regard for that \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d cannot overcome constitutional considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Taking into account the presumption of the validity of the Governor\u2019s plan, we agree with the Special Master that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>plan does not unconstitutionally transgress the \u201cdue regard\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Governor\u2019s plan for redistricting the General Assembly satisfies all constitutional and statutory requirements and was therefore validly enacted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\">.

The Special Master considered as a separate issue Dembrow\u2019s allegation that the plan improperly created districts for the purpose of protecting incumbents.

In the 1980's redistricting litigation, we began our analysis of the claims there raised with an overview of applicable federal and state constitutional principles. <em>See In re Legislative Districting, 299 </em>Md. 658, 672-81, 475 A.2d 428 (1982). Since most of those principles remain the law today, we acknowledge that discussion as useful background for the instant case, particularly in the area of population equality. An updated overview is less appropriate here, however, because more nebulous issues, such as adequacy of notice and \u201cdue regard\u201d for boundaries, comprise the focus of this case, as opposed to the oft-litigated and more concrete compactness requirement which dominated the 1982 dispute. We also caution that the law has changed significantly in the area of discrimination against minorities, as the discussion of the Voting Rights Act claims, <em>infra, </em>will show.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b625-6\">. Levin and Rynd both assert that the GRAC was compelled to follow the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Maryland Code (1984, 1993 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7\u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article, which specifies that notice must be published in the Maryland Register. This assertion is incorrect, because the APA applies only to Executive Branch 'units,\" defined as \"officer[s] or unitfs] authorized by law to adopt regulations.\u201d \u00a7 10-101(g). Here, even assuming the redistricting plan was a \"regulation,\u201d neither the GRAC nor the Governor was a \u201cunit,\u201d for neither was authorized by law to adopt the plan; rather, the plan became law only upon the General Assembly\u2019s inaction. Also, as the State points out, a statute such as the APA cannot control a constitutional gubernatorial function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b628-9\">. The Special Master rejected Dembrow\u2019s original assertions that the 18th, 19th, and 20th districts were all noncompact.

In fact, district 20 scrupulously hews to the Montgomery County/Prince George\u2019s County border, without crossing into the latter jurisdiction. It is therefore not surprising that its remaining boundary within Montgomery County is somewhat irregular, so that it might encompass the legally required number of residents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\">. Meanwhile, the Court had decided a series of cases in which it imposed a standard of strict mathematical equality on the apportionment of federal congressional districts. <em>See e.g. Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, </em>394 U.S. 526, 89 S.Ct. 1225, 22 L.Ed.2d 519 (1969) (striking down a Missouri plan with a maximum deviation of only 3.13%).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b633-6\">. The Special Master found the maximum deviation for the single-member delegate districts in the Governor's plan to be 10.67%, and for the two-member delegate districts to be 8.87%. Assuming the strictures of <em>Reynolds </em>and its progeny apply to subdistricts in a legislative districting plan, the deviation among single-member districts could conceivably require justification by the State. We note, however, that the 10.67% figure is well below that which the Supreme Court approved in <em>Mahan </em>based on Virginia\u2019s policy of respecting subdivision boundaries, a rationale which, <em>inter alia, </em>the State advances here. In any event, the petitioners have not challenged the subdistricts in the Governor\u2019s plan as unconstitutionally unequal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\">. Skinner and Weiner also argue that the Governor\u2019s plan does not legitimately reflect state policy considerations in deviating from population equality. This is because, they assert, the Governor\u2019s plan was developed by the GRAC, \u201can ad hoc committee without legal foundation,\u201d and became law only upon failure of the General Assembly to enact an alternative plan. Skinner and Weiner claim that there was no \u201cconsistently applied legislative policy\u201d to justify departures from population equality.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">This claim is erroneous. When the General Assembly passes a bill which becomes law, the people of Maryland have articulated a legitimate state policy through their duly elected officials. That is no less true where, as here, the constitution specifies that the Governor shall develop the law in the first instance, which the General Assembly can then reject or endorse through its own action or inaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b635-6\">. Such a showing would be difficult. As discussed earlier, a state may deviate from pure population equality among districts for numerous reasons: to make districts compact, to make districts contiguous, to respect the boundaries of political subdivisions and municipalities, to preserve the cores of prior districts, to avoid contests between incumbents, or to further any other rational state policy. <em>Reynolds, </em>377 U.S. at 578-79, 84 S.Ct. at 1390; <em>Karcher, supra, </em>462 U.S. at 740, 103 S.Ct. at 2663.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b636-5\">. The dissent suggests that the Governor\u2019s plan \"obviously discriminates against ... Montgomery County.\u201d It alleges that, although Montgomery County\u2019s population exceeds Baltimore City\u2019s, \"the voters of Baltimore City elect 8 Senators and 24 Representatives, while the voters of Montgomery County elect only 7 Senators and 21 Representatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The dissent achieves this result by selectively manipulating all cross-jurisdictional districts into Baltimore City and out of Montgomery County. In fact, Baltimore City residents will <em>alone </em>elect only 5 senators (in districts 40, 41, 43, 44, and 45) and 17 delegates (in those districts plus subdistrict 47A). City residents will largely control the election of a sixth senator and three more delegates in district 46, though Baltimore County residents will have some input into that election. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s implication, however, City residents will not \"elect\u201d a seventh and eighth senator and several more delegates. In districts 42 and 47, City residents will only <em>share </em>in the senatorial elections with County residents, who have enough voting strength in each district to alter the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Likewise, Montgomery County residents will not elect \u201conly 7 Senators and 21 Representatives.\u201d They will <em>alone </em>elect 7 senators and 22 delegates (in districts 14A, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 39), and they will contribute significantly to the election of an eighth senator (district 14) and, less significantly, to the election of two more delegates (district 14B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\">. Such a showing, however, would still leave the interesting question, which we need not address, whether it is a \"rational state policy\u201d under <em>Reynolds </em>to maximize the legislative representation of a region, such as Baltimore Cily, with waning political clout but urgent political needs, so long as no other region in the State is seriously and disproportionately underrepresented as a result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\">. The dissent expends much energy trying to evade the \"10% rule,\u201d first calling it \u201cdictum,\u201d then apparently conceding its binding nature, asserting that it only establishes the threshold for <em>prima facie </em>discrimination. The dissent suggests that when maximum population deviations in a redistricting plan fall below 10%, a plaintiff must only show \"more than the mere percentage deviation\u201d in order to shift the burden to the State to justify the deviations. To adopt the dissent\u2019s proposal would ensure that every legislative redistricting plan would languish in protracted litigation. Disgruntled opponents of any redistricting scheme can invariably offer something suggesting ill will by district planners; thus, the dissent's proposal would undermine <em>Brown\u2019s </em>rule that maximum deviations under 10% will not \"ordinarily\u201d require justification by the State. Only when a plaintiff can show that no legitimate policy concerns contributed to population deviations should the burden shift to the State to justify those deviations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b640-13\">.

The GRAC chairman publicly announced that the GRAC created districts to \u2018cross local jurisdiction lines and to group communities that share interests,\u2019 thereby possibly diluting the full application of the \u2018due regard\u2019 provision. Thus, the Governor\u2019s plan in the City/Baltimore County region comes perilously close to running afoul of Article III, \u00a7 4.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">The majority also states that \u201cthe Governor\u2019s plan appears to favor Baltimore City[,] [b]y packing that region with districts containing barely more than the minimum constitutionally permissible population.\u201d 331 Md. at 596, 629 A.2d at 657. Yet, the majority holds that it is \u201cnot prepared to say that this favorable result for the City rises to the level of a constitutional violation.\u201d 331 Md. at 596, 629 A.2d at 657. The plan was deliberately drawn to ignore the boundaries of subdivisions in certain areas, regard for which is a constitutional imperative. Moreover, the plan deviates from equality of population for a reason other than the reason which has been accepted by the Supreme Court for such deviation\u2014respect for the boundaries of subdivisions. The plan thus transgresses federal and state constitutional requirements regarding legislative districting in two critical, interrelated ways. While the majority holds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>the plan is only \u201cperilously close\u201d to the edge of unconstitutionality, I believe that it is over the edge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The Maryland Constitution mandates that a redistricting plan for the General Assembly conform to certain specified requirements. Article III, \u00a7 4, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\u201cEach legislative district shall consist of adjoining territory, be compact in form, and of substantially equal population. Due regard shall be given to natural boundaries and the boundaries of political subdivisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Article III, \u00a7 5, states that the Governor\u2019s \u201cplan shall conform to Sections 2, 3 and 4 of this Article.\u201d The constitutional language requiring due regard for natural boundaries and political subdivisions was adopted by Ch. 363 of the Acts of 1972 and was ratified on November 7, 1972. Rather than accept these mandates for preparing the Governor\u2019s redistricting plan, the GRAC announced that the plan had been drafted based upon the following principles (Remarks of GRAC Chair at beginning of December 10, 1991, hearing):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">\u201c1) [To represent people fairly\u2014Legislative districts fall within 5 percent of the ideal population of 101,733.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">2) To be compact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">3) To provide minority voters the opportunity to elect candidates of their choosing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-11\">4) [To r]ecognize communities of interest\u2014where districts cross local jurisdictional lines and to group communities that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>share interests (interests such as shopping centers, utility systems, transportation, and other community facilities).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeh\">5) To keep municipalities whole where possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR6\">6) To support regional interests through the intra-regional sharing of districts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">It is apparent from these remarks of the Chairman, as well as from the numerous times that the Plan crossed political subdivision lines, that the constitutional requirement of due regard for the boundaries of political subdivisions was ignored in favor of the promotion of \u201cregional interests.\u201d As we stated in <em>In re Legislative Districting, </em>299 Md. 658, 681, 475 A.2d 428, 439 (1982), \u201cthe \u2018due regard\u2019 requirement is of mandatory application.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">The majority attempts to dilute this constitutional imperative by stating that the due regard provision is the \u201cmost fluid\u201d of the constitutional guidelines and therefore \u201cwill often be the first to yield.\u201d 331 Md. at 615, 629 A.2d at 667. The majority\u2019s analysis is disingenuous. The due regard requirement in this case has not yielded to other constitutional imperatives such as substantial equality of population, contiguity or compactness. This constitutional mandate has yielded to a nonconstitutional program of attempting to promote \u201ccommunities of interests\u201d and supporting \u201cregional interests.\u201d These considerations are not set forth in Article III of the Maryland Constitution. To the contrary, they may be antithetical to the \u201cdue regard\u201d requirement mandated by the Constitution. Moreover, as the majority recognizes, this Court \u201cexplicitly stated in 1982 that \u2018communities of interest\u2019 are an unworkable basis on which to apportion districts.\u201d 331 Md. at 614, 629 A.2d at 666. It is certainly possible that the due regard requirement may have to yield to other constitutional mandates, including federal law made supreme by the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution of the United States<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>and Art. 2 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is impermissible, however, to subjugate a constitutional mandate to lesser principles. The GRAC\u2019s deliberate decision to ignore the boundaries of political subdivisions for a reason other than to conform to constitutional principles or federal law renders the legislative redistricting plan invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">The majority\u2019s dismissal of the requirement of due regard for political subdivisions is unsupported by the history and reality of governance in this State. Earlier legislative districting plans have considered the counties and Baltimore City to be the primary element in apportionment, and have only crossed subdivision boundaries when necessary to achieve population equality. <em>See </em>Report to the Governor of Maryland by the Commission to Study Reapportionment of the General Assembly (January 31, 1964) (assuming that all representation is determined with reference to subdivision boundaries); Final Report of the Committee on More Equitable Representation in the General Assembly of Maryland (January 15, 1960) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The political subdivisions have always been central to our system of state government. From the early history of Maryland, political subdivisions have played a critical role. <em>See generally </em>Matthew P. Andrews, <em>History of Maryland, </em>617 (1929) (\u201cIn the matter of representation Maryland has been likened to a \u2018confederacy of counties,\u2019 or a federated republic\u2014the counties and the city of Baltimore ... being comparable to the states in the Federal Union\u201d); Theodore J.

Unlike many other states, Maryland has a small number of basic political subdivisions: twenty-three counties and Baltimore City.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[t]he counties in Maryland occupy a far more important position than do similar political divisions in many other states of the union.\u201d 241 Md. at 499, 217 A.2d at 290, quoting the Maryland Geological Survey, \u201cThe Counties of Maryland, Their Origin, Boundaries and Election Districts,\u201d 419 (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The Maryland Constitution itself recognizes the critical importance of counties in the very structure of our government. <em>See, e.g., </em>Art.

After the State as a whole, the counties are the basic governing units in our political system. Maryland government is organized on a county-by-county basis.

Many of Maryland\u2019s counties have not established local legislative bodies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *8 For these \u201cnon-home rule\u201d counties, the Maryland General Assembly is the local legislature. In practice, members of the General Assembly from such county (the county delegation) decide upon the legislation for the county and are the <em>defacto </em>local legislature. Home rule counties under Art. XI-A of the Constitution, which have local legislative bodies, may enact laws on subjects enumerated in the Express Powers Act, Code (1957, 1990 Repl.Vol., 1992 Cum.Supp.), Art. 25A, \u00a7 5, and in Art. 4, \u00a7 6, of the Code of Public Local Laws of Maryland. On subjects not covered by these grants of express powers, however, the county delegation in the General Assembly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>serves as the legislative body even for a home rule county. In addition, the General Assembly regularly makes exceptions to and variations in public general laws on a county-by-county basis. In addition, the State\u2019s annual Budget frequently makes appropriations on a county-by-county basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Dr. Carl Everstine, former Director of the Department of Legislative Reference, described the legislative procedure for local laws enacted by the General Assembly (Everstine, <em>Maryland Legislative Council, Local Government: A Comparative Study, </em>Research Report No. 23, 17 (September 1944)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">\u201cThe rules of procedure adopted and followed by the legislatures of other states' show an interesting contrast with those of Maryland, with respect to the committees to which local bills may be assigned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">\u201cLocal bills introduced into the General Assembly of Maryland usually are referred to the select committees made up, in the House, of the members of the county delegation concerned, and in the Senate, of the Senator from the county concerned and the senators from two adjoining counties. Occasionally, a bill which would affect only one county may yet have implications of State-wide importance which will lead to its being referred to a standing committee, but it is the general practice to refer all local bills to select committees, and the rest of the legislature accepts without question the recommendations of these committees. There are no standing committees to which all local bills may be referred, simply by virtue of their being local bills.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-7\"><em>See also </em>George A. Bell and Jean E. Spencer, <em>The Legislative Process in Maryland, 85-87 </em>(2d ed. 1963). In exercising these legislative functions, it is of paramount importance that the county delegations exist in the General Assembly. If county lines are ignored in the legislative redistricting process, this entire system of government will not function properly. Furthermore, a legislator simply cannot \u201crepresent his constituents properly\u2014nor can voters from a fragmented district exercise the ballot intelligently\u2014when a voting district is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>nothing more than an artificial unit divorced from, and indeed often in conflict with, the various communities established in the State.\u201d <em>Karcher v.

As discussed in Part II below, respect for political subdivision lines is the primary ground upon which deviation from equal population may be acceptable under equal protection principles. Moreover, respect for subdivision boundaries may well prevent other unwarranted tinkering with legislative districts. <em>See Reynolds v. Sims, supra, </em>377 U.S. at 578-579, 84 S.Ct. at 1390, 12 L.Ed.2d at 537 (\u201cIndiscriminate districting, without any regard for political subdivision or natural or historical boundary lines, may be little more than an open invitation to partisan gerrymandering\u201d). In addition, where various groups, such as minorities, have striven to attain influence in a particular subdivision, and have finally succeeded in acquiring such influence in the subdivision, a General Assembly redistricting plan which combines subdivisions for reasons other than population equality can undermine that political influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Even under the federal Constitution, where there is no express constitutional requirement that any regard be given to the boundaries of political subdivisions, the Supreme Court has recognized the importance of this consideration. In <em>Shaw v. Reno, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 2827, 125 L.Ed.2d 511, 528 (1993), the Supreme Court discussed the \u201ctraditional districting principles such as compactness, contiguity, and <em>respect for political subdivisions </em>\u201d (emphasis added). In Maryland, where Art. Ill, \u00a7 4, of the State Constitution explicitly commands that \u201cDue regard shall be given to ... the boundaries of political subdivisions,\u201d it is unfathomable to have a legislative redistricting plan which sets out to disregard county lines. This plan\u2019s stated goal of not giving regard to subdivision lines but, instead, of promoting \u201cregionalism,\u201d directly contravenes practical necessity, historical precedent, and, most importantly, violates the constitutional mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>The plan allows senatorial districts to overlap county boundaries 18 times. Five senatorial districts overlap the Baltimore City-Baltimore County border; the Baltimore City border is invaded four times for House districts.

The right to vote includes the right to have one\u2019s vote count fully; \u201cthe right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen\u2019s vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.\u201d <em>Reynolds, </em>377 U.S. at 555, 84 S.Ct. at 1378, 12 L.Ed.2d at 523-524.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">These principles are fortified in Maryland by Art. 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights which \u201cembodies the concept of equal protection of the laws to the same extent as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Murphy v.

The majority acknowledges these inequalities, and further acknowledges that the inequalities systematically benefit one area of the State\u2014the metropolitan Baltimore area. 331 Md. at 596, 629 A.2d at 657. The stated reasons for the unequal distribution of representation under the plan are to promote \u201cregionalism\u201d and to recognize \u201ccommunities of interest.\u201d I assume for the moment that these stated policies were not mere pretexts for pure discrimination in favor of one area of the State and against another area. Nevertheless, these policies cannot be considered legitimate legislative goals in light of the constitutional mandate to respect the boundaries of political subdivisions, which these policies directly contravene.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">This Court has, in the past, decried the use of \u201ccommunities of interest\u201d as guidelines for legislative districting. <em>See In re Legislative Districting, supra, </em>299 Md. at 692-693, 475 A.2d at 445 (calling the concept of communities of interest \u201cnebulous\u201d and stating that \u201cno reasonable standard could possibly be devised to afford them recognition in the formulation of districts within the required constitutional framework\u201d). Moreover, the Supreme Court has. set forth the reasons which it considers sufficient to justify population discrepancies; the desires to promote regionalism and to support communities of interest are not among them. In <em>Reynolds v. Sims, supra, </em>the Supreme Court discussed at length the principles on which deviation from strict population equality might be accepted, and expressly rejected the notion that group interests can override the equal population principle. The Court stated (377 U.S. at 578-580, 84 S.Ct. at 1390-1391, 12 L.Ed.2d at 537-538, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\u201cA State may legitimately desire to maintain the integrity of various political subdivisions, insofar as possible, and provide for compact districts of contiguous territory in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>designing a legislative apportionment scheme. Valid considerations may underlie such aims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">\u201cSo long as the divergences from a strict population standard are based on legitimate considerations incident to the effectuation of a rational state policy, some deviations from the equal-population principle are constitutionally permissible with respect to the apportionment of seats in either or both of the two houses of a bicameral state legislature. <em>But neither history alone, nor economic or other sorts of group interests, are permissible factors in attempting to justify disparities from population-based </em>representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The Supreme Court in other cases has upheld deviations from the equal population principle only on the basis of the State\u2019s desire to preserve the integrity of its political subdivisions. <em>See, e.g., Voinovich v. Quilter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 113 S.Ct. 1149, 1159, 122 L.Ed.2d 500, 516 (1993) (a State can justify deviations by its desire to maintain political subdivision lines); <em>Brown v. Thomson, </em>462 U.S. 835, 846-848, 103 S.Ct. 2690, 2698-2699, 77 L.Ed.2d 214, 224-225 (1983) (population deviations were constitutionally permissible in light of the need to preserve county representation in Wyoming); <em>Mahan v. Howell, supra, </em>410 U.S. at 325-326, 93 S.Ct. at 985-986, 35 L.Ed.2d at 330-331 (deviations from equal population are justified on the basis of respect for the political jurisdictional lines of the counties and cities). <em>See also Karcher v. Daggett, supra, </em>462 U.S. at 740, 103 S.Ct. at 2663, 77 L.Ed.2d at 147 (deviations may be justified by the policy of respecting municipal boundaries, among others); <em>Abate v. Mundt, </em>403 U.S. 182, 187, 91 S.Ct. 1904, 1908, 29 L.Ed.2d 399, 403 (1971) (upholding an apportionment for a county legislative body having a maximum deviation of 11.9%, in light of New York\u2019s long history of maintaining the integrity of existing local government units within the county). I am aware of no Supreme Court case which upholds a deviation from the equal population principle on any other basis. The population deviations in the plan now before us are not a result of this legitimate and important concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Moreover, I doubt that \u201ccommunities of interest\u201d and \u201cregionalism\u201d provided the major impetus for the population disparities in the plan. The majority apparently does not believe this rationale either, stating that \u201cthe Governor\u2019s plan appears to systematically afford the City the maximum number of representatives in the legislature as its population can support.\u201d 331 Md. at 596, 629 A.2d at 657. It is undisputed in this case that the districts with the smallest numbers of voters per district lie in the Baltimore area; eleven of the twelve smallest districts in the State are in the Baltimore City-Baltimore County area. The implication is that the drafters of the plan made a systematic attempt to overrepresent the voters in one area of the State by affording them the largest number of representatives for the fewest number of people, and conversely, to underrepresent the voters in other areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Obviously uncomfortable with the clearly discriminatory plan, the majority seeks to justify it by asserting that, although the deviations benefit the voters of the Baltimore area, they do not do so at the expense of any other region.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I do not agree. The plan obviously discriminates against the Washington metropolitan area, and particularly Montgomery County. The districts with the largest number of voters in each district lie in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties; these counties account for nine of the fourteen largest districts in the State. According to the 1990 census, the population of Montgomery County exceeds that of Baltimore City. Under the Plan, however, the voters of Baltimore City elect 8 Senators and 24 Representatives, while the voters of Montgomery County elect only 7 Senators and 21 Representatives. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>seems that the citizens of Montgomery County bear much of the expense of the Baltimore area\u2019s overrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Furthermore, there is harm to the voters living in every other area of the State, even assuming that the plan does not intentionally discriminate against any particular region. The General Assembly consists of a finite number of delegates and senators. Under Art. Ill, \u00a7 2, of the Maryland Constitution, there are 141 Delegates and 47 Senators. Any increase in the number of representatives for one area necessarily results in a decrease in the number of representatives per capita for other areas of the State. \u201cOverweighting and overvaluation of the votes of those living here has the certain effect of dilution and undervaluation of the votes of those living there.\u201d <em>Reynolds v. Sims, supra, </em>377 U.S. at 563, 84 S.Ct. at 1382, 12 L.Ed.2d at 528. The majority seems to recognize the relationship between granting excessive representation to the people of one area, and underrepresentation to others. Nevertheless, the majority seems to be willing to overlook the resultant dilution of votes because, in its view, no particular \u201cregion in the State is seriously and disproportionately underrepresented as a result.\u201d 331 Md. at 598, n. 19, 629 A.2d at 658, n. 19. In setting out this high threshold for recognizing an injury, the majority all but ignores the fundamental right of every citizen in every region of the State to have his or her vote count equally. The standard set forth by the majority allows deliberate vote dilution on the basis of pure geographic favoritism.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">After dismissing this geographic discrimination as not rising to the level of a constitutional violation, 331 Md. at 597, 629 A.2d at 657, the majority further implies that this discrimination might be constitutionally justifiable. The majority implies that systematically favoring the Baltimore metropolitan area (a region \u201cwith waning political clout but urgent political needs\u201d) with disproportionately high representation could constitute a rational state policy \u201cso long as no other region in the State is seriously and disproportionately underrepresented as a result.\u201d 331 Md. at 598, n. 19, 629 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>658, n. 19.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This implication is an assault on the very concept of representative government. The \u201cpolitical needs\u201d of an area cannot justify diluting the votes of the rest of the citizens of the State. The Supreme Court \u201cclearly established that the fundamental principle of representative government in this country is one of equal representation for equal numbers of people, without regard to race, sex, economic status, or place of residence -within a State.\u201d <em>Reynolds v. Sims, supra, </em>377 U.S. at 560-561, 84 S.Ct. at 1381, 12 L.Ed.2d at 526, discussing <em>Wesberry v. Sanders, </em>376 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 526, 11 L.Ed.2d 481 (1964). Later, the Supreme Court specifically \u201cunderscored the danger of apportionment structures that contain a built-in bias tending to favor particular geographic areas or political interests.... \u201d <em>Abate v. Mundt, supra, </em>403 U.S. at 185-186, 91 S.Ct. at 1907, 29 L.Ed.2d at 403. <em>See also Brown v. Thomson, supra, </em>462 U.S. at 843-844, 103 S.Ct. at 2696-2697, 77 L.Ed.2d at 222-223 (upholding Wyoming\u2019s redistricting plan, which contained a substantial deviation from equal population, and noting that it exhibited no \u201cbuilt-in bias tending to favor particular political interests or geographic areas\u201d). The purposeful promotion of the interests of one region of the State over others cannot be a legitimate basis for deviation from equal population principles as a matter of law. <em>See Gray v. Sanders, </em>372 U.S. 368, 380, 83 S.Ct. 801, 808, 9 L.Ed.2d 821, 830 (1963) (\u201cthe Constitution visualizes no preferred class of voters but equality among those who meet the basic qualifications\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The GRAC\u2019s stated rationales for the significant population deviations within the plan are not compelling or even legitimate State interests. Consequently, the plan fails the equal protection scrutiny to which we must subject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The majority, however, skips entirely the first step in this equal protection analysis and refuses to examine the justifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>tion for the disparities. Instead, it holds that population disparities between legislative districts of less than ten percent are virtually insulated from review. The majority relies on the dictum in <em>Brown v. Thomson, supra, </em>462 U.S. at 842, 103 S.Ct. at 2696, 77 L.Ed.2d at 222, to the effect that, as a general matter, deviations of less than ten percent are <em>de minimis. </em>The majority overlooks another statement in <em>Brown, </em>making it clear that the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of the unique situation presented by that case \u201cdoes not mean that population deviations of any magnitude necessarily are acceptable.\u201d 462 U.S. at 844-845, 103 S.Ct. at 2697, 77 L.Ed.2d at 223. The majority also ignores the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>holdings </em>that deviations from the strict equal population principle are permissible only when <em>\u201cnecessary </em>to permit the State[ ] to pursue other legitimate objectives.\u201d <em>Brown v. Thomson, </em>462 U.S. at 842, 103 S.Ct. at 2696, 77 L.Ed.2d at 221 (emphasis added). <em>See also Mahan v. Howell, supra, </em>410 U.S. at 325, 93 S.Ct. at 985, 35 L.Ed.2d at 330 (\u201cdeviations from the equal-population principle are constitutionally permissible\u201d only \u201cso long as the divergences ... are based on legitimate considerations incident to the effectuation of a rational state policy\u201d); <em>Reynolds v. Sims, supra, </em>377 U.S. at 581, 84 S.Ct. at 1392, 12 L.Ed.2d at 538-539 (\u201ccareful judicial scrutiny must of course be given, in evaluating state apportionment schemes, to the <em>character </em>as well as the degree of deviations from a strict population basis\u201d) (emphasis added). <em>Cf. Wesberry v. Sanders, supra, </em>376 U.S. 1, 18, 84 S.Ct. 526, 535, 11 L.Ed.2d 481, 492 (discussing \u201cour Constitution\u2019s plain objective of making equal representation for equal numbers of people the fundamental goal ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s view, the equal population principle is of utmost importance. The Supreme Court has stated <em>(Reynolds v. Sims, supra, </em>377 U.S. at 581, 84 S.Ct. at 1392, 12 L.Ed.2d at 539):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">\u201ceven [if] as a result of a clearly rational state policy of according some legislative representation to political subdivisions, population is submerged as the controlling consideration in the apportionment of seats in the particular legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>tive body, then the right of all of the State\u2019s citizens to cast an effective and \u00e1dequately weighted vote would be unconstitutionally impaired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The majority\u2019s view that \u201cthe Supreme Court has unequivocally built a 10% degree of flexibility into the one person, one vote requirement so that states can accommodate important concerns in reapportioning their legislatures,\u201d 331 Md. at 595, 629 A.2d at 656, is simply incorrect. A significant deviation of less than 10% is permissible only for valid reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The ten percent rule serves only as a threshold for establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. If the population deviation between legislative districts is greater than ten percent, a citizen challenging the districting plan has established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, shifting the burden to the State to show that the plan is not discriminatory. If the population disparity is less than ten percent, however, citizens must still have an opportunity to show that the population deviations were not based on legitimate considerations. As the Court stated in <em>Brown v. Thomson, supra, </em>462 U.S. at 845-846, 103 S.Ct at 2697-2698, 77 L.Ed.2d at 224:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">\u201cThe consistency of application and the neutrality of effect of the nonpopulation criteria must be considered along with the size of the population disparities in determining whether a state legislative apportionment plan contravenes the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The majority, however, asserts that unless \u201cthe plaintiff can present compelling evidence that the drafters of the plan ignored all the legitimate reasons for population disparities and created the deviations <em>solely </em>to benefit certain regions at the expense of others,\u201d 331 Md. at 597, 629 A.2d at 657, deviations under ten percent will not be scrutinized. Furthermore, the majority will not accept the plan itself as evidence of improper discrimination, even when, as in this case, the plan on its face favors one area over all others generally and discriminates against certain areas in particular. As an initial matter, there is no reason to discount the evidentiary value of the plan in making out a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>the best possible evidence of improper geographic discrimination would seem to be the plan itself. <em>Cf. Shaw v. Reno, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, -, 113 S.Ct. at 2824, 2832, 125 L.Ed.2d at 525, 536 (redistricting plan \u201con its face\u201d was such that \u201cit rationally can be viewed only as an effort\u201d to accomplish an illegitimate purpose \u201cwithout regard for traditional districting principles and without sufficiently compelling justification\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Moreover, there is no support in the cases for the view that population deviations of less than ten percent are never subject to question. <em>Brown v. Thomson, supra, </em>and <em>Voinovich v. Quilter, supra, </em>each hold that major deviations from population equality, in themselves, are sufficient to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. A deviation of less than ten percent is not considered \u201cmajor\u201d within this rule, according to <em>Brown. </em>Therefore, as pointed out above, a citizen challenging the apportionment must show more than the mere percentage deviation in order to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case and in order to require justification by the State. The rule is not, as the majority opinion states, that deviations of less than ten percent do not require justification by the State; the rule is that deviations of less than ten percent do not, in and of themselves, require justification by State in the manner that larger deviations do. The <em>Broum </em>case simply does not stand for the proposition that a percentage deviation of less than ten percent is constitutional under all circumstances, as the majority opinion suggests.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The overriding constitutional objective in legislative districting is population equality among districts; this objective is not served by ignoring so-called minor deviations which are not based on legitimate principles. As pointed out by the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>preme Court, \u201c[i]f state legislators knew that a certain <em>de minimis </em>level of population differences was acceptable, they would doubtless strive to achieve that level rather than equality.\u201d <em>Karcher v. Daggett, supra, </em>462 U.S. at 731, 103 S.Ct. at 2659, 77 L.Ed.2d at 141. In fact, this is exactly what happened in the case at bar. The GRAC\u2019s goal was not population equality; instead, the GRAC crafted the plan with the express target of ten percent deviations between districts. The GRAC on June 11, 1991, adopted a set of \u201cLegal Standards for Plan Development,\u201d which included the following statement of principle: \u201cThe population of any legislative subdistrict shall be substantially equal to the appropriate fraction of the Senate district population. Deviations from the ideal Senate district or legislative subdistrict population should not exceed +5% or - 5% (except as may be necessitated by other constitutional requirements).\u201d The GRAC Chairperson later remarked (at the beginning of the December 10, 1991 hearing) that it was one of the committee\u2019s goals to have \u201clegislative districts fall within 5 percent of the ideal population.\u201d Thus, instead of making the required good faith effort to construct districts which are virtually equal in population, deviating only to accommodate other constitutional requirements, the GRAC set out to construct a plan which contained districts of unequal population as an initial matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The plan deviates significantly from the overriding constitutional imperative of equal population, and the deviations were not for legitimate constitutionally recognized reasons. Consequently, the votes of numerous citizens of this State have been impermissibly diluted.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The majority\u2019s decision upholding this legislative redistricting plan, I am afraid, sends a message to future Governors for many decades that, in preparing a General Assembly redistricting plan, they need not be concerned about the constitutional criteria set forth in Art. Ill, \u00a7 4, because, as long as the population discrepancies are no greater than 10%, the Court of Appeals will uphold the plan regardless of the reasons for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>population discrepancies and regardless of the other constitutional criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">I would hold that the legislative redistricting plan at issue violates the Equal Protection Clause, of the Fourteenth Amendment, violates Art. 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and violates Art. Ill, \u00a7 4, of the Maryland Constitution. Consequently, I would refer the plan to a Special Master. The Special Master could be Judge Smith, who has already served in that capacity, or, if he is unavailable, a different Special Master. The Special Master should recommend to this Court modifications of the plan so that the constitutional deficiencies regarding the districts for Baltimore County, Baltimore City and Montgomery County might be rectified. In making his recommendations, the Special Master should consider any alternate plans which have already been submitted in this redistricting effort, as well as any new submissions from the parties which they may wish to make, although he should not be limited to particular alternate plans which have been or will be submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Only the districts relating to Baltimore County, Baltimore City and Montgomery County have been specifically challenged, but the Special Master\u2019s recommendations might affect other areas. This effect is not likely to be great; nonetheless, the necessary modification should be accomplished with as little disruption to other areas as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">I realize that I would have the Court take on what may seem to be a difficult task. I point out, however, that the Court has invalidated a redistricting plan in the past. <em>See In re Legislative Districting, </em>271 Md. 320, 317 A.2d 477, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 840, 95 S.Ct. 70, 42 L.Ed.2d 67 (1974). Moreover, it is the constitutional duty of this Court to grant relief from an unconstitutional legislative districting plan. The perceived difficulty of the task should not excuse its performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Judge ROBERT M. BELL has authorized me to state that he concurs with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-12\">. Since I believe that the redistricting plan is invalid on two grounds, namely its failure to give due regard to political subdivision boundaries and its population deviations, and that the plan should be modified to rectify its deficiencies in both of these areas, I need not and do not express any opinion concerning the other grounds on which the plan was challenged. If the plan were modified to rectify the deficiencies regarding political subdivision boundaries and population deviations, some of the other challenges might disappear or might be of a different nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b656-10\">.

Each county has a circuit court, and each county has at least one circuit judge. Art. IV, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 21. The State is represented by a State's Attorney in each county. Art. V, \u00a7 7. The State carries out registration of voters on a political subdivision basis, with an election board in each county. Furthermore, several national programs, such as the cooperative extension service and the soil conservation service, are operated on a county-by-county basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">For thorough reviews of the responsibilities undertaken by and in political subdivisions, <em>see </em>Theodore J. Maher, <em>State-County Relations in Maryland, </em>142-243 (1971); Don L. Bowen and Robert S.

County Commissioners, under Art. VII, \u00a7 1, of the Maryland Constitution, largely \"act as administrators or in an executive capacity,\u201d <em>City of Bowie v. County Comm\u2019rs, 258 </em>Md. 454, 461, 267 A.2d 172, 176 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b663-6\">. The Supreme Court applied strict scrutiny in invalidating a state election law in <em>Kramer v. Union Free School District, </em>395 U.S. 621, 89 S.Ct. 1886, 23 L.Ed.2d 583 (1969), which was not a reapportionment case. The Supreme Court reasoned, however, that because strict scrutiny is appropriate in reapportionment cases, it was also appropriate in that case. The Court stated (395 U.S. at 626-627, 89 S.Ct. at 1889\u20141890, 23 L.Ed.2d at 589):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">\"[S]tate apportionment statutes, which may <em>dilute </em>the effectiveness of some citizens\u2019 votes, receive close scrutiny from this Court. <em>Reynolds v. Sims, supra. </em>See <em>Avery v. Midland County, </em>390 U.S. 474, 88 S.Ct. 1114, 20 L.Ed.2d 45 (1968). No less rigid an examination is applicable to statutes <em>denying </em>the franchise to citizens who are otherwise qualified by residence and age.... Therefore, if a challenged state statute grants the right to vote to some bona fide residents of requisite age and citizenship and denies the franchise to others, the Court must determine whether the exclusions are necessary to promote a compelling state interest.\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b666-5\">. The majority\u2019s comment, 331 Md. at 597, 629 A.2d at 657, that people and not territory are to be represented in the General Assembly, serves only to distract from the real issues at hand. We are concerned here with the systematic dilution of the votes of citizens living outside of a favored territory, not with some scheme of representation of the territory itself. We measure disparities between districts because of the principle that districts are to be comprised of equal numbers of people, not because we are concerned with discrimination against the \"district\u201d <em>per se.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">. A merely \u201crational\u201d state policy would be insufficient to justify the significant deviations from population equality in the plan. As discussed earlier, only a compelling state interest may justify significant deviations, and even then, it only justifies those deviations which are necessary to serve that interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\">. The majority opinion cites two cases as authority for its notion that population deviations of less than ten percent never require justification by the State: <em>Brown v. Thomson, </em>462 U.S. 835, 103 S.Ct. 2690, 77 L.Ed.2d 214 (1983), and <em>Voinovich v. </em>Quilter, - U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1149, 122 L.Ed.2d 500 (1993). <em>Voinovich </em>merely quotes the <em>Brown </em>opinion; it does not provide more guidance in this matter. \u2014 U.S. at -, 113 S.Ct. at 1159, 122 L.Ed.2d at 516.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
