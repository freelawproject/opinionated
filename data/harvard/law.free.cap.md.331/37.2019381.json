Agger, </em>287 Md. 342, 343, 412 A.2d 733, 733-734 (1980). This protection includes, <em>inter alia, </em>compensation for lost earning capacity, paid as a percentage of a worker\u2019s pre-injury \u201caverage weekly wage.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 9-637(a) of the Labor and Employment Article (providing that an employee who has suffered a permanent total disability shall be paid compensation equal to two-thirds of the employee\u2019s average weekly wage). The statute, however, does not specify a particular time period to be used in calculating a worker\u2019s average weekly wage. Instead, \u00a7 9-602 lists the elements to be considered as within the average weekly wage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission is expressly authorized by \u00a7 9-309(a) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation title of the Maryland Code to \u201cadopt regulations to carry out this title.\u201d In addition, \u00a7 9-701 broadly authorizes the Commission to promulgate procedural rules and regulations, specifically including regulations concerning \u201cthe nature and extent of evidence and proof\u2019 for establishing a right to compensation. At the time the present case arose, the Commission had promulgated a regulation governing the ascertainment of the average weekly wage. The regulation, referred to as Commission Rule 5, and set forth in COMAR 14.09.01.05, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-4\">\u201cA. Average weekly wage shall be determined from gross wages, including overtime, and will be determined by the Commission based on the information in the Commission file before the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">\u201cB. Notwithstanding \u00a7 A, unless otherwise 'ordered after the hearing, compensation payments shall be based on: (1) the average wage earned by the employee during the 13 weeks before the accident; (2) those weeks the employee actually worked during the period; (3) those items set forth in Article 101, \u00a7 7(8), Annotated Code of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">\u201cC. Periods of involuntary lay-off, or involuntary authorized absence are not included in the 13 weeks. However, any vacation wages paid shall be included in computing average weekly wage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">\u201cD. If payments are made at a rate other than that determined by the Commission in its initial award, the carrier, self-insurer, or State Accident Fund, within 60 days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>of the date of the initial award shall file with the Commission the basis on which the payments were made and shall serve a copy on the claimant or his attorney of record if represented.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The dispute in this case centers upon the language of subsection B above, stating that, \u201cunless otherwise ordered after the hearing, compensation payments shall be based on ... the average wage earned by the employee during the thirteen weeks before the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Irving Gross worked for Sessinghause &amp; Ostergaard, Inc., a construction firm, for over two years preceding the accident which precipitated this case. On June 6, 1984, a tunnel in which Mr. Gross was working collapsed, causing injuries to his neck, shoulders, and back. He filed a claim for benefits with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, and on the claim form he listed his wages as $11.00 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">On the basis of this hourly wage representation, the Commission made an initial determination of Mr. Gross\u2019 average weekly wage as $440.00. The employer\u2019s insurance carrier, The Home Insurance Company, paid Mr. Gross\u2019s benefits on the basis of the Commission\u2019s initial wage determination, while the parties attempted to negotiate a permanent resolution of Mr. Gross\u2019s claim. By November 1986, the parties had not come to an agreement, and the insurer stopped making payments to Mr. Gross. Mr. Gross requested a hearing before the Commission, claiming that he was permanently and totally disabled and that the cessation of payments was gravely detrimental to him in light of his inability to work. The employer submitted a wage statement covering the thirteen weeks prior to the accident, which showed an average weekly wage of $282.20. The insurer also impleaded the Subsequent Injury Fund into the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>An administrative hearing was held on November 19, 1987. The major issues were the nature and extent of Mr. Gross\u2019s disability, and the proper calculation of his average weekly wage. On the wage issue, the employer and insurer argued that Mr. Gross\u2019s compensation ought to be based on the thirteen-week wage statement. Mr. Gross submitted his W-2 form for the year preceding the accident, showing total wages of $20,823.45, which, when divided by 52 weeks, comes to an average weekly wage of approximately $400.00. Mr. Gross argued that, given the nature of the heavy construction industry in which Mr. Gross worked, the yearly earnings better represented his earning capacity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The remainder of the hearing addressed the other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">In an order issued on December 10, 1987, the Commission found that Mr. Gross\u2019s average weekly wage was $400.00 and that compensation should be awarded to Mr. Gross on this basis. The Commission also found that Mr. Gross was permanently and totally disabled, seventy:five percent of which was attributable to the accident and twenty-five percent of which was attributable to pre-existing conditions. The Commission further stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">\u201cthe employer and insurer shall pay the sum of $104,000.00 representing the compensation payable for 75% due to the accidental injury and further finds that the Subsequent Injury Fund, pursuant to the provisions of Section 66, Subsection 1 of Article 101 shall pay the claimant compensation benefits at the rate of $267.00, per week and continuing during the period of permanent total disability, and said compensation to begin at the end of compensation to be paid by the employer and insurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The employer and insurer requested a rehearing with regard to the \u201cfinding that the claimant\u2019s average weekly wage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>was $400.00 per week.\u201d They argued that, under the statute and regulation, \u201cthe average weekly wage is computed based upon the thirteen weeks prior to the accident and not upon the claimant\u2019s entire work year.\u201d Mr. Gross in response argued that neither the statute nor any Commission regulation required the wage calculation to be based on the thirteen-week statement, and he reiterated his position that, under the circumstances of this case, the yearly wage statement was a fairer and more accurate reflection of his earnings. The Commission denied the request for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The employer and insurer then filed in the Circuit Court for Calvert County an action for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s order. They contended that \u201cthe Commission misconstrued the law and facts as applicable to the Claimant\u2019s average weekly wage,\u201d and that the average weekly wage should be $282.20. At the circuit court nonjury hearing, Mr. Gross testified that he was a full-time employee of Sessinghause &amp; Ostergaard, that he had worked approximately 48 out of 52 weeks the preceding year, that Sessinghause &amp; Ostergaard was his only employer, and that he was retained even when other employees were laid off. The court, at the conclusion of the hearing, delivered an opinion in which it found that Mr. Gross was a full-time employee. The court then held that the Commission does not have the authority to base its average weekly wage calculation on anything but the thirteen-week statement, as provided for in Rule 5, unless after a hearing the Commission specifically finds that some inequity would result from doing so. The court stated that the Commission did not give any reason for choosing to use the prior year\u2019s wages rather than the thirteen weeks\u2019 wages. The court held that the Commission\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary,\u201d and it reversed. The case was remanded to the Commission with instructions to amend its order to reflect the lower average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Mr. Gross took an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. <em>Gross v. Sessinghause, Inc., </em>85 Md.App. 727, 584 A.2d 1313 (1991). The intermediate appellate court recognized that the thirteen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>week rule is not absolute. It stated (85 Md.App. at 734, 584 A.2d at 1316):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\">\u201cCommission Rule .05 B. provides that compensation payments following a hearing shall be based upon the average weekly wage for the thirteen weeks before the accident, unless otherwise ordered after the hearing. The Commission, therefore, is not locked into the thirteen week period if the circumstances or facts in a particular case warrant a reasonable alternative computation of average weekly wage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Nevertheless, the appellate court went on to state <em>(ibid.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"App\">\u201cThe right to deviate from the Rule, however, may not be arbitrarily invoked on a case-by-case basis. Departure from the Rule must be articulated by the Commission setting forth the factual basis for the decision rendered. That articulation was not set forth in this case and the trial court was not required to accept the Commission\u2019s preference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZA\">Mr. Gross then filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari which presented a single question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnG\">\u201cDoes the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and rules promulgated pursuant thereto, limit determination of the Claimant\u2019s \u2018average weekly wage\u2019 to the thirteen-week period prior to an accident?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Neither the employer nor the insurer nor the Subsequent Injury Fund filed a cross petition for a writ of certiorari. Thereafter we granted Mr. Gross\u2019s petition and issued a writ of certiorari, 323 Md. 27, 590 A.2d 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">In considering the parties\u2019 contentions, we first point out that no party has challenged the Commission\u2019s authority to promulgate the average weekly wage regulation referred to as Rule 5 and set forth in COMAR 14.09.01.05, or has otherwise challenged the validity of the regulation or its applicability to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Mr. Gross argues that the issue before us is one of law, that the circuit court and Court of Special Appeals misconstrued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the Commission\u2019s Rule 5, that the regulation allows the Commission to use a period other than thirteen weeks prior to the accident as long as it does so after a hearing, and that neither the statute nor the regulation require the rigid adherence to the thirteen-week period which was mandated by the courts below. Mr. Gross alternatively argues that, even if the circuit court\u2019s and Court of Special Appeals\u2019 view of the regulation were correct, the case should have been remanded to the Commission for that agency to set forth its reasoning for deviating from the thirteen-week period.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">The employer and insurer argue that the circuit court\u2019s determination, that the thirteen-week period should be used for establishing Mr. Gross\u2019s average weekly wage, should be treated as a finding of fact in a <em>de novo </em>judicial review proceeding. According to the employer and insurer, this \u201cfact finding\u201d is not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d under Maryland Rule 8-131(c). The thrust of the employer\u2019s and insurer\u2019s argument, however, is that the provisions of the Commission\u2019s Rule 5 must \u201cbe followed unless there is a justified reason to deviate from them\u201d (brief at 12), and that the Commission in this case \u201cdisregardfed] its promulgated\u201d regulation <em>(id. </em>at 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The Subsequent Injury Fund contends that the thirteen-week period prescribed by Rule 5 for determining an employee\u2019s average weekly wage should be utilized unless sufficient reasons exist for deviating from that period and such reasons are set forth by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Initially, we must decide if the decisions of both courts below were based on a circuit court finding of fact, as argued by the employer and insurer, or if they were rulings on an issue of law, as contended by the claimant and as conceded in oral argument by the Subsequent Injury Fund. In our view, it is clear that the circuit court\u2019s decision was not premised upon the resolution of a factual issue by that court. Instead, both courts below decided this case as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>There were no disputed facts or disputed inferences in this case. Mr. Gross\u2019s testimony before the Commission and before the circuit court indicated that he was a full-time employee at the time of his injury and during the year preceding his injury. It was undisputed that the wage statement submitted by the employer accurately reflected Mr. Gross\u2019s average weekly wage during the thirteen-week period immediately preceding the injury. It was also undisputed that the W-2 form submitted by Mr. Gross accurately reflected his wages for the calendar year preceding the injury. The thirteen-week period urged by the employer and insurer, and the fifty-two-week period urged by the claimant, were the only two bases for determining Mr. Gross\u2019s average weekly wage submitted by any party. No other basis was suggested. The only disputed issue before the circuit court, before the Court of Special Appeals, and before this Court, has been whether, under the Commission\u2019s Rule 5, the Commission was required to use the thirteen-week period instead of the fifty-two-week period reflected by the W-2 form.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Moreover, the circuit court expressly acknowledged in its opinion that it was making no factual determination of the claimant\u2019s average weekly wage and that the issue before it was one of law. The circuit judge stated at 'the outset of his opinion as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">\u201cThe <em>only fact finding </em>the Court will state for the record is that the evidence is uncontradicted that the claimant in this case, Mr. Irving Gross, was at the time of his injury, and the year preceding his injury, a full-time employee as defined by law, and as interpreted by the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">\u201cThis is a non-jury case appealed from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission <em>on the sole legal issue </em>of whether the Commission erred in calculating the elaimant/appellee\u2019s award based upon an average of the claimant\u2019s wages over a 52 week period as evidenced by his W-2 form, rather than upon an average of wages earned over a 13 week period immediately preceding his accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The remainder of the circuit judge\u2019s opinion confirms that the sole basis for the court\u2019s reversal of the Commission\u2019s decision was the court\u2019s conclusion that the Commission erred as a matter of law. The circuit judge\u2019s opinion did not find as a fact or intimate that, based on the evidence introduced, the average wages paid over a thirteen-week period best represented Mr. Gross\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage.\u201d Instead, the thirteen-week period was based entirely upon the Commission\u2019s Rule 5. After indicating that Rule 5 was the \u201cpertinent rule\u201d and that, under it, \u201ccompensation payments shall be based on the average weekly wages earned during the 13 weeks before the accident,\u201d the circuit judge went on to criticize the Commission because the agency \u201cdid not state and articulate for the record that it had used other means, that they found that it was totally unfair and totally contrary to the benevolent and social policies of the Workers\u2019 Compensation law to use the 13 week period.... \u201d With respect to the \u201cunless otherwise ordered\u201d language in the regulation, the circuit judge indicated that the Commission in determining a claimant\u2019s average weekly wage \u201cdoes not [have] a great deal of latitude and flexibility.\u201d The circuit judge continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-4\">\u201cThe rule itself says that unless otherwise ordered at the hearing. And I think there they are leaving the door open where the Commission could say, this man is a seasonal worker, and we cannot use the immediate 13 weeks prior to his accident, because it would not fairly represent, it would be totally inequitable because of the very peculiar job he has of working beach umbrellas, or he only cuts wood in the wintertime or he only does certain things that are related to summer or fall that it would not be fair to him in the way of compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Later, the judge reiterated that the Commission could depart from the thirteen-week period if the Commission could \u201carticulate [justification] for the record\u201d but that the Commission failed to do so here. \u201cThey did not give the appellants any justification. They did not justify going from the immediate 13 weeks prior to\u201d the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals adopted the same approach as the circuit court, holding that under the Commission\u2019s Rule 5, the Commission is to determine a claimant\u2019s average weekly wage based upon \u201cthe thirteen weeks before the accident,\u201d that the Commission \u201cis not locked into the thirteen week period if the circumstances or facts in a particular case warrant a reasonable alternative\u201d basis, but that \u201c[departure from the Rule must be articulated by the Commission setting forth the factual basis for the decision rendered\u201d and such \u201carticulation was not set forth in this case,\u201d 85 Md.App. at 734, 584 A.2d at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Therefore, the issue in this case has consistently been treated as one of law, relating to the interpretation and application of an agency regulation. Specifically, the issue is whether, when the Commission departs from utilizing the thirteen-week period prescribed by Rule 5, the Commission must set forth findings or reasons justifying its departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Finally, treating the issue in this case as one of law is consistent with this Court\u2019s prior opinions. Where the \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d issue in a workers\u2019 compensation case has not depended upon a resolution of disputed facts, but instead has concerned the <em>method </em>for determining the injured worker\u2019s average weekly wage, this Court has held that the \u201cquestion is one of law.\u201d <em>Stevenson v. Hill, </em>171 Md. 572, 573, 189 A. 910, 911 (1937). <em>See Crowner v. Balto. Butchers Ass\u2019n, </em>226 Md. 606, 175 A.2d 7 (1961); <em>Merrill v. Military Department, </em>152 Md. 474, 136 A. 897 (1927); <em>Picanardi v. Emerson Hotel Co., </em>135 Md. 92, 108 A. 483 (1919).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Consequently, the issue before us is whether the courts below correctly interpreted and applied Commission Rule 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The critical language of the Commission\u2019s Rule 5 is that, \u201cunless otherwise ordered after the hearing, compensation payments shall be based on ... the average weekly wage earned by the employee during the 13 weeks before the accident.\u201d As previously discussed, both courts below recognized that this language authorizes the Commission, after a hearing, to depart from the thirteen-week period. The circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals held, however, that whenever the Commission decides to do so, it is required to set forth expressly its findings or reasons justifying the departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The language of the regulation itself does not contain the requirement of specific findings or reasons which the courts below imposed. Instead, the only requirement set forth in the regulation for departing from the thirteen-week period is that there be a hearing. The Commission in this case held a hearing and then entered its order which included a finding that the claimant\u2019s average weekly wage was $400.00, based on the fifty-two-week period shown by the W-2 form. This procedure would seem to satisfy the requirements of Rule 5. No other regulations or statutory provisions or administrative law principles applicable to the Commission, which have been called to our attention, require more specific findings or reasons in this situation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>As previously noted, <em>supra </em>n. 3, prior to the promulgation of a regulation specifying a time period for calculating a injured worker\u2019s average weekly wage, the Commission was free to choose an appropriate period on a case-by-case basis. Several cases in this Court have recognized that an injured worker\u2019s average weekly wage can be based on a one year period. <em>Crowner v. Balto. Butchers Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>226 Md. at 608, 175 A.2d at 8 (the Commission used a fifty-two-week period, and its determination was upheld); <em>Stevenson v. Hill, supra, </em>171 Md. at 574, 189 A. at 911 (\u201cthe Commission adopted ... a year\u2019s earnings instead of those during six months, as the basis of computation\u201d); <em>Merrill v. Military Department, supra, </em>152 Md. at 479-480, 136 A. at 899 (recognizes that \u201cannual earnings\u201d are ordinarily an appropriate basis).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The Commission\u2019s Rule 5 appears to be designed to address the vast majority of cases in which there is no hearing. In such cases, it provides a definite rule in lieu of a case-by-case basis. The regulation also supplies a standard in those cases in which there is a hearing but where no question arises concerning the appropriate time period or where the Commission decides that it should not depart from the thirteen-week rule. Nevertheless, contrary to the view of the courts below, in a case where there is a hearing, the regulation does not purport to restrict the Commission in any manner from utilizing a different time period if the Commission deems it appropriate to do so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CALVERT COUNTY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE ORDER OF THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION COMMISSION.

At the time <em>Campbell Coal </em>was decided, the Commission had not promulgated a regulation fixing the time period for determining average weekly wage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b87-6\">. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the usual Maryland administrative law requirement of findings <em>on </em>disputed factual issues is not ordinarily applicable to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. Generally, administrative agencies, in rendering a decision in an adjudicatory or quasi-judicial proceeding after a hearing, must \" \u2018resolve all significant conflicts in the evidence and then chronicle, in the record, full, complete and detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.' \u201d <em>United Steelworkers v. Beth. Steel, </em>298 Md. 665, 678, 472 A.2d 62, 69 (1984), quoting <em>State Commission on Human Relations v. Malakoff, </em>273 Md. 214, 229, 329 A.2d 8, 17 (1974). And, \"in judicial review of agency action, the court may not uphold the agency order unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for reasons stated by the agency.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers v. Beth. Steel, supra, 298 </em>Md. at 679, 472 A.2d at 69. See, <em>e.g., Mossburg v. Montgomery County, Md., </em>329 Md. 494, 507, 620 A.2d 886, 893 (1993); <em>Harford County v.

These principles are not ordinarily applicable to the Workers' Compensation Commission, a unique agency whose decisions are normally subject to <em>de novo </em>judicial review. <em>Tobacco Company v. Goslin, </em>163 Md. 74, 78, 160 A. 804, 806 (1932). <em>See Furley v. Warren-Ehret Co., </em>195 Md. 339, 345, 73 A.2d 497, 499 (1950); <em>Moore v.

Hill, </em>171 Md. 572, 189 A. 910 (1937). That case, decided prior to the promulgation of a regulation specifying a time period for determining a claimant\u2019s average weekly wage, is distinguishable. In <em>Stevenson, </em>the claimant sought to introduce evidence of what his earnings would have been if economic conditions had been better. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Here, Mr. Gross presented evidence of his actual past earnings, which the Commission appropriately used as a basis for determining his earning capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
