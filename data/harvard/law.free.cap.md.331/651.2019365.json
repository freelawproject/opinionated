Gilliam was found guilty of first degree murder of Christine Doerfler, robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, kidnapping, and related weapons offenses. The State notified Gilliam of its intent to seek the death penalty, and Gilliam elected to be sentenced by the court. Almost five months after the trial, a sentencing hearing was held before Judge Fader, and, as a result of that hearing, Gilliam was sentenced to death for the murder of Ms. Doerfler.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">On direct appeal, this Court affirmed the conviction and sentence. <em>Gilliam v. State, </em>320 Md. 637, 579 A.2d 744 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1110, 111 S.Ct. 1024, 112 L.Ed.2d 1106 (1991). Gilliam filed a petition for post conviction relief, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>hearing was held on that petition. The circuit court, Turnbull, J., issued an opinion and order denying post conviction relief. This Court granted Gilliam\u2019s application for leave to appeal from the denial of post conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The facts that led to Gilliam\u2019s conviction and sentence were set out in Gilliam\u2019s first appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">\u201cDuring the early morning hours of Saturday, December 3, 1988, the body of Christine Doerfler (Ms. Doerfler) was found slumped over the wheel of her Nissan Sentra automobile. She had been shot in the back of the head with a sawed-off shotgun. The following facts were adduced at the trial of Appellant, Tyrone D. Gilliam, Jr. (Gilliam).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">On Thursday afternoon, December 1, Gilliam and the Drummond brothers, Kelvin LeGrant Drummond (Kelvin) and Delano Anthony Drummond (Tony), sat in a friend\u2019s apartment and got high on cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol. With them they had a sawed-off Winchester pump shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The three men talked about \u201cwhat was going to happen, since [they] had the shotgun, and that is when Tony and Tyrone [Gilliam] came up with the idea of going to Harford County.\u2019 They discussed their plans for \u2018Friday and like fantasiz[ed] like what [they were] going to do. Tyrone [Gilliam] said that he was going to kill a bitch.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The next day, the threesome drove to Harford County in a Nova they had stolen earlier in the week. Each was wearing a stolen snowsuit and gloves taken from a sporting goods store Kelvin had recently burglarized. Gilliam carried the sawed-off shotgun inside his snowsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">After reaching Harford County at about 2:00 p.m., the three men visited a friend\u2019s apartment and \u2018smoked some greens.\u2019 At about 6:00 p.m. they left the apartment, and with Kelvin behind the wheel, they drove the Nova to Baltimore County. There they stopped at the entrance of a townhouse development \u2018[b]eeause [they were] planning on robbing somebody.\u2019 Kelvin put on the hazard lights of the Nova, feigning trouble, and they waited for a victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Still waiting at the entrance of the townhouse complex, the three men watched as a ear approached. This first car was driven by a man. Gilliam and Tony told Kelvin not to follow the car. At about 7:45 p.m., Ms. Doerfler pulled her Nissan Sentra into the parking lot of her sister\u2019s townhouse complex. The men had their victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">As Ms. Doerfler pulled into a parking spot, Kelvin pulled the Nova in back of her Sentra. Ms. Doerfler was getting out of her car, but had not yet shut her door, when Tyrone and Tony jumped out of the Nova. They pushed their way into her car and forced her to drive down Belair Road while Kelvin followed in the Nova.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Because he was not certain of any plan, Kelvin signaled the lead car to join him in the rear lot of a Channel store. Both cars stopped and Tony got out of Ms. Doerfler\u2019s car to tell Kelvin that \u2018she didn\u2019t have no money\u2019 but that she had a Signet bank card. Tony rejoined Gilliam and Ms. Doerfler in the lead car and the two cars continued to drive in tandem to find a Signet Bank. Eventually, they turned into Town and Country at the end of Gum Spring Road in Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The cars stopped, and Kelvin pulled the Nova beside Ms. Doerfler\u2019s Sentra. Tony Drummond then got out of the Sentra and took Ms. Doerfler\u2019s car keys -with him. He joined his brother Kelvin in the Nova, leaving Ms. Doerfler alone with Gilliam.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The two brothers sat in the Nova talking and waited for Gilliam to join them. Kelvin testified that it was at this point that he looked up and saw Gilliam standing outside Ms. Doerfler\u2019s car on the driver\u2019s side. Ms. Doerfler was still sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. Kelvin could see Gilliam standing with one arm on the hood of Ms. Doerfler\u2019s car, leaning down talking to her. In his other hand he held the shotgun, grasping it in the center on the pump area, his arm fully extended down. Kelvin then turned to his brother Tony for a cigarette. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">\u2018That is when I lit my cigarette up. That is when I heard this loud bang. You could see the flash. When I turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>around, I couldn\u2019t see the girl. I could just see her hair and the coat. She was like face first into the steering wheel.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Gilliam quickly rejoined the brothers in the Nova and the three drove off, leaving Ms. Doerfler at the dead-end of Gum Spring Road. Kelvin asked Gilliam why he did it and Gilliam answered, \u2018because she saw [my] face.\u2019 They had stolen three dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">A few days later on December 5, 1988, at about 3:15 a.m., Trooper Gary D. Kulick of the Maryland State Police was on patrol in Harford County when he received a broadcast over his radio that an \u2018incident\u2019 had occurred near his patrol. He was told to look out for two cars driving on Route 40. Minutes later, Trooper Kulick spotted the cars\u2014 a gold, four-door, Toyota Camry followed by a Dodge Colt. The vehicles drove in tandem at a distance of about two to three car lengths and traveled at a speed of 50 m.p.h. in a posted 55 m.p.h. zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Trooper Kulick positioned his cruiser so that the approaching cars would not see him. He then received another broadcast which gave the license tag number of the Colt. He radioed the police barrack that he had spotted the cars and asked for back-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">Deputy Buchannan of the Harford County Sheriffs Department came to his assistance. The Deputy signaled the Toyota Camry to pull off the road, which it did, and Kelvin Drummond was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">The Toyota, however, which Trooper Kulick attempted to stop, sped away. A high-speed pursuit ensued, reaching speeds of over 100 m.p.h. The chase ended only when the Toyota, unable to pass a pick-up truck, spun around and hit the median retainer wall head-on. The driver, bleeding from the forehead, was Gilliam.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">Gilliam was arrested and his car searched. The search netted a loaded, sawed-off shotgun lodged between the front door and the driver\u2019s seat of the car. The shotgun had three shells in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>At about 3:50 a.m., Trooper Kulick left the accident scene with Gilliam and took him to the Fallston General Hospital emergency room. Gilliam received treatment and was visited by his mother. He was released from the hospital at 6:10 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Gilliam was taken to the Maryland State Police Barracks in Bel Air, Maryland, where he was directed to a holding cell. More than 12 hours after his arrest, at approximately 4:45 p.m., Gilliam was removed from his holding cell and walked 30 to 40 feet into an interview room where he was questioned by Corporal Ryan and Detective Naylor of the Baltimore County Police Department. Although Gilliam at first denied committing the murder, he ultimately confessed after being confronted with statements Kelvin Drummond had made to police. Gilliam made both oral and tape recorded confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Gilliam was then charged with murder, robbery with a deadly weapon, kidnapping, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. Pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 412(b), the State timely notified Gilliam that if a conviction of first-degree murder was returned, it would seek the death penalty. Kelvin Drummond was also indicted and pleaded guilty to first degree murder of Christine Doerfler. However, Kelvin Drummond made an agreement with the State that, if he testified for the State at Gilliam\u2019s trial, the State would recommend that Kelvin receive a sentence no more severe than life with the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore County held a hearing on June 5, 1989, to consider Gilliam\u2019s motion to suppress his statements to police. The motion was denied. Presiding without a jury, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Fader, J.) conducted a trial on the merits on June 5-7, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The State\u2019s case against Gilliam consisted of three elements: The testimony of Kelvin Drummond; Gilliam\u2019s high-speed flight from police in a car containing a sawed-off shotgun; and Gilliam\u2019s statements made to police after he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>was brought into the police barracks. [The defense evidence consisted of four character witnesses, at least one of whom opined that, based on Gilliam\u2019s good character, the shooting must have been accidental.] The trial court found Gilliam guilty of murder in the first degree (on theories of both premeditated murder and felony murder), guilty of robbery with a deadly weapon, guilty of kidnapping, and guilty of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The trial judge conducted a hearing on June 23, 1989 to determine whether Gilliam elected to be sentenced by the court or by a jury. Gilliam elected to be sentenced by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">On October 30-31, 1989, Judge Fader, sitting without a jury, found that Gilliam was a principal in the first degree of the murder of Christine Doerfler and, as an aggravating factor, found that the murder was committed during the course of a kidnapping, Md.Code (1957,1987 RepLVol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 413(d)(4), and robbery, Art. 27, \u00a7 413(d)(10). The court found no mitigating factors. Gilliam was sentenced to death.\u201d (Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\"><em>Gilliam, </em>320 Md. at 642-45, 579 A.2d at 746-48. Additional facts will be set forth in our discussion of the issues raised by Gilliam in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">I. Was Gilliam denied his Sixth Amendment Right to Effective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Throughout pretrial motions, trial, and sentencing, Gilliam was represented by Donald Daneman, a privately retained counsel. Following his sentencing and appeal and after a meticulous scrutiny of Daneman\u2019s representation, Gilliam, now represented by the Office of the Public Defender, filed a petition for post conviction relief under Maryland Code (1957, 1992 RepLVol.), Article 27, \u00a7 645A. In his petition for post conviction relief and subsequent appeal of its denial, Gilliam fires a salvo of accusations of ineffective assistance of counsel. A few of them are patently frivolous. One example is the complaint that \u201cDaneman neglected to consult with an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>on sleep deprivation\u201d prior to the hearing on the motion to suppress Gilliam\u2019s confession. Consultation with an expert on sleep deprivation seems unnecessary, to say the least, since (1) Gilliam never claimed that he was suffering from sleep deprivation, and (2) Gilliam was alone in a cell for approximately ten hours prior to his tape recorded confession and had ample opportunity to sleep prior to his confession had he been tired.</p>\n<p id=\"AQk\">In his brief, Gilliam alleges the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">\u201cSpecifically, counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in the following ways: A) Failing to develop and present mitigation evidence; B) Failure to investigate; C) Failure to prepare witnesses; D) Failure to prepare for sentencing; E) Failure to prepare for trial; F) Failure to advise and make recommendation as to judge or jury trial and sentencing; G) Failure to advise of the advantages of a jury sentencing under <em>Mills v. Maryland </em>[486 U.S. 367, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d 348 (1988) ]; H) Failure to advise of the defense of not criminally responsible; I) Failure to prepare for the hearing on Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress; J) Failure, at trial, to argue the voluntariness of Petitioner\u2019s statement.\u201d (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We shall deal with the material aspects of these general allegations and will attempt to do so in what we hope is a more logical order than they are presented in Gilliam\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In reviewing Daneman\u2019s representation of Gilliam, we must keep in mind that <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), requires that defense counsel\u2019s representation meet \u201can objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693. \u201cThe proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694. The Sixth Amendment does not require the best possible defense or that every attorney render a perfect defense. In order to be deficient, counsel\u2019s acts or omissions must be \u201coutside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695. \u201c \u2018[A] court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u201cmight be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Thomas, </em>325 Md. 160, 171, 599 A.2d 1171, 1176 (1992) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694-95) (citation omitted). The courts should not, aided by hindsight, second guess counsel\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">A. <em>The Suppression Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The primary allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel at the hearing to suppress Gilliam\u2019s confession are that (1) Daneman failed to adequately prepare for the hearing; and (2) Daneman failed to prepare Gilliam for his testimony at the hearing. The facts adduced at the suppression hearing are rather simple and straightforward.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Gilliam was arrested in the early morning hours of December 5, 1988, two days after the murder, following a high-speed chase which ended when Gilliam\u2019s car collided with a median wall. The police took Gilliam to a local hospital, where he was treated and released to police custody. Prior to being interrogated, he was detained in a holding cell for over ten hours. When his interrogation began over twelve hours after his arrest, Gilliam was asked to read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> aloud, and did so. Gilliam also initialed and signed a <em>Miranda </em>rights waiver. The interrogation officers testified that Gilliam was coherent, responsive, and did not appear to be suffering from the effects of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Gilliam testified at the suppression hearing that the only effect his drug use had on him at the time of his confession was that it made him \u201cparanoid\u201d and \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d When asked if he understood his <em>Miranda </em>warnings when he signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the waiver form he replied, \u201cin a way I understood and in a way I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">1. Failure to Prepare for the Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Gilliam\u2019s complaints can be summed up by the statement in his brief that \u201cDaneman failed to develop any evidence relating to Petitioner\u2019s drug use or head injury or sleep deprivation as they impacted upon the voluntariness of his statement.\u201d Gilliam contends that Daneman failed to obtain information from Trooper Wilson, who was on the scene of Gilliam\u2019s automobile accident immediately prior to his arrest and whose accident report characterized Gilliam\u2019s head injury as incapacitating, rather than one of the other two types of injury listed on the form, <em>i.e., </em>non-incapacitating or fatal. In light of the assessment of Gilliam\u2019s condition at the hospital, we fail to see how Trooper Wilson\u2019s assessment of Gilliam\u2019s condition would have any probative value. Additionally, Gilliam contends Daneman failed to obtain information from Gilliam\u2019s mother and two other witnesses, who could corroborate his physical condition and drug use prior to his arrest. Gilliam ignores or minimizes, however, the following facts. Daneman did consult with Dr. Ramamurthy, a specialist in internal medicine, who upon reviewing the hospital reports detailing Gilliam\u2019s medical treatment after his arrest, concluded that it would be difficult to present expert testimony on mental impairment at the time of the confession. The hospital report indicated Gilliam never lost consciousness after the accident and that he was alert and understood what was happening. Gilliam had advised Daneman before the suppression hearing that he \u201cknew what [he] was saying,\u201d that \u201che was not intoxicated\u201d when he confessed, and that he confessed after he was told Kelvin Drummond confessed because he \u201chad the presence of mind to try and establish a defense of accidental shooting.\u201d Further, Gilliam did not give his statement to the police until over twelve hours after his arrest and after he had been left alone in a cell for approximately ten hours prior to his interrogation, thus militating against any claim of intoxication or sleep deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>In response to Gilliam\u2019s prior contentions about his confession, we have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u201cBut even if Gilliam had argued that his waiver was involuntarily given due to prior drug use, we would point out here, as we have in a <em>pre-Miranda </em>decision, that as long as a statement is freely and voluntarily given at a time when the accused understands what he is saying, the fact that the accused may be under the influence of narcotics does not necessarily make the statement inadmissible. <em>Bryant v. State, </em>229 Md. 531, 536, 185 A.2d 190, 192-93 (1962). The same would be true for any effects caused by the laceration on his forehead. <em>See Hadder v. State, </em>238 Md. 341, 357, 209 A.2d 70, 79 (1965) (physical injury does not affect admissibility as long as the disclosure is freely and voluntarily made at a time when the accused knows and understands what he is saying).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\"><em>Gilliam, </em>320 Md. at 650, 579 A.2d at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Faced with the evidence of the voluntariness of Gilliam\u2019s tape recorded confession as well as with Gilliam\u2019s tacit acknowledgment of its voluntariness, Daneman did as much as could reasonably be expected. Gilliam has failed to prove Daneman rendered ineffective assistance in his preparation for or representation during the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">2. Preparation of Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Gilliam makes another allegation that relates to the suppression hearing, but also impacts on other aspects of Daneman\u2019s preparation. He states: \u201cPerhaps the most telling deficiency in Daneman\u2019s performance with respect to the suppression hearing was his complete failure to prepare Petitioner for his testimony.\u201d Gilliam expands this allegation to include the trial and sentencing phase and complains that \u201cstarting with the suppression hearing and continuing through sentencing, Daneman\u2019s complete failure to prepare witnesses severely impaired Petitioner\u2019s defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Daneman testified that he did have extensive conversations with Gilliam about the suppression issues. Consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>with the general rule disfavoring unduly influencing witnesses, Daneman indicated that he had adopted a practice of not reviewing specific questions and answers with clients or witnesses. He did, however, adhere to a policy of reviewing the general subject of each witness\u2019s testimony. This is all that is required of an attorney. <em>See State v. Earp, </em>319 Md. 156, 170-72, 571 A.2d 1227, 1234-35 (1990) (describing the cloudy line between permissible witness preparation and improper influence of a witness\u2019s testimony and cautioning attorneys to \u201cexercise great care to avoid suggesting to the witness what his or her testimony shall be.\u201d). Gilliam\u2019s general complaint of failure to prepare witnesses is without merit. We shall deal with one, more specific, part of this allegation in part I.C.6, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">B. <em>Trial Errors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">1. Failure to Advise and Make Recommendations as to Judge or Jury Trial and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Gilliam contends that Daneman was deficient in not making a recommendation as to whether he should opt for a court or jury trial and sentencing. At the post conviction hearing, Gilliam called William C. Brennan, Jr., who was qualified as an expert in handling death penalty cases. Mr. Brennan opined that an attorney \u201chas a duty to make a recommendation\u201d as to court or jury trial and sentencing. Mr. Brennan, however, also testified that it would be impossible for him to say what advice Daneman should have given or even if one mode was preferable over the other in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Daneman testified that he advised Gilliam at length and on several occasions regarding the decision to elect court or jury trial and sentencing. Daneman further testified that his practice is to tell the client that the ultimate decision must be made by the client. Daneman did not attempt to influence Gilliam\u2019s decision by making any recommendation of his own, although Gilliam\u2019s mother, Mary Gilliam, apparently recommended to Gilliam that he elect a court trial and court sentencing because she believed Judge Fader was a \u201creligious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>person\u201d and would be the fairest possible trier of fact. Gilliam also expressed fear about how a jury would view his crime and ultimately elected a court trial and court sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Election of court or jury trial and/or sentencing is a decision for the defendant. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-246; <em>Bruce v. State, </em>328 Md. 594, 602-608, 616 A.2d 392, 396-99 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 2936, 124 L.Ed.2d 686 (1993). There was no indication that, in the instant case, one would have been preferable over the other and no reason why Daneman should have attempted to influence Gilliam\u2019s decision by making a recommendation. We therefore find no ineffective assistance in Daneman\u2019s failure to make a recommendation in the instant case as to whether Gilliam should elect to have his trial and his sentencing before a court or jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">2. Failure to Prepare for Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Gilliam argues that Daneman was deficient in arguing only an accident defense at trial, and not exploring alternative defenses. Although Gilliam initially told Daneman that he shot Ms. Doerfler accidentally, during a subsequent interview prior to trial, however, Gilliam changed his story and told Daneman \u201cit was not an accident, I killed her because she could have identified [Tony]. She saw his face.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">At the guilt/innocence trial, Daneman relied on the defense of accident which was consistent with Gilliam\u2019s confession to the police. There was never any suggestion that the accident defense was either inappropriate or inadequately presented. Indeed, Gilliam\u2019s expert on criminal defense representation, William C. Brennan, Jr., acknowledged that \u201cMr. Daneman did a pretty good job on the accident defense at trial.\u201d Gilliam does not now challenge the accident defense, but claims in his brief that Daneman \u201cfailed to make any attempt to develop an alternative defense.... Petitioner\u2019s initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>claim that the shooting was an accident did not relieve Dane-man of his responsibility to investigate and develop all defenses that may be available under the facts and the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Gilliam shot Ms. Doerfler in the back of the head with a shotgun after robbing and kidnapping her. He did so in the presence of two witnesses who were in another car some distance away, and he confessed to the police, albeit claiming the gun went off accidently. Daneman was clearly not ineffective because he failed to \u201cinvestigate and develop an alternative defense.\u201d <em>See Lindsey v. Smith, </em>820 F.2d 1137, 1152 (11th Cir.1987) (a defendant \u201cwho proposes an alternative trial strategy that would itself have proved futile has failed to demonstrate that the [attorney\u2019s] representation at trial fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 U.S. 1059, 109 S.Ct. 1327, 103 L.Ed.2d 595 (1989); <em>Jones v. United States, </em>512 A.2d 253, 262-63 (D.C.1986) (\u201cAssuming ... that [an alternative] defense would be a valid defense as a matter of law, counsel\u2019s failure to pursue it appears to have been a tactical judgment\u201d and did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel when such judgment was reasonable). Daneman obviously chose to pursue the best and probably the only legitimate trial defense. The claim that Daneman should have \u201cdeveloped\u201d an alternative trial defense is at best frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">3. Failure to Pursue the Defense of Not Criminally Responsible</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Among potential alternative defenses, Gilliam specifically asserts that Daneman should have pursued the defense of not criminally responsible. Daneman\u2019s reasons for not pursuing this defense, however, were based, in part, on his discussions with his client. Daneman testified at the post conviction hearing that he and Gilliam \u201cdiscussed whether he understood what he was doing, could he appreciate what he was doing, and you have to understand that my client told me that what he had done, ... it was a cold blooded murder.\u201d At the pretrial motions hearing, Daneman recited for the record, in Gilliam\u2019s presence, that he and Gilliam had jointly decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>not to file a plea of not criminally responsible. As we noted in Gilliam\u2019s first appeal: \u201cThe record establishes that defense counsel discussed the plea option with his client and that Gilliam was included in the decision to forgo a plea of \u2018not criminally responsible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gilliam, </em>320 Md. at 665, 579 A.2d at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Even had Gilliam not concurred in the decision, no expert witness has ever opined that Gilliam was, by virtue of a mental disorder, not criminally responsible at the time of the murder. Dr. Ellen McDaniel and Dr. David Shapiro testified to their opinions that Gilliam met the mitigating factor under Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 413(g)(4) that by virtue of a mental disorder Gilliam was \u201csubstantially impaired\u201d in his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. Neither expert opined, however, that Gilliam met the statute\u2019s test for a finding of not criminally responsible under Md.Code (1982, 1990 Repl.Vol.), Health-General Article, \u00a7 12-108, which requires, in relevant part, that at the time of the offense, by virtue of a mental disorder, he \u201clacks substantial capacity\u201d to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. There is a difference between <em>lacking substantial </em>capacity and having <em>substantially impaired </em>capacity. The post conviction judge made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-5r\">\u201cThere is no doubt in this Court\u2019s mind that the Defendant did not meet the standards of Not Criminally Responsible. The Defendant\u2019s confession, Counsel\u2019s interviews with the Defendant, a report from Dr. Rubin, discussions with the Defendant\u2019s family and lastly the letter from the Defendant himself [admitting he had \u2018cold bloodedly killed someone\u2019] all support this finding of fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Based upon the evidence in the record, we conclude that these findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">4. Failure to Argue Involuntariness of Gilliam\u2019s Confession at Trial</p>\n<p id=\"Avz\">Gilliam also claims Daneman\u2019s representation was deficient because, after the denial of the motion to suppress Gilliam\u2019s confession, Daneman did not raise the issue of volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>tariness again at trial. Even if this was an oversight on Daneman\u2019s part, it in no way prejudiced Gilliam\u2019s defense. Judge Fader was the trier of fact both at the suppression hearing and at trial. Judge Fader can be presumed to know the law and to know, even without Daneman reminding him, that a confession cannot be considered by the trier of fact unless it is found to be voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Brittingham v. State, </em>306 Md. 654, 665, 511 A.2d 45, 49-50 (1986). As <em>Strickland </em>points out: \u201cThe assessment of prejudice should proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision.\u201d 466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698. We should assume that Judge Fader did not need to be reminded that he could not consider Gilliam\u2019s confession unless he found that confession voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, Daneman\u2019s failure to argue this issue in no way prejudiced Gilliam\u2019s defense. We might also note that, in light of the facts, there was little Daneman could argue to Judge Fader in challenging the voluntariness of Gilliam\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">C. <em>Sentencing Hearing Errors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Gilliam alleges a number of instances of ineffective assistance by Daneman at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">1. Failure to Present Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"A15\">Gilliam first suggests that Daneman failed to effectively pursue, at the sentencing hearing, mitigating factors of duress and substantial mental impairment. We note that prior to the death penalty sentencing hearing, Daneman asked Gilliam to put his thoughts about the crime in writing. Gilliam wrote a letter to Daneman which stated in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjL\">\u201cI\u2019m not sure about how I should start this letter. Even though this letter will not be taken to court with me, I still feel as though I might say the wrong thing. I\u2019m not the young man that I appear to be by my past actions. I am looking at my case from both sides, so please; don\u2019t think that I\u2019m crazy. <em>I have reasons why I think that I should be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number><em>given the death penalty, and reasons why I shouldn\u2019t be given the death penalty. I\u2019ve cold bloodedly killed someone. I had no reason for it, and it\u2019s hard for me to deal with the fact that it\u2019s all over. </em>It\u2019s even hard for me to \"write down the reasons why I think I should live. I don\u2019t want to die, even though it sounds that way; but I do deserve every bit of death. I\u2019ve caused a lot of hurt, just by pulling a trigger one time. And it doesn\u2019t feel good. I will never forget what I have done.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In this letter, Gilliam acknowledges his cold blooded killing and in no way suggests the mitigating factors of duress or substantial mental impairment which he now claims Daneman should have more effectively pursued at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Nonetheless, Daneman\u2019s sentencing hearing preparation included a review of each of the statutory mitigating factors, as well as potential non-statutory mitigating factors. Ultimately, Daneman in fact decided to pursue both duress and substantial mental impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The mitigating factor of duress was generated by a statement Gilliam made to the defense psychologist, David Shapiro, Ph.D., that Gilliam shot Ms. Doerfler because he was afraid of what Tony would do to him if he didn\u2019t kill her. Daneman argued duress as a mitigating factor in spite of circumstances refuting that defense, including (1) in his tape recorded confession, Gilliam asserted accident, not duress; (2) the day before the murder, Gilliam stated to the Drummond brothers that he wanted to \u201ckill a bitch\u201d; (3) Gilliam never alleged to anyone that Tony directly ordered him to kill Doerfler; and (4) it is difficult to infer that Gilliam, armed with a sawed-off shotgun, was acting out of fear of an unarmed friend who was sitting in a car some distance away.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">As for the defense of substantial mental impairment, Dane-man also presented evidence at the sentencing hearing of the mitigating factor that Gilliam committed the murder while his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>tially impaired as a result of mental disorder and drugs. Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 413(g)(8). Dr. Shapiro testified that there was a \u201csubstantial impairment\u201d of Gilliam\u2019s ability to conform his conduct to law \u201cbased on the combination of unstable personality disorder and the ingestion of drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">There was no other available evidence that Gilliam was substantially impaired because the two psychiatrists retained to examine Gilliam, Dr. Neil Blumberg and Dr. Ellen McDaniel, told Daneman prior to the sentencing hearing that they could not express an opinion as to the existence of such substantial impairment, and they were not called as witnesses. Dr. Blumberg explained to Daneman before the sentencing hearing that Gilliam\u2019s acknowledgment of complete awareness of his act of murder precluded any conclusion that Gilliam\u2019s ingestion of drugs was a significant factor in the killing. Dr. Blumberg told Daneman: \u201cThe Defendant did consider some alternatives because he stood outside of the car with a gun for one and one-half minutes thinking of what to do before he shot the young girl.\u201d Dr. Blumberg also advised Daneman that \u201cthis case is a cold blooded execution. Intoxication played a part, but unfortunately he was not under duress or intimidated,\u201d and \u201che can\u2019t mitigate on the grounds of substantial impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Thus, in spite of Gilliam\u2019s claim to the contrary, Daneman did present evidence on the mitigating factors of duress and substantial mental impairment and pursued those factors to the extent possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">2. Daneman\u2019s Lack of Death Penalty Litigation Experience and Failure to have Co-Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Gilliam\u2019s claim seems to be that Daneman had insufficient death penalty litigation experience, although he acknowledges that Daneman was an experienced defense counsel. In his brief, Gilliam alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\">\u201cDaneman, sole counsel at trial and sentencing, and inexperienced in death penalty litigation, failed to conduct legal research on the issue of mitigation, stating that his legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>research was \u2018in his brain.\u2019 Daneman did not begin to contemplate the sentencing phase of Petitioner\u2019s trial until after the guilty verdict.\u201d (Footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Daneman has been a member of the bar since 1961 and engaged in the practice of criminal law since his admission to the bar. He has been involved in \u201cthousands\u201d of cases and lectured for the Department of Justice. Daneman had represented a previous client in a murder case where the death penalty notice was sent by the State. The post conviction hearing judge found that \u201c[b]ased upon all of the evidence and testimony this Court finds as a fact that defense counsel was experienced and more than competent to handle a capital case.\u201d This finding is well supported in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Gilliam\u2019s expert witness opined that representing a defendant in a capital murder without a \u201csecond chair\u201d was inadequate representation as a matter of law. We disagree and further note that Daneman had more than adequate assistance. Daneman received assistance from a law clerk as well as from an associate in his law firm. Daneman also received substantial assistance from the Capital Defense Division of the Office of the Public Defender. This assistance included advice from other attorneys, assistance in retaining at least three experts, and a psychological family background assessment. All that <em>Strickland </em>requires is that a criminal defendant receives competent representation, falling within a professional standard of reasonableness. We find that Gilliam received such representation. Gilliam cites no case that recognizes a right to multiple counsel, and we refuse to create such a requirement. As long as a defendant receives adequate representation, it may be provided by a single attorney acting without a \u201csecond chair\u201d at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">As for Gilliam\u2019s contention that Daneman failed to conduct legal research on the issue of mitigation, there was ample evidence that Daneman did an adequate review of potential mitigating factors, and there is no indication that additional legal research would have produced any additional mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>As for Gilliam\u2019s contention that Daneman did not begin to contemplate the sentencing phase of Gilliam\u2019s trial until after the guilty verdict, this was expressly refuted by Daneman. In fact, Daneman produced an internal office memorandum dated approximately one month before the commencement of the guilt/innocence trial which reviewed mitigation theories. We also note that, between the trial and sentencing, Daneman had five months to prepare for the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Finally, Gilliam contends that \u201cDaneman\u2019s failure to investigate also prevented him from establishing during the guilt/innocence phase evidence which would have supported mitigating circumstances at sentencing, namely, substantial impairment and duress.\u201d We have already noted that Daneman was justified in emphasizing only the defense of accident at Gilliam\u2019s trial. <em>See </em>Part I.B.2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">3. Failure to Advise of the Advantages of a Jury Sentencing Under <em>Mills v. Maryland</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Gilliam contends Daneman failed to adequately advise him of the advantages of a jury sentencing under <em>Mills v. Maryland, </em>486 U.S. 367, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988), in which the Supreme Court held that a jury must weigh aggravating against mitigating factors when even one juror finds that a mitigating circumstance exists. Although now presented in a somewhat different fashion, this argument has already been decided in Gilliam\u2019s first appeal. On direct appeal, Gilliam contended that the trial judge failed to properly advise him of the effect of <em>Mills v. Maryland. </em>Specifically, Gilliam contended that he should have been told that \u201cif some, but less than all, of the jurors believed that at least one mitigating factor existed and was not outweighed by the aggravating factor(s), the result would be a deadlocked jury. Once deadlocked, the jury could not impose a sentence of death.\u201d <em>Gilliam, </em>320 Md. at 662, 579 A.2d at 756. The record reflects that the trial judge did advise Gilliam that, if the jury became deadlocked or could not reach a decision in a reasonable amount of time, the sentence could not be death. With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>respect to Daneman\u2019s advice to Gilliam, we also stated in Gilliam\u2019s first appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">\u201c[T]he record is clear that Gilliam discussed the significance of the <em>Mills </em>decision with his attorney, as well as its effect on his election to be sentenced by the court. Before trial, when Gilliam was to elect whether to be tried by the court or by a jury, the trial court instructed him on the <em>Mills </em>decision. The court then asked if Gilliam understood the instruction and the record shows the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">\u2018THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">THE COURT: All right. Mr. Daneman, I take it you have been over this with your client before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">MR. DANEMAN: I have.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">At no time did defense counsel object to the court\u2019s <em>Mills </em>instruction. Further, it is clear that Gilliam\u2019s attorney had already thoroughly instructed him on the matter. Therefore, absent clear evidence that Gilliam was in doubt about the effect of <em>Mills </em>on his election to be tried and sentenced by the court, we presume that he was fully informed by his counsel. The ambiguity, if any, in the judge\u2019s explanation of <em>Mills </em>does not undermine the judge\u2019s finding of a knowing and voluntary election to be sentenced by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 663-64, 579 A.2d at 757. At the post conviction hearing, Gilliam did not testify, and he failed to establish that Daneman was incorrect when he represented to the trial judge that he advised Gilliam of the significance of the <em>Mills </em>decision and the factors to be considered in electing a court or jury sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">4. Testimony of Arneisha James and Lisa Brown</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that relates primarily to the sentencing hearing, but which Gilliam also raises as a trial error, is Daneman\u2019s alleged failure to present favorable testimony from Arneisha James and Lisa Brown. Gilliam suggests that these two women, who saw him shortly before the murder, could have provided helpful information about his drug use and possible drug intoxication, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>well as testimony that his crime was mitigated because he was acting under duress from Tony Drummond. The post conviction hearing judge found, in effect, that there was nothing to suggest James\u2019 and Brown\u2019s testimony would have been exculpatory or favorable to Gilliam. That finding was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Muehlbauer, </em>892 F.2d 664, 669 (7th Cir.1990) (attorney\u2019s failure to call two witnesses that defendant claimed were critical did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel where there was nothing in the record to suggest that witnesses would have helped exonerate defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Arneisha James and Lisa Brown gave statements to the police in which they described a visit that Gilliam, Tony Drummond, and Kelvin Drummond made to James\u2019 apartment shortly before the murder. In their statements, they indicated that, while in the apartment, Tony had the shotgun. This was consistent -with Kelvin Drummond\u2019s testimony at Gilliam\u2019s trial that Tony Drummond had possession of the shotgun while the group was at James\u2019 apartment and Tony asked James\u2019 permission to put the shotgun in her closet during their visit. Tony Drummond\u2019s brief possession of the shotgun at James\u2019 apartment in no way establishes that Gilliam was acting under duress. It was uncontroverted that the shotgun belonged to Gilliam and that Gilliam had possession of the shotgun at the time of the murder and several days after the murder. Gilliam shot the victim while Tony and Kelvin Drummond were some distance away, unarmed, and in another car. Tony Drummond\u2019s possession of the shotgun at James\u2019 apartment was testified to by Kelvin Drummond and was uncontroverted. There was no reason why Daneman should have called James and Brown to corroborate Kelvin Drummond\u2019s testimony on this issue. <em>See Proctor v. United States, </em>729 F.Supp. 473, 476 (D.Md.) (rejecting ineffective assistance of counsel claim where presentation of evidence defendant claimed was \u201cvital\u201d would have merely been cumulative), <em>aff'd sub nom. </em>911 F.2d 721 (4th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1038, 111 S.Ct. 707, 112 L.Ed.2d 697 (1991). Additionally, neither James nor Brown could aid in establishing the possibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>mitigating factor of drug impairment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In her statement, James made mention of some of the group smoking marijuana, but made no mention of other drugs and gave no indication that Gilliam was exhibiting any signs of drug impairment, although she did indicate Tony Drummond, by contrast, was sick and lying down during the visit. At the post conviction hearing, James was called as a witness, but gave no indication that either she or Brown saw any signs that Gilliam was impaired by drugs. There was no showing that either James or Brown could have added anything of substance to either Gilliam\u2019s duress claim or his substantial impairment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Gilliam also contends that James could have testified about a letter Tony Drummond wrote to her in which he asked her not to tell anyone that he was wearing a white ski suit or that he had the gun at her apartment. Gilliam contends this letter shows Tony Drummond dominated the group and indicates Gilliam was therefore acting under duress. The short answer is that Tony Drummond\u2019s letter to Arneisha James may have suggested he dominated James; it does not suggest he dominated Gilliam. The letter quite simply is not admissible evidence to establish that Gilliam was acting under duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">5. Psychosocial Family Background Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Gilliam claims, \u201cDaneman did not conduct, nor did he hire anyone to conduct, an investigation into Petitioner\u2019s family background. Instead, he relied upon interviews conducted by [graduate] social work students from the University of Maryland. The students interviewed Petitioner\u2019s mother, sister, aunt and a friend.\u201d The graduate students also interviewed Gilliam on six occasions, and from these interviews <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>prepared a twenty-two page psychosocial report which was admitted at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Following the sentencing hearing and in preparation for the post conviction hearing, the Office of the Public Defender hired Mr. Hans Selvog, an expert with a Master\u2019s Degree in social work, to review the first psychosocial history and to do a second psychosocial investigation of Gilliam\u2019s family background. This second psychosocial investigation contained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\u201cThroughout the initial four years of his life, Tyrone Gilliam Jr. witnessed extreme violence between his parents. Both his mother and father were capable of inflicting injury and their fierce and unpredictable outbursts created a home environment that was threatening, confusing and insecure. Further, the ongoing violence between the parents elicited the constant fear from Tyrone Jr. and his sister that at any moment they too might suffer the same brutalization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">After his parents\u2019 final separation, which followed a particularly explosive episode, Tyrone Jr.\u2019s existence became even more unstable as he moved with his mother and sister to many different residences during the next four years. And the trauma he had suffered when his parents were together did not end after their separation; he continued to be subjected to a fearful and brutal environment while cared for at his maternal grandmother\u2019s home. Here his step-grandfather viciously abused his wife, children and grandchildren. And on top of this were the constant sexual attacks Tyrone Jr. was subject to in this house and as well as at the hands of a babysitter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Gilliam now challenges the adequacy of the twenty-two page psychosocial report prepared by the graduate students from the University of Maryland School of Social Work. That report states, incidentally, that the graduate students who compiled the report \u201cworked in conjunction with the Death Penalty Defense Unit of the Office of the Public Defender, Baltimore City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Gilliam has failed to show that Daneman\u2019s representation in conjunction with securing a psychosocial family background investigation was inadequate. Daneman had a right to rely on, and did rely on, the graduate social work students in connection with the volunteered assistance of the Public Defender\u2019s Office. The twenty-two page psychosocial report they sent to Daneman did not appear to be inadequate. Even if counsel who fails to investigate a capital defendant\u2019s background might be deemed ineffective, <em>see, e.g., Harris v. Dugger, </em>874 F.2d 756, 768 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1011, 110 S.Ct. 573, 107 L.Ed.2d 568 (1989), Daneman met his obligation by securing- a background investigation by the graduate students recommended by the Office of the Public Defender. <em>Cf. Mitchell v. Kemp, </em>762 F.2d 886, 889-90 (11th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>483 U.S. 1026, 107 S.Ct. 3248, 97 L.Ed.2d 774 (1987). Further, even if we were to assume the graduate student\u2019s psychosocial family background investigation was inadequate, Gilliam was not denied any constitutional right and is not entitled to a new sentencing. <em>See Poyner v. Murray, </em>964 F.2d 1404, 1418-19 (4th Cir.) (claim of ineffective assistance of expert witness does not assert a cognizable constitutional violation), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 419, 121 L.Ed.2d 342 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">6. Failure to Prepare Sentencing Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">We have already dealt with the general allegation of Daneman\u2019s failure to prepare -witnesses in part I.A.2, <em>supra. </em>In his brief, Gilliam complains specifically about Daneman\u2019s failure to prepare Dr. Shapiro, a psychologist who testified at Gilliam\u2019s sentencing to his opinion that Gilliam was \u201csubstantially impaired\u201d at the time of the murder. Gilliam\u2019s specific allegations regarding Dr. Shapiro\u2019s testimony are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apt\">\u201cAlthough Daneman knew that Shapiro, a psychologist, anticipated having a limited role in the sentencing presentation, Daneman never informed him that the psychiatrist upon whom he relied, Dr. McDaniel, had declined to testify. Despite the fact that Shapiro had, at Daneman\u2019s request, prepared a memorandum suggesting questions for Daneman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>to ask, Daneman asked the one critical question that Shapiro was not prepared for, namely, whether Petitioner was \u2018substantially impaired\u2019 at the time of the crime. Shapiro answered that he was but explained at the post conviction hearing that, had he known that question would be asked of him, Shapiro would have insisted on \u2018substantially more interviews\u2019 and investigation on which to base his opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">Even worse was Daneman\u2019s failure to advise Shapiro that if Shapiro testified, the State would rebut his testimony with that of Dr. Siebert, who would testify that Petitioner was antisocial and dangerous. Had Shapiro known that Siebert would so testify, he would have advised Daneman not to call him as a witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Daneman was able to elicit a favorable opinion in mitigation of sentence from Dr. Shapiro that Gilliam was substantially impaired at the time of the murder. This was an opinion that up to that point no other expert was able to express, as well as an opinion to which Dr. Shapiro had not anticipated testifying. We fail to see how Daneman rendered ineffective assistance in the manner in which he elicited this favorable opinion from Dr. Shapiro.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">7. Dr. Ellen McDaniel</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">As previously noted, after trial, but before sentencing, Daneman requested assistance from the Public Defender\u2019s Office. The Public Defender hired Dr. Ellen McDaniel, a psychiatrist. Shortly after the Office of the Public Defender contacted Dr. McDaniel, she sent a letter to Daneman requesting Gilliam\u2019s Juvenile Service reports, school records, information about the offense, family history, etc. Dr. McDaniel was supplied with the pre-sentence investigation, Dr. Shapiro\u2019s report, offense reports of the murder, Gilliam\u2019s statements to the police, as well as the twenty-two page report prepared by the graduate social work students. She interviewed Gilliam on two occasions. Dr. McDaniel\u2019s sole contact with Daneman was on October 23, 1989, when she called Daneman and told him that she could not come to any conclusion that would be helpful to Gilliam at his sentencing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>According to a contemporaneous memorandum of that telephone conversation made by Daneman and introduced as an exhibit, Dr. McDaniel told him that Gilliam was not psychotic, but is somewhat aggressive with a \u201cchip on his shoulder.\u201d The memo also indicates Gilliam told Dr. McDaniel four different stories as to what occurred but that he never indicated that he was afraid of Tony. Dr. McDaniel testified that she did not remember asking Daneman for any additional information during that telephone conversation, but she assumes she did. Daneman does not recall any request for additional information, and the memorandum of his conversation with Dr. McDaniel indicates no such request.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Following the court\u2019s imposition of the death penalty, the Public Defender\u2019s Office again retained Dr. McDaniel and sent her a copy of the. new psychosocial history prepared by Hans Selvog. Dr. McDaniel interviewed Gilliam one more time and interviewed Gilliam\u2019s mother and sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">At the post conviction hearing, according to Gilliam, Dr. McDaniel made it clear that, had Daneman supplied her with the background information reported by Selvog, she would have rendered an opinion at the time of Petitioner\u2019s sentencing that Gilliam had a paranoid personality disorder and was substantially impaired in his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. There is some question about how much weight should be given to Dr. McDaniel\u2019s newly formed opinion founded on the second psychosocial history, an opinion that she was previously unable to form from her interviews with Gilliam, the first psychosocial history, and the other reports furnished by Daneman. Dr. McDaniel testified that, based on the information she had prior to receiving the Selvog psychosocial history, \u201cI was able to state he [Gilliam] had a personality disorder, but I was not able to state he had a <em>paranoid </em>personality disorder, much less to say that he was substantially impaired.\u201d (Emphasis added). In fact, the first psychosocial report, which Daneman furnished Dr. McDaniel, specifically observed that \u201c[w]e conclude from the information gathered in this report that Defendant Gilliam has a ... somewhat paranoid personality.\u201d In addition to this first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>psychosocial history, at the time Dr. McDaniel told Daneman she would be unable to supply any helpful information, she also had reviewed Dr. Shapiro\u2019s written report containing test results showing evidence of Gilliam\u2019s paranoia. Thus, Gilliam\u2019s paranoid personality was not revealed for the first time in Mr. Selvog\u2019s psychosocial history.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">We have already held that there was no inadequate representation because Daneman did not obtain a better psychosocial history. It follows that there was no breach in the standard of care by not furnishing Dr. McDaniel with information disclosed by the second psychosocial history which was the foundation for the opinion Dr. McDaniel formed after Gilliam\u2019s sentencing and to which she testified at the post conviction hearing. If Gilliam\u2019s childhood was vital to Dr. McDaniel\u2019s psychiatric assessment, Daneman could assume Dr. McDaniel would elicit this information from Gilliam. If additional interviews with Gilliam\u2019s family members were important in forming her psychiatric opinion, Daneman could assume that Dr. McDaniel would take the initiative and request those interviews. Gilliam also has not established any inadequate representation because Daneman failed to initiate further meetings with Dr. McDaniel after her October 23rd representation that she was unable to provide any information that would be helpful at sentencing. He has no obligation to pursue her and try to convince her to change her mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">D. <em>Additional Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">We recognize that Gilliam makes passing reference to other instances not discussed herein which he suggests might illustrate Daneman\u2019s inadequate representation, such as how Daneman phrased questions to several witnesses. Those were not overlooked; they were, however, so insignificant or devoid of merit that we deemed them unworthy of further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">E. <em>The \u201cCumulative Effect\u201d of the Ineffective Assistance Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Gilliam also contends the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of his ineffective assistance claims should entitle him to post convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>tion relief. In the instant case, we see no basis to conclude that Gilliam\u2019s claims collectively have any greater force than they have individually. <em>Compare Bowers v. State, </em>320 Md. 416, 436-37, 578 A.2d 734, 744 (1990) (cumulative effect of related claims was sufficient to establish ineffective assistance of counsel). This is not a case where the cumulative effect of numerous interrelated errors in aggregate amount to inadequate representation. This is more a case of the mathematical law that twenty times nothing is still nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">II. Suppression of Exculpatory Material</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Citing Maryland Rule 4-263(a)(l) and <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), Gilliam contends that the State failed to turn over material which was exculpatory in nature. Specifically, Gilliam contends that the State failed to turn over the statements of Arneisha James, the statement of Lisa Brown, the police report of Trooper Wilson, and the letter from Tony Drummond to Arneisha James.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Although Daneman did not recognize these documents when shown them at the post conviction hearing some three years after the trial, it is by no means clear that he had not been provided these documents by the State. The post conviction judge found that Daneman had two meetings to review the State\u2019s file, and it was stipulated that the documents at issue were in the State\u2019s file prior to trial. It was also conceded that it is the policy of the Baltimore County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to give open file discovery. Moreover, Daneman testified at the post conviction hearing that he and the prosecutor met and \u201cI went through everything.\u201d He further testified, \u201cI know I had to look through their file.... No, the State gave me everything I wanted.\u201d Daneman\u2019s failure to recognize the documents three years later does not require the trial judge to find that they were withheld by the State. The trial judge\u2019s finding that Daneman was given access to the disputed documents was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Even if these documents had not been furnished by the State, from our previous discussion about these specific items, see parts I.A.1 and I.C.4, <em>supra, </em>it is clear that none of these documents constitute \u201cmaterial evidence\u201d whose suppression would require a new trial. <em>See United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d 481, 494 (1985) (\u201cThe evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d); <em>Thomas, </em>325 Md. at 190, 599 A.2d at 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">III. The Post Conviction Judge Employed An Incorrect Standard in His Assessment of Daneman\u2019s Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Gilliam complains that the trial judge incorrectly articulated the standard for determining whether counsel\u2019s inadequate representation prejudiced the defense. The simple answer to this contention is that it is irrelevant, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOt\">\u201ca defendant who hopes to show that counsel was ineffective ... has the burden of persuading a court that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">(1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">(2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-9\"><em>Bowers, </em>320 Md. at 424, 578 A.2d at 738 (citing <em>Harris v. State, </em>303 Md. 685, 696, 496 A.2d 1074, 1079 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">In light of this two-prong test, even if the post conviction judge\u2019s articulation of the standard for evaluating whether an attorney\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense was incorrect, any error was harmless. The judge did not find, as we do not find, that Daneman\u2019s representation was deficient. The first prong of the test was not met. Therefore, what standard would be used to measure prejudice, had Daneman been deficient, is simply irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">IV. The Post Conviction Judge Relied on Facts Outside the Record</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">Gilliam contends that the post conviction judge improperly relied upon extrinsic facts outside of the record in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>denying post conviction relief. In particular, he refers to the post conviction judge\u2019s written opinion, in which the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">\u201cThis Court knew defense counsel as an active practitioner, well before being appointed to the bench, and during the past six years has had Mr. Daneman before this Court for many cases, both pleas and trials.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">Gilliam argues that there was no evidence in the record to support this statement and, therefore, that the court was incorrect in relying upon it in assessing Daneman\u2019s competence. It is clear that the judge did not rely on his prior contacts with Daneman as a basis for the finding that Dane-man was competent. The post conviction judge, in his opinion, took note of the testimony at the post conviction hearing that Mr. Daneman had been admitted to the Maryland bar in 1961 and had actively been engaged in the practice of criminal law since then; that Mr. Daneman had been involved in thousands of cases and had lectured for the Department of Justice; that Mr. Daneman kept updated on the latest cases; that he was assisted by a law clerk, an associate, and Jerome Deise, the Chief of the Capital Litigation Unit of the Public Defender\u2019s Office; that he had consulted with an array of experts in preparing the case; and that he had previous experience in death penalty litigation. The court then concluded, <em>\u201c[b]ased upon all of the evidence and testimony </em>this Court finds as a fact that defense counsel was experienced and more than competent to handle a capital case.\u201d (Emphasis added). It is obvious that \u201call of the evidence and testimony\u201d adduced regarding Daneman\u2019s experience and competence was what the judge relied on. We must also keep in mind that whether Mr. Daneman was <em>generally </em>experienced and competent has very little to do with Gilliam\u2019s specific claim of ineffective assistance. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel succeeds or fails depending <em>not </em>on the overall qualifications of the attorney, but rather on careful examination of <em>particular </em>allegations of error that supposedly affected the result of the proceeding at issue. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>V. The Post Conviction Judge\u2019s Factual Findings Were Clearly Erroneous</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Gilliam\u2019s next contention is that several of the post conviction judge\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous. Most of these findings were discussed in previous portions of this opinion. The remaining contentions are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The post conviction judge found that Daneman was assisted by an associate. In claiming that this finding was erroneous, Gilliam relies on a portion of the transcript early in Daneman\u2019s testimony at the post conviction hearing where when asked if he was assisted by an associate, Daneman said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d The short answer to this contention is that Mr. Daneman later corrected the testimony that Gilliam relies upon and testified, \u201cI was incorrect in my prior testimony, after reviewing the memos, she [Leslie Leader, Mr. Dane-man\u2019s associate] did work on this case.\u201d Mr. Daneman testified that his memory was refreshed by looking at various memoranda and at the log he had prepared for the hearing, but he could not specifically recall what role Leader played. Daneman was able to recall, however, that Leader tried a portion of the case in Harford County that involved other armed robberies and the same confession admitted in this case; that Leader had sent Gilliam jury instructions at his request; and that Leader had discussed this case with Gilliam on March 13 and April 13, 1989. On the State\u2019s examination, Mr. Daneman confirmed that both Leader and a law clerk had assisted him on the case. The post conviction court\u2019s finding that Mr. Daneman was assisted by an associate is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">Gilliam argues that the post conviction judge was clearly erroneous in finding that \u201cMr. Daneman had previously tried a death penalty case in Anne Arundel County Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Court twice.\u201d The record reflects Daneman testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\">\u201cQ. What was the number of death penalty cases you had handled prior to Tyrone Gilliam?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">A. I had not tried a full death penalty case prior to the Gilliam case. I did represent an inmate in Annapolis who had killed a fellow inmate, but I tried the murder case twice, both times it was hung, and then they nol prossed the case. So, I did not go to the second phase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">Q. Okay, but that was a death penalty case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">Q. What was the name of the Defendant in that case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">A. Clyde Dixon. I spoke to Mr. Dixon about two weeks ago, because I don\u2019t have the file, and he, I asked him about the case. He refreshed my memory, and he told me, yes, they were going to the death penalty. Now, that\u2019s my only recollection of that case, I must tell you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-10\">Q. That\u2019s still continuing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-11\">A. No, no, it\u2019s finished. It\u2019s over with. It was just an old case. I didn\u2019t go back into my files to pull out that file to see what was done with regard to the death penalty phase; I must tell you, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">The trial court\u2019s finding that Mr. Daneman had twice before tried a death penalty case in Anne Arundel County was thus supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-13\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-14\">Gilliam contends that he wanted Arneisha James and Lisa Brown to be called as witnesses at trial, but Daneman did not call them. He now alleges that the post conviction judge was clearly erroneous in finding in his written opinion that Gilliam \u201chas not alleged one witness that he wanted called.... \u201d While the record indicates that, prior to trial, Gilliam and Daneman discussed Arneisha James and Lisa Brown, there was no testimony that Gilliam wanted these two women called to testify. Thus, the lower court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>VI. Restricting the Testimony at the Post Conviction Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Gilliam contends that the post conviction judge improperly restricted the testimony of his witness, Hans Selvog. Mr. Selvog, a social worker with a Master\u2019s Degree in social work, prepared the second post-sentencing psychosocial history. Gilliam\u2019s specific contention is that the court erred in refusing to admit Selvog\u2019s opinions and in refusing to allow Selvog to draw comparisons between his report and that done by the University of Maryland social work team in 1989. Neither action by the court was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Gilliam\u2019s contention that Selvog should have been allowed to state his conclusions has not been preserved for appellate review. After some discussion regarding the extent to which the court might allow Selvog to testify, the prosecution agreed to allow Selvog to introduce his report into evidence with the exception of the portion containing his opinions. In response, Gilliam\u2019s post conviction counsel stated, \u201cYour Honor, I have, no problem deleting the last two pages and anything within the report that would allude to a conclusion on the part of Mr. Selvog. I would, however, like the opportunity to at least go through ... at least the personal history of Tyrone Gilliam, Junior.\u201d The Court thereafter admitted Selvog\u2019s report \u201cminus any conclusions or opinions rendered.\u201d As Gilliam did not object to the course of action proposed by the prosecution and taken by the court, and apparently indicated his agreement with it, he cannot now be heard to complain that the court\u2019s action was wrong. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 8\u2014131(a); <em>White v. State, </em>324 Md. 626, 640, 598 A.2d 187, 194 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">In any case, we are not directed to any specific opinions or conclusions which Gilliam claims were erroneously excluded. Gilliam offered Selvog only to provide a basis for Dr. McDaniel\u2019s subsequent opinion; therefore, Selvog\u2019s compilation of Gilliam\u2019s psychosocial history was all that was relevant. We would also point out that the post conviction judge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>as trier of fact, is not obliged to give credence to any of Mr. Selvog\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Further, the judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to allow Selvog to compare his report with the social history report done for the sentencing hearing. As the post conviction judge stated, he needed no assistance to ascertain whether, and how, the two reports differed. Expert testimony may be excluded when it will not aid the trier of fact. <em>I.W. Berman Properties v. Porter Bros., Inc., </em>276 Md. 1, 14, 344 A.2d 65, 74 (1975); <em>see also State v. Allenwalt, </em>308 Md. 89, 101, 517 A.2d 741, 747 (1986); L. McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 702.1, at 218 (\u201cExpert testimony also will be inappropriate when the expert can add nothing to what the judge or jurors already know or could infer from the evidence.\u201d). Finally, the court properly foreclosed Selvog from reiterating and summarizing the report that was already in evidence, as such testimony would have been cumulative. The post conviction judge therefore did not abuse his discretion by the manner in which he restricted Selvog\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">VII. Failure to Make Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Gilliam\u2019s final contention is that \u201c[t]he post conviction court failed in its duty to set forth, with precision, each contention of the Petitioner, a ruling thereon and the reasons therefor,\u201d citing Md.Rule 4-407(a). <em>See also Davis v. State, </em>285 Md. 19, 36-37, 400 A.2d 406, 414-15 (1979); <em>Duff v. Warden, </em>234 Md. 646, 648, 200 A.2d 78, 80-81 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">While we might have preferred that the post conviction judge\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact and rulings\u201d be set out more fully, there is no reason to remand for additional rulings. We are able to decide all of the issues raised on this appeal based on the record without the need to remand for additional factual findings. <em>Cf. State v. D\u2019Onofrio, </em>221 Md. 20, 155 A.2d 643 (1959). In fact, we have previously addressed all issues on which Gilliam claims the trial judge failed to make a ruling, but one.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Gilliam complains that the trial judge failed to rule on his contention that his appellate counsel was inadequate. Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>pellate counsel\u2019s alleged inadequacy in his first appeal was the failure to raise on appeal the issue that Gilliam did not knowingly and intelligently waive a jury trial because there was no showing that he had been told he had the right to have a jury decide whether he was not criminally responsible. The contention is that \u201c[a]lthough the trial court extensively questioned Gilliam about jury trial waiver with respect to guilt-innocence as well as sentencing, the record is devoid of any voir dire regarding the right to have a jury decide [whether Gilliam was not criminally responsible by reason of insanity].\u201d The post conviction judge made no finding on this contention. It is obvious that the contention has no merit. As we have already indicated, <em>see </em>part I.B.3, <em>supra, </em>the record reflects that Gilliam had elected not to file a plea of not criminally responsible and there was no basis for such a plea. There was no reason why the trial judge should, in securing a waiver of jury trial, \u201cvoir dire\u201d Gilliam regarding the right to have a jury determine the defense of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity when that defense was not raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">For the reasons indicated, the petition for post conviction relief was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-8\">. <em>Miranda v.
