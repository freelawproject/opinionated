Article 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u00a7 281A(b), a firearm is \u201cused\u201d during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense when it is neither actively employed nor brandished.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 327 Md. 304, 609 A.2d 312. In addition, because we granted certiorari prior to argument or decision by the Court of Special Appeals, we must address two other issues. One involves the application of Maryland Rule 1-351, which pertains to <em>ex parte </em>orders. The other involves the propriety of the trial court\u2019s allowance of cross-examination of the appellant concerning the defendant\u2019s income and Maryland State income tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">I.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Cecil Harris, the appellant, was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of possession of cocaine in sufficient quantity to indicate an intent to distribute, possession of marijuana, and feloniously using, wearing, carrying, or transporting a firearm, to wit, an Uzi semi-automatic 9mm assault firearm, during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment\u2014ten years for the cocaine charge, six months for the marijuana charge and ten years without parole for use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>firearm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The charges arose out of the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s execution of a search and seizure warrant, at premises at which the appellant maintained a part-time residence and, out of which, he had, at one time, operated a restaurant and car repair business.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The appellant and three others were found on the first floor, seated on the sofa in the living room. Neither weapons nor drugs were found on that floor or on the person of the appellant and his companions. All of the drugs and weapons were found on the second floor. In a hallway closet, 96.6 grams of 70% pure cocaine, valued at $36,000, were found in the false bottom of a \u201cFix-A-Flat\u201d container. Eleven bags of cocaine and a bag of marijuana were found in the pocket of a man\u2019s leather jacket, which was located in the middle room closet. The Uzi semi-automatic 9mm firearm was seized, in plain view, from the appellant\u2019s room, the front bedroom. In that same room, the police recovered a loaded .357 handgun which was stuffed between pillows in a couch and three unloaded shotguns, all located in the closet. A .22 caliber Derringer handgun containing one round, was found in a drawer of the dresser in that room. The appellant owned all of the firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The State offered expert testimony as to the significance of the evidence recovered. According to Officer Glenn Williams, to whose qualifications in narcotics investigation the parties stipulated, the quantity and purity of the cocaine found in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Fix-A-Flat can indicated distribution rather than personal use. He also testified that the premises was a narcotics stash house, in which guns are ordinarily kept to protect the narcotics from rival dealers and police. That was the purpose of the Uzi found in appellant\u2019s bedroom, Officer Williams opined.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Testifying in his defense, the appellant described the businesses he operated at the premises as a carry-out restaurant and a mechanic shop and a tire shop. Although the carry-out had been closed, he testified that he made some money in that store.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">On cross-examination, the appellant testified that he supported himself from the proceeds of his businesses. He characterized his car repair business as profitable, as long as his physical condition permitted him to work, and his carryout restaurant business as doing pretty well. This prompted inquiry concerning his income, his 1989 and 1990 taxes, and his expenses, generally. The appellant\u2019s 1989 and 1990 Maryland tax returns, showing income of $2,909 in 1989 and $18,441 in 1990, which were admitted into evidence, formed the basis for much of the questioning. The appellant objected to being questioned about the tax returns and to their admission in evidence. On redirect, as he had also done on cross-examination, the appellant testified to having other income from insurance and disability payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The appellant\u2019s tax returns were obtained during the course of the trial. The prosecutor obtained a court order for their disclosure without notice first being given to the appellant that they were being sought. Neither was the appellant or his counsel present when the State presented the court with the petition and order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Section 281A(b), by its plain language, makes it a crime for a person to use or to wear, carry or transport a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>firearm during, and in relation to, a drug trafficking crime. There are three prerequisites: the firearm must be 1) used, worn, carried or transported, 2) during a drug trafficking crime, and 3) in relation to it. One who uses or wears, carries or transports a firearm during a drug trafficking crime is not guilty of a violation of section 281A(b) unless the evidence also establishes that the use, wearing, carrying or transporting was in relation to that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">While penal statutes are to be strictly construed against the State and in favor of the defendant, <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>320 Md. 749, 754, 580 A.2d 193, 195 (1990); <em>Davis v. State, </em>319 Md. 56, 61, 570 A.2d 855, 858 (1990); <em>Wynn v. State, </em>313 Md. 533, 539, 546 A.2d 465, 468 (1988); 3 Norman J. Singer, <em>Statutes and Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 59.03 (4th ed. 1986), so that only punishment contemplated by the words of the statute is meted out, <em>Davis, </em>319 Md. at 61, 570 A.2d at 858, the construction to be given a statute must depend upon discerning the intention of the Legislature when it drafted and enacted it. <em>Kennedy, </em>320 Md. at 755, 580 A.2d at 196. This requires reading and interpreting the entire statute, neither adding, nor deleting, words in order to give it a meaning not otherwise evident by the words actually used. <em>Bd. of Educ. of Garrett County v. Lendo, </em>295 Md. 55, 63, 453 A.2d 1185, 1189 (1982); <em>Smelser v. Criterion Ins. Co., </em>293 Md. 384, 389, 444 A.2d 1024, 1027 (1982); <em>Pappas v. Pappas, </em>287 Md. 455, 465, 413 A.2d 549, 553 (1980). Moreover, construction requires that the statute be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is illogical or incompatible with common sense. <em>D &amp; Y, Inc. v. Winston, </em>320 Md. 534, 538, 578 A.2d 1177, 1179 (1990); <em>Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 319, 498 A.2d 1195, 1196 (1985); <em>Erwin and Shafer, Inc. v. Pabst Brewing Co., </em>304 Md. 302, 315, 498 A.2d 1188, 1194 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Our inquiry into legislative intent begins with the words of the statute and, ordinarily, will also end there. Where the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, there usually is no need to go further in construing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>statute, <em>Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 73, 591 A.2d 481, 485 (1991); <em>G. Heileman Brewing Co. v. Stroh Brewery Co., </em>308 Md. 746, 755, 521 A.2d 1225, 1230 (1987); <em>In re Criminal Investigation No. 1-162, </em>307 Md. 674, 685, 516 A.2d 976, 982 (1986); <em>Comptroller of Treasury v. Fairchild Industries, Inc., </em>303 Md. 280, 284, 493 A.2d 341, 343 (1985). Giving the words their ordinary and common meaning \u201cin light .of the full context in which they appear, and in light of external manifestations of intent or general purpose available through other evidence,\u201d <em>Dickerson v. State, </em>324 Md. 163, 170-71, 596 A.2d 648, 651-52 (1991), quoting <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>318 Md. 182, 185, 567 A.2d 126, 127 (1989), normally will result in the discovery of the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 92, 581 A.2d 9, 12 (1990). In the interest of completeness, however, we may look at the purpose of the statute and compare the result obtained by use of its plain language with that which results when the purpose of the statute is taken into account. <em>Sabatier v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>323 Md. 232, 250, 592 A.2d 1098, 1107 (1991); <em>Mustafa, </em>323 Md. at 73, 591 A.2d at 485; <em>Baltimore County Coalition Against Unfair Taxes v. Baltimore County, </em>321 Md. 184, 203, 582 A.2d 510, 519 (1990); <em>Cunningham, </em>318 Md. at 185, 567 A.2d at 127; <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514-15, 525 A.2d 628, 632-33 (1987). We may also consider such evidence as \u201ca bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs, amendments that occurred as it passed through the legislature, its relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation, and other material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal----\u201d <em>Wynn, </em>313 Md. at 539, 546 A.2d at 468, quoting <em>Kaczorowksi, </em>309 Md. at 515, 525 A.2d at 632-33. And we may look to the Court\u2019s interpretation or treatment of another statute treating the same or similar subject matter. <em>Bridges v. Nicely, </em>304 Md. 1, 10, 497 A.2d 142, 146 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The appellant insists that the evidence in the case <em>sub judice </em>showed only that he possessed the firearm and that the General Assembly did not make it a crime to possess a firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. The language of section 281A(b), the appellant argues, is plain and unambiguous, and in that regard, cannot be construed to cover mere possession. He posits that \u201cpossession\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d have different meanings; while one necessarily possesses a firearm while using it, it is not necessarily true that one who possesses a firearm also uses it.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The State does not dispute, nor can it, that the appellant was not wearing, carrying or transporting<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime; direct evidence established that no firearms were found on the appellant and, in fact, that the only firearms recovered were located on the second floor, one floor removed from the appellant. The State does argue, however, that the appellant \u201cused\u201d a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. It concedes that section 281A(b) does not punish the mere possession of a firearm, unrelated in any way to a drug trafficking offense. Nonetheless, specifically, citing <em>Rich v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 142, 154-61, 611 A.2d 1034, 1039-43 (1992), the purpose of the Drug Kingpin Act, and the cases construing the federal statute, which is similar to section 281A(b), the State, argues that it does not follow that the statute requires proof of the active use or brandishment of a firearm. As the State sees it, the statute ought to be read so as to encompass any case in which a firearm in any way facilitates a drug offense. In other words, the State urges us to construe the statute so that it covers the drug dealer who keeps a firearm accessible to protect his drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In <em>Wynn v. State, </em>313 Md. 533, 543, 546 A.2d 465, 470 (1988), this Court defined \u201cuse.\u201d At issue in that case was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>interpretation of Md.Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1986 Cum. Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d), which proscribes the \u201cuse of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence,\u201d a crime very much like that proscribed by section 281A(b). In <em>Wynn, </em>the defendant was carrying a loaded .38 revolver during a housebreaking, a crime of violence. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 441. Although the evidence did not establish that he actively employed or brandished the handgun while engaged in the housebreaking, he was charged with \u201cusing\u201d the handgun during its commission. 313 Md. at 535, 546 A.2 at 466. Favorably citing the Supreme Court of California\u2019s interpretation, we defined \u201cuse\u201d as \u201c \u2018to carry out a purpose or action by means of;\u2019 to \u2018make instrumental to an end or process;\u2019 and to \u2018apply to advantage.\u2019 \u201d 313 Md. at 543, 546 A.2d at 470, quoting <em>People v. Chambers, </em>7 Cal.3d 666, 672, 102 Cal.Rptr. 776, 779-80, 498 P.2d 1024, 1027-28 (1972). We held that, by possessing the gun while committing the crime of housebreaking, the defendant did not \u201cuse\u201d the gun, as the Legislature contemplated when it enacted section 36B(d); rather, we said, what he did constituted the lesser crime proscribed in section 36B(b), \u201cwearing, carrying, or transporting any handgun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544, 546 A.2d at 471.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we did not confine our analysis to the words of the affected section. Rather, taking to heart the lesson of <em>Kaczorowski </em>that \u201c \u2018the search for legislature intent is most accurately characterized as an effort to discern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>some general purpose, aim, or policy of the statute,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 539, 546 A.2d at 468, quoting <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 513, 525 A.2d at 632, we examined the whole of section 36B, of which section 36B(d) was only a part, in an effort to discover the policy underlying it and \u201cto harmonize the language in question in that context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 546 A.2d at 469. As to the former, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\">In examining the preamble we note that the legislature specifically distinguished between the <em>wearing, carrying, and transporting </em>of handguns and the <em>use </em>of handguns in criminal activity. In particular, in \u00a7 36B(a)(ii) the legislature emphasized that the increase in the number of persons killed or injured by handguns was directly related to the carrying of handguns by persons inclined to use them in criminal activity. This comment clearly indicates that the legislature considered the use of a handgun to be something more than mere illegal possession of a handgun and that the legislature contemplated use of a handgun in an active as opposed to a passive manner. Death and injury do not arise from a handgun which remains holstered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 541, 546 A.2d at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Next, the Court considered the substantive provisions of the statute and found them to be inconsistent with giving the term \u201cuse\u201d a meaning equivalent to bare possession. 313 Md. at 541, 546 A.2d at 469. Focusing particularly on section 36B(b), we observed that it prohibits the unlawful wearing, carrying or transporting of handguns and provides for enhanced penalties based on the particular defendant\u2019s criminal history. Moreover, the <em>Wynn </em>court made specific mention of the enhanced punishment provided by section 36B(b)(iv), when the evidence establishes that the purpose for which the defendant was wearing, carrying or transporting the handgun was to injure or kill another person. <em>Id. </em>at 541-42, 546 A.2d at 469. Finally, we recognized the relative severity of the prescribed penalty, in section 36B(d), for \u201cuse\u201d of a handgun, in contrast to that prescribed by section 36B(b). <em>Id. </em>at 542, 546 A.2d at 469-70. From that contrast we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>The separate treatment of the carrying and wearing of a handgun in one instance, and use of a handgun in another, convinces us that if the legislature had intended for use of a handgun to encompass the conduct in this case it would have expressly so provided. As <em>we see it, the legislature would have drafted \u00a7 36B(d) so as to specifically proscribe the \u201ccarrying, wearing, transporting, or use\u201d of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">313 Md. at 542, 546 A.2d at 470 (emphasis added). <em>See also Webb v. State, </em>311 Md. 610, 617, 536 A.2d 1161, 1165 (1988), in which, discussing section 36B(b), this Court said, \u201cIn addition to the handgun use prohibition, the Legislature enacted \u00a7 36B(b) ... [and] [t]he unit of prosecution of that continuing crime is the wearing, carrying, or transporting of any handgun .... There is no requirement as to ... use.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Our opinion in <em>Wynn </em>was filed. September 1, 1988. The Drug Kingpin Act, of which section 281A(b) is a part, <em>see </em>Ch. 287, Acts of Md. 1989, was enacted May 19, 1989, effective July 1, 1989. Therefore, when it was passed, the Legislature knew, or, at least, is presumed to have known, how we had defined \u201cuse.\u201d <em>See State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 93, 581 A.2d 9, 12 (1990); <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City v. Hockley, </em>300 Md. 277, 283, 477 A.2d 1174, 1177 (1984). Possessed of that knowledge, the Legislature\u2019s proscription of \u201cuse\u201d without any clear indication that it intended that a different meaning be given the term leads inevitably to the conclusion that it adopted the definition we had theretofore given it.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">As we have indicated, section 281A was enacted in 1989 as part of the Drug Kingpin Act. <em>See Williams v. State, </em>329 Md. 1, 3, 616 A.2d 1275, 1276 (1992). Its purpose was \u201cto reduce the supply of drugs in Maryland by establishing harsher penalties for drug dealers and by decreasing the profitability of participation in a drug trafficking crime.\u201d Floor Report for S.B. 400. That purpose is similar to that attending the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>passage, in 1971, of the Maryland Controlled Dangerous Substance Act: \u201cto turn the screw of the criminal machinery\u2014 detection, prosecution and punishment\u2014tighter and tighter.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>318 Md. 182, 189, 567 A.2d 126, 129 (1989), quoting <em>Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 343, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1144, 67 L.Ed.2d 275, 284 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">As initially proposed, <em>see </em>S.B. 400 and H.B. 502, it was contemplated that section 281A(b) would punish anyone who \u201cuses or possesses\u201d a firearm during or in relation to a drug trafficking crime. The briefing document that accompanied the Senate and House bills explained the reason for using that language and its contemplated effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">1. Why is it necessary to establish that use or possession of a firearm be a separate offense when Article 27, \u00a7 36B, already makes it unlawful to use a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">The current statute is restricted to handguns. The proposed bill would include all firearms. Many drug dealers are using automatic weapons, assault rifles and other firearms that may not fall within the current definition of handgun. In addition Article 27, \u00a7 36B prohibits the \u201cuse\u201d of a handgun. In the <em>Wynn </em>case, the Court of Appeals made it clear that \u201cuse\u201d does not pertain to an individual who merely possesses a firearm for possible further use. The language in this bill prohibits anyone to \u201cuse or possess\u201d a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. It would affect an individual who carries a handgun while dealing drugs, even though he does not use it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">2. Wouldn\u2019t this provision make it possible for a person to be convicted, if they distributed a small quantity of marijuana downstairs and had a shotgun on the wall upstairs? No. The statute provides that the firearm must be used or possessed \u201cduring and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.\u201d That provision requires that a nexus be shown between the use or possession of a firearm and the drug trafficking crime. If the State cannot establish that the gun was being used or was kept for the purpose of being used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>further the drug trafficking crime, then the possession of the firearm would not be covered by this provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">It also reflects that the Legislature was very much aware of <em>Wynn </em>and its recognition that \u201cuse\u201d differs from \u201cpossess\u201d. According to the Conference Committee Report for S.B. 400, the House Judiciary Committee proposed amending section 281A by simply deleting \u201cpossesses;\u201d however, that proposal was rejected by the Conference Committee. While that Committee did delete \u201cpossesses,\u201d in its place it added \u201cwears, carries, or transports.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">By deleting \u201cpossesses,\u201d and replacing it with \u201cwears, carries, or transports,\u201d terms that, while less active than \u201cuse,\u201d are more active than \u201cpossesses\u201d, the Legislature clearly expressed an intention to require, for conviction, something more than the mere possession of a handgun during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. Had the punishment of one who possesses a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime been the Legislature\u2019s goal, it would not have been necessary for it to delete that term.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>By inserting \u201cwears, carries or transports,\u201d the terms used in section 36B(b), the Legislature made section 281A(b) the near equivalent of the combined effect of sections 36B(b) and 36B(d). Consequently, the State finds significant the statement in <em>Wynn </em>that, had the Legislature intended that \u201cuse\u201d cover the conduct in that case, it would have</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak_\">\u201cspecifically proscribe[d] the \u2018carrying, wearing, transporting, or use\u2019 of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">313 Md. at 542, 546 A.2d at 476. The <em>Wynn </em>Court was not suggesting, by that statement, that the definition of \u201cuse\u201d would change if the terms \u201cwear, carry, or transport\u201d were inserted in subsection (d). As we have seen, the Court held in <em>Wynn </em>that \u201cuse\u201d means something different from the conduct characterized by \u201cwear, carry or transport.\u201d In that case, that conduct was the equivalent of \u201cmere possession\u201d of a handgun; by having the gun on his person during the housebreaking the defendant possessed it. Thus, the court was simply recognizing that including those terms in subsection (d) expanded the conduct prohibited from that characterized by the active term, \u201cuse,\u201d to include that characterized by the less active terms, \u201cwear, carry or transport.\u201d No different result is required in this case. The definition of \u201cuse\u201d in section 281A(b) is not changed from that announced in <em>Wynn, </em>and, certainly, is not diluted, simply because it is coupled with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u201cwear, carry, or transport.\u201d All that means is that the conduct prohibited includes conduct other than \u201cuse,\u201d conduct which the State concedes is not implicated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In conclusion, the context in which the charged offense arose in <em>Wynn </em>is critical. Wynn was in possession of the handgun, <em>i.e., </em>he wore, carried or transported it. Here the State does not even argue that the appellant wore, carried, or transported the firearm; it argues only that he possessed it in relation to a drug trafficking offense; hence, he \u201cused\u201d it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The State seeks support for its argument in the federal counterpart to section 281A(b), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (1979, 1993 Cum.Supp.) and the cases interpreting it. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">Whoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Although it has not addressed the issue presented by this case, the Supreme Court has construed \u201cuses\u201d in \u00a7 924(c)(1) to have a meaning broader than brandishment or display. <em>Smith v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993). The majority of federal courts that have defined \u201cuses\u201d in that statute have held that a firearm is \u201cused,\u201d for purposes of the statute, if possession is an integral part of the predicate offense or if the firearm is within easy reach and available to protect the user during the ongoing drug trafficking offense. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Abreu, </em>962 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>F.2d 1425, 1431 (10th Cir.1992) (a defendant \u201cuses\u201d a firearm when he or she has ready access to the firearm and the firearm was an integral part of the criminal undertaking); <em>United States v. Duke, </em>940 F.2d 1113, 1119 (8th Cir.1991) (guns found in house where defendant stored and processed drugs were \u201cused\u201d if their availability increased likelihood criminal undertaking would succeed); <em>United States v.

Paz, </em>927 F.2d 176, 178-79 (4th Cir.1991) (evidence that gun was present and accessible and that its presence would help facilitate success of criminal undertaking was sufficient to support defendant\u2019s conviction for use of firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking, even though gun was under mattress); <em>United States v.

Cummings, </em>937 F.2d 941, 943 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 395, 116 L.Ed.2d 345 (1991) (Conviction of possession of handgun during and in relation to drug trafficking offense was sufficiently supported by evidence that the defendant routinely carried weapon on his person, that he had the weapon during the drug transaction with informant, and that he brandished the weapon while attempting to escape); <em>United States v.

That interpretation, of which the Legislature was aware when it enacted section 281A(b), conflicts with the way \u201cuse\u201d has been interpreted by the majority of the federal courts construing \u00a7 924(c)(1). The interpretation given a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>statute ordinarily is persuasive in interpreting a state statute patterned upon the federal statute. <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>299 Md. 493, 506, 474 A.2d 880, 887 (1984). <em>And see Atlantic Sea-Con v. Robert Dann Co., </em>321 Md. 275, 262, 582 A.2d 981, 984 (1990). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>not only is the authority interpreting the federal statute not uniform, but the legislative history of the state statute suggests that a different meaning of \u201cuses\u201d was intended, since the Legislature chose to use the same language in section 281A(b) as it had used in section 36B, knowing the gloss we had put on the latter. It follows that the General Assembly did not intend to equate \u201cuses\u201d with \u201cpossesses\u201d as the majority of federal courts have done. This is particularly so where, as here, the Legislature amended the statute specifically to delete \u201cpossess\u201d and replaced it with terms that are not, in all circumstances, its equivalent. We are obliged to follow the intent of the Legislature. <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Seidel Chevrolet, Inc., </em>326 Md. 237, 248, 604 A.2d 473, 479 (1992); <em>Ayres v. Townsend, </em>324 Md. 666, 672, 598 A.2d 470, 473 (1991); <em>Privette v. State, </em>320 Md. 738, 744, 580 A.2d 188, 191 (1990). If \u201cpossession\u201d of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime is to be punished, the Legislature must clearly so provide, not we. <em>See Webb v. State, </em>311 Md. 610, 618, 536 A.2d 1161, 1165 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">As we see it, \u201cuse\u201d requires that the defendant \u201ccarry out a purpose or action\u201d or \u201cmake instrumental to an end or process\u201d or \u201capply to advantage\u201d the firearm. <em>Wynn, </em>313 Md. at 543, 546 A.2d at 476. When discovered, the appellant did not have a firearm on his person, in fact, all the firearms were recovered one floor removed from the appellant. We will neither \u201cstretch the meaning of \u2018use\u2019 to include \u2018non-use\u2019 \u201d, <em>see Chouinard, </em>603 P.2d 745, nor extend the statute to reach cases not plainly within its contemplation. <em>Ball v.

He also argues that the failure of the State to provide notice of those proceedings either to him or his lawyer had the effect of excluding him from a stage of his trial; hence, Rule 4-231 was also violated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When these rule violations are taken together, the appellant contends, the effect of the <em>ex parte </em>hearing was to deny him the ability to make \u201can informed choice to testify or remain silent.\u201d Finally, the appellant asserts that precluding him from participating in the proceedings to obtain his income tax returns was at least fundamentally unfair.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">An <em>ex parte </em>proceeding is one in which only one side of the controversy is presented, the other side having been afforded no opportunity to participate by virtue of the absence of notice or knowledge of the proceedings. <em>See Magness v.

Certainly, before the records were admitted, their relevance to the issue as to which they were offered had been established. Furthermore, a proceeding for the purpose of discovering impeachment evidence for use at trial is not a stage of the appellant\u2019s trial; rather it is collateral and totally separate from it.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See Department of Social Services v.

The State was entitled to rebut that implication, if it could. Cross-examining the appellant as to his 1989 and 1990 tax returns, was an effective method of doing so. It sought by that examination to show that the appellant did not earn enough from his businesses to support himself or his family. Although the cross-examination tended to prove that the appellant likely had another source of income, and did not live off the proceeds of his businesses alone, as his direct testimony suggested, it did not suggest, nor was it presented to prove, that the appellant was more likely to commit a crime because he was poor. The court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the State to cross-examine the appellant as to his State tax returns. <em>State v.

We do not agree, however, that the same construction obtains after the deletion of \"possesses\u201d as obtained before its deletion. As the briefing document indicates, by using \"possesses\u201d along with \"uses,\u201d the Legislature intended to reach conduct which we held in <em>Wynn </em>was not covered simply by the word \"use.\u201d The deletion of \"possesses\u201d and replacing it with other, more limited terms, must have some effect; it certainly could not mean the same thing as it did before. In light of the deletion, to read the statute as the State proposes would be to create a crime, possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime, not prescribed by the Legislature. <em>See Patuxent Inst. v. Hancock, </em>329 Md. 556, 575, 620 A.2d 917, 926 (1993) (it is a cardinal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>rule of the penal system that a criminal defendant is entitled to be informed of what the state commands or forbids).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Additionally, the State, citing <em>Rich, </em>93 Md.App. at 153-57, 611 A.2d at 1039-41, maintains that \u00a7 281A(b) was passed in order to combat the result reached in <em>Wynn: </em>the distinction arising from the statutory separation between \u201cuse\u201d in \u00a7 36B(d) and \"wear, carry or transport\u201d in Section 36B(b). The legislative history does not indicate that the purpose in passing \u00a7 281A was to avoid the impact of the decision in <em>Wynn. </em>It indicates just the opposite. Additionally, the Legislature is presumed to be aware of the decisions of this Court. <em>See State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 93, 581 A.2d 9, 12 (1990); <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City v. Hackley, </em>300 Md. 277, 283, 477 A.2d 1174, 1177 (1984). The Legislature has not taken any action to define or, for that matter, redefine the term \"use\"; thus, it may be presumed that it is satisfied with the meaning we have given that term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b192-12\">. The Supreme Court has very recently held that \"use\u201d of a firearm may consist of conduct other than possession, brandishment, or display. In <em>Smith v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993), it concluded that trading a firearm for drugs is \"using\u201d a firearm within the contemplation of the federal counterpart to section 281A(b). That holding is not contrary to the result we reach here, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b196-14\">. The appellant was not charged with illegal lottery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\">. Maryland Rule 4-231(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">(b) <em>Right to Be </em>Present\u2014Exceptions.\u2014A defendant is entitled to be present at a preliminary hearing and every stage of the trial, except (1) at a conference or argument on a question of law; (2) when a nolle prosequi or stet is entered pursuant to Rules 4-247 and 4-248; or (3) at a reduction of sentence pursuant to Rules 4-344 and 4-345.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">. The appellant also alleges that Rule 4-263, pertaining to discovery, was violated when he was not apprised of the <em>ex parte </em>proceedings. He does not, however, state the manner, and we can discern none, in which such a violation could have occurred in this case; accordingly, we shall not further address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b198-5\">. Section 13-202 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle, an officer, employee, former officer or former employee of the State or of a political subdivision of the State may not disclose, in any manner, any tax information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">Section 13-203(b) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">(b) <em>Judicial or legislative </em>order.\u2014Tax information may be disclosed in accordance with a proper judicial order or a legislative order.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b198-9\">. The State quite properly did not subpoena the appellant's income tax returns; it recognized, correctly, that, for purposes of section 13-203, a subpoena is not \"a proper judicial order.\u201d The clerk of a court is charged with the duly of issuing subpoenas, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 4-265, and that duty, like other clerical duties, is generally classified as ministerial. <em>See also Corey v. Carback, </em>201 Md. 389, 402, 94 A.2d 629, 630 (1953).; <em>Director of Finance v. Harris, </em>90 Md.App. 506, 513, 602 A.2d 191, 192 (1992), quoting <em>McCray v. Maryland, </em>456 F.2d 1, 4 (4th Cir.1972). A party seeking the issuance of a subpoena need not justify the request; he or she is not required to show cause why it should issue. On the other hand, records or information that are confidential may not be obtained by subpoena, without more. Such records may be obtained only upon a showing of need, <em>see Zaal v. State, </em>326 Md. 54, 87, 602 A.2d 1247, 1264 (1992), and relevance. <em>See DonBullian v. DeLisa, </em>246 Md. 734, 230 A.2d 349 (1967). In <em>DeLisa, </em>after assuming that a subpoena, which issues as a matter of course, even though over the signature of the Chief Judge, was not a proper judicial order, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">[T]he Comptroller without objection produced the return in court and his representative, in obedience to the statute, would reveal the .contents of the return only to the judge who, under the circumstances, was \u201can officer of the State having a right thereto in his official capacity.\u201d The judge\u2019s ruling which found the return relevant evidence and admitted it in evidence was a \"proper ... judicial order\u201d under the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">246 Md. at 738, 230 A.2d at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">It may be deduced from the foregoing that a proper judicial order is one that orders disclosure of the records sought only after a judge, having considered the matter in light of the total circumstances, <em>i.e., </em>the records sought, the issue on which it is alleged they have bearing, etc., has determined that they are relevant. In other words, a proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>judicial order issues after the judge has exercised discretion to determine the relevance of the records, not as a matter of course.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\">. Recognizing that a subpoena issued by a clerk is not \"a proper judicial order,\u201d as contemplated by section 13-203, the State argues that a court order stating that there is good cause, issued by a judge, even though without either a hearing or a finding that the records sought are relevant, is such an order. The State\u2019s position, then, is that confidential records may be obtained almost as a matter of course. Preservation of confidentiality requires more.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>early in the trial, the State, in an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding, obtained an order authorizing disclosure of the appellant\u2019s income tax returns. At that time, the appellant had not testified, and so, the State could not have been seeking them to impeach the appellant\u2019s testimony. The petition submitted to the court stated that the returns were needed to permit the State properly to prepare for the appellant\u2019s trial, which, the petition alleged, involved an extensive lottery scheme operating in Baltimore City. Aside from supplying the nature of the case against the defendant (in this case, that information was also erroneous), the petition disclosed nothing from which the court could conclude that the returns were relevant except, perhaps, on the issue of the appellant\u2019s poverty. That would not have justified the disclosure of the information, however. <em>See Vitek v. State, </em>295 Md. 35, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>40, 453 A.2d 514 516-17 (1982). Because, however, notice of the proceedings was never given to anyone and no hearing was held, there never was any opportunity for this fact to be pointed out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\">. We do not today decide whether the person for whose benefit the confidentiality of the records exists must be notified of the separate proceedings notwithstanding the fact that a defendant is not entitled to know, in advance, what evidence the State intends to use to impeach him or her. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 2-422; <em>Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 488-87, 536 A.2d 622, 629 (1988). <em>See </em>also Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 503.16 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b200-9\">. The appellant also contends that the cross-examination was intended to prove that he committed prior bad acts. He does not explain how, precisely, cross-examining a witness as to his income tax returns is intended to prove prior bad acts. Given the view we take of the appellant\u2019s initial argument, it does not matter. We believe the cross-examination was permitted on a contested, relevant issue in the case and any implication of the commission of prior bad acts that may be drawn is substantially outweighed by its probative value. <em>Harris v. State, </em>324 Md. 490, 499, 597 A.2d 956, 961 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\">.
