Chapter 849 of the 1978 Acts of Maryland. One section of that comprehensive statutory scheme is now Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 142(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 142(c) provides a narrow exception to the hearsay rule, permitting the State to introduce an affidavit of a bank to establish dishonor of a check or the status of an account without requiring any of the bank\u2019s employees to testify. Article 27, \u00a7 142(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\u201c\u00a7 142. [Obtaining property or services by bad check]\u2014 Presumptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">* * Jk <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">(c) Dishonor of a check by the drawee, that the drawer had no account with the drawee at the time of utterance, and insufficiency of the drawer\u2019s funds at the time of presentation and utterance may properly be proved by introduction in evidence of a notice of protest of the check, or a certificate under oath of an authorized representative of the drawee declaring the dishonor, lack of account and insufficiency, and this proof shall constitute presumptive evidence of the dishonor, lack of account and insufficiency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Today, we are called upon to address whether this relatively recent exception to the hearsay rule violates an accused\u2019s confrontation rights embodied in both the Sixth Amendment of United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. We hold that the admission of documentary evidence under Article 27, \u00a7 142(c), is neither per se unconstitutional nor unconstitutional under the facts of this case. We believe the evidence admissible under \u00a7 142(c) contains sufficient indicia of reliability so as not to offend a criminal defendant\u2019s right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In the evening of April 19, 1988, John Vernon Chapman entered the Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. catalogue store (Sears) in the Harford Mall. Chapman purchased a color television and a maintenance service agreement. The total purchase price for the sale was $315.49, including tax and shipping and handling charges. The assistant manager, Jean Hightower, was operating the cash register at the time of Chapman\u2019s purchase. Chapman tendered a check for $315.49, drawn on Fairfax Savings Bank, in exchange for the television and service agreement. Before accepting the check, Ms. Hightower requested identification from Chapman. Chapman gave her a Maryland driver\u2019s license. Ms. Hightower then examined the picture on the license and compared the signatures on the license and the check to verify Chapman\u2019s identity. Satisfied that the drawer of the check was indeed John Vernon Chapman, Ms. Hightower accepted the check and inscribed the license number on the back of the check. Chapman then departed the store with the television and service contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The next day, Sears deposited the check along with its other receipts for the day. Later, the bank notified Sears that Fairfax Savings Bank had dishonored the check on April 21, 1988. The depository bank returned the check to Sears marked \u201cDO NOT REDEPOSIT.\u201d The face of the check also indicated that the account on which Chapman had drawn the check upon was closed. Sears made several attempts to contact Chapman at the telephone number and address printed on the check. Approximately a year later, on September 7, 1989, after all efforts to contact Chapman failed, Sears filed an \u201cApplication for Statement of Charges,\u201d and Chapman was subsequently charged with Obtaining Property or Services by Bad Check under Md.Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 141.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Chapman was tried by jury in the Circuit Court for Harford County. At trial, the State\u2019s case consisted of the testimony of Ms. Hightower and two pieces of documentary evidence, the dishonored check and an \u201cAffidavit as to Account Status\u201d from Fairfax Savings Bank. Ms. Hightower testified that the dollar amount of the transaction exceeded $300.00, that Chapman was the drawer of the check and presented it to her in exchange for the merchandise, and that the bank ultimately returned the check as dishonored. Next, the State introduced the affidavit under Article 27, \u00a7 142(c) to establish that Chapman did not have an account with the bank when he wrote the check on April 19, 1988. The affidavit provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">\u201cTO: State\u2019s Attorney for Harford County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">AFFIDAVIT AS TO ACCOUNT STATUS RE: Account # 001150107 Drawer John V.

Stockman (signature)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Chapman objected on the basis that the admission of the affidavit under \u00a7 142(c) violated his right of confrontation. In addition, Chapman argued that even if this was the type of hearsay that did not offend principles of confrontation, there was an apparent irregularity on the face of the document that cast sufficient doubt upon its reliability to necessitate the affiant\u2019s live testimony in this case. The trial judge overruled Chapman\u2019s objection and admitted the affidavit into evidence. The jury subsequently found Chapman guilty of obtaining property or services by bad check, and following imposition of sentence Chapman appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari before the intermediate appellate court heard the case. <em>Chapman v. </em>State, 329 Md. 168, 617 A.2d 1085 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The question before this Court is whether the admission of the affidavit attesting to the status of his checking account under Article 27, \u00a7 142(c) violated Chapman\u2019s right of confrontation. In deciding this issue, we must examine the interrelationship of the hearsay rule and the Confrontation Clause. As the Supreme Court has noted, the common law rule against the admission of hearsay and the Confrontation Clause protect similar interests and are closely related. <em>See California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 155-56, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1933-34, 26 L.Ed.2d 489, 495 (1970); <em>Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 86, 91 S.Ct. 210, 218, 27 L.Ed.2d 213, 225-26 (1970). Both express a preference for a personal examination of a declarant as a means of testing the veracity and accuracy of a witness\u2019s testimony. <em>See Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 63-64, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2537-38, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, 606 (1980); John W. Strong, 2 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 245, at 93 (4th ed. 1992) (hereinafter <em>\u201cMcCormick on </em>Evidence\u201d) (stating rule against hearsay was designed to insure compliance with three conditions of oral testimony: oath, personal presence, and cross-examination). As a result of this close relationship, a legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>alteration of the hearsay rules may impinge upon Confrontation Clause protections. The important question, therefore, is at what point does the legislature\u2019s enactment of a new hearsay exception cross the threshold and impermissibly limit the exercise of essential components of the criminal justice system\u2014confrontation and cross examination. Clearly, not every alteration of the common law scheme regarding the admissibility of hearsay will violate the Confrontation Clause. While the Supreme Court has noted that the prohibition against hearsay and the Confrontation Clause share common roots and protect similar values, it has been careful not to equate the two. <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 814, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3146, 111 L.Ed.2d 638, 651 (1990); <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. at 155, 90 S.Ct. at 1933, 26 L.Ed.2d at 495; <em>Dutton, </em>400 U.S. at 86, 91 S.Ct. at 218, 27 L.Ed.2d at 225-26. Indeed, the Supreme Court has clearly cautioned against regarding the Confrontation Clause as \u201cnothing more or less than a codification of the rules of hearsay and their exceptions as they existed historically at common law.\u201d <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. at 155, 90 S.Ct. at 1933-34, 26 L.Ed.2d at 495. By refusing to equate the protections of the Confrontation Clause with the common law rules regarding the admission of hearsay in criminal trials, the Supreme Court has allowed the states some latitude to create new exceptions to the hearsay rule. <em>See Green, </em>399 U.S. at 171, 90 S.Ct. at 1941, 26 L.Ed.2d at 504 (Burger, C.J., concurring) (emphasizing \u201cthe importance of allowing the States to experiment and innovate.... If new standards and procedures are tried in one State their success or failure will be a guide to others and to the Congress.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Legislative latitude in altering the hearsay rule, however, is not limitless. The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>and its progeny, has set out a general framework to determine whether the fundamental confrontation protections have been impinged upon. A legislature must comply with the principles embodied in the <em>Roberts </em>line of cases when modifying the rule governing hearsay in the context of a criminal trial. <em>Cf. People v. Denning, 219 </em>Ill.App.3d 428, 162 Ill.Dec. 129, 132-33, 579 N.E.2d 943, 946-47 (1991), <em>appeal denied, </em>143 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Ill.2d 641, <em>167 </em>Ill.Dec. 403, 587 N.E.2d 1018 (1992); <em>People v. Rocha, </em>191 Ill.App.3d 529, 138 Ill.Dec. 714, 721-22, 547 N.E.2d 1335, 1342-43 (1989), <em>appeal denied, </em>131 Ill.2d 565, 142 Ill.Dec. 886, 553 N.E.2d 400 (1990); <em>State v. Myatt, </em>237 Kan. 17, 697 P.2d 836, 842-43 (1985); <em>State v. Wright, </em>751 S.W.2d 48, 51-52 (Mo.1988); <em>State v. Sosa, </em>59 Wash.App. 678, 800 P.2d 839, 842-43 (1990); <em>see also </em>2 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 252, at 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of the admission of hearsay under the traditional former testimony exception in a criminal proceeding, where the declarant was unavailable to testify. There the Court held that cross-examination of a hearsay declarant can be dispensed with when a party demonstrates: (1) the necessity of introducing the out-of-court statement, and (2) the out-of-court statement bears adequate indicia of reliability. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201cThe Confrontation Clause operates in two separate ways to restrict the range of admissible hearsay. First, in conformance with the Framers\u2019 preference for face-to-face accusation, the <em>Sixth Amendment establishes a rule of necessity. </em>In the usual case (including cases where prior cross-examination has occurred), the prosecution must either produce, or demonstrate the unavailability of, the declarant whose statement it wishes to use against the defendant.7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">The second aspect operates once a witness is shown to be unavailable. Reflecting its underlying purpose to augment accuracy in the factfinding process by ensuring the defendant an effective means to test adverse evidence, <em>the Clause countenances only hearsay marked with such trustworthiness that \u2018there is no material departure from the reason of the general rule.\u2019 </em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, [291 U.S. at 107, 54 S.Ct. at 333, 78 L.Ed. at 679]. The principle recently was formulated in Mancusi v. Stubbs [408 U.S. 204, 92 S.Ct. 2308, 33 L.Ed.2d 293]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\u2018The focus of the Court\u2019s concern has been to insure that there \u2018are indicia of reliability which have been widely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>viewed as determinative of whether a statement may be placed before the jury though there is no confrontation of the declarant,\u2019 Dutton v. Evans, [400 U.S. at 89, 91 S.Ct. at 220, 27 L.Ed.2d at 227], and to \u2018afford the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement,\u2019 California v. Green, [399 U.S. at 161, 90 S.Ct. at 1936, 26 L.Ed.2d at 498],...\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">7 A demonstration of unavailability, however, is not always required. In Dutton v. Evans, 400 U.S. 74, 27 L.Ed.2d 213, 91 S.Ct. 210 (1970), for example, the Court found the utility of trial confrontation so remote that it did not require the prosecution to produce a seemingly available witness....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Roberts, 448 U.S. at 65-66, 100 S.Ct. at 2538-39, 65 L.Ed.2d at 607 (emphasis added) (citations omitted); <em>see also Moon v. State, </em>300 Md. 354, 367, 478 A.2d 695, 701-02 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">On appeal before this Court, Chapman contends that his rights of confrontation were abridged when the trial judge admitted hearsay evidence under \u00a7 142(c) at trial. Chapman asserts that evidence admitted under \u00a7 142(c) fails the two-prong test enunciated under <em>Roberts. </em>He argues that the introduction of evidence under \u00a7 142(c) violates the Confrontation Clause since it permits the introduction of unreliable hearsay evidence and does not require the State to establish the unavailability of the affiant before the introduction of the Affidavit as to Account Status. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Contrary to Chapman\u2019s assertions, we believe evidence admitted under Article 27, \u00a7 142(c) generally possesses sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness so as to satisfy the reliability prong of <em>Ohio v. Roberts. </em>The Supreme Court has indicated \u201cthat the \u2018indicia of reliability\u2019 requirement could be met in either of two circumstances: where the hearsay statement \u2018falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,\u2019 or where it is supported by \u2018a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 816, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3147, 111 L.Ed.2d 638, 653 (1990) (quoting <em>Roberts, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>448 </em>U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d at 608). Where the hearsay in question falls within a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d hearsay exception \u201cno independent inquiry into reliability is required....\u201d <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 183, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2782, 97 L.Ed.2d 144, 157 (1987). \u201cAdmission under a firmly rooted hearsay exception satisfies the constitutional requirement of reliability because of the weight accorded longstanding judicial and legislative experience in assessing the trustworthiness of certain types of out-of-court statements.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> **** <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 817, 110 S.Ct. at 3147, 111 L.Ed.2d at 653 (citations omitted). However, where hearsay statements are admitted under an exception which is not considered \u201cfirmly rooted,\u201d then they are \u201cpresumptively unreliable and inadmissible for Confrontation Clause purposes\u201d and must be excluded, at least absent a \u201c \u2018showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 543, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 2063, 90 L.Ed.2d 514, 528 (1986) (quoting <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d at 608). These guarantees of trustworthiness must be such that the evidence is \u201cat least as reliable as evidence admitted under a firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d so as to assure \u201cthat adversarial testing would add little to its reliability.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 821, 110 S.Ct. at 3149, 111 L.Ed.2d at 656 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Article 27, \u00a7 142(c) does not qualify as a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d hearsay exception. As the Supreme Court has noted, the codification of a hearsay exception does not alone qualify it for a presumption of reliability. <em>See Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 817-18, 110 S.Ct. at 3148, 111 L.Ed.2d at 654. If that were the case, the Confrontation Clause would become a shallow vessel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>whose contents are subject to rapid evaporation by way of legislative enactment. Accordingly, we must probe the foundation of Article 27, \u00a7 142(c) to determine whether it bears sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness so \u201cthat \u2018there is no material departure from the reason of the general rule\u2019 \u201d requiring cross-examination. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 65, 100 S.Ct. at 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d at 607 (quoting <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 107, 54 S.Ct. 330, 333, 78 L.Ed. 674, 679 (1934)).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">We recently discussed factors courts generally consider in determining the reliability of hearsay in <em>Bailey v. State, </em>327 Md. 689, 612 A.2d 288 (1992). Although <em>Bailey </em>concerned the admissibility of hearsay in probation revocation proceedings, it provides a useful starting point for our analysis in the instant case. We noted in <em>Bailey </em>that it is \u201cdifficult for this Court to formulate any bright-line standards\u201d with respect to determining the reliability of hearsay. <em>Id., </em>327 Md. at 700, 612 A.2d at 293. We did identify, however, several factors to which courts often look in determining whether admitted testimony bears sufficient indicia of reliability so as not to offend principles of confrontation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">\u201cThese factors include: the presence of any additional evidence which corroborates the proffered hearsay; the type of and centrality of the issue that the hearsay is being offered to prove; and the source of the hearsay, including the possibility of bias or motive to fabricate. This is not an all-inclusive list, as other factors may affect a court\u2019s evaluation of reliability. Furthermore, the facts and circumstances of a particular case may undermine the trustworthiness of hearsay evidence that otherwise might enjoy a high degree of reliability.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">In the instant case, the Affidavit as to Account Status, made admissible by \u00a7 142(c), is closely related to hearsay evidence routinely introduced under more traditional hearsay exceptions recognized in this State. Section 142(c)\u2019s most apparent analog is Maryland\u2019s statutory business records hearsay ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ception, which provides for the admission into evidence of a \u201cwriting or record made in the regular course of business as a memorandum or record of an act, transaction, occurrence, or event ... to prove the act, transaction, occurrence, or event.\u201d Md.Code (1974,1989 Repl.Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 10-101(b). Hearsay evidence admitted under the business records exception is generally regarded as reliable since any risk of \u201cinsincerity will be minimized, because the business will want accurate records to rely on,\u201d Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 803(6).l, at 380 (1987) (hereinafter <em>Maryland Evidence), </em>and \u201c[t]he very regularity and continuity of the records are calculated to train the recordkeeper in habits of precision.\u201d 2 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 286, at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Section 142(e) is a direct derivative of the business records exception. The information contained in the affidavit is gathered from records the bank generates and maintains for its own use and upon which it relies to conduct its business, thus lending credibility to the information contained therein. Banks universally generate and maintain records concerning transactions affecting their customers\u2019 accounts, as well as the status of their customers\u2019 accounts. Ordinarily, a bank\u2019s records of its accounts would qualify under the business records exception as long as the information contained therein is reported by an employee with a business duty to report and recorded by an employee with a business duty to record the information. <em>See </em>Advisory Committee Notes to Fed.R.Evid. 803(6), 56 F.R.D. 183, 308-09 (1972) (indicating that where both source of information and maker of a business record operated under a duty of accuracy, due to their employment, that records ordinarily qualify under common law business record exception). In addition, there are circumstances where it may not be an abuse of discretion to admit business records even without the testimony of the records\u2019 custodian. As this Court held in <em>Pine St. Trading Corp. v. Farrell Lines, Inc., </em>278 Md. 363, 373, 364 A.2d 1103, 1110 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">\u201cWhile a foundation must be laid for the introduction of evidence under [the business records exception] statute, the foundation need not always consist of testimonial evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>and in some cases the court may properly conclude from <em>the circumstances and the nature of the document involved </em>that it was made in the regular course of business.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><em>Id.; see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Keister, </em>327 Md. 56, 74-75, 607 A.2d 909, 918 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">We also note that several cases have held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3505, which allows admission of foreign business records based on an affidavit of a foreign business employee attesting to veracity and source, does not violate a criminal defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. <em>See United States v. Sturman, </em>951 F.2d 1466, 1489-90 (6th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 2964, 119 L.Ed.2d 586 (1992); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>830 F.2d 1073, 1077-78 (9th Cir.1987); <em>United States v. Gleave, </em>786 F.Supp. 258, 279 (W.D.N.Y.1992); <em>United States v. Chan, </em>680 F.Supp. 521, 522-25 (E.D.N.Y.1988). For example, in <em>United States v. Miller, </em>which involved the admission of a certificate of the records of a foreign bank under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3505, the Ninth Circuit found that such certificates bear adequate indicia of reliability. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">\u201cBanks depend on keeping accurate records and although, as we all know, they err occasionally, their records are among the most common type of business record routinely used in our courts. The novelty of the statute is to admit the records without confrontation by the defendant with the recordkeepers. No motive is suggested that would lead bank officials to change, distort, or manipulate the records at issue here. The recordkeepers have, under criminal penalties in their own countries, asserted that the records are records kept in the course of business. Examination of the recordkeepers ... could not reasonably be expected to establish anything more or less than that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-10\"><em>Id., </em>830 F.2d at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">In enacting \u00a7 142(c), the General Assembly quite simply took legislative notice of the strong indicia of reliability accompanying bank records, but altered the traditional procedure of placing their contents into evidence in two ways. First, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>General Assembly decided to allow the State to forego the admission of the voluminous actual bank records and instead substitute a summary of the relevant information that those records would invariably reveal. Second, the General Assembly also decided to forego the need for testimony of the bank employee who prepared the account summary of the account in question. We believe that the General Assembly made a valid judgment in thus expanding the manner in which the State may prove an account\u2019s status, or its non-existence. These procedural \u201cshort-cuts\u201d are well grounded and do not undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of data contained in account records created and maintained in the ordinary course of the bank\u2019s business. Rather, the General Assembly, in enacting \u00a7 142(c), invoked well-accepted evidentiary practices to prove the status of an account by means of an account summary or the lack of an account through the absence of entries in business records.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">First, the information derived from the bank\u2019s records and contained in a \u00a7 142(c) affidavit concerning the status or lack of an account would also be admissible as an exception to the best evidence rule. Ordinarily, where documentary evidence is admissible into evidence, a party may not prove its contents with extrinsic evidence. Rather, the documents or records themselves must be introduced into evidence. This rule is not absolute, however, and parties may introduce summaries or compilations of voluminous or complex records, such as bank records, to prove the contents of otherwise admissible records. Such summaries of complex or voluminous records may take two forms: summations or compilations of what the records contain, <em>id., </em>or statements as to what is <em>not </em>recorded in the records. <em>See generally Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 1006.1, at 545-46. As for the latter form, it is well established under Maryland law that a litigant may prove through negative inference, without the need of introducing the underlying records, the non-occurrence of an event or transaction from the absence of an entry in a business\u2019s records where such records normally contain like information. <em>Summons v. State, </em>156 Md. 382, 386-87, 144 A. 497, 500 (1929); <em>Hutchinson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number><em>State, </em>36 Md.App. 58, 62-64, 373 A.2d 50, 52-53 (1977). In <em>Summons v. State, </em>for example, the defendant was convicted of obtaining money by false pretenses. The defendant represented to an investor that he was selling stock of a corporation, that all the proceeds of the sale would go directly to that corporation, and that he maintained a sum of money to repay any dissatisfied investors. At trial, the State introduced testimony of a director of the corporation that the defendant was allegedly representing. The witness testified that \u201che examined and investigated the accounts and records of the company ... and found no record of any deposit or fund provided by the [defendant] for the purpose of the reimbursement of the stockholders; ... and that a complete personal examination failed to reveal any record that the [defendant] had turned in to the company the proceeds of the sale of any of its common stock.\u201d <em>Summons, </em>156 Md. at 387, 144 A. at 499. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s objections to this testimony, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abt\">\u201cThe objection to the testimony is that it is not the best evidence of the facts introduced; but we cannot agree with this contention, since the purpose was, not to establish the terms of the corporate records or accounts, but to establish facts about these documents other than their contents. The witness was giving primary evidence of facts within his personal knowledge as a result of the exercise of his own powers of observation. On this ground, or on that of the inconvenience of producing before the jury or trial court a large number of documents and accounts to be read and examined before a fact could be ascertained, a competent witness, who has investigated and is familiar with the contents of the entire mass, may testify that certain entries in the corporate records or accounts do not exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\"><em>Id., </em>156 Md. at 386-87, 144 A. at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Section 142(c) deviates from the practice of using summaries of records in one way: the need to present a bank employee, as custodian of the records or as the one who prepared the summary, to lay the appropriate foundation. This deviation from the admission of the bank\u2019s business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>records or summaries of those records, however, is not fatal to \u00a7 142(c). The General Assembly may properly excuse the testimony of an out-of-court declarant or custodian of records where it does not undermine the reliability of the proposed evidence, as it has for example in the case of public records under Md.Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 10-204. Under \u00a7 10-204 a court may admit a public record into evidence without the presence of the preparer of the record or custodian of records. Under the public records exception, records, reports, statements, or data compilations of public offices or agencies are admissible at trial absent circumstances indicating a lack of trustworthiness. <em>See Ellsworth v. Sherne Lingerie, Inc., </em>303 Md. 581, 606, 612, 495 A.2d 348, 360-61, 363-64 (1985). Such public records are freely admissible into evidence, without testimonial sponsorship of the person who prepared the record or the record custodian, \u201cif certified as a true copy by the custodian of the record.... \u201d \u00a7 10-204. As we reasoned in <em>Ellsworth, </em>the rationale underlying the assessment of trustworthiness attached to public records is \u201cbecause of the reliability of the public agencies usually conducting the investigation, and \u2018their lack of any motive for conducting the studies other than to inform the public fairly and adequately.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ellsworth, </em>303 Md. at 607, 495 A.2d at 361 (quoting <em>Ellis v. International Playtex, Inc., </em>745 F.2d 292, 300 (4th Cir.1984), in turn quoting <em>Kehm v. Proctor &amp; Gamble, </em>724 F.2d 613, 618-19 (8th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In essence, the General Assembly made a judgment when enacting \u00a7 142(c) that independent banking institutions, in the context of the criminal bad check provisions, should be treated as public or quasi-public agencies so that their affidavits are readily admissible without the necessity of calling the custodian of the records or those who generate summaries of those records. <em>Cf. State v. Rogers, </em>177 N.J.Super. 365, 426 A.2d 1035, 1040 (1981) (affidavit of local government official stating that defendant had no permit for revolver in prosecution for possession of a revolver without a permit did not violate defendant\u2019s right of confrontation); <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>492 F.2d 217, 220 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 935, 94 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>2649, 41 L.Ed.2d 239 (1974) (holding admission of certif\u00edcate of non-registration of destructive device, which recited that a diligent search was conducted and disclosed no registration, did not violate the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation). We find that, considering the nature of the banking industry, this judgment was sound and inherently reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The banking industry possesses qualities that assure the same degree of accuracy as public records. As with public agencies, banks have strong incentives to generate and maintain accurate account records. The nature of their business, as well as state and federal regulation, require that banks meticulously record the transactions that affect their customers\u2019 accounts. Such information is the stock and trade of the banking industry. Additionally, the absence of an apparent motive of bank employees to fabricate also buttresses the General Assembly\u2019s decision to equate the banking industry with a quasi-public agency. This factor provides a guarantee of reliability in the context of public records and, as we found in <em>Bailey, </em>acts as an indicator of reliability of hearsay. <em>Bailey, </em>327 Md. at 702-03, 612 A.2d at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Chapman argues that no such indicia of reliability can be assumed in the instant case because the document was generated in anticipation of litigation. While it is true that documents that parties prepare for the purpose of litigation are often suspect because of their apparent self-serving ends, <em>see Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 803(6).l, at 382, such is not the case when a bank completes an affidavit of account status or notice of protest under Article 27, \u00a7 142(c). There is no enhanced motive for insincerity or fabrication under these circumstances. This is not the case where a party to the litigation generates a document for self-serving means. Rather, the bank, not the State, prepares the affidavits of account status. The bank has neither a position to advocate nor a stake in the outcome of a criminal trial. <em>See Howard v. United States, </em>473 A.2d 835, 839 (D.C.1984) (finding admission of government\u2019s drug analysis reports did not violate defendant\u2019s confrontation rights since chemists conducted tests under routine circumstances and without interest in outcome of litigation); <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number><em>Deanes, </em>323 N.C. 508, 374 S.E.2d 249, 261-62 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1101, 109 S.Ct. 2455, 104 L.Ed.2d 1009 (1989) (finding that introduction of medical test result of victim generated by a private lab, after initiation of criminal proceedings, did not violate defendant\u2019s right of confrontation where there was \u201cabsolutely no evidence that anyone at the lab had any knowledge of the criminal prosecution, or any motive to distort the truth if they had known of it.\u201d). Additionally, the form affidavit does not reflect a preconceived bias. The form affidavit is in the first instance an investigatory tool, whereby the bank may well provide information tending to establish the defendant\u2019s innocence, as well as his guilt. For example, the form allows the bank to indicate that on the date the defendant uttered the check, he or she had a valid account and that the account contained sufficient funds. The State does not simply send a bank a completed form and ask it to \u201crubber-stamp\u201d it. Rather, the bank must perform an independent review of its records and fill out the form according to what its records show.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Finally, an additional factor that provides some indicia of reliability of a \u00a7 142(c) affidavit is the fact that it is corroborated by the dishonored check itself. An element of the bad check offense is that \u201c[pjayment [of the check] is refused by the drawee upon presentation.\u201d \u00a7 141(a)(3). Dishonored checks give some indication that there was insufficient money in the account to honor the check at the time of presentment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Citing <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 820-24, 110 S.Ct. at 3149-51, 111 L.Ed.2d at 655-58, Chapman asserted at oral argument that it is inappropriate to consider corroborative evidence to bolster the reliability of an out-of-court statement under the Confrontation Clause. While Chapman\u2019s reading of <em>Wright </em>may be sound, we find <em>Wright </em>to be distinguishable from this case. In <em>Wright, </em>the defendant was tried for sexually abusing her two young daughters. At trial, the trial judge admitted testimony of a doctor who had examined both of the children. The testimony at issue regarded the out-of-court statements of the younger daughter concerning the acts of sexual abuse committed by her mother and her mother\u2019s boyfriend, Giles. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>trial judge found that the statements were admissible under Idaho\u2019s residual hearsay exception. The trial judge, taking into consideration the medical and physical evidence of sexual abuse and the in-court testimony of the older daughter, found that the hearsay testimony regarding the child\u2019s statements bore sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness. <em>See State v. Giles, </em>115 Idaho 984, 772 P.2d 191, 194-95 (1989); <em>State v. Wright, </em>116 Idaho 382, 775 P.2d 1224 (1989) (both detailing lower court proceedings relating to <em>Idaho v. </em>Wright).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The majority in <em>Wright </em>rejected the State\u2019s argument that \u201c \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 should ... be based on a consideration of the totality of the circumstances, including not only the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement, but also other evidence at trial that corroborates the truth of the statement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>497 U.S. at 820, 110 S.Ct. at 3148, 111 L.Ed.2d at 655. The Court \u201cagree[d] that \u2018particular guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 must be shown from the totality of the circumstances,\u201d but stated that \u201cthe relevant circumstances include only those that surround the making of the statement.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned that the use of other unrelated case specific corroborating evidence \u201cto support a hearsay statement\u2019s \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 would permit admission of a presumptively unreliable statement by bootstrapping on the trustworthiness of other evidence at trial....\u201d <em>Id., </em>497 U.S. at 823, 110 S.Ct. at 3150, 111 L.Ed.2d at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In the instant case, using the fact that the drawee bank refused to pay the check upon presentation as corroboration for the reliability of the Affidavit as to Account Status is not constitutionally infirm under <em>Wright. </em>Section 142(c) creates a narrow hearsay exception which comes into play only where there has already been a dishonored check. <em>See </em>\u00a7 141(a)(3) (providing that fact \u201c[pjayment is refused by the drawee upon presentation\u201d is an element of bad check offense); \u00a7 142(b)(1) (providing drawer of check is presumed to have intended or believed the check would be dishonored upon presentation where drawer had no account at time of utterance). It is only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>after the drawee bank has refused payment, and a complaint has been filed, that the State\u2019s Attorney presents a \u00a7 142(c) affidavit to the bank to investigate whether a violation of the Bad Check statute has occurred. The dishonored check is thus a prerequisite to, and a component part of, the hearsay exception embodied in \u00a7 142(c). The fact that the drawee bank has refused payment of the check <em>is </em>part of the circumstances surrounding the genesis of the affidavit, and therefore constitutes permissible corroboration under <em>Wright. </em>Thus, the existence of the dishonored check properly provides further indicia of the affidavit\u2019s reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In light of our analysis above, we reject Chapman\u2019s facial challenge to Article 27, \u00a7 142(c). We hold that out-of-court statements admitted under Article 27, \u00a7 142(c) bear sufficient \u201cguarantees of trustworthiness\u201d to satisfy the requirements of the Confrontation Clause. Considering \u00a7 142(c)\u2019s adoption of familiar evidentiary principles, its close similarity to business and public records exceptions and the indicia of reliability associated with those exceptions, the lack of any apparent motive to fabricate, and the corroborative quality of the canceled check, we conclude that Article 27, \u00a7 142(c) is generally so reliable that \u201cadversarial testing would add little to its reliability.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 821, 110 S.Ct. at 3149, 111 L.Ed.2d at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Next, Chapman asserts that admission of the Affidavit as to Account Status under \u00a7 142(c) fails the second prong of the <em>Roberts </em>standard since it does not require a showing of unavailability of the person who prepared the summary. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>decision, courts and commentators often interpreted <em>Roberts </em>to require a showing of both (1) the unavailability of the declarant or a demonstration of unsuccessful good faith efforts to secure the declarant\u2019s presence, and (2) that the proffered hearsay possessed adequate indicia of reliability. More recently, however, the Supreme Court has qualified its language in <em>Roberts </em>concerning what some have perceived as a strict unavailability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>requirement. <em>See White v. Illinois, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 112 S.Ct. 736, 741-42, 116 L.Ed.2d 848, 857-60 (1992); <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 182, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2782, 97 L.Ed.2d 144, 157 (1987); <em>United States v. Inadi, </em>475 U.S. 387, 392-94, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 1124-25, 89 L.Ed.2d 390, 396-97 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In the first of these cases, <em>Inadi, </em>the issue before the Court was whether the Confrontation Clause required a prior showing of unavailability of the hearsay declarant before the government could introduce an out-of-court statement of a co-conspirator under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court rejected the Third Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 finding that <em>Roberts </em>requires the government to first demonstrate unavailability of a declarant as a constitutionally mandated prerequisite to admissibility of all forms of hearsay. The Court cautioned that <em>Roberts </em>should not be read \u201cas an abstract answer to questions not presented in that case, but rather as a resolution of the issue the Court said it was examining: \u2018the constitutional propriety of the introduction of the preliminary hearsay testimony of a witness not produced at the defendant\u2019s subsequent criminal trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Inadi, </em>475 U.S. at 392-93, 106 S.Ct. at 1125, 89 L.Ed.2d at 397 (quoting <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 58, 100 S.Ct. at 2535, 65 L.Ed.2d at 602). According to the Court, <em>\u201cRoberts </em>cannot fairly be read to stand for the radical proposition that no out-of-court statement can be introduced by the government without a showing that the declarant is unavailable.\u201d <em>Id., </em>475 U.S. at 394, 106 S.Ct. at 1125, 89 L.Ed.2d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The Court in <em>Inadi </em>then distinguished between evidence admitted under the co-conspirator and the former testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>exceptions. With respect to the former testimony exception, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">\u201cUnlike some other exceptions to the hearsay rules, ... former testimony often is only a weaker substitute for live testimony. It seldom has independent evidentiary significance of its own, but is intended to replace live testimony. If the declarant is available and the same information can be presented to the trier of fact in the form of live testimony, with full cross-examination and the opportunity to view the demeanor of the declarant, there is little justification for relying on the weaker version.... But if the declarant is unavailable, no \u2018better\u2019 version of the evidence exists, and the former testimony may be admitted as a substitute for live testimony on the same point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><em>Id., </em>475 U.S. at 394-95, 106 S.Ct. at 1126, 89 L.Ed.2d at 398. The Court then explained that the same principles do not apply to co-conspirator statements. Unlike the prior testimony context, the government is not faced with a choice between two forms of evidence to prove the same point. Co-conspirator statements, the Court reasoned, cannot be replicated at trial. Such statements \u201cderive much of their value from the fact that they are made in the context very different from trial, [during the course of the conspiracy,] and therefore are usually irreplaceable as substantive evidence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>475 U.S. at 395-96, 106 S.Ct. at 1126, 89 L.Ed.2d at 399. Furthermore, the Court determined that the burdens on the criminal justice system associated with mandating a rule of unavailability in this context outweighed any foreseeable benefits. <em>Id., </em>475 U.S. at 399-400, 106 S.Ct. at 1128, 89 L.Ed.2d at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In <em>White v. Illinois, </em>the Court reaffirmed <em>Inadi\u2019s </em>clarification of <em>Roberts. </em>In <em>White, </em>the Court again stated that the unavailability requirement established in <em>Roberts </em>does not apply to all forms of hearsay. <em>White, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 741-42, 116 L.Ed.2d at 858. The Court held that, as with the co-conspirator statements addressed in <em>Inadi, </em>the Confrontation Clause does not require an initial showing of unavailability prior to admitting out-of-court statements which are spontaneous declarations or are made for the purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>attaining medical diagnosis or treatment as substantive evidence for the State\u2019s case. <em>White, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 743, 116 L.Ed.2d at 859-60. In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted that such out-of-court statements \u201care made in contexts that provide substantial guarantees of their trustworthiness,\u201d and that the \u201csame factors that contribute to the statements\u2019 reliability cannot be recaptured even by later in-court testimony.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 742, 116 L.Ed.2d at 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">With <em>Inadi </em>and <em>White, </em>it appears that the Supreme Court has emphasized that <em>Roberts </em>contemplated a rule of necessity, not one of unavailability. <em>Accord Moon v. State, </em>300 Md. 354, 366, 478 A.2d 695, 701 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1207, 105 S.Ct. 1170, 84 L.Ed.2d 321 (1985) (exceptions to rule requiring cross-examination permitted in past only \u201c \u2018after close scrutiny has disclosed that this type of <em>evidence is both necessary and so intrinsically reliable </em>that it need not be subjected to the rigors of cross-examination\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>State v. Collins, </em>265 Md. 70, 78, 288 A.2d 163, 167 (1972)); <em>State v. Roby, </em>463 N.W.2d 506, 509 (Minn.1990) (stating that Confrontation Clause analysis entails inquiry into necessity of hearsay evidence and its reliability). In both <em>Inadi </em>and <em>White, </em>the Court focused on the <em>necessity </em>of admitting at trial the type of out-of-court statement, and whether that need was outweighed by the benefit to the criminal defendant of requiring the government to present the out-of-court declarant. Furthermore, the <em>Inadi </em>Court even recast <em>Roberts </em>in terms of necessity. It made clear that where both live testimony and hearsay testimony are available to prove the identical point, the Confrontation Clause favors the production of the live testimony at trial, rather than permitting what is most convenient for the government to produce. The Court indicated that unavailability of a hearsay declarant may be one way the State may establish the necessity of introducing the out-of-court statement, but it is not the exclusive way.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent clarification of <em>Roberts, </em>we must reject Chapman\u2019s argument that, since \u00a7 142(c) does not require a prior showing of unavailability, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>is per se unconstitutional. While unavailability of a declarant may be required in some instances, as we shall explain, this is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Under \u00a7 142(c) and other compilations and summaries of official and business records, there are two distinct classes of out-of-court declarants: (1) the persons who generated each individual document that comprises the organization\u2019s records, and (2) the persons who reviewed the contents of those records and state a conclusion as to what those records reveal. Although Chapman fails to indicate to which class of declarants he believes an unavailability requirement should apply, we find that a showing of unavailability is not required in either case. First, it is beyond dispute that a litigant need not establish the unavailability of those who generate the individual entries in a business\u2019s or agency\u2019s records. <em>See Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 67 n. 8, 100 S.Ct. at 2539 n. 8, 65 L.Ed.2d at 608 n. 8 (indicating both business records and official records exceptions are \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d exceptions to the hearsay rule); <em>State v. Garlick, </em>313 Md. 209, 225-26, 545 A.2d 27, 30 (1988) (holding hospital record admissible in a criminal case under the business records exception without testimony of hospital employee who made entry into patient\u2019s medical records); <em>Bowers v. State, </em>298 Md. 115, 136-37, 468 A.2d 101, 112 (1983) (holding that admission of autopsy report under business records exception did not violate defendant\u2019s right of confrontation without testimony of medical examiner who prepared the report). In such instances, the routine nature of the task, while bolstering reliability of the document, also decreases the probability that the declarant will remember the events memorialized in the entry. <em>See State v. Sosa, </em>59 Wash.App. 678, 800 P.2d 839, 843 (1990) (lab experts who prepare reports are unlikely to recall details of routine report completed weeks before trial). This fact satisfies the necessity prong, since the cross-examination of the declarant would likely be futile and the most accurate evidence of the event is the affidavit itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Likewise, the Confrontation Clause does not require a showing of unavailability with respect to the out-of-court statements of those bank employees who summarize those records. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Once again we find instructive the General Assembly\u2019s classification of banks as quasi-public agencies. In general, summaries prepared by a government official from public records do not violate the Confrontation Clause regardless of the availability of the official who generated the summary. <em>See, e.g., Rogers, </em>177 N.J.Super. 365, 426 A.2d at 1040; <em>Cruz, </em>492 F.2d at 220; <em>see also Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 67 n. 8, 100 S.Ct. at 2539 n. 8, 65 L.Ed.2d at 608 n. 8 (indicating official records exception, which includes data compilations, is a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d exception to the hearsay rule). The rationale underlying excusing the testimony as a condition of admissibility is the \u201c \u2018assumption that a public official will perform his duty properly and the unlikelihood that he will remember details independently from the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ellsworth, </em>303 Md. at 606, 495 A.2d at 361 (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 803(8) advisory committee\u2019s note). Additionally, public policy disfavors the disruption of public agencies by requiring them to testify on a regular basis concerning matters contained in their records. 2 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 295, at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Similar policies that underlie the official records exception to the hearsay rule also support \u00a7 142(c). First, in light of the great reliability accorded the banking records and the absence of any motive on the part of the bank employees to fabricate, the General Assembly could legitimately assume that the bank would accurately complete its task of examining and summarizing its records. Additionally, the very purpose of \u00a7 142(c) was to avoid the unnecessary burdening and disruption of the banking system by requiring the bank to present ministerial witnesses to carry to court a bank\u2019s business records. Furthermore, these decisions are buttressed by the limited utility that cross-examination of a record\u2019s custodian would provide the criminal defendant in a bad check prosecution. Bank employees generate and utilize the bank\u2019s records with great frequency. With the routine of repetitive examination of the bank\u2019s records comes the probability that the details concerning any given transaction will fade. The affidavit recording the summary of the account, that the bank employees contemporaneously generate, might even constitute better evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>than the subsequent live testimony of the witness who examined the records. The live custodian could say little more than the affidavit-\u2014\u201cI searched the record and this is what I found.\u201d Cross-examination is, thus, unlikely to clarify the record or jog the declarant\u2019s memory beyond the recorded information in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Due to the limited utility to criminal defendants of cross-examining bank employees and the substantial burden to banks associated with it, we find that the Confrontation Clause does not require the State to establish the unavailability of the bank employee who compiled the Affidavit as to Account Status. Accordingly, we hold that Article 27, \u00a7 142(c) does not violate the mandates of the Confrontation Clause by omitting such an unavailability requirement. Finally, we also point out that if Chapman believed there was anything in the bank records that would have aided his defense, he was free to subpoena those records.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Chapman\u2019s final argument focuses on the specific affidavit admitted under Article 27, \u00a7 142(c). Chapman points to the fact that the affidavit incorrectly states that the check was presented for payment on April 21, 1989, when in fact it was presented on April 21, 1988. Relying on <em>Moon v. State, </em>300 Md. 354, 478 A.2d 695 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1207, 105 S.Ct. 1170, 84 L.Ed.2d 321 (1985), Chapman argues that there was an obvious error on the face of the affidavit and, as such, it \u201ccannot be said to have such indicia of reliability as would justify the abridgement of [his] right under the State and federal constitutions.\u201d We disagree and reject his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">At trial, Chapman contended that the obvious error in the affidavit regarding the date of presentation undermined its reliability and made it inadmissible under <em>Moon. </em>The trial judge disagreed, however, and admitted the affidavit over Chapman\u2019s objection. The trial judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">\u201cI think considering the totality of the circumstances the check itself indicates ... it was presented on April 21st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>1988 ... it was deposited April the 20th, [with] the second presentment on April the 21st. So, the most important evidence is that the check itself indicates that---- I think basically it\u2019s a scrivener\u2019s error and based on the totality of the evidence and including the witness testified that the check was returned promptly indicates that it was a mistake____ I\u2019ll overrule the objection----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Upon review of the affidavit admitted at Chapman\u2019s trial we conclude that the obvious single typographical error in the affidavit does not undermine the reliability of its otherwise trustworthy hearsay. Unlike the report submitted in <em>Moon, </em>the affidavit submitted at Chapman\u2019s trial was not marred by discrepancies that undermined its reliability. The trial judge did not err in relying on the dishonored check, which was in evidence, and concluding that the Affidavit as to Account Status was trustworthy, despite the presence of an obviously typographical error. The check was also in evidence. In accordance with banking industry practice, each bank that handled the check stamped the back of the instrument with a date on which it handled the check. The check Chapman uttered contained two such stamps: (1) from the collecting bank in which Sears initially deposited the check dated April 20, 1988; and (2) the drawee bank which received the check for presentment on April 21, 1988. It is clear that the date of presentment in the affidavit was not substantive and was merely a typographical error. The hearsay affidavit of the bank was admissible to establish the status of Chapman\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HAR-FORD COUNTY AFFIRMED.
