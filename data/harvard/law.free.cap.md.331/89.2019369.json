Vol.), Art. 28, \u00a7 8-101. That section designates the county councils of Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties \u201cas the district council for that portion of the regional district lying within each county, respectively.\u201d \u00a7 8-101(a). The section further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">\u201c(b) <em>Grant of zoning </em>power.\u2014(1) Each district council, respectively, in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in this article, may by ordinance adopt and amend the text of the zoning ordinance and may by resolution or ordinance adopt and amend the map or maps accompanying the zoning ordinance text to regulate, in the portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of the regional district lying within its county, (i) the location, height, bulk, and size of buildings, other structures, and units therein, building lines, minimum frontages, depths and areas of lots, and percentages of lots which may be occupied; (ii) the size of lots, yards, courts, and other open spaces; (in) the erection of temporary stands and structures; (iv) the density and distribution of population; (v) the location and uses of buildings and structures and units therein for trade, industry, residence, recreation, agriculture, public activities, and other purposes; and (vi) the uses of land, including surface, subsurface, and air rights therein, for building, trade, industry, residence, recreation, agriculture, forestry, or other purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The Prince George\u2019s County \u201cmini-dorm\u201d ordinance was introduced in the County Council of Prince George\u2019s County, sitting as the District Council, as Zoning Ordinance Bill Number CB-152-1989 on October 31,1989, was enacted into law on November 28, 1989, and took effect on July 1, 1990. The ordinance\u2019s preamble states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">\u201cAN ORDINANCE concerning</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">Mini-Dormitories</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">FOR the purpose of defining a mini-dormitory; establishing criteria for regulating this use; allowing it as a permitted use or by Special Exception in certain zones, subject to certain criteria; prohibiting the Board of Appeals from granting certain variances for mini-dormitories; prohibiting the Planning Board from approving departures from the required number of parking spaces for mini-dormitories; and requiring all existing uses to be in conformance with these regulations by July 1, 1991.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">These legislative goals were achieved by amending the County\u2019s zoning ordinance at \u00a7\u00a7 27-107.1, 27-229(b), 27-441(b)(6), 27\u2014515(b)(7), 27-547(b)(7), 27-568 and 27-588(c) and adding \u00a7\u00a7 27-249.1, 27-374.1, 27-445.7, 27-532.2, and 27-548.1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">The ordinance defines a \u201cmini-dormitory\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u201cAn off-campus residence, located in a building that is, or was originally constructed as a one-family, two-family, or three-family dwelling which houses at least three (3), but not more than five (5), individuals, <em>all or part of whom are unrelated to one another by blood, adoption or marriage and who are registered full-time or part-time students at an institution of higher learning.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00a7 27-107.1(a) (150.1) (emphasis added).

Further, departures from the required number of parking spaces may not be approved by the Planning Board and a reduction in the required number of spaces must have approval of the County Council, sitting as the District Council, \u201cin the form of a variance granted in connection with the approval of a Special Exception.\u201d \u00a7 27-588(c)(2). A \u201cmini-dormitory\u201d is permitted only after obtaining a Use and Occupancy Permit certifying the residence as an acceptable \u201cmini-dormitory\u201d or by receiving special exception from the District Council. The ordinance further provides that nonconforming structures being used as mini-dorms must be certified and \u201cmay only continue subject to the requirements of this Section and to any other applicable requirements of [the code].\u201d \u00a7 27-249.1(a). In that section, the ordinance continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">\u201c(b) The purpose of this Section is to prevent or control detrimental effects upon neighboring properties, such as illegal parking and saturation of available parking by residents of mini-dormitories, litter, and noise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">(c) All certified nonconforming mini-dormitories shall meet the following requirements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">(1) The use shall not alter the single-family residential character or appearance of the premises; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">(2) The property shall be maintained in accordance with all applicable provisions of the County Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The ordinance provides additional requirements for specific special exceptions at \u00a7 27-374.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">(a) A mini-dormitory may be permitted, subject to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">(1) The application shall be accompanied by a statement which sets forth an acceptable maintenance plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">(2) The site plan shall include the number, type, and location of exterior trash receptacles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-12\">(3) Rooms used for sleeping purposes shall have not less than seventy (70) square feet per resident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>(4) All required parking spaces shall be provided on-site, except as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\">(A) The required number of parking spaces may be reduced on-site by one (1) space if on-street parking is allowed in front of the subject lot; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">(B) The required number of parking spaces may be provided off-site if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">(i) The mini-dormitory is located within five hundred (500) feet of an existing parking lot;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">(ii) The owner of the mini-dormitory has written permission from the parking lot owner for the residents of the mini-dormitory to use the parking lot; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">(iii) The existing parking lot has sufficient surplus parking spaces available to provide the number of spaces required;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">(5) Parking spaces provided solely for, and on the same lot with, the mini-dormitory may be located one behind the other (the front space may be used as access to the rear space);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">(6) The number of driveway entrances authorized shall not exceed one (1) driveway entrance per building lot or per street on which the subject lot has frontage (i.e., a corner lot) unless such driveway entrances were in existence on November 28, 1989;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">(7) The use shall not alter the single-family residential character or appearance of the premises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-12\">(8) The maximum percentage of lot coverage for a mini-dormitory shall be the same as that for the dwelling type that was originally constructed on the lot; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-13\">(9) The maximum percentage of lot coverage may only be increased by the District Council in the form of a variance granted in connection with the approval of a Special Exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">On July 3, 1990, Donald P. Kirsch and Martha Kaye Dunn, individual owners of residential property they wish to rent to persons including students, and Stephanie Stockman and Dan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>iel Cones, both students at the University of Maryland residing off campus in housing subject to the ordinance, (\u201cthe petitioners\u201d), filed suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, seeking declaratory relief from the ordinance. On motion of the plaintiffs, the circuit court issued an interlocutory injunction on February 14, 1991, enjoining the County from enforcing the ordinance pending final disposition. Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed, and on August 1, 1991, the circuit court granted the County\u2019s motion. That judgment was affirmed by Court of Special Appeals. <em>Kirsch v.

Edmonds, supra, </em>we revisited the standards under which legislative classifications are judged in equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>protection cases. Speaking for the Court, Judge Eldridge wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">\u201cIn most instances when a governmental classification is attacked on equal protection grounds, the classification is reviewed under the so-called \u2018rational basis\u2019 test. Generally under that test, a court \u2018will not overturn\u2019 the classification \u2018unless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that [the court] can only conclude that the [governmental] actions were irrational.\u2019 A statutory classification reviewed under the rational basis standard enjoys a strong presumption of constitutionality and will be invalidated only if the classification is clearly arbitrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">\u201cWhere, however, a statutory classification burdens a \u2018suspect class\u2019 or impinges upon a \u2018fundamental right,\u2019 the classification is subject to strict scrutiny. Such statutes will be upheld under the equal protection guarantees only if it is shown that \u2018they are suitably tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">\u201cFinally, there are classifications which have been subjected to a higher degree of scrutiny than the traditional and deferential rational basis test, but which have not been deemed to involve suspect classes or fundamental rights and thus have not been subjected to the strict scrutiny test. Included among these have been classifications based on gender, discrimination against illegitimate children under some circumstances, a classification between children of legal residents and children of illegal aliens with regard to a free public education, and a classification under which certain persons were denied the right to practice for compensation the profession which they were qualified and licensed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA9\"><em>Id. </em>at 355-357, 601 A.2d at 108-09 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In recent years, the Supreme Court has declined to extend heightened scrutiny review to additional legislative classifications. Instead, the Court has on several occasions held that notwithstanding the traditional deference accorded legislative acts certain legislative classifications failed rational basis scru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tiny because the classification adopted did not further the express purpose of the statute. In <em>City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, </em>473 U.S. 432, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985), the Supreme Court invalidated a city ordinance requiring an annual special use permit for particular group homes, including homes occupied by mentally retarded citizens. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">\u201cThe lesson of <em>[Massachusetts Board of Retirement v.] Murgia </em>[427 U.S. 307, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976) ] is that where individuals in the group affected by a law have distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests the State has the authority to implement, the courts have been very reluctant, as they should be in our federal system and with our respect for the separation of powers, to closely scrutinize legislative choices as to whether, how, and to what extent those interests should be pursued. In such cases, the Equal Protection Clause requires only a rational means to serve a legitimate end.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\"><em>Id. </em>473 U.S. at 441-42, 105 S.Ct. at 3255, 87 L.Ed.2d at 321. Nevertheless, Justice White, speaking for the Court, continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">\u201cOur refusal to recognize the retarded as a quasi-suspect class does not leave them entirely unprotected from invidious discrimination. To withstand equal protection review, legislation that distinguishes between the mentally retarded and others must be rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. This standard, we believe, affords government the latitude necessary both to pursue policies designed to assist the retarded in realizing their full potential, and to freely and efficiently engage in activities that burden the retarded in what is essentially an incidental manner. The State may not rely on a classification whose relationship to an asserted goal is so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational. Furthermore, some objectives\u2014 such as \u2018a bare ... desire to harm a politically unpopular group,\u2019\u2014are not legitimate state interests. Beyond that, the mentally retarded, like others, have and retain their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>substantive constitutional rights in addition to the right to be treated equally by the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 446-47, 105 S.Ct. at 3257-58, 87 L.Ed.2d at 324 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Passing on the issue of the zoning ordinance\u2019s validity, Justice White opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">\u201cThe constitutional issue is clearly posed. The city does not require a special use permit in a R-3 zone for apartment houses, multiple dwellings, boarding and lodging houses, fraternity or sorority houses, dormitories, apartment hotels, hospitals, sanitariums, nursing homes for convalescents or the aged (other than for the insane or feebleminded or alcoholics or drug addicts), private clubs or fraternal orders, and other specified uses. It does, however, insist on a special permit for the Featherston home, and it does so, as the District Court found, because it would be a facility for the mentally retarded. May the city require the permit for this facility when other care and multiple-dwelling facilities are freely permitted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">\u201cIt is true, as already pointed out, that the mentally retarded as a group are indeed different from others not sharing their misfortune, and in this respect they may be different from others who would occupy other facilities that would be permitted in an R-3 zone without a special permit. But this difference is largely irrelevant unless the Featherston home and those who would occupy it would threaten legitimate interests of the city in a way that other permitted uses such as boarding houses and hospitals would not. Because in our view the record does not reveal any rational basis for believing that the Featherston home would pose any special threat to the city\u2019s legitimate interests, we affirm the judgment below insofar as it holds the ordinance invalid as applied in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 447-48, 105 S.Ct. at 3258, 87 L.Ed.2d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">In <em>Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor, </em>472 U.S. 612, 105 S.Ct. 2862, 86 L.Ed.2d 487 (1985), a qualified Vietnam veteran and his wife who established residency in New Mexico in 1981 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>applied for a tax exemption in 1983 under a New Mexico statute exempting from the State\u2019s property tax $2000 of the assessed value of property of honorably discharged veterans who had served on active duty during the Vietnam War for at least 90 continuous days. The exemption was limited to those veterans who resided in New Mexico before May 8,1976. The exemption was denied. The couple challenged the statute as denying them equal protection of the law. In applying the rational basis standard to strike down the statute, the Court noted that \u201cif the statutory scheme cannot pass even the minimum rationality test, our inquiry ends.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 105 S.Ct. at 2866, 86 L.Ed.2d at 493. The Court went on to hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACS\">\u201cEven assuming that the State may legitimately grant benefits on the basis of a coincidence between military service and past residence, the New Mexico statute\u2019s distinction between resident veterans is not rationally related to the State\u2019s asserted legislative goal. The statute is not written to require any connection between the veteran\u2019s prior residence and military service.

Vermont, </em>472 U.S. 14, 105 S.Ct. 2465, 86 L.Ed.2d 11 (1985), the Court invalidated an automobile registration tax scheme which exempted cars purchased in Vermont where a sales tax had been paid. The scheme also provided a credit against the registration tax for the value of a sales tax paid on a vehicle purchased in another state by persons residing in Vermont at the time of purchase where the foreign state reciprocated in like fashion for Vermont residents. The statute was challenged by persons who bought and registered cars outside of Vermont prior to becoming Vermont residents. In discussing the applicable standard of review, the Court stated that \u201c[a]n exemption such as that challenged here \u2018will be sustained if the legislature could have reasonably concluded that the challenged classification would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>promote a legitimate state purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22-3, 105 S.Ct. at 2471, 86 L.Ed.2d at 19 (citation omitted).

Each is a Vermont resident, using a car in Vermont, with an equal obligation to pay for the maintenance and improvement of Vermont\u2019s roads.

The foreign insurers challenged the statute on equal protection grounds. The Court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">\u201cIn whatever light the State\u2019s position is cast, acceptance of its contention that promotion of domestic industry is always a legitimate state purpose under equal protection analysis would eviscerate the Equal Protection Clause in this context. A State\u2019s natural inclination frequently would be to prefer domestic business over foreign. If we accept the State\u2019s view here, then any discriminatory tax would be valid if the State could show it reasonably was intended to benefit domestic business. A discriminatory tax would stand or fall depending primarily on how a State framed its purpose\u2014as benefitting one group or as harming another. This is a distinction without a difference, and one that we rejected last Term in an analogous context arising under the Commerce Clause. <em>Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v.

Under the distribution scheme, each adult resident received one dividend unit for each year of residency subsequent to 1959 when Alaska achieved statehood. A couple who had resided in Alaska for two years challenged the statute on the grounds that the dividend distribution plan violated federal equal protection guarantees by creating \u201cpreference given to persons who were residents when Alaska became a State in 1959 over all those who have arrived since then, as well as the distinctions made between all bona fide residents who settled in Alaska at different times during the 1959 to 1980 period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59, 102 S.Ct. at 2312, 72 L.Ed.2d at 677.

In order to qualify as a resident of a mini-dormitory one must be a student enrolled full or part time in an institution of higher learning. At argument, the County Attorney conceded that the ordinance was passed to address complaints regarding noise, litter, and parking problems from residents of the College Park area, the site of the principal campus of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>University of Maryland, an internationally recognized university community that is expanding in the number of students and scope of degree offerings on an annual basis.

I disagree. The zoning ordinance at issue permits student mini-dormitories in residential zones provided the mini-dorms meet the rather strict requirements of the ordinance. If a student mini-dormitory fails to satisfy the requirements of the ordinance, it is still permissible within a residential zone provided a special exception is obtained. There is no contention that the dormitory regulation is arbitrary or irrational, only that the student/non-student classification is arbitrary and irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">It is not arbitrary or irrational for the Prince George\u2019s County Council to assume that, generally, residential college students will wish to live as close to their college campus as possible. It is not arbitrary or irrational for that legislative body to further assume college dormitories housing college students will, unless regulated, tend to be most highly concentrated in residential neighborhoods surrounding a college campus, whereas other non-student similar group residences will probably be more uniformly disbursed throughout the county. Because non-student group residences probably will not be as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>concentrated in any single geographic area as will student group residences near a college campus, there is a basis for zoning regulations addressing these student mini-dorms. It is not irrational to regulate student mini-dorms by requiring a special exception so as to avoid too high a concentration of unregulated, possibly substandard, student mini-dormitories in residential neighborhoods adjacent to institutions of higher learning.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In <em>Creative School v. Board, </em>242 Md. 552, 572, 219 A.2d 789, 801 (1966), this Court held that a Montgomery County Zoning Ordinance which required a special exception for a private school, with no similar requirement for a public school, did not violate constitutional equal protection guarantees. We stated that \u201cif any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain the classification, the existence of that state of facts at the time of the enactment of the statute must be assumed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572, 219 A.2d at 800 (citing <em>Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., </em>220 U.S. 61, 78-79, 31 S.Ct. 337, 340, 55 L.Ed. 369, 377 (1911)). Several states of facts reasonably can be conceived that would justify the student/non-student classification. We can conceive that some students of the University of Maryland and Bowie State University might not like to five in the campus dormitories and would prefer to live off campus but close to their universities. We can con-, ceive that as full or part-time students, they may only have limited funds and are therefore more willing to tolerate crowded, inferior living quarters. Real estate speculators, seizing upon this market, may buy small, inexpensive single-family residences close to these institutions of higher learning and rent formerly single-family homes to several students per house. Many of these students have cars which they might park on the street. As only nine-month tenants, the students may not be concerned about maintaining the property. Intolerant neighbors inconvenienced by the shortage of parking spaces and concerned about declining aesthetics of their neighborhoods may put their homes up for sale. Prospective buyers may not be eager to move into a neighborhood with neglected, crowded student group residences, so the specula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>tors may be able to purchase more houses at deflated prices. The speculators, without doing anything more than is minimally necessary to rent the properties, can create more mini-dorms in close proximity to these two Universities. Soon there may be a real danger that many quiet college residential neighborhoods will be saturated with student mini-dorms. These assumed justifications are not irrational or arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">It is also easy to conceive that there is no such problem with non-students or people with other occupations. These non-students are more likely to be employed full-time than are students, and with more money to spend on housing, they presumably may be less willing to tolerate crowded, inferior living conditions. Also, since they will live in the same residence all year long, rather than only for nine months of the year, the premises are less likely to be neglected. Non-student group residences are more likely to be disbursed throughout the county and not clustered around the two Universities.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">These hypotheses are conceivable and should not be dismissed as irrational. This Court may believe that the hypothetical justifications for the zoning ordinance are not probable or not likely to occur, but that is not the issue. The issue is whether these hypothetical justifications for the legislation are irrational\u2014they are not. There has been no showing that the County Council was wrong in believing there was a particular problem with student mini-dorms or assuming that, because of their concentration around college campuses, student group residences could be a significant problem unless regulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Petitioners also contend that this zoning regulation is a denial of equal protection because it is underinclusive and, if the county is going to regulate group residences, it should uniformly regulate all group residences. I disagree. Even if the County Council chose to regulate one major aspect of the group residence problem (student group residences), rather than all aspects of the problem (all group residences), that should not invalidate the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>In <em>Williamson v.

Evils in the same field may be of different dimensions and proportions, requiring different remedies. Or so the legislature may think. Or the reform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind. The legislature may select one phase of one field and apply a remedy there, neglecting the others. The prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination.

The fact that the County Council initially dealt with only one aspect of a problem does not render the legislation invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">This Court might not agree with the legislative perception of the mini-dorm problem adjacent to a residential college campus or with the legislative solution, but we should not substitute our judgment for that of a legislative body. Nor should we declare any statute invalid unless the strong presumption of validity is overcome and unless it is clearly demonstrated that the legislative body acted irrationally and arbitrarily. The strong presumption of validity of the zoning ordinance at issue has not been overcome. This zoning regulation of student mini-dorms, that if unregulated, might become a problem in residential neighborhoods surrounding a college campus, has not been proven to be clearly arbitrary and irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The majority opinion calls to mind Justice Hugo Black\u2019s statements in <em>Ferguson v.
