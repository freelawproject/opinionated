In <em>McKenzie, </em>the Court held that whether an injury arises out of the use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle under MCL 500.3105(1); MSA 24.13105(1) turns on whether the injury is closely related to the transportational function of motor vehicles. Because the plaintiff in <em>McKenzie </em>was using a camper/trailer attached to his pickup truck as a sleeping accommodation at the time of his injury, the Court concluded that the use was too far removed from the transportational function to constitute use of the camper/trailer as a motor vehicle at the time of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The facts of the present case axe succinctly set forth in <em>Morosini v Citizens Ins Co of America, </em>224 Mich App 70; 568 NW2d 346 (1997). Plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was struck from the rear by another motorist. The plaintiff got out of his vehicle and was in the process of examining the damage to his vehicle when he was assaulted by the driver of the other vehicle. We held that while assaults are not ordinarily part of the \u201cnormal risk\u201d of driving, injuries arising from assaults are compensable under the no-fault act only when the assault arises out of a \u201cnormal activity associated with the use of a vehicle as a motor vehicle.\u201d Thus, we concluded that there was a sufficient causal nexus between the injuries sustained by plaintiff in the assault and the use of the motor vehicle as a motor vehicle because plaintiff\u2019s injuries were sustained in the course of fulfilling his statutory obligations as an operator of a motor vehicle involved in an accident to inspect for damage and exchange information with any other driver involved in the accident. MCL 257.618, 257.619; MSA 9.2318, 9.2319. This holding is consistent with the approach that focuses on transportational function because the fulfillment of statutory obligations with regard to motor vehicle accidents is closely related to the transportational function of motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
