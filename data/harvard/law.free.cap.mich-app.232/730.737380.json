Defendants are the department, its director, and several wardens, deputy wardens, and corrections officers employed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>MDOC. Defendants appeal by leave granted from a circuit court order denying their motion for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(4), (7), and (8). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The case arises out of allegations that male corrections personnel have systematically engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment of female inmates incarcerated by the mdoc. Specifically, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that the mdoc assigns male officers to the housing units at all women\u2019s facilities without providing any training related to cross-gender supervision; that women are forced to dress, undress, and perform basic hygiene and body functions in the open with male officers observing; that defendants allow male officers to observe during gynecological and other intimate medical care; that defendants require male officers to perform body searches of women prisoners that include pat-downs of their breasts and genital areas; that women prisoners are routinely subjected to offensive sex-based sexual harassment, offensive touching, and requests for sexual acts by male officers; and that there is a pattern of male officers requesting sexual acts from women prisoners as a condition of retaining good-time credits, work details, and educational and rehabilitative program opportunities. The complaint also alleged that the inmates were subject to retaliation for reporting this gender-based misconduct. Plaintiffs claimed that these actions, and defendants\u2019 failure to protect female inmates from this misconduct through adequate training, supervision, investigation, or discipline of mdoc employees, constitute gender-based discriminatory conduct, sexual harassment, and retaliation in violation of the Civil Rights Act. They sought injunctive and declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>tory relief, their initial claim for monetary damages having been ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The purpose of the Civil Rights Act is to prevent discrimination directed against a person because of that person\u2019s membership in a certain class and to eliminate the effects of offensive or demeaning stereotypes, prejudices, and biases. <em>Noecker v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>203 Mich App 43, 46; 512 NW2d 44 (1993). The act is remedial and must be liberally construed to effectuate its ends. <em>Reed v Michigan Metro Girl Scout Council, </em>201 Mich App 10, 15; 506 NW2d 231 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Article 3 of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in public accommodations and public services. Subsection 302(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-8\">Except where permitted by law, a person shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-9\">(a) Deny an individual the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a place of public accommodation or public service because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, or marital status. [MCL 37.2302(a); MSA 3.548(302)(a)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">Section 103 of the act, MCL 37.2103; MSA 3.548(103), declares that sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">Section 301 defines \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d and \u201cpublic service\u201d as those terms are used in subsection 302(a). It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-12\">(a) \u201cPlace of public accommodation\u201d means a business, or an educational, refreshment, entertainment, recreation, health, or transportation facility, or institution of any kind, whether licensed or not, whose goods, services, facilities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>privileges, advantages, or accommodations are extended, offered, sold, or otherwise made available to the public. .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-5\">(b) \u201cPublic service\u201d means a public facility, department, agency, board, or commission, owned, operated, or managed by or on behalf of the state, a political division, or an agency thereof, or a tax exempt private agency established to provide service to the public. [MCL 37.2301; MSA 3.548(301)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Finally, \u00a7 303 of the act creates an exemption under article 3 for private clubs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-7\">This article shall not apply to a private club, or other establishment not in fact open to the public, except to the extent that the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of the private club or establishment are made available to the customers or patrons of another establishment that is a place of public accommodation or is licensed by the state. . . . [MCL 37.2303; MSA 3.548(303)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">In denying defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 Civil Rights Act claim, the trial court ruled that the mdoc is a \u201cpublic service\u201d agency prohibited from engaging in gender-based discrimination or harassment under subsection 302(a) of the act. The court further noted that the act does not specifically exclude prisoners from its coverage and declined to read such an exclusion into the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">The narrow issue before us is whether the mdoc correctional facilities are places of \u201cpublic service\u201d in which discrimination against inmates, based on sex, is prohibited. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Pennsylvania Dep\u2019t of Corrections v Yeskey, </em>524 US_; 118 S Ct 1952; 141 L Ed 2d 215 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>(1998), leads us to conclude that the mdoc facilities are places of \u201cpublic service\u201d within the meaning of subsection 301(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The question in <em>Yeskey </em>was whether a state prisoner could maintain a claim against a state department of corrections under another civil rights statute, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ada), title II of which prohibits discrimination by a \u201cpublic entity\u201d against individuals with a disability. 42 USC 12132. The statutory definition of \u201cpublic entity\u201d at issue in <em>Yeskey </em>is similar to the definition of \u201cpublic service\u201d set forth in subsection 301(b): \u201cany department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government.\u201d 42 USC 12131(1)(B). Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Justice Scalia held that \u201cthe statute\u2019s language unmistakably includes State prisons and prisoners within its coverage.\u201d 118 S Ct 1954. Emphasizing the broad statutory language, the Court stated that \u201cthe ADA plainly covers state institutions without any exception that could cast the coverage of prisons into doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court therefore concluded that \u201c[s]tate prisons fall squarely within the statutory definition of \u2018public entity\u2019. ...\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Yeskey </em>applies equally to this case. Under subsection 301(b), a \u201cpublic service\u201d includes \u201ca public facility, department, agency, board, or commission, owned, operated, or managed by or on behalf of the state . . . .\u201d The MDOC is a state agency, and this state\u2019s correctional facilities are operated by it. Any \u201cexception that could cast the coverage of prisons into doubt,\u201d 118 S Ct 1954, is conspicuously absent from the unambiguous statutory language of the Civil Rights Act. Thus, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>plain language of subsection 301(b), the MDOC clearly falls within the broad statutory definition of a \u201cpublic service.\u201d Defendants essentially concede as much.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-3\">Defendants argue that even if the MDOC is a \u201cpublic service,\u201d its prisons are nevertheless not required to comply with subsection 302(a) of the Civil Rights Act because they fall within the \u00a7 303 exemption for \u201cprivate club[s], or other establishments] not in fact open to the public.\u201d We reject this argument. The fact that the MDOC operates buildings that are not fully open to the public does not mean that the MDOC itself is a \u201cprivate club or other establishment\u201d not open to the public. There is a distinction between a state agency and the buildings that house that state agency. There are presumably many departments of state government (this Court included) that operate facilities that members of the public may not enter at their will. This, however, does not mean that those departments themselves are private establishments not open to the public; it merely means that the <em>physical structures </em>used by those departments are not fully accessible to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Moreover, \u201c[rjesident inmates are obviously members of the public in a general sense.\u201d <em>Martin v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>424 Mich 553, 565; 384 NW2d 392 (1986) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting). Our Supreme Court has held that prisoners are members of the public for purposes of the governmental tort liability act, MCL 691.1401 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.996(101) <em>et seq. Green v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>386 Mich 459, 464; 192 NW2d 491 (1971). The Supreme Court has also held that prisoners are members of the public for purposes of the Administrative Procedures Act, MCL 24.201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.560(101) <em>et seq. Martin, supra, </em>p 555. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Civil rights acts are to be liberally construed to provide the broadest possible remedy. <em>Reed, supra. </em>Only by reading \u201cprivate club, or other establishment not in fact open to the public\u201d in its most restrictive, literal sense, may a correctional facility be deemed to be \u201cnot open to the public.\u201d We therefore conclude that the \u00a7 303 exemption does not relieve defendants of the obligation to act in conformity with subsection 302(a) of the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Defendants contend that even if the \u00a7 303 exemption does not apply to state-run correctional facilities, subsection 302(a) of the Civil Rights Act was not intended to protect prisoners. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">We begin by reviewing the legislative purpose of the Civil Rights Act in general and subsection 302(a) in particular. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-7\">No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of his civil or political rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of religion, race, color or national origin. The legislature shall implement this section by appropriate legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">The Civil Rights Act was enacted as 1976 PA 453. Its purpose was two-fold. First, it was intended to centralize and make uniform the patchwork of then-existing civil rights statutes applying to the private sector, such as the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Employment Practices Act, and the Public Accommodations Act. See <em>Dep\u2019t of Civil Rights ex rel Forton v Waterford Twp Dep\u2019t of Parks &amp; Recreation, </em>425 Mich 173, 187-188; 387 NW2d 821 (1986). Second, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>intended to broaden the scope of the then-existing civil rights statutes to include governmental action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">[T]he Legislature\u2019s addition of \u201cpublic service\u201d to [subsection] 302(a), thereby including state action violations that amount to constitutional deprivation with private sector, non-state action legislative violations, can be explained by the fact that article 1, \u00a7 2 of the Michigan Constitution provides: \u201cthe legislature <em>shall </em>implement this section by appropriate legislation.\u201d It is the only provision of the Declaration of Rights to provide so. <em>[Id., </em>p 188 (emphasis in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Thus, insofar as subsection 302(a) of the Civil Rights Act governs \u201cpublic service,\u201d it is essentially a codification of the constitution\u2019s Equal Protection and Antidiscrimination Clauses, broadened to include categories not covered under the constitution, such as age, sex, and marital status. See <em>Dep\u2019t of Civil Rights, </em>pp 188-189.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The constitutional equal protection guarantee applies to prisoners. As explained in <em>Jackson v Bishop, </em>404 F2d 571, 576 (CA 8, 1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\">Lawful incarceration may properly operate to deprive the convict of certain rights which would otherwise be his to enjoy. A classic example is [the] denial to the felon of the right to vote. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-9\">On the other hand, a prisoner of the state does not lose all his civil rights during and because of his incarceration. In particular, he continues to be protected by the due process and equal protection clauses which follow him through the prison doors. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">Because, as our Supreme Court has stated, the protections of subsection 302(a) of the Civil Rights Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>were intended to be coextensive with the Equal Protection and Antidiscrimination Clauses of the Michigan Constitution, and because prisoners do not lose their right to equal protection by virtue of their status as inmates, we can only conclude that the Legislature also intended all persons \u2014 including inmates \u2014 to be protected under subsection 302(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Further, as noted by the trial court, nowhere does the language of the Civil Rights Act purport to preclude its application because of a person\u2019s status as a prisoner or inmate. Compare <em>Walters v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>148 Mich App 809, 819; 385 NW2d 695 (1986); <em>Marsh v Dep\u2019t of Civil Service, </em>142 Mich App 557, 569; 370 NW2d 613 (1985). When the Legislature has seen fit to exclude prisoners from the provisions of a statute, it has specifically done so. See, e.g., MCL 15.231(2); MSA 4.1801(1)(2), excluding \u201cthose persons incarcerated in state or local correctional facilities\u201d from provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. A court must not judicially legislate by adding into a statute provisions that the Legislature did not include. <em>Empire Iron Mining Partnership v Orhanen, </em>455 Mich 410, 421; 565 NW2d 844 (1997). Accordingly, we decline to read into the Civil Rights Act an exclusion barring prisoners from bringing an action under subsection 302(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Defendants suggest that any holding that the Civil Rights Act applies to prisoners will unacceptably impair the MDOC\u2019s corrections responsibilities. Their fear is unwarranted. At least to the extent that a state agency\u2019s conduct is at issue, the protections of subsection 302(a) of the Civil Rights Act were intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>to be coextensive with those of the Antidiscrimination and Equal Protection Clauses of the constitution. <em>Dep\u2019t of Civil Rights, supra, </em>p 188. As our Supreme Court stated in <em>Dep\u2019t of Civil Rights, supra, </em>p 189:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">Discrimination, in constitutional terms, refers to baseless and irrational line drawing. . . . When there is a sufficiently important governmental interest and the classification is adequately related to that interest, it does not amount to discrimination to draw legislative lines on the basis of those classifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">It would be anomalous at best and contradictory at worst to attempt to rid the state of discriminatory practices by the use of an arbitrary standard that would prohibit, in effect, any line drawn between the genders, regardless of its relevance to the purpose of the regulation, unless the Legislature, in its wisdom and its own good time, countervails it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Thus, even though we hold that subsection 302(a) prohibits the MDOC from engaging in discriminatory practices in the operation of its correctional facilities, the MDOC may still treat prisoners differently on the basis of gender, provided that the gender-based treatment can pass constitutional muster. As the Court acknowledged in <em>Dep\u2019t of Civil Rights, </em>merely because the state engages in a practice that treats men and women differently, it does not necessarily mean that it engages in unlawful gender discrimination. Rather, the test is whether the gender-based treatment serves a sufficiently important governmental interest and is substantially related to the achievement of that interest. <em>Dep\u2019t of Civil Rights, supra, </em>p 189. The MDOC may therefore treat prisoners differently on the basis of gender without violating subsection 302(a), as long as the gender-based treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>serves important penological interests and is substantially related to the achievement of those interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">This approach to state sex discrimination claims by inmates mirrors not only the analysis employed in equal protection cases, but also the analyses typically employed by federal courts in 42 USC 1983 actions. See anno: <em>Sex discrimination in treatment of jail or prison inmates, </em>12 ALR4th 1219. Because the MDOC admits that prisoners may bring equal protection claims under \u00a7 1983, our holding that prisoners are not excluded from the protections of subsection 302(a) of the Civil Rights Act should impose upon defendants no stricter standards than those to which they must presently adhere in order to survive either a constitutional or \u00a7 1983 challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Finally, defendants argue that the Court of Claims, not the circuit court, had subject-matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 case. While it is generally true that the Court of Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over \u201call claims and demands, liquidated and unliquidated, ex contractu and ex delicto, against the state\u201d or any of its agencies, MCL 600.6419(l)(a); MSA 27A.6419(l)(a), that exclusivity does not extend to Civil Rights Act claims. MCL 37.2801(1); MSA 3.548(801)(1); <em>Rangel v Univ of Michigan, </em>157 Mich App 563, 564-565; 403 NW2d 836 (1987). Moreover, a complaint against the state seeking only equitable or declaratory relief must be filed in the circuit court. <em>Watson v Bureau of State Lottery, </em>224 Mich App 639, 643; 569 NW2d 878 (1997), <em>Silverman v Univ of Michigan Bd of Regents, </em>445 Mich 209, 217; 516 NW2d 54 (1994). Because plaintiffs no longer are seeking money damages, the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>court, rather than the Court of Claims, had jurisdiction to consider the Civil Rights Act claims, as well as the remaining equitable and declaratory claims against the mdoc and defendant McGinnis in his official capacity as the director of the MDOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The circuit court also had jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 Civil Rights Act claims against the remaining individual defendants. MCL 600.6419(l)(a); MSA 27A.6419(l)(a). Moreover, the defendant guards and wardens are not state officers who may be sued in the Court of Claims. <em>Lowery v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>146 Mich App 342, 349; 380 NW2d 99 (1985); <em>Burnett v Moore, </em>111 Mich App 646, 648-649; 314 NW2d 458 (1981); <em>Bandfield v Wood, </em>104 Mich App 279, 282; 304 NW2d 551 (1981). Accordingly, we find no error in the circuit court\u2019s ruling that it had jurisdiction to hearing plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b795-7\">Gage, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b795-8\">O\u2019Connell, RJ.</author>\n<p id=\"AEky\">(dissenting.) My views with respect to the legal issues here presented have already been published at length in what was then a majority opinion, <em>Neal v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>230 Mich App 202; 583 NW2d 249 (1998), and I readopt that opinion without repeating it. All that needs now to be added is comment concerning the application to this case of the decision in <em>Pennsylvania Dep\u2019t of Corrections v Yeskey, </em>524 US __; 118 S Ct 1952; 141 L Ed 2d 215 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">In <em>Yeskey, </em>the United States Supreme Court was faced with determining, under the federal jurisprudential standards for statutory construction of legislation affecting states\u2019 rights, whether title II of the Ameri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>cans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 USC 12131 <em>et seq., </em>applies to state correctional facilities. The language used by Congress embraced within the ambit of the ADA \u201cthe services, programs, or activities of a public entity,\u201d 42 USC 12132, with \u201cpublic entity\u201d being defined as including \u201cany department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government,\u201d 42 USC 12131(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The facts in <em>Yeskey </em>involved a Pennsylvania program, the motivational boot camp, that offered the plaintiff inmate the opportunity, if successfully undertaken, of reducing his minimum incarceration before parole from eighteen months to six months. 118 S Ct 1953. Because Yeskey was hypertensive, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections concluded that his participation in the boot camp program was medically contraindicated, and it refused to admit him to the program. Yeskey then claimed that this was discrimination proscribed by the ADA. The Supreme Court held that the statutory definition of a \u201cqualified individual with a disability,\u201d 42 USC 12131(2), does not exclude prisoners, rejecting the contention that the terms \u201celigibility\u201d and \u201cparticipation\u201d necessarily imply a prerequisite voluntariness that is inherently lacking in the case of persons confined against their will.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">In contrast to the ADA, the Civil Rights Act (CRA), MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.548(101) <em>et seq., </em>defines \u201cpublic service\u201d so as to include only entities that \u201cprovide service to the public.\u201d MCL 37.2301(b); MSA</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>3.548(301)(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> State prisoners, by definition, are not part of the general public to whom any otherwise public service proffered by the Michigan Department of Corrections can be provided. This limitation of the definition of \u201cpublic service\u201d is conspicuously absent from the definition of \u201cpublic entity\u201d found in the ADA, which has no corresponding language of limitation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The mdoc is subject to the cra, as we held in the original majority opinion, to the extent that it opens the doors of any place of confinement under its jurisdiction to visitors, employees, officials, or other persons voluntarily seeking admittance. 230 Mich App 209. Indeed, with respect to employees of the Department of Corrections, the CRA applies by virtue of article 2, which extends the cra\u2019s prohibition of the statutorily enumerated forms of discrimination to the employment relationship, <em>McCallum v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>197 Mich App 589; 496 NW2d 361 (1992), rather than article 3, which covers places of public accommoda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>tion and public services. The majority\u2019s current expansion of the CRA\u2019s reach conflates all these crucial distinctions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I am unable to subscribe to the notion that the decision in <em>Yeskey, </em>which involved a different statute, significantly different statutory language, different facts, and different jurisprudential principles of statutory construction, somehow controls the present case or even usefully informs our analysis and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">It bears reiteration that, if article 3 of the CRA applies generally to prisons and prisoners, the MDOC may find that it cannot legally maintain separate facil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>ities for men and women<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that it may no longer segregate young from old, even though the inevitable result of this judicial stampede toward political correctness will be a penological conflict. The female prisoners will, in general, be terrorized by the male prisoners, who are normally physically larger, stronger, and more aggressive, and likewise the juvenile and geriatric prisoners will be subjected to the predations of the more vigorous adult population. Perhaps these prospects ought to caution plaintiffs to bear in mind the adage to be careful what they wish for, because it may come to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Nothing in the prior majority opinion suggests that any correctional program that may further a prisoner\u2019s rehabilitation, or enhance the prospect of pardon, commutation, or parole, may be made available on a basis that discriminates because of gender, race, religion, national origin, or on any other invidious basis. Although that issue is not properly before us, and whatever we say with respect to that issue is obiter dictum, any such programmatic discrimination would appear to fall well within prohibitory penumbra of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>race, religion, gender, or national origin, 42 USC 2000a(d), 2000d-4a(l)(A), <em>United States v Wyandotte Co, </em>343 F Supp 1189 (D Kan, 1972), rev\u2019d on other grounds 480 F2d 969 (CA 10, 1973), and of the ADA relative to disabilities, <em>Yeskey, swpra </em>(assuming that either federal enactment may constitutionally be applied to the states at all, an issue reserved for later decision in <em>Yeskey, </em>118 S Ct 1956). However, MDOC programs do not admit of participation by non-prisoners, that is, by any members of the public (in the sense of making the program available <em>to </em>the public, although members of the public may well participate <em>in </em>a correctional program as leaders, instructors, facilitators, and so forth.). To the extent that outside agencies offer public programs that the MDOC permits prisoners to have access to, those outside agencies, of course, remain precluded by the CRA from discriminating against prisoners by virtue of gender, race, and so forth (but are not limited in discriminating against prisoners as a class per se, as the status of being a prisoner is not covered by the CRA, or by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, <em>Rosado Maysonet v Solis, </em>409 F Supp 576 [D PR, 1975]).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The present plaintiffs do not allege gender discrimination in prison employment, educational opportunities, or housing, so we need not determine whether other articles of the CRA protect prisoners from discrimination in such contexts. All we face today is a claim of gender discrimination concerning public services under Article 3.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Inasmuch as prisons are not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>with respect to prisoners, \u201cpublic services\u201d as defined by the CRA, I would adhere to our initial decision holding that plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the CRA should be dismissed pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(8) for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-5\"> One of the goals of the cra is to prevent discrimination in public accommodations and public services. MCL 37.2102(1); MSA 3.548(102)(1). In my opinion, references to \u201cpublic accommodation\u201d and \u201cpublic service\" within the CRA are not intended to include establishments that are not open to the general public or that do not provide a service to the public at large. I note that even for purposes of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d were originally understood to include only such public gathering places as restaurants and theaters. See Olson, <em>The Excuse Factory: How Employment Law is Paralyzing the American Workplace </em>(New York: The Free Press, 1997), p 50. It should be clear that our Legislature similarly envisioned only entities serving the general public when bringing the cra to bear on public accommodations and public services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-6\"> Section 303 of the cra provides that \u201c[t]his article shall not apply to . . . establishments] not in fact open to the public . . . .\u201d Not only are prisons not open to the general public, but their very mission \u2014 forcibly keeping felons away from the public \u2014 renders them the very antithesis of those public accommodations that offer services to the public. 230 Mich App 214. Even if I were to agree with the majority\u2019s liberal definition of the term \u201cpublic service,\u201d I would nonetheless conclude that \u00a7 303 created an exemption for prisons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\"> Plaintiffs advocate a liberal interpretation of the terms \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d and \u201cpubhc service.\u201d For the reasons stated in my prior opinion, I beheve that a liberal reading of these terms, or any specific term, is inappropriate and dangerous. Defining specific terms in a liberal fashion leads to a slippery slope of absurd results. This Court should not be in the business of adding a liberal meaning to a specific and well-recognized term. An example regarding the term \u201cplace of pubhc accommodation\u201d may clarify my concern:</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">In their brief, plaintiffs allege that prisons are also places of pubhc accommodation as defined by cra, \u201cbecause prisons house members of the general pubhc at taxpayers expense.\u201d A liberal interpretation of the term \u201cplace of pubhc accommodation\u201d would on the surface seem to support their position. However, once this Court adopts plaintiffs\u2019 definition, it will not be long before another plaintiff argues that some private residences are also \u201cplaces of pubhc accommodation.\u201d I anticipate the argument would be that because we allow members of the pubhc (our friends, neighbors, and relatives) to spend nights at our homes, and in some cases the government either pays or subsidizes the rent, our private homes are now transformed into places of pubhc accommodation, because they house \u201cmembers of the pubhc at taxpayers\u2019 expense.\u201d This slippery slope logic is untenable and, as I have previously stated, inappropriate and dangerous. 230 Mich App 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Appropriately, the majority has not adopted plaintiffs\u2019 definition of \u201cplace of pubhc accommodation.\u201d However, the majority has adopted plaintiffs\u2019 definition of \u201cpubhc service,\u201d even though prisons in no way perform a service to the general pubhc. Prisons are not situated similarly to some of our other establishments that do perform a \u201cpubhc service,\u201d such as a court, a hospital, or an office of the Secretary of State, ah of which were estabhshed to provide, and do provide, services to the general pubhc. <em>Id. </em>at 214.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b799-6\"> The majority states that \u201cthe mdoc may still treat prisoners differently on the basis of gender, provided that the gender-based treatment can pass constitutional muster.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 741.1 suspect that drawing of the line that delineates what \u201cpassjes] constitutional muster\u201d will be no simple task for trial courts; however I suspect that an explosion of prisoner litigation will give the trial courts an ample array of cases to assist them in drawing this line. But I further suspect that the \u201cline\u201d will be anything but clear cut, tending to move in the varied directions of the sensitivities of judges and the objectives of such high-stakes litigation. For these reasons, I choose to draw the line on the basis of the commonly understood meaning of \u201cpublic service,\u201d which I would define to include only entities that are open to the general public or that provide a service to the public at large. This commonsense definition does not embrace the relationship between state prisons and their inmates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b800-6\"> The m^jor flaw in the majority opinion is the treatment of a statutory right as coextensive with a constitutional right. A state statute is by design an entity distinct from a constitutional provision. The majority fails to provide support for its inaccurate conclusion. In fact, there exists a sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>nificant difference between a cause of action alleging a violation of the Equal Protection Clause and a cause of action alleging sex discrimination under the cha. A party proceeding under constitutional equal protection doctrine must prove intentional or purposeful discrimination. <em>Harville v State Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc, </em>218 Mich App 302, 306; 553 NW2d 377 (1996). In contrast, a party proceeding under the cea need show only disparate treatment, the prima facie case requiring legally admissible and sufficient evidence that \u201cshe was a member of a class deserving of protection under the statute, and that, for the same conduct, she was treated differently [from] a man.\u201d <em>Schellenberg v Rochester, Michigan, Lodge No 2225 of Order of Elks, </em>228 Mich App 20, 33; 577 NW2d 163 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The majority\u2019s failure to recognize the distinctions between these two bases for litigation is the vehicle through which the majority reaches a result not intended by the drafters of the CRA. The majority posits that \u201cbecause prisoners do not lose their right to equal protection by virtue of their status as inmates, we can only conclude that the Legislature also intended all persons \u2014 including inmates \u2014 to be protected under subsection 302(a).\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 739-740. I agree that inmates do not lose <em>all </em>of their constitutional rights by virtue of their status as inmates. However, this conclusion by no logical path leads to the corollary that a state statute is intended to apply to prisoners. This holds especially in light of \u00a7 303\u2019s exclusion of \u201cestablishments not in fact open to the public,\u201d plus the majority\u2019s observation that the cra\u2019s protection against sex discrimination exceeds the expressed scope of our state constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
