The trial court concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the contractual limitation period and dismissed plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tiffs\u2019 action. The plaintiffs appealed. Relying on Michigan precedent, <em>Bennett v Shearson Lehman-American Express, Inc, </em>168 Mich App 80, 83; 423 NW2d 911 (1987), we affirmed the determination that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are arbitrable and reversed and remanded for arbitration, holding that procedural issues, such as the timeliness of an otherwise arbitrable claim, must be determined by the arbitrator, not the court. <em>Amtower v William C Roney &amp; Co, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 11, 1997 (Docket No. 165777).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">This case has now returned to us<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on remand from the Supreme Court for the limited purpose of considering \u201cwhether the Federal Arbitration Act [FAA], 9 USC 1 <em>et seq., </em>requires that a court instead of arbitrators decide the issue of the timeliness of plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d 457 Mich 864 (1998). We hold that it does not, and we again conclude that the timeliness of plaintiffs\u2019 claims is a question to be decided by the arbitrator rather than the trial court. Accordingly, we reverse and remand this matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">I. UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">For completeness, we repeat the facts of this case as set forth in our prior unpublished opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">Following the advice of defendant, an investment adviser, plaintiffs invested in a limited partnership known as the Certified Historic Income Properties VH Limited Partnership (chips vii). Twelve of the plaintiffs, Franklin Amtower, Richard Bumb, Richard Cummings, Thomas DeAgostino, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>David Farber, Jeffrey Farber, Carl Freeman, Patricia Hutchinson, Gary Lambert, Paul Tatseos, Barry Miller and John Christ, executed customer agreements with defendant. These agreements provided that any claims against defendant arising out of the chips vn transaction would be submitted to binding arbitration within one year of the accrual of the cause of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">Plaintiffs brought this action pursuant to the Michigan Consumer Protection Act, MCL 445.901 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 19.418(1) <em>et seq. </em>Plaintiffs alleged that defendant misrepresented pertinent facts regarding the integrity of the CHIPS VII investment.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>J Defendant moved for summary disposition against Amtower, Bumb, Cummings, DeAgostino, David and Jeffrey Farber, Freeman, Hutchinson, Lambert, Tatseos, Miller and Christ, arguing for outright dismissal or, alternatively, for an order to compel arbitration. Defendant argued that the arbitration agreement precluded these plaintiffs from obtaining relief from the courts. Defendant also argued that the action had been brought more than one year from the time the cause of action accrued. Defendant argued that the cause of action accrued in October, 1990, when plaintiffs were notified that the chips vn investments were failing. Plaintiffs argued in response that the arbitration agreement was invalid because they had not made a knowledgeable waiver of rights. Plaintiffs also argued that the cause of action did not accrue until May 8, 1991, when they learned that the chips vii general partner had misappropriated funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">The trial court concluded that the arbitration agreement was valid and that the cause of action accrued in October, 1990. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s summary disposition motion. The trial court later denied plaintiffis\u2019] motion for relief from order and for reconsideration pursuant to MCR 2.612.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>On appeal, plaintiffs abandoned any claim that the arbitration agreements were invalid and argued only that the trial court erred in determining that their cause of action accrued in October 1990. Defendant argued that the court correctly made this determination. Although not an issue raised by the parties, we held in our prior opinion that the arbitrator, not the trial court, should decide whether plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the contractual one-year limitation period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">Although the existence of a contract to arbitrate and its enforceability is a judicial question that cannot be decided by an arbitrator, <em>City of Huntington Woods v Ajax Paving [Industries, Inc (After Remand)], </em>196 Mich App 71, 74; 492 NW2d 463 (1992), procedural matters arising out of an arbitrable dispute are for the arbitrator, and not the court, to determine. <em>Bennett v Shearson Lehman-American Express, Inc, </em>168 Mich App 80, 83; 423 NW2d 911 (1987). As such, the timeliness of bringing of an arbitration proceeding is a procedural issue to be determined by the arbitrator rather than the courts. <em>Id.; </em>see also <em>Nielsen v Barnett, </em>440 Mich 1, 10; 485 NW2d 666 (1992). Therefore, the trial court erred in making a determination regarding when plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action accrued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">On the basis of defendant\u2019s argument in seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, that the FAA preempted state law and that federal law required the court rather than an arbitrator to determine the question of timeliness, the Supreme Court, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, remanded the matter for further consideration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>H. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Now that it has made its legal position more clear, we agree with defendant that the faa applies to this dispute, which dispute unquestionably arises out of contracts involving interstate commerce. <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos, Inc v Dobson, </em>513 US 265; 115 S Ct 834; 130 L Ed 2d 753 (1995). State courts are bound, under the Supremacy Clause, US Const, art VI, cl 2, to enforce the faa\u2019s substantive provisions. <em>Ultra-cashmere House, Ltd v Meyer, </em>664 F2d 1176, 1180 (CA 11, 1981). However, as more fully explained below, because the parties broadly agreed to arbitrate the merits of any controversy arising between them, we conclude that federal law requires that an</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">A GENERAL FEDERAL RULE \u2014 'TIMELINESS ISSUES AS QUESTIONS OF \u201cPROCEDURAL ARBITRABILITY\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">In <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc v Livingston, </em>376 US 543, 557-558; 84 S Ct 909; 11 L Ed 2d 898 (1964), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]nce it is determined . . . that the parties are obligated to submit the subject matter of a dispute to arbitration, \u2018procedural\u2019 questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition should be left to the arbitrator.\u201d Since that decision, an overwhelming majority of fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>eral appellate circuits (including the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals) considering the issue have determined that timeliness of a claim is a procedural matter and, therefore, within the arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Michigan, which has developed its own strong policy favoring arbitration on the basis of federal precedent,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is in accord. Michigan law also provides that arbitrators, rather than courts, should decide the application of such potential defenses to arbitration as contractual limitation periods, statutes of limitation, and the doctrine of laches. See, e.g., <em>Brown v Holton Public Schools, </em>397 Mich 71, 73-74; 243 NW2d 255 (1976); <em>Iron Co v Sundberg, Carolson &amp; Associates, Inc, </em>222 Mich App 120, 126; 564 NW2d 78 (1997); <em>Bennett, supra </em>at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">B. PARTIES\u2019 INTENT TO RESERVE TIMELINESS ISSUES FOR THE</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Notwithstanding the general federal rule, it is equally clear that the parties to an arbitration agreement can provide that certain issues be determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>by the court if they so specify in their contract. \u201c \u2018[Arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he had not agreed so to submit.\u2019 \u201d <em>AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc v Communications Workers of America, </em>475 US 643, 648; 106 S Ct 1415; 89 L Ed 2d 648 (1986) (citations omitted). Thus, \u201cthe basic objective in this area is ... to ensure that commercial arbitration agreements, like other contracts, \u2018are enforced according to their terms,\u2019 and according to the intentions of the parties.\u201d <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc v Kaplan, </em>514 US 938, 947; 115 S Ct 1920; 131 L Ed 2d 985 (1995) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Consequently, the determination whether the issue of timeliness must be decided by the arbitrator or a court inexorably becomes a question of contract interpretation. When deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter, courts should ordinarily apply basic state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 944. \u201c \u2018The cardinal rule in the interpretation of contracts is <em>to ascertain the intention of the parties\u2019 \u201d Goodwin, Inc v Orson E Coe Pontiac, Inc, </em>392 Mich 195, 209; 220 NW2d 664 (1974), quoting <em>McIntosh v Groomes, </em>227 Mich 215, 218; 198 NW 954 (1924) (emphasis in Goodwin). \u201cWhere the language of a contract is clear and unambiguous, the intent of the parties will be ascertained according to its plain sense and meaning.\u201d <em>Haywood v Fowler, </em>190 Mich App 253, 258; 475 NW2d 458 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">However, consistent with the strong federal policy promoting arbitration, any ambiguity concerning whether a specific issue falls within the scope of arbitration, such as whether a claim is timely, must be resolved in favor of submitting the question to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>arbitrator for resolution. See <em>AT &amp; T Technologies, supra </em>at 650. In other words, there is a presumption of arbitrability \u201c \u2018unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an inteipretation that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.\u201d\u2019 <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United Steelworkers of America v Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co, </em>363 US 574, 582-583; 80 S Ct 1347; 4 L Ed 2d 1409 (I960).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>First Options, supra </em>at 945, the Court explained that when the parties have a contract that provides for arbitration of some issues, \u201cthe parties likely gave at least some thought to the scope of arbitration.\u201d Therefore, the law \u201cinsist[s] upon clarity before concluding that the parties did not want to arbitrate a related matter.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the arbitration provisions at issue in this case. Most of the customer agreements contain the following language related to arbitration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">Any and all controversies which may arise between us . . . concerning, arising out of, or relating to, your business, my accounts), transactions with you for me, any other transactions, this agreement or the construction, performance or breach of this or any other agreement between us . . . shall be submitted to, and settled and determined by, binding arbitration.... Arbitration must be commenced within one year after the cause of such action accrued by service upon the other of a written demand for arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>or a written notice of intention to arbitrate, naming therein the arbitration tribunal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Some of the agreements used slightly different language, but with the same import:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">It is agreed that any controversy between us arising out of. . . this agreement shall be submitted to arbitration .... Arbitration must be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrued by service upon the other of a written demand for arbitration or a written notice of intention to arbitrate, naming therein the arbitration tribunal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Particularly when considered in light of the federal presumption in favor of arbitrability, we believe that these broadly worded arbitration clauses, covering as they do <em>any </em>controversy arising between the parties, indicate that the arbitrator must decide the timeliness issue. This conclusion makes sense when one considers that the timeliness issue itself requires a determination of often-disputed, as here, fact questions regarding when \u201cthe cause of action accrued.\u201d Federal precedent makes it clear that, ordinarily, this is a question that the arbitrator is in a better position to decide. In <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons, supra </em>at 556-557, the Court explained: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>We also believe, as a general rule, that submitting procedural matters, such as timeliness, to the arbitrator is consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that in deciding whether the parties have agreed to submit a particular grievance to arbitration, \u201ca court is not to rule on the potential merits of the underlying claims.\u201d <em>AT &amp;T Technologies, supra </em>at 649.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Questions concerning the procedural prerequisites to arbitration do not arise in a vacuum; they develop in the context of an actual dispute about the rights of the parties to the contract or those covered by it. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">Doubt whether grievance procedures or some part of them apply to a particular dispute, whether such procedures have been followed or excused, or whether the unexcused failure to follow them avoids the duty to arbitrate cannot ordinarily be answered without consideration of the merits of the dispute which is presented for arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>C. EXCEPTIONS TO THE GENERAL <em>RULE </em>\u2014 RONEY <em>&amp; CO v KASSAB </em>AND <em>SMITH BARNEY, INC v SARVER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">In opposition to the general federal rule favoring the determination of timeliness issues by an arbitrator, defendant cites two recent decisions from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, <em>Roney &amp; Co v Kassab, </em>981 F2d 894 (CA 6, 1992), and <em>Smith Barney, Inc v Sarver, </em>108 F3d 92 (CA 6, 1997), for the proposition that the court must determine whether a plaintiff\u2019s claims are barred by a contractual limitation period in the absence of clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended the question to be for the arbitrator. However, these cases are clearly distinguishable, involving contract language much different than that at issue here. <em>Roney &amp; Co, supra </em>at 898, involved Rule 603 of the New York Stock Exchange, while <em>Smith Barney, supra </em>at 94, n 2, involved the identically worded \u00a715 of the Code of Arbitration Procedure of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Both provisions state that after six years from the events giving rise to the dispute have elapsed, the dispute \u201cshall [not] be eligible for submission to arbitration . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In light of this \u201celigible for submission\u201d language, it has been recognized that Rule 603 and \u00a715 are unlike ordinary procedural limitation periods because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>indicate \u201cthat the parties intended to bar from arbitration disputes raised more than six years after the events giving rise to them.\u201d <em>PaineWebber Inc v Hartmann, </em>921 F2d 507, 513 (CA 3, 1990); see also <em>Cogswell v Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc, </em>78 F3d 474, 476 (CA 10, 1996). Furthermore, even given the unique character of the time-bar language of Rule 603 and \u00a7 15 at issue in <em>Roney &amp; Co </em>and <em>Smith Barney, </em>we note that currently there is an even split among the federal appellate circuits regarding the question whether such language abrogates the general rule that timeliness is a procedural matter that must be submitted to the arbitrator.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">We conclude that the analysis contained in <em>Roney &amp; Co </em>and <em>Smith Barney </em>is limited to the unique language of Rule 603 and \u00a7 15 and represents a specific exception to the general federal rule that timeliness issues must be submitted to an arbitrator.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>quently, the decisions in <em>Roney &amp; Co </em>and <em>Smith Barney </em>provide no guidance in our determination how the arbitration agreements in this case should be construed. We further conclude that the contractual language at issue in this case does not unmistakably remove the issue of the timeliness of a claim from the purview of the arbitrator and is thus not equivalent to the language that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals found in <em>Roney &amp; Co </em>and <em>Smith Barney </em>to preclude submission of the issue to an arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">m. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Because the parties have included a broadly worded arbitration provision encompassing the core claim, we conclude that the timeliness of plaintiffs\u2019 claims is for the arbitrator to decide as a procedural matter. Accordingly, we reverse and remand this matter to the trial court with instructions to grant defendant\u2019s alternative motion to compel arbitration. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\"> Upon remand, Judge Holbrook, Jr., was substituted for (now) Justice Clifford W. Taylor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\"> Plaintiffs also alleged claims of breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b283-7\"> Although defendant mentioned the faa and cited various federal cases in arguing before this Court that the trial court properly calculated the accrual date of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, defendant did not, until it filed briefs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the Supreme Court, assert that the matter was actually governed by the faa. We therefore addressed the arbitration question relying on Michigan precedent. See <em>Bennett, supra </em>at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">In any event, we note that <em>Bennett, </em>although a Michigan case, is entirely founded on federal law. <em>Bennett </em>can be traced directly back to our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brown v Holton Public Schools, </em>397 Mich 71, 73-74; 243 NW2d 255 (1976), which, in turn, relied on a series of federal cases. Thus, as a practical matter, whether the issue at hand (who, as between arbitrator or court, should determine a timeliness question) is addressed under Michigan or federal law, the legal rule and result is the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\"> See, e.g., <em>Glass v Kidder Peabody &amp; Co, Inc, </em>114 F3d 446, 455 (CA 4, 1997); <em>United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum, &amp; Plastic Workers of America, AFL-CIO, CLU, Local 164 v Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp, </em>104 F3d 181, 184 (CA 8, 1997); <em>Local 285, Service Employees Int\u2019l Union, AFL-CIO v Nonotuck Resource Associates, Inc, </em>64 F3d 735, 739 (CA 1, 1995); <em>Denhardt v Trailways, Inc, </em>767 F2d 687, 689-690 (CA 10, 1995); <em>Nursing Home &amp; Hosp Union No 434 AFL-CIO-LDIU v Sky Vue Terrace, Inc, </em>759 F2d 1094, 1097 (CA 3, 1985); <em>Commerce Park at DFW Freeport v Mardian Constr Co, </em>729 F2d 334, 339, n 5 (CA 5, 1984); <em>Belke v Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, </em>693 F2d 1023, 1027-1028 (CA 11, 1982); <em>O\u2019Neel v Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Securities Dealers, Inc, </em>667 F2d 804, 807 (CA 9,1982); <em>Conticommodity Services Inc v Philipp &amp; Lion, </em>613 F2d 1222, 1227 (CA 2, 1980); <em>Chambers v Beaunit Corp, </em>404 F2d 128, 131 (CA 6, 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b285-9\"> See <em>Detroit v AW Kutsche &amp; Co, </em>309 Mich 700, 703; 16 NW2d 128 (1944).
