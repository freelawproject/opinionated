Downing, deceased, against George Shoenberger and John H. Shoenberger. Ejectment for a tract of land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-11\">There was no dispute about the original title, which was in Richard Downing, in whose name it was sold in 1830 for the taxes of 1826 to 1829, by the treasurer, to Isaac Miller, who conveyed to Dr Peter Shoenberger, under whom the defendants, his sons, claim: and this sale was regularly made. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-12\">Richard Downing, by his will, dated the 25th of April 1819, devised the land to his grand-children, of whom Richard P. Downing, under whom the plaintiffs, who are his father, mother, brothers, and sisters claimed, was one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-13\">The plaintiffs, on the trial, confined their claim to the interest of Richard. P. Downing, under his grandfather\u2019s will, which was the undivided fourth part; and to maintain their right to recover this, they proved that Richard P. Downing was born on the 27th of November 1813, and that in his lifetime, on the 13th of June 1836, by his attorney in fact, John Lyon, he tendered a sufficient sum of money tosthe treasurer, and demanded a redemption of the land, which the treasurer refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The court below (Burnside, president) instructed the jury that the provision of the act of 13th March 1815, in favour of orphans, was not available to Richard P. Downing, who, although a minor, was not an orphan, and directed a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-6\"><em>M\u2019Jlllister </em>and Blanchard, for plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_4\">cited 5 <em>Watts </em>389; 2 <em>Watts </em>436; 6 <em>Bac.

Downing was a minor when the tract was sold for taxes; he died under age, and the plaintiffs, his father and mother are his heirs, and the others his brothel\u2019s and sisters. An orphan is one bereft of parents; a minor is one under twenty-one years of age. In law, and in common parlance, the words minor and orphan do not mean the same. The legislature except the lands of minors in the act of 1804: instead of minor they use the term \u201c orphan\u201d in the last act, which is an act to amend the former; and in the eleventh section of the last act we find, \u201c such parts of the act to which this is a supplement; and so much of any other act of assembly as is altered or supplied by this act, is hereby repealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">It is impossible to deny that the word orphan is not an alteration of the word minor. We have nothing to do with whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>alteration is wiser or more just than what was altered. We must, and all courts must, take it, that when an act is passed expressly to amend or change a previous law, the legislature intended to change where they used different terms, and particularly where the words embrace a different class of persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">If we can go beyond the terms of the act of 1815, why pass over the act of 1S06? why not take in all legal disabilities ? Or, as the first law allowed five years, and the latter only two, after the disability was removed, what power have we to extend the number of persons to whom it applies, more than we have to extend the time so as to make it all correspond with the act of 1804.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
