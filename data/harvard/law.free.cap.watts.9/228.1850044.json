In pursuance whereof, the said Christian Bear did, in the year 1803, at a great expense, erect a dam in the said Swatara creek, opposite to his said plantation, as designated and authorised by said act, and did further erect during the said year, connected with the said dam upon his said tract of land and plantation adjoining said creek, a large three story stone grist-mill and saw-mill also at great expense, which said grist-mill is still standing, and which has been at all times (before the injuries and obstructions thereto hereinafter stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>and complained of) well supplied, supported and driven by the waters of the said Swatara creek, and without any impediment or obstruction of the back water of the same, and the said Christian Bear being so seised and possessed of the said tract of land, dam, and mills, as aforesaid, died;, and Henry Landis and Henry Brenneman, the administrators of his estate by virtue and in pursuance of an order of the orphans\u2019 court of the said county of Dauphin, by \u25a0their deed of indenture, bearing date the 1st of June 1805, for the consideration therein mentioned, granted and conveyed the said tract of land with all and singular the privileges and appurtenances thereunto belonging unto a certain Martin Grieder in fee simple, and the said Martin Grieder and Elizabeth his wife, by deed, dated the 21st of February 1816, for the consideration therein named, granted and conveyed the same to George Bower and to his heirs and assigns forever; and the said George Bower being so seised and possessed of the said tract of land, mills and premises in the year 1S28 died intestate.-leaving issue but one child, the aforesaid Elizabeth, intermarried with the aforesaid Christian Landis, your petitioners; and that, by the laws and usages of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the said tract of land, mills, mill-dam with \u2022their privileges and appurtenances, have descended to the said Elizabeth, as the heir and representative of her father, the said George Bower, and have come to the seisin and possession of the said Christian Landis in right of his said wife; that since the said tract of land with the said .privileges and appurtenances came to the seisin, and possession of the said Christian Landis, to wit: on the 1st of June 1S28, the said Christian Landis erected, at great cost, a valuable clover-mill, attached to the said mill-dam, and driven by the waters of said creek on the said described tract of land, and without any impediment from the 'back water of the said creek, from which said mills your petitioners derived great profits and advantages until interrupted in the manner hereinafter complained of. That the said Christian Landis and Elizabeth his wife, being so seised and possessed of the said premises with the appurtenances, the Union Canal Company of Pennsylvania, on the first day of December in the year last aforesaid, and on divers other days and times, between that day and-the presentation of the petition, entered in and upon the canals, premises, mills, privileges, hereditaments and appurtenances aforesaid, with and by their engineers, artists, officers, contractors, workmen and laborers, and then and there erected, raised, formed and made large dams and impediments and obstructions in the said .Swatara creek, against the said mills and waterworks of your petitioners, and, have, continued the same from the said 1st day \u00a9f December 1828. to the presentation hereof, and have thereby so obstructed, stopped up and raised the waters of the .said creek, and caused- them to flow back upon the wheels of the said mills and other water-works of your petitioners on the said tract of land erected, a^'to greatly obstruct, retard and entirely pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>vent their operation, whereby the said mills and other water-works \u25a0have been rendered to a great extent useless, and the said Christian Landis deprived of the tolls and operations thereof: and other harms \u25a0to the said Christian Landis and Elizabeth his wife,then and there did to their great damage. That the said Union Canal Company of Pennsylvania have not purchased from your petitioners, nor from any one under whom they claim to hold the said premises, with their privileges and appurtenances, any right or privilege appurtenant to or connected with the lands and appurtenances aforesaid, nor have they made them or any of them any satisfaction, payment or amends for the damages so done and committed on their said premises, hereditaments and appurtenances. Your petitioners therefore pray the court to award a <em>venire facias </em>directed to the sheriff of any adjoining county, to summon a jury of disinterested men in order to ascertain and report to the court the damages to the aforesaid premises, according to the provisions of the acts of the general assembly in such case made and provided; and they will pray,\u201d- &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-6\">Upon this petition a venue was awarded to the sheriff of Cumberland county, who summoned a jury, who by their inquest found that the petitioners had sustained damages to the amount of two thousand six hundred and fifty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-7\">Upon the return of the inquisition to the court of quarter sessions, the court set the same aside on the ground, that-the Union Canal Company had the privilege of erecting the dam complained of by grant, previous to the grant to Bear to erect his dam, and the privilege granted to Bear, was with reservation of the privileges secured to the canal company since vested in defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-8\">In this court the following errors and reasons for reversing the judgment of the court below were assigned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-9\">1. The court erred in setting aside the inquisition, and because there never was any legislative grant to the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company, of an exclusive right to the waters of the Swatara creek or river.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-10\">2. Because the Union Canal Company of Pennsylvania had no right to build a dam in the Swatara, by any law passed prior to the erection of Christian Bear\u2019s dam, and by the erection of a dam in the Swatara, they forced the water back on his mills, and entered on his privileges, and damnified his real hereditaments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-11\">3. Because the grant to Christian Bear of the waters of the Swatara, contained no proviso, rendering said grant to him of the waters of the Swatara, subject to the rights of the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company to the \u00fase of these waters, but only' contained a reservation, enabling the company to explore and locate their canal through his premises, without \u2022 being trespassers in so doing; and provided against Christian Bear infringing or impairing the rights of the company, by backing the waters of the Swatara on their works or otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>4. Because Christian Bear\u2019s mill was not completed until after the passage of the act of the 28th March 1803, which act authorized any persons owning property on the Swatara, to erect dams in said stream, for the purpose of supplying their mills, or other water works with water.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\">5. Because the Union Canal Company only succeeded to the estates purchased by the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-7\">6. Because Christian Bear\u2019s dam was erected in the Swatara twenty-five years before the Union Canal Company raised their dam, and he had acquired a right by prescription to the waters of the said creek.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-8\">7. Because, after Christian Bear had enjoyed the legislative grant to him at great expense, if the company had any right to the waters of the Swatara creek, (when they built their dam in the year 1825,) their rights, and Christian Bear\u2019s were concurrent, and neither could encroach on the rights of the other, without being responsible in damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-9\">8. Because Christian Bear and those claiming under him, succeeded to all the rights of the original purchasers from the proprietaries, and as such, had a prior right to use the waters of the Swatara.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-10\">9. Because, if the canal company had any rights prior to the grant to C. Bear of.using the waters of the Swatara, they were repealed and divested by act of 1811, except the rights acquired by purchase of the landholders.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-11\"><em>Hamilton Jllrichs </em>and <em>Roberts, </em>for plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq6\">cited <em>Pam.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACk\">The commonwealth having dominion over navigable streams, and having a consequent right to dispose of them at pleasure, declared the Swatara a public highway in 1771; and thus it was devoted to public use. In 1800, an act was passed, by which was granted to Christian Bear, from whom the complainants derive their title, authority to erect and maintain a dam across that stream-, \u201cprovided the rights of every person whomsoever, shall remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>inviolate and unaffected by this act, especially that the privileges granted to Adam Hamaker, and the company incorporated for the purpose of opening a'canal and lock navigation from Susquehanna to Schuylkill, shall not be impaired or infringed by any thing herein contained.\u201d Authority to erect a dam across the Swatara, had been given to Hamaker in 1793, with the same reservation of the rights of the company. What were those rights? \u201c To enter upon the lands covered with water, situate upon, near, and between Tulpehoccon creek, in the county of Berks, and Swatara creek, in the county of Dauphin;\u201d and' for what purpose? Not merely \u201c to lay out and survey the route of their canal,\u201d as mentioned in the sixth section of the act of incorporation, but evidently to appropriate the public franchise to the purpose of the work without paying for it to one individual, because it belonged to no individual. An exclusive right to the water was not expressly granted, but that the company might enter and take it without stint, was an implicit stipulation of the charter. By the grant of power to make the canal every thing necessary to the purpose, passed as incidental to it which the state had power to give; and without a right to take the water, the grant would have been useless. The state itself put that construction on the very grant under consideration; and the successors of the original grantee are bound by it. She granted the petition of their predecessor on her own terms; one of which was that he should not interfere with the company\u2019s right. What right? Not the right of taking private property for public use on payment of a compensation, for that'was more efficiently secured by the constitution; but the right to be first served out of the stream, and to make, at pleasure, all erections necessary to the enjoyment of it. The'residue of the use alone was subsequently granted: it was all the state had power to grant. The grantee took subject to the company\u2019s right to enter still further on the actual possession of its franchise; and he erected his dam at the express risk of interference from subsequent erections. The public right of navigation, was necessarily to continue till these should be made; and hence the necessity of a grant subsequent to the origin of the company\u2019s title, without which, a private dam would have been a nuisance. What the legislature meant to do, therefore, was not to grant an estate in the use of the stream, but to guard the occupant from prosecution for an invasion of the residue of the public franchise. The respondent, then, as that company\u2019s successor, was entitled to enter on the subject of its .grant, exactly as if no grant had been made to any one else'; and on the ground taken by the court below, the proceedings were properly quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
