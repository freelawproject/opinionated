Two of -them reported in favour of granting the prayer -of the petitioners, and returned with their report their bill for-two -days for each viewer amounting to four dollars. The court confirmed-their report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-14\">The error assigned was, that but two of the viewers were notified \u25a0of their -appointment, -and butt two attended.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-15\"><em>R.

Even if it were, it is not our business to quash or sustain proceedings according to an estimate of probabilities. In the court below, the fact might have been inquired into-on affidavits; and that was the place for the objection. Here we have no discretion; for, on a <em>certiorari, </em>every intendment is to be made in favour of the proceedings, till the contrary appear.- We are to presume, then, that all the viewers attended, though but two of them joined in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Judgment and proceedings affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
