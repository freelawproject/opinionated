G. Ege to make a tender of the rent of the forge due up to the 1st of April 1837 to George Houk, and I undertook to make the tender some time before the distress was made of the goods of the said A. G. Ege by the said George Houk, at the saw mill along side of the <em>forge; I </em>was at the saw mill, and Mr Houk came along riding on horseback, and I told him that I had the money for the rent due up to the 5th of April. I had it in specie; I had not time to count it, as he rode off; when he was going away he said he would have nothing to do with it or with A. G. Ege; I do not recollect which; the amount was either 27 dollars and some cents, or 28 dollars and some cents; I understood from Mr Ege that it was the rent up to the 5th of April 1837. I had the money yet when Mr M\u2019Glaughlin made the distress, and told him that morning that he was ready and willing to pay it; I afterwards returned the money to Mr Ege\u2019s manager, Mr Beelman.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-8\">Cross-examined by George Houk, Esq., the witness further saith:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-9\">\u201c I understood that Mr Lyon had rented the property of Mr Houk; I understood that Mr Lyon was to pay 500 dollars a year, and it was to be paid quarterly; I understood from Mr Lyon and Mr Ege that Mr Ege had bought Mr Lyon\u2019s lease; I did not get time to show the money to Mr Houk, because Squire Houk rode off after I told him, before I had time to unfold it; on the morning that the distress was made, I was at the forge in company with M\u2019Glaughlin, the constable, and George Houk, about fifteen minutes; I told Mr M\u2019\u2019Glaughlin not to make the levy, that I had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>money for the rent up to the 5th of April; I stated to M\u2019Glaughlin that I had 27 dollars and some cents, or-28 dollars and some cents, I do not recollect which; Mr M\u2019Glaughlin refused to take it, and asked above 100 dollars; I did not show them any money at that time or any other; Mr Ege had directed me not to suffer the property to be levied on and removed or taken away, and at the risk of his, the deponent\u2019s, life he would not suffer it to be done, (it is admitted by the parties themselves that the blooms distrained were the property of J. B. Lyon.) I think the levy was made about the 17th, or from that to the 20th of March 1837, Houk and me, it appears to me, we might have had a conversation between the time we met at the saw mill and the time the levy was made, but I do not remember it; Mr Houk was riding at a walk the morning that I spoke to him at the saw mill, he did not stop but drawed up the mare; then when I pulled it out, he rode on, and said he would have nothing to do with it or with Galbraith Ege, I do not know which; I cannot recollect the time, but think it was not more than two days from the time I saw Houk at the forge that the levy was made.

The money tendered admitted to be in court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-7\">The Court delivered the following charge to the jury, which was excepted to by both parlies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-8\"><em>\u201c </em>George Houk and George Himes being the owners of a forge property, leased it by their indenture of 13th of June 1836,'to the plaintiff, J. B. Lyon, at an annual rent of 500 dollars, payable quarterly in advance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-9\">On the 13th of February 1837, George Hook entered into an article of agreement with A. G. Ege for the sale of the property. By the terms of the article, which were duly complied with, Houk was to render a deed for the property, and possession, on the 5th of April following. He was also to be entitled to the rent from Lyon after the 5th of April\u2014Houk to have it till that time. Ege having purchased the lease of Lyon (on the 3d of .March 1837), took possession of the property on the 15th of March; on the 16th or 17th of the same month, according to the deposition of Mullen, Ege caused a tender to be made to Houk of the proportion of rent which he considered himself entitled to, on the then current quarter, namely, up to the 5th of April. Houk, disregarding the tender, distrained the goods of Lyon on the premises for the rent of the entire quarter. Lyon replevied the goods, and the defence to the replevin is, that there was no rent in arrear. The plaintiff contended that the tender by Ege of the proportion of rent due to Houk, extinguished the right of the latter to distrain\u2014the court instruct the jury that under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>agreement between Houk and Ege, Houk was entitled to 28 dollars 67 cents, as his proportion of the rent of the quarter in dispute, (that the balance belonged to Ege,) and that the tender made by Ege did not extinguish his claim, or his right of distress, although at the time of making the tender and distress, he knew that Ege was in possession of the premises. It might have been otherwise had he been privy to the agreement between Ege and Lyon, by which Ege covenants to pay the rent\u2014or had notice of such agreement been given to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-6\">\u201cThe jury will therefore find for the defendant,and that there is rent in arrear 28 dollars 67 cents, with interest from the date of distress\u2014and that the value of the goods distrained is of the same amount.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-7\">The plaintiff moved the court for a new trial, on the ground of misdirection to the jury, which was overruled on the following ground:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-8\">\u201c In this case the plaintiff moved for a new trial, on the ground that the court erred in charging the jury that the tender made by Ege to Houk was not available to him in this suit. That the charge was correct, having regard to the evidence in the cause, I am welL satisfied, for though in the charge the fact-was assumed, through misapprehension, that Ege was, in possession of the demised premises at the time of the tender and distress, there was no evidence whatever of the fact\u2014nothing to be left to the jury from which they could infer the fact. It is not necessary, then, to inquire whether the tender would have been good, had Ege been in possession of the premises, as the court supposed he was, but merely whether it was good, Ege not being in possession, and that it was not, is quite certain. Therefore, the motion for a new trial on the part of the plaintiff is dismissed.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-9\"><em>Watts </em>and <em>Alexander, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aic\">The assignee of the term, by reason of the mere fact of becoming such, subjects himself to the liability of the payment of the rent: but in this case he had taken actual possession, and it was a sufficient evidence of that, that the tender was made on the Dremises. 6 <em>Law Lib. </em>140, 141, 142. 151, 152. 158; 3 <em>Salk. 4.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-10\"><em>Gaullaher </em>and Biddle, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3f\">cited 2 <em>Saund.

G-.Ege having contracted with George Houk, one of the original lessors, who had become sole owner of the reversionary interest by purchase from George Himes, his co-lessor, for the purchase of the reversionary interest in the leased premsses, the latter, as between themselves, was only entitled to the rent from the 15th of March 1837, to the 5th of the following month, making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>twenty days, which, at the rate of 500 dollars rent <em>per annum, </em>would have been equal to about .27 dollars 40 cents. The 15th of March was the commencement of the quarter, and the rent, according to the lease which Lyon had taken of Houk &amp; Himes, was payable quarterly in advance. But then, by the agreement which Ege had made with Houk for the purchase of the reversionary interest in the leased premises, Ege was to have the residue of the quarter\u2019s rent, so that 27 dollars 40 cents was all that Houk had any right to claim of Ege, considering the latter as the tenant in possession, as in fact he was; because, after his purchase of the reversion from Houk, he, on the 15th of March 1837, came into the actual possession of the leased premises undpr a purchase from Lyon, the lessee, of his right therein, made previously, on the third of the same' month. By this means he acquired all the interest of Lyon, the lessee, in the premises, as well as that of the lessors, to a limited extent. Having come thus rightfully into the actual possession, as tenant, at least, of the leased premises, and being in possession as such of the same, when the rent became payable, on the 15th of March, it was his duty to see to the payment of it, as he thereby made himself either liable to pay, or to be distrained on for it, if he did not. Having thus become a privy in interest, he was consequently a proper person to tender all the rent coming to Houk, as between the latter and himself. <em>Co. Lit. </em>206 <em>b, </em>207 <em>a; </em>1 <em>Sound. Rep. </em>203, <em>note b; </em>Williams <em>v. </em>Bosanquet, 1 <em>B. &amp; B. </em>461; <em>Latch. </em>107; 7 <em>Co. </em>13. In this respect he stood in the-shoes of Lyon, the original lessee; and moreover, as claiming an interest in the rent itself, by purchase from Houk. Then if he tendered, or caused a sufficient sum of money to be tendered, Houk ought either to have received it, or not to have distrained for it subsequently, without having made a personal demand of it, and a refusal on the part of Ege to pay. <em>Gilbert on Rents </em>81, 82, 83; <em>Hol. </em>207; 2 <em>Rolle. </em>427. A distress is a summary remedy, given by law for the recovery of rent, and may be considered equivalent, in some respects, to an action in which a judgment is obtained, and an execution awarded-for the recovery of it. But it is very obvious, if an action were to be brought for the recovery of rent, after a tender of payment had been made of it to the landlord, without his having subsequently made a demand of the rent from the tenant, the tenant, by pleading the tender, and bringing the money into court, would defeat the plaintiff in his action, and recover from him the costs expended by the defendant on account of it. We therefore think that the court below erred in charging the jury that the tender made by Ege of the rent coming to Houk, did not take away or suspend the right of the latter to distrain for it, until he made a demand on Ege for it, and the latter refused or omitted to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
