The two last payments were to remain unpaid, and charged on the land, for and during the life of his daughter Catharine Heffernan, the interest thereof to be paid to her annually. It is admitted that the interest was paid to her up to the 12th of January 1814. Catharine Heffernan died on the 11th of January 1836, she having survived her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-17\">Henry Singer, the devisee, died anterior to the year 1810, intestate, without issue, leaving a widow, who died on the 10th of May 1831. Henry left five brothers and sisters. In 1810 the land devised to Henry by his father was appraised, and accepted of by John, one of the brothers, at 1800 pounds; 900 pounds were paid by John to the other heirs, at the time of said acceptance; 900 pounds remained charged on the land, until the death of Henry\u2019s widow. The one fifth of this sum is the 180 pounds which is here claimed, with interest, since the widow\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-18\">\u00abIt is contended by the counsel of the defendant, that on the death of Henry, the devisee, the lands which had been devised to him by his father, descended to his brothers and sisters, of whom Catharine Heffernan was one, and therefore that this legacy was merged or extinguished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-19\">\u00abIt is true, that on the death of Henry, this land did descend to his brothers and sisters, as tenants in common; notwithstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>this fact, as against her brothers and sisters, Catharine still had a right to this interest, to be thus annually paid to her; the death of Henry did not destroy her right to it; at his death, Catharine did not become the entire owner of the whole estate. There never was a perfect union of the legal and equitable title in her. If she had become the entire owner of the land, then the charge in her favour would have sunk into the legal estate. In that case there could have been no just end for which the charge could have survived; she had not even the prior right of acceptance under our intestate laws. The brothers, by law, were preferred to her; of this advantage John availed himself, and thus the absolute estate became his. Why then should the charge be merged? She had not received the money, nor any equivalent for it; no rule of law enjoined her to relinquish it for the benefit of her brothers and sister; nor does it appear that in point of fact she did relinquish it. This is not insisted on, but the relinquishment is argued as being by operation of law. Justice would then appear to demand that the charge should still subsist. There is some legitimate and beneficial purpose which requires that it should be preserved. It appears to have been the understanding of the parties in interest that it should be preserved. The fact,thatthe interest was for some time confessedly paid by the occupant, isa strong demonstration of this understanding. It is eveii now contended that it has all been discharged. This is all inconsistent with the idea that it has been merged. It cannot be merged contrary to the intention of the parties. There is nothing in the whole transaction, either actual or presumed, which clearly manifests an intention that it should be merged. Whether it should merge or not, was not a matter of indifference to her; she might insist upon its payment as matter of right; that it should be kept alive appears to me best to subserve the purposes of justice, and the actual intention of parties, as far as that is demonstrated by what they did at the time. This purpose was one which was innocent, and worked injury to no one interested; to my mind k is most obvious, that her right to this money has not merged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-6\">\u201cJohn Singer, who accepted the land, having made his will, which was proved on the 29th of January 1822, died, but the precise time has not been shown; the same lands were devised by him to William Singer and Daniel Stroeble.

There is no doubt but both pieces of land were originally bound for these claims; when part was sold, and the money not applied to their payment, the first purchaser might insist that the money should be raised out of the lands unsold. Dotterer was the first purchaser, if I got the dates correctly; the debt should in equity be raised out of the residue of the land, and that sold could only be resorted to for that which remained after this residue was exhausted.

If he did, and they received the money, it would be a ratification of what he had done, and they would be bound by it, and could not recover in this action. If he informed them of what he had done, and they agreed to it, or acquiesced in it, they ought not now to be permitted, after this lapse of time, and under the circumstances of <em>this case, to </em>recover.

The court below, however, were of opinion that the circumstance of the annuitant\u2019s having become by descent the owner of an undivided fifth part of the land, as tenant in common, did not affect her right to have the full amount of the annuity thereafter paid to her, in any degree whatever, and accordingly instructed the jury to that effect. To this instruction the counsel for the defendants below took exception, and have assigned it here as the first error. In the first place it may be proper to observe, that the claim to the annuity is not made against the estate of Henry Singer, the devisee, generally, as if he had been personally liable originally for the payment of it, but against the fund arising from the sale of the land, or rather one hundred acres thereof, whereon it was charged \u2022and made a lien by the will of the testator, who gave it. For supposing the annuitant to have been entitled to claim the whole of the annuity against the devisee personally in his lifetime, or his personal representatives after his death, yet it may present a different question, whether she, having become the owner of an undivided portion of the land, upon which the annuity was charged, could do so as against it thereafter. Now it is very clear, that, if she had become the owner of the whole of the land so charged, the annuity would have become entirely extinct thereby. Notwithstanding, however, the court below considered this would have been the result of such an event, yet they entertained the opinion, that a partial ownership of the land by the annuitant would not operate as an extinguishment even <em>pro tanto. </em>Under the statute regulating the descent of estates of inheritance in Pennsylvania, no distinction is or can be made as to the quantum that each of the heirs standing in .equal degree to the ancestor shall take, where every thing like advancement to any of them by the ancestor in his lifetime is out of the question. Their interests are made equal by the statute; but in the case before us, if it were to be adjudged that the annuitant took her undivided fifth part discharged of the annuity altogether, and that the other heirs took their respective portions of the estate, charged exclusively with the whole of if, the consequence is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>that the annuitant would be held to have acquired by descent a greater interest in the estate than either one of the other heirs. Or suppose that the interest of one of the other heirs in the land charged-had been sold under a judgment and execution against him in the, lifetime of the annuitant, when arrears of the annuity were due to her, and she had claimed and been paid the amount of such arrears\u2019 out of the money arising'from the sale, would it not have been just as equitable that the heir, whose portion of the land charged- had thus been sold and made to pay the whole amount of the arrears due to the annuitant, should have had contribution from the other heirs? It would seem as if but one answer could be given to this question, and that a stronger case for making equality of burthen the rule of equity, as also that of decision in the case, could not be easily imagined, and is never likely to happen. Again, suppose another person, instead of the annuitant, had in such case been the\u2019 owner, by descent of her fifth of the land charged, could it be doubted for a moment that such person would not have been liable to con-tribution? Certainly not. Then why should the annuitant be exempt from it\u2014or, in other words, why should not one-fifth of the annuity be' considered as' extinguished, and thus equalize the interests respectively which the five heirs acquired by descent in the land. Though heirs will not be permitted to claim contribution against a purchaser from their ancestor, yet, as against each other, there is no reason why they should not have it. Boyer <em>v. </em>Rivettte, 3 <em>Bulstr. </em>320, per Jones, J.; and 321, per Dodridge, J. The distinction in this respect is founded in reason, because the heirs succeed to the estate as the ancestor held it, and stand as it were in his place, bound to fulfil his obligations, so far as they were a charge upon the estate at the time of his death, or otherwise give it up for that purpose. Had the annuitant acquired her interest in the land, charged with the payment of her annuity, by purchase, it is not necessary to say here what would have been the effect of it, whether it would have operated so as to have extinguished the whole of the annuity or not. Supposing, however, that it- would, still it does not necessarily follow that the acquisition of a similar interest by the <em>act of the law </em>would produce such an effect: because the maxim, <em>actus legis nulli facit injuriam, </em>may interpose to prevent it. As in the case'of a rent charge, if the grantee purchase part of the land, the rent thereby becomes extinct, and h\u00e9 shall never have a writ of annuity; but if the rent charge be determined by the act' of God, or'of <em>the law, </em>the grantee may have a writ of annuity. <em>Co. Lit. </em>148, <em>a. </em>So if the tenant of the land, in case of a rent charge, convey part thereof to the father of the party entitled.to the rent, and the father dies, whereupon the land so conveyed <em>descends </em>to the owner of the rent, the rent shall not thereby become suspended or extinguished in whole, but in part only,-and shall be apportioned. <em>Co. Lit. 148, b: </em>The result would doubtless-be the same in the case of land charged with a rent' seek, because the only distinction between'a rent seels; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>and a rent charge is, that the remedy by distress is granted with and accompanies the latter. The charge in question having been without the remedy by distress for its recovery, may therefore be very justly considered the same as a rent seek, or an annuity charged upon the land, and as falling under the same rules. We therefore think that the court below erred in not having instructed the jury to apportion it, if they found for the plaintiff, by reducing it from twelve pounds to nine pounds twelve shillings per annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The second error is, that the court erred in charging the jury, that the judicial sale made by the sheriff of the fifty acres to John Dotterel-, for 150 dollars, did not discharge so much of the claim of the intestate of the plaintiff below, as the fifty acres ought in equity to bear; according to their proportional value to that of the whole one hundred and fifty acres. We are of opinion that this error cannot be sustained. The land upon which the claim of the intestate of the plaintiff below was a charge, consisted of two separate lots, <em>one </em>containing one hundred acres, and the other fifty acres: so that in this respect she may be considered as having two distinct funds, to which she had a right in law to resort, in order to have her claim satisfied. In such case, having a clear legal right to resort to either for payment, she of course had the right of forbearing to make her claim upon the first that was converted by a judicial sale into money. If any objection existed on the part of any one to her doing so at the time, he ought then to have made it known, and to have invoked the aid of equity to prevent her from doing so, if he had any sufficient ground for it. Her right to go against either fund, or any portion of the land charged, being a perfect legal right, could not be affected by a mere equitable objection, unless it were made in time to prevent her from losing by it. But the moneys arising from the previous sales having been all appropriated to the payment of other claims,cannot now be come at by the plaintiff below; and no notice having been given to him or his intestate that such a thing was desired, it is obviously too late to insist now upon having recourse thereto, or upon his losing any portion of his claim because he or his intestate did not do so. If we had a court of chancery, the right of the intestate of the plaintiff below at law, to resort to either fund, could have been resisted only in that court; but it is too plain to admit of illustration, that if such application were not made until after the plaintiff\u2019s intestate had permitted one of the funds, upon which she had a lien, to be appropriated to the discharge of junior claims, it would be too late then to make it, as no alternative remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The third error presents substantially the same question as the second, and therefore requires no further answer in order to show that it cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"AXN\">The fourth error is also untenable. The claim of the plaintiff below, in right of his intestate, is not, properly speaking, founded upon the bond there alluded to: for if it had, it might be lost as to her estate upon another ground, very different from that of its hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ing been reduced into possession by her- husband, as is contended it was, by his taking the bond payable to himself. The bond was no lien upon the land before the death of the obligor, and hence, for aught we know, if the claim of the plaintiff below rested upon it, the money arising from the sale of the land may be all required to satisfy prior liens. But the claim of the plaintiff below is not founded upon the bond. It is founded upon a recognizance, acknowledged by John Singer in the orphans\u2019 court, when the land was decreed to him, which bound it from its date. The condition of this recognizance is, that the money should be paid-to the <em>heirs </em>severally of Henry Singer, the younger, in their respective proportions: so that the intestate of the plaintiff below being one of the heirs, and not her husband, the money claimed in this action was made payable to her, and she having survived her husband, was entitled to it at the time of her death, which gives the plaintiff below a right to claim it as her representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">There is nothing in the fifth error;, because the issue joined here being a feigned one, ordered by the court for the purpose of ascertaining matters of fact, they might nominate whom they pleased as parties for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The question embraced in the sixth error was settled by this court in Heffernan <em>v. </em>Addams, 7 <em>Watts </em>116, where it was determined that the letter of attorney mentioned in this error was not legally executed\u2014in short, not executed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The question raised by the seventh error is answered fully in the answer given to the first error.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">We also think that the court were right in the instruction given to the jury, which is excepted to in the eighth and last error. Catharine Heffernan, the intestate of the plaintiff below, being a daughter of the testator, William Singer, the elder, it may therefore be reasonably supposed that he intended the twelve pounds <em>per annum </em>as a partial support for her at least, and for this purpose his desire was, that it should be punctually paid to her, that she might by means of it be made comfortable.- For want of it, however, it may be, that debts were contracted upon which she had to pay interest. But besides, as it regarded her, the twelve pounds are not to be looked upon as the interest of money that was due or o\\ying to her. It was itself <em>principal </em>to her, so far as she had \u00e1 claim to it; and therefore ought to have been punctually paid. And had it been so, she would have had thfe use of it, which we must presume would have been equal in value to the interest; but having lost the use of it, by reason of the delinquency of the owners of the land, who were bound to have paid it regularly as it fell due, it is but reasonable that interest should be allowed as a compensation for the loss so occasioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">The judgment is reversed on account of the first error assigned, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
