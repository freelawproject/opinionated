We rely on the intention of the testator, as evinced in the whole scope of the will, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>and particularly in the form and manner of the other bequests in the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-6\">It is manifest, that the testator computed the whole amount of his estate real and personal, and designed to dispose of the whole of it between the devisees and tile legatees to divide it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-7\">The legacies are all by implication, and the time Qf payment fixed; and they are all given in the same form and words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-8\">The testator had daughters married, and had grand-children, and had sons-in-law; some of his children dead, leaving children; some living; some of his- sons-in-law dead, &amp;c. The legacies, by the express terms of the will, are payable out of the proceeds of the personal estate. First, the executors are to pay to his son-in-law, Peter Verdauff, 50 pounds in 1822, and 50 pounds in 1823. To his daughter, Mary Dentlin, in 1824, in 1829, and in 1S34. Now, if either of these legatees had died before the time of payment, would their legacies have lapsed? certainly not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-9\">Further, his executors shall pay to his daughter Hestena 30 pounds in 1825, 35 pounds in 1S30, and 35 pounds in 1835.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-10\">They shall pay to his daughter, Jeruel Miller, 30 pounds in 1826, 35 pounds in 1831, and 35 pounds in 1836.

See 1 <em>Rop. on Leg. 436. </em>So where a design is indicated by the testator that he intended to divide his estate between the devisees and legatees in a particular way, the legacies are vested. 1 <em>Rop. </em>441; 1 <em>Bro. C. C. </em>123. This intent is perfectly plain throughout the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-16\">Besides, in the conclusion of the first part of the will, he directs that all the afore mentioned sums of money shall be paid \u201c unto the said legatees, or their heirs.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-17\">By the supplemental part of the will, he makes the legacies a present lien upon all his lands, though he had directed them to be paid out of the proceeds of his personal estate; and that lien is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>to be released or discharged but by payment. The receipts of the legatees \u201c or their heirs,\u201d for the payment of all the legacies, is alone contemplated by the testator, as releasing the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-6\">By the death of a legatee, if the legacy be lapsed, the devisees alone would be benefitted. This was clearly not the purpose of the testator. Lord Eldon says he would struggle against the construction that the legacy is not vested. 6 <em>Ves. </em>541. The bequest is not to be defeated but upon the clear intention of the testator. 11 <em>Vez. </em>497.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-7\">There is no residuary bequest\u2014no provision for any lapse; the event was not contemplated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-8\">There is a present bequest by implication, in all the cases, to all the legatees, to be paid in future, all the different times being fixed. None of them in terms, are payable on any contingency\u2014no if\u2014 or <em>in </em>case\u2014or <em>provided. </em>The amount is contemplated as falling due, and the time of payment is only postponed, or provided for. There is no uncertain event\u2014no contingency, that might or might not happen. And this, in the books, is said to indicate that the legacy is vested. 1 <em>Roper </em>381. If the legacy was made a present lien, it must be considered a present debt. If the debt is present, and payment only postponed, judgment should be rendered in favour of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-9\">Interest is a matter of course, if the legacy was vested, from the time it was payable. Dawes <em>v. </em>Levan, 4 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>218.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-10\">All the other legacies in the will, we think, are clearly vested by necessary implication, from a consideration of their situation and circumstances. It would be cruelty to their offspring to decide otherwise. If that is fixed, then a legacy in the same will, out of the same fund, to an infant grand-child, and in the very same words, and under the sam\u00e9 circumstances, cannot be lapsed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-11\">We ask that judgment be reversed, and entered for the plaintiff, for the sum stipulated in the special verdict, and with interest from the 1st of July 1832.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-12\"><em>Watts, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-13\">When the age of the legatee is annexed to the gift, and not to the time of payment and the legatee dies before the happening of the event, the bequest is contingent and lapses. 1 <em>Roper on Leg. </em>383; 2 <em>Sim. &amp; Stuart </em>490. This case is directly in point; it was a legacy \u201c to A as soon as she attains twenty-one, with interest;\u201d and it was held to be contingent, and lapsed upon the death of the legatee before the time arrived. See also 2 <em>Salk. </em>415; 1 <em>Eq. Cas. Ab. </em>295; <em>Peake </em>6; 3 <em>Pr. Wms. </em>20; 2 <em>Wms. on Ex\u2019rs </em>776.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-14\">It does not appear to have been the intention of the testator that the legacy to John Moore should be paid at all events, for the language of the bequest to him is different from that of any other bequest to his children; the legacies to all the others are undoubtedly vested, as the time is annexed to the payment and not to the gift.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The testator devises to his sons, John and Michael, his real estate, and charges it with the payment of the legacies, and the claim now made, if recoverable, will be out of the real estate devised, as is found b5r the special verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-6\">When a legacy is charged upon land, the construction of the bequest will be the more readily made in favour of the inheritance. There is nothing, therefore, in the argument that there is no residuary clause which provides for the case of a lapsed legacy. The testator knew, that, if John Moore died before twenty-one, it would be in relief of his own sons, to w.hom he devised his land, he having given to his other children all he intended they should have., 2 <em>Williams on Ex\u2019rs </em>779.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-8\">The circumstance that the testator, by the last clause of his will, directed all the legacies to be paid \u201c on the 1st day of May in each and every year before mentioned,\u201d &amp;c., cannot give any additional claim to the plaintiff, because it is not certainly applicable to the clause giving the legacy to John Moore, but to the other legacies, payable in the different years mentioned, and because he had fixed other circumstances and another time under and when his legacy was to be paid. And the same remarks are applicable to the interpretation off the codicil: it operated upon the vested legacies to his children, and not upon the legacy in question. But even if it did, it would not operate .to give a different character to the legacy. If the legacy was contingent, and would lapse in case of the death of the legatee, the fact that the testator secured its payment, in the event that it should be payable at all, would not seem to change the character of the bequest. And inasmuch as the words \u201c the receipts of the legatees and their heirs,\u201d &amp;c., are certainly applicable to the vested legacies, there is no reason that there should be given to them the strained, interpretation of applying them, to give a character to a bequest not intended to be embraced.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b407-10\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABlC\">The ruling principle of a case like this is, that where there is no' separate and antecedent gift which is independent of the direction and time for payment, the legacy is contingent; and it seems to be as well founded in reason, as\u2019rules of interpretation usually are. Where a gift is only implied from a direction to pay, it is necessarily inseparable from the direction, and must partake of its quality; insomuch that if the one is future and contingent, so must the other be. The implication of the one is an accessory of the other, and it consequently follows the nature of its principal; whence it results that there can be no separate and independent legacy which is not given in express terms. The bequest, in this instance, is destitute of any expression separately indicative of an intent to give. \u201c And further,\u201d says the testator, \u201c my exe-v cutors shall pay unto my grandson, John Moore, 100 pounds like money, as soon as he arrives to be twenty-one years of age;\u201d from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>which, though it is not directly expressed, it must be inferred that a gift was intended, but subject to the contingency that the donee be living at the day of payment to receive it. There is no case exactly in point as to circumstances; but, in Balsford <em>v. </em>Kebbel, 3 <em>Ves. </em>363, the principle is asserted in so many words. A testatrix, who bequeathed the produce of certain bank annuities betwixt her death and the arrival of the legatee at the age of thirty-two, directed her executors to transfer the annuities to him at that period; and it rvas held that the dividends were a distinct subject of bequest, and that there was no gift of the annuities but in the direction to pay, Avhieh attached itself to his person only at a particular age; consequently that the bequest of the annuities was contingent. In Mackel <em>v. </em>Winter, <em>Ibid. </em>543, it was said that the distinction betwixt even prospective payment and a present gift, however signified, is an arbitrary one, unfounded in any legitimate principle of interpretation, and destitute of any peculiar claim to respect; and that, though it has been follorved as to legacies, it has never been extended to real estate. It was borrowed, however, from the ecclesiastical courts, for purposes of convenience if not of \u2022necessity. It is a guide to certainty of result, where it is necessary, to choose betwixt suppositious intents in cases Avhere it is nearly certain that there was no intent at all; and it, therefore, frustrates the testator\u2019s purpose as seldom as any other which could be employed. But the general rule, that the legacy shall be deemed vested or contingent just as the time shall appear to have been annexed to the gift or the payment of it, as well as the particular rule of interpretation to determine whether it was annexed to the one or the other, is established beyond controversy; and by an application of them to the case in hand, we find that the legacy Avas not vested in the legatee\u2019s minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
