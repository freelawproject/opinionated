I was born on the land adjoining. I can remember as far back as 1795, and before that, when I was ploughing in the fields of my father adjoining. John Mehaffy from my earliest recollection, lived on the land adjoining Gilson Craighead, and occupied it, lived on it and farmed it as his own. I remember also that he made a contract with John M\u2019Culloch to clear a part of it, and M\u2019Culloch was to have either two or three crops for the clearing of the land. After he had cleared and raised one crop, then he got my brother to farm it one year on the shares; and that year I helped to plough the land for my brother. I remember of John Mehaffy\u2019s living in the View house on the land; Andrew Mehaffy lived on the other part of the land. I know the line between them, and each farmed and occupied his own part as far back as I can remember. At first, when I remember the land as far back as 1795, there was a part of the division between them which was a road, and John farmed up the road on one side and Andrew on the other side. I never knew or heard of any dispute between John Mehaffy and his brother Andrew Mehaffy about their respective rights; as things appeared each had his own, and farmed his own. Several years after, M\u2019Culloch cleared land for John. I remember that John\u2019s sons then began to grow up stout boys, and they and their father cleared some more land on their part. I never heard of any dispute about their lands between them, until some time after Andrew Mehaffy\u2019s death, some years, perhaps; I cannot remember. I know the land that James Mehaffy and Thomas Mehaffy, the sons of John, now live on, and it is the same land their father John Mehaffy lived and died on. I remember that two of the girls, whose names I think were Margaret and Martha, lived with Andrew from the earliest time that I can recollect, on Andrew\u2019s land adjoining John\u2019s. I never heard of John farming any part of Andrew\u2019s land, or Andrew to farm any part of John\u2019s land, each farmed his own, and got the whole proceeds of his own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-8\">John Dobbs and Andrew Dobbs, executors of Thomas Dobbs, deceased, appeared,and cross-examined the witness; who answer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>eel. I remember old Thomas Mehaffy, the father of Andrew and John; I saw him at my father\u2019s hous'e: I never knew that at the time that Thomas Mehaffy was alive, hb claimed the whole of the land. I was too young to, know it if he claimed it. I never knew of any legal transfer of the land or any writings between Thomas Mehaffy and his two sons Andrew and John.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-6\">Robert Moore, sworn.\u2014I can remember John Mehaffy from 1790. He lived on the old place; was then unmarried. I have seen old Thomas Mehaffy once or twice, and he was alive at that time. John Mehaffy was married in 1791. Sometime after he was married he lived with the old people. I made John\u2019s wedding coat. I know where defendants James and Thomas Mehaffy live now; it is on the same place their father lived: he commenced building a house, I heard, in 1794 or 1795. I can remember John\u2019s living in that house, on the land in controversy; think John died there; never knew him to live any where else; John lived up the creek. Andrew continued to live in the old place; his sisters lived with him, and a daughter of Mr Allison, who (Allison) married a daughter of Mehaffy\u2019s. I knew John Mehaffy worked the upper part of the place himself; never knew Andrew or any body else but John to farm the upper part. James and Thomas the present defendants, now live on the same land. John their father is dead. There is a house and barn, and tenant put on the place since John went there; the barn at James\u2019 is a middling good one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\">Cross-examined.\u2014Old Thomas died on the old place, in the old house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-8\">George Ege, sworn.\u2014I recollect this land now in dispute, as early as I can recollect any thing; can remember the house John Mehaffy lived and died in, prior to 1794; John Mehaffy lived in it then; never knew him to live any where else; I know it was pr.ior to 1794, because at that time'I commenced going to college. In passing back and forward along the road, I always saw John Mehaffy and his sons after him, farming the place. Considerable land cleared since I first remember it, and fenced; there was some stabling there from my earliest' recollections; additions have been built since, and perhaps the whole barn there now, has been built since John Mehaffy went there. Never knew any body to do any act of ownership on the upper part of the place but John Mehaffy and his family. John died on the place, and his sons reside in that house; there has been a house built some years back, near Craig-head\u2019s mill, said to be on the same tract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-9\">Jacob Shoff, sworn.\u2014I know this land in dispute; I can remember it thirty-seven or thirty-eight years. In 1800 I lived at the forge; in the year 1802 was well acquainted with John Mehaffy. Forty years last October since I came to that neighbourhood to live. When I first knew this property John Mehaffy lived on it; Andrew lived at the lower place; John farmed his own land himself, claimed it as his own for all I ever heard; never knew a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>dispute about it during Andrew\u2019s life time. Andrew died in 1811; John Mehaffy died in 1832 or 1833: Thomas Mehaffy died in 1792 or 1793.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-6\">Jacob Richwine, sworn.\u2014Remember this land for forty-four years: John Mehaffy lived on the upper and Andrew the lower all the time I was neighbour. Can not tell who farmed upper tract, but I saw John ploughing; not a great deal cleared when I first saw it; cleared just about the house down to old place; suppose about ten acres cleared there, as near as I can remember; good deal cleared now; no bam on it when I first knew it; no tenant house as 1 know of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-7\">The 10th of June 1762, warrant to Thomas Mehaffy upon which he paid 12 dollars and 80 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-8\">The defendants then gave in evidence the record of an ejectment as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-9\">Margaret Mehaffy v.

I know this land from that early date. Thomas Mehaffy lived on this land; he had as good a log house as was in that county at that time. His stock had been divided off; before he died had good stock, while all lived together. The house in which John lived was put up before he was married, while all lived together; can not tell whether it was finished before he moved into it; the old man was frail for some years before he died. Andrew was oldest son, but two sons, Andrew and John. Old Mr Mehaffy had no other lands but those. Three daughters married, one to Dobbs, one to Love, and one to Allison; there is a daughter of Allison\u2019s lives on the place, lived there before her grandfather\u2019s death; Andrew farmed lower end, and John farmed upper end: would rent for 150 dollars; the lane would throw both houses on upper end, where road went; do not know whether there was a division line or not; do not know whether they worked to the road or not, or whether there was a line or not.

And the object of the evidence was to show an acknowledgment by John Mehaffy, that his father had died seized of the whole of the land, including that in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-13\">William Line, sworn.\u2014In 1814 I was deputy surveyor of the county; was doing business in South mountain; Love\u2019s eldest son mentioned to me that the Mehaffys held a tract of land for which they had no warrant; John Mehaffy asked me and the others about, how they had better have that matter fixed. I told them they had better get a warrant; and having understood that they held it in common; heard it repeatedly from the parties, John and others; I told them they had better take out a warrant in trust for the use of the heirs, and I advised them to have it surveyed immediately. The next day or day after, I did make a survey of the whole tract; and my recollection now is, that there was an application in trust for the use of all the heirs: when I went to Harrisburg, I found this warrant of 1762 to Thomas Mehaffy; in the year 1807, I undertook to build an addition to Eby\u2019s house; he bought the timber from Andrew Mehaffy; the lower part of the tract Eby, Mehaffy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>and myself, went out. Andrew Mehaffy pointed out the line between him and his brother John, which each claimed up to; I went on and cut and hewed the timber; John came out to see whether I was transgressing; both pointed out the lines through the fields; space left up to the line not farmed by either party; this was the same year Eby purchased; and said Mehaffy wanted to sell more; Andrew frequently spoke to me about this, and wanted me to buy. John also spoke to me; I told them I did not think the title was good: I understood from them both that they held the land in common, and the heirs would convey as they conveyed to Eby; that there was land enough left for the other heirs, in the same tract; they spoke of the whole tract as I understood them; I understood from them the whole tract was common land; the lines in the field was on one side called Andrew\u2019s tract, and the other John\u2019s tract; did not learn object of line; each man observed his side of line in selling timber; John frequently farmed land on Andrew\u2019s side; put in fields for him; I have heard John speak of a will, making a division of the land as well as the other members of the family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-6\">Cross-examined.\u2014Heard them frequently speak of a will; do not recollect ever hearing John claim this land as his own, till execution of partition distinctly; John was an exceedingly easy man; never knew of John paying any rent; he did not raise a great deal till his sons grew up; they seemed to live well enough; their lands were exhausted; when his sons grew up they cleared land; John was an easy, inoffensive man; John opposed the holding of the inquisition and claimed the land as his own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-7\">Plaintiff.\u2014-In 1814 there was no separate claim set up by John and Andrew, when the application was made; John was an ignorant man; I have every reason to believe they placed implicit confidence in what I advised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-8\">Rebutting evidence by defendants.

Parker, Esq., has sworn that upon the proceedings upon <em>the </em>writ of partition and valuation of the real estate of Thomas Mehaffy, deceased, John Mehaffy, the father of the present James and Thomas Mehaffy, appeared in court whenever notice was served upon him, and denied that Thomas Mehaffy at the time of his decease, had any title to the land mentioned in the said proceedings, and that when called upon on the return of the rule upon the heirs to accept or refuse to accept the land at the valuation, he appeared in court and said, that he would not accept the same, but that the land was his own and he would hold it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-10\">James M\u2019Clune, sworn.\u2014These defendants have the whole land except about <em>2\\ </em>or 3 acre's, a patch embracing the old house and orchard; they are now in the occupancy and enjoyment of the whole tract; took it by force within eleven years back.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-11\">Sarah Allison sworn.\u2014Lived in same house with uncle Andrew and two aunts when Thomas Mehaffy died.

Grandfather lived in the old house on the farm till he died; I have lived there ever since. According to John\u2019s conduct I could hardly tell whether he claimed separate right or not; sometimes they were peaceable and sometimes at variance, but it never extended further than words. After the death of my grandfather every one worked as they could, and took the product themselves. I knew of no particular division; they worked as suited themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-6\">Cross-examined.\u2014John moved to upper end of place directly after he was married. I. was born in 1781, ten or eleven years old when John was married. Andrew died in 1811. Andrew farmed fields that they now claim on that side of the place; I knew Andrew to farm land upon that side; he did farm there after 1794 or 1795; he fetched the grain home to his own barn; each one took what they raised; nothing but repairs of stabling, &amp;c., done on Andrew\u2019s part. Margaret Mehaffy is about twelve years dead; she lived and died in the same house I live in on the lower part of the land. John nor his sons never paid the other heirs any thing that I know of.

The taking of the land by Margaret Mehaffy at a valuation, is equivalent to a purchase under sale by administrators under a decree of the orphans\u2019 court.

The deed and the recitals in the deed, from John Mehaffy, and the other heirs of Thomas Mehaffy, in 1807, to David Eby, are evidence that the parties at that time considered the title to the whole tract to be in the heirs of Thomas Mehaffy, not in his son John.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-10\">6. If the warrant of 1762 is descriptive of the land, that coupled with the residence proved, vested a title to the land in old Thomas Mehaffy, which, upon his death, would descend to his heirs under the intestate laws, and would give jurisdiction to the orphans\u2019 court to award a writ of partition or valuation, and to vest the title in any one taking the land at the appraisement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-11\">7.

That John Mehaffy, Jun., in his lifetime, was tenant in common with his other brother and sisters, unless a legal transfer of the title was made to him by his father in his lifetime, and his possession is not to be presumed to have been adverse to his co-heirs, and the lapse of time, under such circumstances, would not vest in him a right, in exclusion of his brother and sisters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-13\">9. The application and oath of John Mehaffy, for, and taking out the second warrant after his father\u2019s death, was fraudulent, and vested no title in him or his heirs, and if not void absolutely, he (John) held it in trust for the heirs and representatives of Thomas Mehaffy his brother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-14\">10.

On this recognizance the <em>scire facias </em>you are now trying issued, and that sum with its interest the amount claimed by the plaintiffs in this suit. It is resisted by Moses Eby, the defendant, and also by the Mebaffys, who are alleged to be in possession of land bound by the lien of it, and out of which the money may be made, if you find against them on their issues. Eby, the defendant, denies his liability to pay, because the land taken by Margaret Mehaffy, as he says, was not part of the estate of Thomas Mehaffy, deceased, and consequently no consideration given for the recognizance entered into; and the terre tenants resist the payment, because the land, as they say, belonged to their father, and not to their grandfather; and that the land in dispute at the time of partition, was their father\u2019s separate estate, and not a portion of the estate of Thomas Mehaffy, their grandfather.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-7\">\u201c Now we say, as matter of law, that if the tract of land, No. 2, in the inquest was the estate of John Mehaffy, the father of the terre tenants, and not the estate of Thomas Mehaffy, and formed no part of his estate, a recovery could not be had against the defendant in this suit; and a proper disposition of this important inquiry by you as matter of fact, would in my opinion have disposed of the case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>But the counsel upon each side have furnished us with a list of points numbering twelve upon one side and five upon the other, which we will endeavor to answer according to our best judgment, formed by a hurried investigation during the trial of this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 1st, 2d, 3d and 4th points read and answered in the negative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-7\">The 5th point is crossed out and withdrawn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-8\">The 6th point read.

You must recur to the testimony for the purpose of discovering if possible a relinquishment as indicated by the 2d point, and an entry upon the land as stated in the 4th point. I cannot recall any part of the testimony leading to such conclusion. I cannot recollect any witness that proves John entered into possession of the tract in question as his own in the life time of his father, or that he was put into it by his father to live upon and improve it as his own. Mr White speaks of the land as far back as 1795, which was after the death of Thomas Mehaffy his father, and that then he John was living on it and farming it as his own, but no indication so far as I recollect his testimony that John claimed it as his own land in exclusion of his brothers and sisters. Andrew also farmed the other part of the place; the two brothers seemed to have had it between them in some way, but precisely how is not so easy to determine. Robert Moore speaks of his (John) being on the property from about the same time 1794 or 1795. This is also after the death of his father. Captain Ege, Jacob Shoff, and Jacob Richwine, all speak of it about the same time. I cannot recall a single adverse act in relation to the land in dispute done by John as testified to by any witness until long after. Richard Craighead knew the land since 1777; Thomas Mehaffy lived there then and died upon it in 1792 or 1793; and says that after the old man\u2019s death he bought timber from both Andrew and John, and though cut in the same place paid both them for it: he may be mistaken as to the year but can you doubt the fact as testified to by him; that he did buy timber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>from them after the death of their, father; and Judge Line swears that as late as 1814 he heard repeatedly from both the parties that they held the whole tract in common, and though they showed him the line so much talked about in 1807, they in 1814 admitted to him the whole tract of land was held in common among all the heirs. Sarah Allison, if you believe her, swears, that though she lived on the land all the time from the death of her grandfather Thomas Mehaffy, she never heard John claim this land till after the death of her uncle Andrew; and she swears positively that Andrew did farm fields on the tract in dispute after 1794 or 1795; that he brought the grain home to his own barn and that each took what they raised; now can it be, if these facts are believed, that the confidence thus induced by John\u2019s profession to hold in common with the other heirs up as late as 1814 or until the twenty-one years had elapsed can be termed by him in fraud of his professions to his own advantage as it suits him, pleading the statute as a bar to their recovery, if he did acknowledge that he held in common with the other heirs as the witness proves, the statute of limitations will now afford the defendants no protection.

The instruction given in answer to the eleventh point was right, because if there be a recovery in this suit, and a sale of the land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the purchaser would be entitled to be substituted in that action of ejectment in the place of Margaret Mehaffy deceased.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b376-7\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASt\">There are two material subjects of error on which the jury were misdirected\u2014presumption of ouster from lapse of time, and recital of seisin in the common ancestor.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Before entering into a particular examinati'on of these, it is proper to premise that John\u2019s title, whatever it may have been, was not concluded by the decree of confirmation in the proceedings in partition. He was not a party to those proceedings, which were indeed not <em>inter partes </em>at all; and a decree <em>in rem, </em>though it concludes all the world as to matters properly determinable by it, concludes not rights determinable <em>inter partes; </em>and such was the right set up by John to hold the part of which he was possessed in severalty. It was an ordinary subject of ejectment by the other children, and the orphans\u2019 court could not take cognizance of it. It has been said that it came in question incidentally, and that jurisdiction of it was consequential and necessary. Shall not, however, the party to be affected have a trial by jury? He may have it by an issue directed to the common pleas. But why do incidentally what may be better done directly? I know not how a court can determine a matter indirectly of which it may not take cognizance immediately. The argument, however, disclaims a power in the orphans\u2019 court to take cognizance of a contest for title at. all, and declares that it must be remitted to the common pleas. The very fact that it does so, shows that the orphans\u2019 court has neither incidental nor direct jurisdiction of it; and how the decree of a court can conclude a party as to a matter which it does not pretend to have tried, and which it confesses that it is incompetent to try, is what I cannot comprehend. But the party might be concluded by the verdict and judgment on the collateral issue. It is decisive against this suggestion, that jurisdiction, thus exercised, would conclude the party by one verdict and judgment in a common law matter, proper to be decided in an action of ejectment. The statutory partition is evidently adapted to, and, therefore, intended for, an intestate\u2019s several estate actually possessed by him at his death, and indisputably held in common by his children. The preliminary course of proceeding where he has held in common in his life time, was pointed out in Strohecker <em>v. </em>Feather, 3 <em>Penn. Rep. </em>505, in which it was ruled, that the orphans\u2019 court cannot make partition . betwixt the children and their father\u2019s co-tenant, and among the children themselves. For the same reason, it is necessary, first, to settle, before the proper tribunal, a question of joint or several tenure between the children themselves, where one is made, and then to make partition in the orphans\u2019 court of the whole or a part, according to the event; and this is admitted to be the proper course where the disputant is a stranger. But it is sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>gested that John, who was a son of the common ancestor, cannot be viewed as such. He might, however, make himself a stranger, as he did, by claiming adversely and disclaiming an interest as a son. <em>Cum duo jura in una persona concurrunt, sequum ac si essent in diversis. </em>He had no day in court by the proceeding; and, though he was ruled in, to exercise a supposed right of election, he disclaimed it. The partition, therefore, stands clear of collision with his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">If, then, he originally entered as a tenant in common, but held the contested part in severalty, he may have held it adversely. There was evidence that he entered as early as 1794, and occupied it in severalty as a man would occupy his own. There was no positive evidence of ouster before 1818, when he procured a warrant for it in his own right; but might not an ouster be presumed from lapse of time? In Fisher <em>v. </em>Prosser, <em>Cowp. </em>318, it was presumed, betwixt tenants in common, from uninterrupted possession without counter claim for thirty-six years; but, in Frederick <em>v. </em>Gray, 10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>187, the time was reduced to the naked period of the statute of limitation. Now John began to occupy in 1794, or before it; the partitioii was consummated in 1818; and if he had then gained a separate title by the statute, the land sought to be charged had ceased to be a part of the intestate\u2019s estate; and, not being a part of what was decreed to the cognizor, was not bound by her recognizance. The rule laid down in Frederick v. Gray is, that the statute bars the right of a co-tenant out of actual possession, where his fellow has exclusively claimed the whole for twenty-one years; but by exclusive claim is not to be understood a formal denial of the other\u2019s right; on the contrary, it was deemed sufficient that the occupant had manifested, by her acts, that she considered herself owner of the whole. Can it be doubted that John had so considered himself? There certainly was evidence that he had separately farmed his part according to a line of division betwixt it and the rest of the tract. Too much stress it would; therefore, seem was laid on the want of a positive denial of the title; and, in this respect, the direction tended to mislead the jury by impressing on them a belief that it was indispensable. The difference betwixt the English rule and ours, regards the period, not the circumstances or quality, of the enjoyment: and, though Lord Mansfield admitted, in Fisher <em>v. </em>Prosser, that refusal to pay is not enough without denial of title where profits have been demanded, yet he said that, where none had been demanded, or payment of rents has not been made, or where there has been no claim by the outstanding tenant, and no actual acknowledgment of his title, it is sufficient for a jury to presume,, not indeed a forcible dispossession by the shoulders, but what is nevertheless an actual ouster. The circumstances of the enjoyment, in our case, very much resemble those in Frederick <em>v. </em>Gray, where the heir at law, as well as the tenant herself, had considered her the owner. There seems to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>been an entire acquiescence in John\u2019s possession by the rest of the children; and Sarah Allison testified, that \u201cit was hard to say whether he claimed a separate right or not, that he was sometimes peaceable about parts of the fields and sometimes otherwise.\u201d That looks very much like an assertion of exclusive right. But it is decisive that, from the exception of John\u2019s possession, he took the profits without participation and without objection. Sarah indeed testified, that \u201cAndrew fanned fields which they (John\u2019s children) <em>noio </em>claim on that side of the place;\u201d but she further said, \u201cthey have now got the whole place but the lot I live on.\u201d. The question, however, regards not subsequent encroachments, but what John had held exclusively; and there was not a spark of evidence that his brothers or sisters had claimed a right to farm the ground on his side of the line except at sufferance; so that a legal presumption of ouster having arisen from a peaceable and an exclusive perception of the profits, it lay upon the plaintiff to rebut it.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In affirmance of another of the plaintiff\u2019s points, it was also delivered to the jury, that John was a tenant in common with the others, unless a legal transfer of title was made to him by his father; that under such circumstances, the possession is not presumable to have been adverse; and that lapse of time would not vest an exclusive right in him. His possession, however, may have been adverse, though he were legally seized only in common; and according to Fisher <em>v. </em>Prosser, and Frederick <em>v. </em>Gray, it might be presumed so from a peaceable and exclusive perception of the profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The jury were further instructed in affirmance of another point, that an ejectment brought by Margaret against John in ISIS, as soon as the shares of the other children had been decreed to her, prevented the running of the statute from that time; and that the recital in the deed lo Eby in 1807, in which John had joined, with other proofs in the cause, repelled any presumption of adverse holding at the date of it. The point was partly irrelevant; for the character of the possession at the institution of the ejectment, had ceased to be material betwixt the parties to the recognizance. If the title to John\u2019s part was already dissevered by the statute from the title, to the rest of the intestate\u2019s estate, a simple admission of it, as still abiding in those who had been his co-tenants, would not restore it; but if it was not thus dissevered, it passed to Margaret by the confirmation of her election to take the estate at the valuation, and was bound by the recognizance, against which time ran in no shape, but to raise a presumption of payment when the period should arrive. Against Margaret, indeed, the statute might have run to maturity, had it not reached it before; but the land would continue bound by her recognizance without regard to the persons in whose hands the several parts of it might be, or the character of their possession of it as against each other. But this part of the direction, touching as it did an immaterial question, could no further prejudice the defendants, than by confounding the jury and concealing the true point on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>which the cause turned; yet even- that may have done them a substantial injury; and the same may be said of the prayer for direction, that during the pendency of her ejectment, Margaret might disclaim an interest under the decree of the orphans\u2019 court: the drift of which is unintelligible. But the repellant properties ascribed to the recital in the deed to Eby, operating, as they did, if at all, before the decree of confirmation, and before the statute could have run its course, were of decisive importance. The fact recited is no more than \u201c that Thomas, the father, died seized and possessed of a tract of land in the township, county and slate aforesaid, bounded by lands now of David Eby, Gilson Craighead, the Yellow Breeches creek and others:\u201d whence an inference of seisin by the father at the time of his death\u2014a fact entirely consistent with a subsequent ad verse, possession of a part of it by one of his sons. The time of his death is not stated .by any of the witnesses; but it is said in the petition for an inquest, to have been subsequent to 1794. Still it follows not that John\u2019s possession had not become adverse in time to complete the statutory bar at the confirmation in ISIS. But the recital fails to indicate precisely whether the father died seized of the whole, or only of Andrew\u2019s part, from which was taken the parcel included in Eby\u2019s conveyance. It may be asked why did John join in the conveyance, if the recital regarded only the latter? It may have been to confirm the title, and quiet a doubt entertained by the purchaser; or it may have been for any one of a thousand reasons which can not now be imagined. These recitals, though certainly competent evidence of the fact, yet being usually the work of the scrivener, as was remarked in Good <em>v. </em>Good, are entitled to less respect than oral confessions, which are particularly present to the mind of the party at the time. So far are they from being conclusive, that they are entitled to as little respect by a jury in regard to every thing else, as they were declared in Geddis <em>v. </em>Hawke, 1 <em>Watts </em>287, to be entitled in regard to payment of purchase-money.
