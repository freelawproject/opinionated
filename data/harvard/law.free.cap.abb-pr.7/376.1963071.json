Patterson against Elisha Bloomer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-10\">After an injunction had been issued in this case, and the usual undertaking given (which the plaintiff did not sign), he discontinued. A reference was thereupon ordered to compute the defendant\u2019s damages; The plaintiff had notice of and opposed the application, and also appeared on the reference, but filed no exceptions to the report. A motion for a \u201c final adjudication,\u201d and for a confirmation of the report, was made, which was granted, and an order made June 23, 1868, \u201c that the plaintiff was not, and had not been, entitled to said injunction ; that the defendant\u2019s damages caused thereby amounted to two thousand and sixty dollars ; and that he was entitled to recover that sum from the plaintiff and his sureties.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-11\">This order was served on the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys July 1, 1868, and personal notice given him October 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>1868, but no appeal was ever taken therefrom. A suit was subsequently commenced against the sureties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-5\">The defendant now moved, on affidavits showing the above facts, and that service of a certified copy of this order had been made on the plaintiff, and a demand made by a person having written authority from the defendant, for an order that the plaintiff pay, or be punished as for a contempt.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-6\"><em>George W. </em>Wingate, for the defendant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5v\">I. Tire plaintiff cannot go behind the order of June 23, 1868, which adjudicates the defendant\u2019s damages, and his right to recover them from him. (1.) Having had full notice of that order, and of all prior proceedings, his failure to appeal made it conclusive. (2.) The method of correcting error is by appeal, not by disobedience (People <em>v. </em>Sturtevant, 9 <em>N. Y. </em>[5 <em>Seld.], </em>266.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-7\">II. The order was regular. (1.) The discontinuance by the plaintiff involved the concession that the injunction could not be maintained, and that the plaintiff was not entitled to it (Pacific Mail Steamship Co. v. Leuling, 7 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S., </em>37, 40; Taaks <em>v. </em>Schmidt, 19 <em>How. </em>Pr., 414 ; Crockett <em>v. </em>Smith, 14 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>62; Mutual Safety Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Roberts, 4 <em>Sandf. Ch., </em>592 ; Coates <em>v. </em>Coates, 1 <em>Duer, </em>664 ; Carpenter <em>v. </em>Wright, 4 <em>Bosw., </em>655 ; Cumberland Coal &amp; Iron Co. <em>v. </em>Hoffman Steam Co., 39 <em>Barb., </em>16 ; S. C., 15 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>78). (2.) The fact that plaintiff did not sign the undertaking was immaterial. It is not the practice for a plaintiff to sign undertakings on injunction (Askins <em>v. </em>Hearn, 3 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>188; Leffingwell <em>v. </em>Chave, 10 <em>Id., </em>475, 476 ; Republic of Mexico <em>v. </em>De Arangoiz, 5 <em>Duer, </em>640). The reference is provided by the Code, irrespective of the terms of the undertaking <em>{Code, </em>\u00a7 22). The plaintiff is liable as a wrong-doer in any event, and a bond having been given \u201c <em>on his part </em>\u201d <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 222), prescribing a particular method of computing the damages, he cannot object thereto (Askins <em>v. </em>Hearn, 3 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>188). \u00a1 (3.) The direction to pay was proper. Although, as against the sureties, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>new aciion should, perhaps, be brought, yet the liability of the plain (iff having been fully adjudicated, no fui ther proceedings were necessary, or should be required. The Code contemplates that these damages should be fixed and paid in a summary proceeding in the original action, making a distinction between these \u25a0 and other cases of damages on undertakings (Compare <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 222, with <em>Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 182, 209, 230, 334).</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-5\">III. The court has jurisdiction to enforce the order 'by proceedings for contempt (3 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>849, <em>et seq.</em>, 1 <em>Crary on Special Pro., </em>172, <em>et seq.).</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-6\"><em>Dudley </em>Field, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8S\">I. The plaintiff, not having signed the undertaking, is not liable for these damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-7\">II. The order of reference was irregular.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-8\">III. The court has no jurisdiction to proceed as for a contempt.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-12\"> Proceedings to enforce this as a judgment against the plaintiff were \u25a0 dismissed. See Patterson <em>v. </em>Bloomer, 6 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S., </em>446.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b390-9\">Ingraham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-J\">The court may order the plaintiff to pay the damages assessed, and, if he refuses, may enforce the payment thereof by attachment. The report having been confirmed, in a proceeding to which the plaintiff was a party, and no appeal having been taken by him, the same is conclusive upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">The defendant may have an order directing the payment of the money within thirty days after service oi notice of this order, or, in default, that an attachment issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
