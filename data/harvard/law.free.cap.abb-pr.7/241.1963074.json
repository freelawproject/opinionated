Beach. The facts in the case fully appear from the following opinion of George B. Bradley, Esq., of Corning, Referee, to whom the case was referred for trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-8\">Bradley, Referee.\u2014On the 25th day of February, 1868, the summons in this action was delivered to the .sheriff of Livingston county in good faith, to be served -on the defendant, who then resided and yet resides in \u00a1that county, and on the 9th day of March following, that \u2018sheriff made service of the summons on the defendant. \"The action was brought to- recover on a promissory note made by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2014bearing date March 9, 1865, for $177.71,\u2014payable 1st November then next-, with interest. The amount due on the 5th day of .March, 1868, did not exceed $215.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-9\">Ou the 5th day of March, 1888 (four.' days before the service of the summons, and while the same was in the .sheriff\u2019s hands for service), the defendant caused to be tendered to the plaintiff $215.00, in payment of the note, and the latter refused to accept the amount,\u2014asserting as a reason, that costs had been incurred, which should also be paid by the defendant. The currency tendered was left in the hands of one Merrick, of whom the plaintiff was advised he could at any time receive the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-10\">The plaintiff proceeded with his action, and the defendant afterwards served on the plaintiff, who received the same, an answer alleging the tender and refusal, concluding with the allegations \u201c that the defendant now brings the said sum of two hundred and fifteen dollars into this \u00a1court ready to be paid to the plaintiff, if he will accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the same.\u201d But the defendant did not insert in his answer or serve with it a notice that the money had been paid into court; and in fact the money had not been paid into court. But on the trial the identical money tendered, having been preserved, was produced, and the plaintiff not accepting or taking the same, it was left in charge of the referee for the purposes of the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-5\">The plaintiff now insists\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-6\">1. That the delivery of the summons to the sheriff for service was a commencement of the action so as to require the payment by the defendant of costs, and being advised before and at the time of the tender, that such steps had been taken, he could not and did not relieve himself from liability by tendering merely the amount due on the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-7\">2. That the tender was not, nor was the answer thereof effeytual, for the reason that the defendant did not pay the money into court and give notice thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-8\">The right of the plaintiff to costs at the time of the tender, depends upon the fact whether the action had been commenced and was then pending. If it was, the tender was insufficient; as the defendant, in that case, could not defeat that right, or afford himself a defense by tendering merely the amount due on the note. If the action had not been commenced and was not pending, the plaintiff had no right to insist on the payment of costs as a condition, for the right to costs depends entirely upon the statute which gives to a party costs <em>in </em>actions, while at common law no costs were given (3 Denio, 174).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-9\">Tim manner of commencing actions and right to costs in them, are now prescribed by the Code, by which the question must be controlled and settled. That provides that \u201ccivil actions in courts of record of this State, shall be commenced by the service of a summons\u201d (\u00a7 127). And unless this section was qualified and limited by some other provision of the statute, it would seem that service was necessary to produce the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>mencement or pending of the action. Until the action is commenced, there is no action, for the production of costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-5\">Attention has \"been called to section 99, which provides that \u201cAn, attempt to commence an action is deemed equivalent to the commencement thereof, within the meaning of this title, when the summons is delivered with the intent that it shall be actually served to the sheriff,\u201d &amp;c. By reference to the title referred to (title II.), it is found to be entitled: \u201cTime of commencing actions,\u201d and relates entirely to the subject of the time within which actions must be commenced, to defeat the defense commonly known of the statute of limitations. It is therefore quite apparent that the attempt referred to in section 99, is not to be deemed the commencement of an action for general purposes, but only for the purpose of defeating the operation of the statute of limitations, which has no application to this case. And the courts seem to so understand it (Wiggin <em>v. </em>Orser, 5 Duer, 118 ; Hull <em>V. </em>Peters, 7 <em>Barb., </em>331 ; Farmer\u2019s Loan &amp; Trust Co. <em>v. </em>Dickson, 17 <em>How. Pr., </em>478 ; Kerr y. Mount, 28 IF <em>Y., </em>664).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-6\">At common law, the delivering of the <em>capias </em>to the sheriff or officer to serve was (3 <em>Johns. Cas., </em>145), for all purposes the commencement of the suit. But by the Revised Statutes, service was necessary to produce the com-' mencement of an action (2 <em>Rev. </em>Stai., 347, \u00a71) ; except for the purpose of saving the subject of the action from the operation of the statute of limitations, in which case the delivery of the process in good faith to the sheriff, with intent to be actually served, was deemed the commencement an action (2 <em>Rev. 8tat., </em>299, \u00a7 38). And the defendant was at liberty to defeat that effect of the attempt, by showing a want of such good faith and intent (\u00a7 39 ; Madison Bank y. Keller, 2 <em>Hill, </em>117; Jacks on y. Brooks, 14 <em>Wend., </em>650).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-7\">That no action was commenced for general purposes by any attempt short of actual service, under the Revised Statutes, is well supported by authority (Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number><em>v. </em>Comstock, 6 <em>Hill, </em>10 ; Edmondstone <em>v. </em>Thomson, 15 <em>Wend., </em>554 ; Hull ?&gt;. Peters, 7 <em>Barb., </em>331).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">There seems to \"be some authority to support the position that after a plaintiff has retained an attorney who is proceeding to institute an action, and has taken some proceedings for that purpose, a tender of the amount of the debt by the defendant, will not be effectual unless he tenders or offers to pay the costs incurred in the proceedings to commence the action. This was held in Retan <em>v. </em>Drew (19 Wend., 304); and the latter case was cited with apparent approval, in Brown y. Ferguson (2 <em>Denio, </em>196), and Johnson y. Comstock <em>{6 Hitt, </em>10), although the question did not necessarily arise in the two latter cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-6\">It is quite difficult to appreciate the principles upon which the decision in that respect, in Retan y. Drew, was based; It might be well to make such a rule, founded upon moral equity, as it would be just in many cases. It certainly would be so in this one ; and I should cheerfully follow the case last cited in reaching a conclusion, if the court at general term of the district in which this action is brought, and is pending, had not distinctly decided adversely to the decision in that respect in Retan y. Drew. In Hull y. Peters <em>(supra), </em>the court in that district has distinctly held that a tender of the debt merely, before suit actually commenced, bars the recovery ; and that any previous attempt short of a complete institution of the action does not require of the defendant the tender or payment of any costs. It is true, in that case the defendant was not advised that any proceedings with view to commencement of any action had been had. But it seems to me that the court, in the case of Hull y. Peters, have decided the question, and made the right to costs depend upon the existence of an action at the time of the tender. If the court do not so design to be understood, they should have the opportunity of relieving of the charge of disrespect one who might declare the rule adverse to such understanding of the decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The closing portion of the opinion of the court seems to be independent of the previous portion, and furnishes a distinct ground upon which the decision might be placed, but the court seems to be committed to the former; and I feel bound to follow it in this case, and to deem the case of Retan <em>v. </em>Drew overruled for the purpose in that district. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-4\">The question now arises,\u2014Has the defendant done all that was necessary to render his tender effectual as a defense, and is his answer sufficient ? In case of a tender at common law before suit, like the one in question, it undoubtedly is necessary, for the purpose of pleading it, for the defendant, when sued, to pay the money into court, and give notice at the time of serving his answer (Brown <em>v. </em>Ferguson, 2 <em>Denio, </em>196 ; Eddy <em>v. </em>O\u2019Hara, 14 <em>Wend., </em>221 ; Wilder <em>v. </em>Seelye, 8 <em>Barb., </em>411 ; Kortright <em>v. </em>Cady, 21 <em>N. Y., </em>354).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-5\">This the defendant did not do. He did not pay the money into court, nor did he serve with his answer the requisite notice to that effect. But the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, notwithstanding this omission, received and retained the answer. This was a waiver of this defect in the defendant\u2019s proceedings (Sheriden <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 <em>Hill, </em>538 ; 1 <em>Burr. Pr., </em>408).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\">In the case last cited, the court say,\u2014\u201c Whether the money was paid into court does not seem to be involved in the issue, and it was not therefore a question to be litigated on the trial. The sole question there was upon the fact of tender or not. The effect of not paying the money into court on a plea of tender, is a point of practice, to be dealt with summarily, like all questions of that kind. The omission to pay in the money was but an irregularity which the plaintiff waived by accepting a plea and taking issue upon it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-7\">The plaintiff undoubtedly had the right to treat the answer as a nullity and return it, and enter his judgment for want of an answer when sufficient time after Service of the summons elapsed, on account of such omission (Simpson e. French, 25 <em>How. Pr., </em>464 ; Wilder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>v. </em>Seelye, 8 <em>Bari., </em>412 ; Sheriden <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 Hill, 540; 1 <em>Burr. Pr., </em>407; <em>Bao. Air., </em>tit. Tender)..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">It seems, therefore, that the payment into court and notice thereof with answer, is no part of the act of tender, but are proceedings in practice, merely essential to make the tender effectual as a defense ; and consequently may be waived by the plaintiff, as any other omission or irregularity in practice may.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">But I apprehend that production of the money in court at the time of the trial is essential to complete the proof of tender and readiness on the part of the defendant (Roosevelt <em>r. </em>Bull\u2019s Head Bank, 45 <em>Bari., </em>584 ; Brooklyn Bank <em>v. </em>De G-rauw, 23 <em>Wend., </em>342 ; <em>Bao. Air., </em>tit. Tender, I.).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">The defendant, it seems to me, did'not fail in this respect. The identical money was produced upon the trial before the referee, and is preserved under his direction for purposes which may be advised by the disposition of the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-8\">In view of the positions taken above, the conclusion follows that the defendant has established his defense of tender.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-9\">I do not apprehend that any order was necessary to be made for the payment of the money into court. The cases to which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel has referred on that subject, have relation to payment into court after suit has been commenced. That is the right of a party sued, which has existed and been practised ever since the reign of Charles II. of England. No tender is in such case made, nor is the payment into court the subject of pleading ; but it can be done only pursuant to a rule entered, which is entered as of course if before plea, and upon order of a judge if after plea, notice of the payment to be given to the plaintiff; and such payment into court operates as a discharge to that extent of the claims alleged in complaint. The declaration to that extent is deemed stricken out (1 <em>Wend., </em>103 ; 1 <em>Burr. Pr., </em>408).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-10\">Then there is a tender after commencement of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>provided for Tby statute, which differs in some respects and effect from a tender at common law before action commenced. The tender pursuant to statute is not the subject of pleading ; nor does it bar a recovery of damages, unless accepted\u2014but defeats the recovery of costs and interest, if sufficient in amount (13 <em>Wend., </em>390).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-5\">I have referred to these two classes- of tenders, and to the subject of payment into court, pursuant to \u201ccommon rule \u201d so called, so that the cases relating to them may not be confounded in their application to the question in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">If I am right in my conclusions, .the defendant must be entitled to recover his costs, and the, plaintiff is entitled to the money tendered, which is subject to his order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-7\">Judgment having been entered upon the conclusions of the referee in conformity with this opinion, the plaintiff appealed to the supreme court at general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A5j\"><em>B.

The plaintiff proceeded in his action ; and the defendant pleaded tender made on the 5th March, before action commenced, and that he had ever since remained and still is ready and willing to pay to the plaintiff said sum, but plaintiff has hitherto refused to receive the same; that he now brings the said sum of $215, into this court, ready to be paid to the plaintiff, if he will accept the same. The answer was retained by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and the issues were referred to a referee for trial. The money tendered was not actually paid into court, nor was any notice of payment into court given to the plaintiff or his attorney. The identical money tendered was produced at the trial, and placed in charge of the referee ; and it had been at all times prior to the trial held in readiness for the plaintiff, as he was advised at the time of the tender it would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The referee decided that the defendant was. entitled to recover his costs in the action, and the plaintiff to receive the money tendered. Exceptions were filed by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The referee has given to the questions raised a very full examination, as is evidenced by his able and elaborate opinion to which I have nothing to add; and we adopt it as the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The referee followed in his decision Hull <em>v. </em>Peters (7 <em>Barb., </em>331), decided in this district in 1849, Sill, J., delivering the opinion of the court, in which Retan <em>v. </em>Drew (19 <em>Wend., </em>304), was declared to be a departure from settled principles, and not sustained by authority. Justice Sill referred to White <em>v. </em>Smith 4 <em>Hill, </em>166 ; S. C., 7 <em>Id., </em>520), in which the court for the correction of errors decided (reversing the supreme court), that a plaintiff may discontinue Ms action without paying costs at any time before he has notice of the appearance of ' the defendant, though the defendant may have retained an attorney to defend the action. This decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>subsequent to the decision of the supreme court in Re tan \u00bb. Drew, and Justice Sill was of the opinion that the principle established by it was applicable to the case he was considering, and should govern it. In that case I dissented, from an unwillingness to overrule Retan <em>v. </em>Drew. The case is an authority in point upon the question of the liability of the defendant to pay costs ; and the referee very properly followed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Asito the necessity of averring, with the plea of tender, the payment of the money into court, and paying it in, and giving notice, the general rule undoubtedly is as the plaintiff\u2019s counsel claims; but it seems, from the authorities' cited by the referee in his opinion, that the omission to pay the money into court, and to give notice, is not fatal to the rights of the defendant, in case the plaintiff\u2019s attorney retains the answer and goes to trial upon the issue of tender. The omission by the defendant to pay into court and give notice, is an irregularity, which is waived by the plaintiff by receiving and retaining the answer and going to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In the present case the tender was kept good, and the money tendered was produced on the trial, and delivered to the referee. It had been kept in readiness for the plaintiff from the time of the tender. I think the referee made the proper disposition of the case, and, adopting his opinion, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Barker and Lamout, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
