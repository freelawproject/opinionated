In the same case it was further held that murder in the second degree under that statute consisted in the killing of a human being without a design to effect death, by a person engaged in the commission of a felony, other than that of arson in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">It is insisted by the counsel for the plaintiff in error that the accused cannot be convicted of murder in the second degree, unless the indictment charges that the death was effected while the accused was engaged in the commission of a felony as specified in the statute, and that the absence of such an averment in the present indictment is fatal to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The counsel relies upon the case of Dedieu v. People (22 N. <em>Y., </em>178) as sustaining this position. In that case it was held that the accused, upon an indictment for arson in the first degree, charging him with having in the night time feloniously, &amp;c., set fire to the dwelling house of another, there being at the time some human being therein, was improperly convicted of arson in the third degree, upon proof of his feloniously having set fire to goods contained in such house with' intent to defraud an insurance company which had issued a policy upon such goods, the building not having been at all ignited.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In that case the question arose upon exceptions taken by the defendant to the evidence, and also to the charge. The case was decided correctly. The act constituting the crime of which the defendant was convicted was not the same act for which he was indicted, nor was the intent charged the same. He was indicted for having set fire to a dwelling house with intent to burn the same. He had not set fire to the house at all. The proof was-that he had set fire to certain goods contained in the house, with intent to destroy such goods, to defraud the insurance company. The act and the intent, so far from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\"being inclentical, were plainly separate and distinct, and upon this ground the case was decided. Had there been no bill of exceptions in the case, and had the record merely shown that the jury had rendered a verdict against the defendant, convicting him of arson in the third degree, upon which judgment had been rendered, the case would have been analogous to the present. It would not then have appeared that the defendant had been convicted upon proof of an act different from that for which he had indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">It was sought by the counsel for the people to sustain the conviction in Dedieu <em>v. </em>People, upon the statute (2 <em>Rev. </em>Stat., 702, \u00a7 27).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">That section provides that <em>\u201c </em>upon an indictment for any offense consisting of different degrees, as prescribed in this chapter, the jury may find the accused not guilty of the offense in the degree charged in the indictment, and may find such accused person guilty of any degree of such offense, inferior to that charged in the indictment, or of an attempt to commit such offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The court held that the statute did not apply to the facts of that case, for the reasons above stated. In addition to such reasons, others were assigned, in some of which, to their full extent, I cannot concur, as I think their application would render the statute practically nugatory. As an illustration, it is said in substance that the statute applies to cases only where the indictment for the higher offense includes all the averments necessary to constitute the lesser, with the addition thereto of certain facts essential to the higher, and the latter are unproved,\u2014then only that the defendant may by virtue of the statute be rightly convicted of the lesser offense. If this is the only effect of the statute, it is merely declaratory of the common law, as is shown in the opinion in the case itself, in regard to a conviction for a murder upon an indictment for petit treason. The language of the statute clearly admits of a more extended application, and I apprehend that such was the intention in its enactment. Various criminal acts were made, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>chapter in question, offenses of the same general name, hut differing in degree and in the punishment to be inflicted, by the circumstances under and the intent with which they were committed, such as forgery, arson, burglary, &amp;c. I think the true construction of the statute is, that where the act for which the accused is indicted is the same act for which he is convicted, the conviction of a lower degree is proper, although the indictment contains averments constituting the offense of the highest degree of the species of crime, and omits to state the particular intent and circumstances characterizing a lower degree of the same crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">If this be the true construction, it follows that under an indictment for murder in the' first degree the accused may be convicted of any degree of murder or manslaughter for the unlawful killing of the identical person charged, by the identical means charged in the indictment. This would not include a case where the person killed was not the same as charged in the indictment, nor where the means of effecting the death were materially variant from those the indictment charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Under this construction, where the indictment charges-the murder in the first degree, the accused could not be-convicted of manslaughter in the third degree, by proving that the death had been effected by a mischievous animal, of which the defendant was owner, and which he had willfully suffered to go at large, &amp;c., for the reason that the criminal act charged, would be different irom that-offered in evidence ; but this point could only be presented for review upon exceptions taken to the evidence or to the charge to the jury. Then upon an indictment for murder in the first degree, a judgment convicting the defendant of manslaughter in the third degree must be sustained, in the absence of any exception showing that evidence had been erroneously admitted, or some error committed in the charge. In the absence of any such exception the record would fail to show that the accused had been convicted of any other act than that charged, or that there was any material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>variance in the means employed from those charged in the indictment, hut would show that the intent of the accused in effecting the death, and the attendant circumstances, were different from those charged, which difference constituted the offense of manslaughter in the third degree, instead of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In the present case the record shows that the person killed, and the means of effecting the death of which the defendant was convicted, were identical with the charge contained in the indictment; but that the killing was without a design to effect death, and therefore not murder in the first degree, hut was done while the defendant was engaged in the commission of a felony other than arson in the first degree, and, therefore, under the ^statute of 1862, murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">It is a general rule in criminal pleading that when \u2019the act done is criminal only when done under a particular state of facts or circumstances, the existence of such 'facts and circumstances must he averred in the indictment. But the section of the statute under consideration has, in effect, provided that when the indictment is for a crime consisting of different degrees, depending upon 'the intention of the accused, and the circumstances under which the act was committed, and the indictment charges such act to have been committed with the intent .and under the circumstances constituting the highest degree of the crime, the. defendant may he convicted of any lower <em>degree; </em>and, consequently, when there is a \u25a0failure of proof of any fact essential to a conviction of the higher degree, proof may he given of facts constituting a lower degree of the same crime, although the latter facts .are not charged in the indictment; and the defendant may, upon such proof, he rightly convicted of the lower ! degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In the present case the presumption from the record' is, that the prosecution proved the killing of John Abrahams by. the .accused, by the means charged in the indictment, but failed to prove that the act was done with a premeditated design to effect his death, hut proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>that it was done while the accused was engaged in the perpetration of a felony. He was, therefore, rightly convicted, if the evidence of the latter fact was admissible under the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">We have seen that the statute authorizing a conviction of a lower degree of the same crime, upon an indictment for a higher degree, makes the evidence authorizing such conviction competent, otherwise the statute would be inoperative. I the more readily accept this construction, as I cannot see that the accused can be prejudiced thereby. He is informed by the indictment of the particular crime charged, and of the means used in its perpetration, and that it was committed with the intent, and under the circumstances, constituting the highest degree of that crime. He, therefore, comes to his trial, prepared to show, if he can, not only that he is not guilty of the particular degree charged, as well as that he is not guilty of any lower degree of the same crime. If acquitted upon the indictment, or convicted in any lower degree than that charged, he will find no obstacle in pleading his acquittal or conviction in bar to any subsequent indictment for the same crime. It exposes him to no danger of a conviction of the crime in any degree not warranted by the evidence. This he may readily guard against by calling attention to it in the charge to the jury ; and in case any error is committed by the judge in this respect, he can correct such error, upon review, by taking the proper exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">My conclusion is that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">All, the judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
