' An injunction was therefore prayed for, enjoining, &amp;c., defendants from selling, &amp;c., the plaintiff\u2019s lots, and it was prayed that the said assessment be cancelled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-5\">The defendants demurred to the complaint on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the action, and that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b23-13\"> As to what is the proper ground of demurrer in such case, see Wilson <em>a. </em>The Mayor, &lt;Stc., of New York, 1 <em>Ante, </em>1; and 6 <em>lb., </em>6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b24-6\">Clerks, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al\">\u2014A court of equity will not assume jurisdiction to review the proceedings of a municipal corporation in prosecuting a local improvement, or in assessing or collecting the means to complete it, if there exists no other reason, for its interposition than the alleged invalidity of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">The common-law writ of <em>certiorari </em>is the appropriate remedy in cases of this nature; and it is no reason for granting the remedy prayed for in this, action, that the defects, of which the plaintiff complains, in the defendants\u2019 proceedings, do not appear upon the record; that they can only be substantiated by extrinsic proof; and therefore that the objection could not be raised on a certiorari.
