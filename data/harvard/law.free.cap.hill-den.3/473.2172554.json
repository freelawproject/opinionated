Delafield perfected his judgment in this court, and issued and levied his <em>fi. fa. </em>against Sandford, who, after the lapse of three months, sued out a writ of error to the court for the correction of errors, obtained the order in question, and served it on the sheriff. The latter thereupon declined to proceed to a sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number><em>Edwards </em>said, the writ should have been sued out within four days after judgment perfected. At any rate, it was too late to obtain the order after levy made. <em>(Grab. </em>Practice, 2d ed. 354,355, 953 ; 7 <em>Cowen, </em>418; 9 <em>Wend. </em>224; 21 <em>id. </em>287.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-5\"><em>A.

(2 <em>R. S. </em>494, 5, 2d. <em>ed. </em>\u00a7 29, 30.) The provision in the last section is, that if an execution shall have been issued and <em>not fully executed, </em>the service of the order shall stay, &amp;c. It is supposed that the levy is a full execution within the meaning of the statute. Not so. To complete the execution, there must be a sale at least. There is no cause, therefore, either for setting aside the order or directing the sheriff to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
