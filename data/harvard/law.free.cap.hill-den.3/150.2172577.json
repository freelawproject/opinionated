The summons was issued on the 2d of January, 1838. After issue joined and a trial had before the justice, judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs for $42,50. The defendant appealed to the common pleas, and on the trial in that court the following facts appeared. On the 9th of November, 1837, the defendant, without having obtained a tavern license, posted a sign in front of his house, on which was painted in large letters \u201c <em>Samuel Warner\u2019s Inn.\u201d </em>A day or two after-wards a piece of pasteboard was affixed to the post a few feet below the other sign, inscribed in capital letters, <em>\u201c Temperance.\u201d </em>These remained a few days, when the defendant substituted the word &lt;\u00a3 <em>Entertainment\u201d </em>in the place of\u00a3\u00a3 <em>Inn.\u201d </em>The signs continued thus till the commencement of the suit. There were large barns and sheds contiguous to the defendant\u2019s house, and people were in the habit of calling there for refreshment, for which they were charged the prices usually taken at country taverns. The defendant contended that the plaintiffs could only recover at the rate of $1,25 per day from the 9th of November to the period when the word \u00a3\u00a3 Entertainment\u201d was substituted for \u00a3\u00a3 <em>Inn\u2022\u2019\u2019 </em>and the plaintiffs insisted that they were entitled to a verdict for the penalty for each day intermediate the erection of the first sign and the commencement of the suit before the justice. The court below decided that the word \u00a3\u00a3 Entertainment\u201d did not indicate that the defendant kept a tavern; to which decision the plaintiffs excepted.

The penalty for which this action was brought is given by 1 <em>R. S. </em>679, \u00a7 10, and it will be seen that only the word tavern,\u2014not <em>inn </em>or <em>tavern </em>\u2014is used in that section. To bring the case within the statute, therefore, the sign erected by the defendant must be shown to have indicated, not merely that he kept an inn, but a <em>tavern. </em>That the words are not synonymous, see <em>Bailey's </em>Dictionary, where <em>u Inn\" </em>is defined to be \u201c a public house for the entertainment of travellers,\u201d and <em>u </em>Tavern\u2014a house where wine is sold.\u201d The definitions given by <em>Johnson </em>are nearly in the same words. It has been laid down that, \u201c every inn is not an alehouse, nor every alehouse an <em>inn; </em>but if an inn uses common selling of ale, it is then also an alehouse ; and if an alehouse lodges and entertains travellers, it is also an inn.\u201d <em>(2 Toml. Law. Dict. tit. </em>\u201c <em>Inns </em>&amp; <em>Innkeepers.\") </em>We contend therefore, that no house can with propriety be called a <em>tavern. </em>except it be one where liquors are sold $ and although the word \u201c <em>Inn\" </em>may indicate such a house, yet, as in this case the word <em>11 Temperance\" </em>was also affixed to the sign post, it is certain that no one could mistake the building for a <em>tavern. </em>This is clear when we take into consideration the fact that, for years past, temperance, in its ordinary acceptation, has been understood to mean entire abstinence from the use of all intoxicating drinks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-5\">It may be urged that in other sections of the statute, the words <em>inn </em>and <em>tavern </em>are used synonymously ; but we submit, that, as the statute has not defined these terms, they are to be construed according to their respective significations in approved lexicons. Again : as both words are used in the statute, it is to be presumed they were employed in different senses; for if <em>inn </em>and <em>tavern </em>mean the same thing, only one of them would be necessary, and the use of the other superfluous. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-6\">If there be any doubt in the case, the legal intendment should be in favor of the defendant; inasmuch as the prosecution is-under a, penal statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Hand, in reply. The fact that the sign was in front of a house where the public were entertained, contiguous to which were large barns and sheds, was enough to induce travellers to suppose that the building was a tavern\u2014a place where guests were accommodated and liquors furnished. The word <em>entertainment </em>is no less significant than tavern, and is as commonly used to denote a place where liquors are sold. <em>Entertainment </em>is defined by Webster, \u201c 1. The receiving and accommodating of guests, either with or without reward; 2. Provisions of the table; hence also, a <em>feast; </em>a superb dinner or supper.\u201d And in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>(2 <em>Barn, Aid. </em>283, 286,) Bayley, J. speaks of a tavern keeper as one who furnishes a table, &amp;c. According to this view, the defendant adopted the very term which of all others, except the word <em>tavern </em>itself, indicated that he kept a house where liquors were sold. The word \u201c Temperance\u201d did not change the character of the sign any more than if <em>Tavern </em>instead of \u201c Entertainment\u201d had been substituted for <em>\u201c Inn.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-5\">But the opposite counsel seems to concede that the word \u201c <em>Entertainment\u201d </em>on the sign sufficiently indicated that the defendant kept an <em>inn, </em>though not a <em>tavern; </em>and lexicons have been resorted to in support of the latter distinction. We submit however, that <em>inn </em>and <em>tavern </em>are synonymous ; and in this we are sustained by the etymology of the words. <em>Webster </em>defines a tavern thus : \u201c Tavern, [Fr. <em>taverne ; </em>W. <em>tavarn ; L. taberna.] </em>A house licensed to sell liquors in small quantities, to be drank on the spot. In some of the United States, <em>tavern </em>is synonymous with <em>inn </em>or <em>hotel, </em>and denotes a house for the entertainment of travellers, as well as for the sale of liquors, licensed for that purpose.\u201d <em>Taverne </em>and <em>tavarn </em>are no doubt derived from the latin word taberna, the general meaning of which is, \u201c any house made of boards,\u201d See.; but, according to Ainsworth, i&lt; may be translated <em>11 a tavern </em>or <em>inn.\u201d </em>Though the word <em>tavern </em>may have been restricted in its meaning in early times, it is certainly not so now ; nor was there ever any war rant for such restriction in the derivation of the word. True <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>it was said in <em>Calye\u2019s </em>case, (8 <em>Rep. </em>63,4,) that \u201c the latin word for an <em>inn, </em>is <em>diversorium </em>but that means no more than <em>taberna diversoria </em>which, by dropping the last word, is easily anglicised <em>tavern. </em>Again: the words are used in the statute to signify the same thing. Both are sometimes employed in connection j but the context will show that, even in such cases, they are used synonymously. Besides, the word <em>tavern </em>is frequently found in the statute where <em>inn </em>should have been used, if the argument of the defendant\u2019s counsel be well found <em>ed; </em>and <em>vice versa. (See </em>1 <em>R. S. </em>678, 9, \u00a7 4, 6\u201410 ; <em>see also id. p. </em>680, 681, \u00a7 12, 17, 18.) It is also submitted, that the use of these terms in courts of law, shows that they are synonymous* <em>Inn </em>is the word generally found in the books j and forms a distinct head or branch of the law. <em>Tavern </em>does not. In the English books the general division is into <em>inns </em>and alehouses, and it is possible that the definition of the former was once quite limited; <em>(See Calye\u2019s </em>case, 8 <em>Rep. </em>63, <em>and the form of the writ in F. N. B. </em>94 ;) but it is not so now. An <em>inn </em>is \u201c a house where the traveller is furnished with every thing which he has occasion for whilst upon his <em>wray\u201d\u2014(Per </em>Bayley, <em>J. in Thompson </em>v. Lacy, 3 <em>Barn. &amp; Ald. </em>283, 6,)\u2014\u201c a house kept open publicly for the lodging and entertainment of travellers generally, for a reasonable compensation*\u201d <em>(Hilliard\u2019s Elements of the Law, 101 ; 2 Kent\u2019s Com. </em>595.) And in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>a house of public entertainment in London called the \u201cGlobe Tavern &amp; Coffee House,\u201d where beds and provisions were furnished, was considered an <em>inn. </em>Abbot, Ch. J. thought it like an inn in the country ; and the whole case goes to show that the distinction bptween an <em>inn, </em>a <em>coffee-house </em>and <em>tavern, </em>particularly in the country, is practically abolished. Petersdorff says of the keeping of <em>alehouses </em>and <em>inns, </em>that \u201c these occupations have, in modern times, been generally united.\u201d (10 <em>Petersd. Abr., </em>615, <em>note ; </em>1 <em>id. </em>453, <em>note ; And see James </em>v. <em>Osborn, 2 Chit. Rep. </em>484 ; 1 <em>Bl. Com. by Chitty, </em>430, <em>note </em>(19) ; 2 <em>Toml. Law Diet. 201, tit. </em>\u201c <em>Inns and </em>Innkeepers.\u201d) In popular language, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>in this country, <em>inn </em>and <em>tavern </em>are synonymous, whatever may have been the technical meaning of <em>tavern </em>in Dr. Johnson\u2019s day, who probably defined the word with reference to the sense in which it was used in London. Our lexicographers and legislators certainly use the words synonymously <em>; </em>(See <em>Webster\u2019s Diet, and R. S., cited supra </em>; <em>and also </em>1 <em>Laws of </em>1801, <em>Webster\u2019s ed., p. 484 ; </em>1 <em>R. L. of </em>1813, <em>p. </em>176 ;) and probably not one in a thousand of the American people ever supposed there was any difference. In England too it would seem that three centuries ago, if we may judge from the language of the hero of Gadshill, these words were employed quite indiscriminately ; or he would not have said of the place where he used two gallons of sack to one halfpenny-worth of bread :</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-5\">\u201c Shall I not take mine ease in mine <em>inn </em>?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-6\">So even in King James\u2019 time ; as appears by the translation of <em>Acts, ch. 28 v. </em>15\u2014&lt;\u00a3 they (thebrethren) came to meet us as far as Appii Forum, and the <em>Three Taverns.\u201d </em>(Gr. <em>Trion Tabernon ; </em>Lat. of old v\u00e1lgate, <em>Tres Tabernas.) </em>Robinson, in the first edition of his lexicon of the New Testament, says these words mean <em>\u201c </em>the three inns but in his second edition, <em>\u201c </em>the three taverns.\u201d (Tit.\u00a3( <em>Tabernai.\u201d) </em>And see his quotations from <em>Zosimus, </em>and from <em>Cic. Ep. to Att. </em>in his second edition under the same head, by which it would seem they were called\u00a3\u00a3 the three eating houses\u201d and\u00a3\u00a3 three taverns.\u201d See also <em>Rob. Calmet, Art. u Appii Forum,\u201d p. </em>83, where it is <em>said\u2014\u201c </em>So that probably the chief number of Christians waited for Paul at this place as a place of refreshment.\u201d In <em>Kuinoel\u2019s Comm, on The New </em>Testament, the <em>three taverns </em>mentioned in Acts, <em>ch. 28 v. </em>15, are spoken of as a place on the Appian Way at which travellers might turn aside and refresh themselves with wine and food,\u2014\u25a0 almost the exact definition of an <em>inn, </em>as given in <em>Calye\u2019s case.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-7\">But the construction we contend for is sustained by referring to the obvious intent of the <em>legislature; </em>and if this be established, it supersedes all speculation as to the etymology and early technical use of the words.\" Two objects were sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>to be attained by the statute. The one was revenue; and the other, to place these establishments under good police regulations. No one can read the present statute, or that of 1801, without being convinced of the former object. And as to the latter, it is equally clear. Hence, both in England and in this country the keeper must be licensed ; (10 <em>Petersd. Abr. </em>620, <em>note ;) </em>and, as well our old statute of 1801, as the present, require bonds and impose restrictions. It was intended that no one should keep a public house of such a description without a sign, and that no sign should be erected unless the person had obtained a license j in short, that whoever engaged in the business should do it openly, pay the duty and give a bond for good conduct, See.$ <em>(See </em>Vaughan, 355.) Nor was it ever intended that these requirements might be evaded by a mere trick of words, like that resorted to in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-5\">We submit finally, that the device on a sign is matter of caprice or whim ; and that every thing and any thing inducing the traveller to suppose that he may enter and enjoy the privileges of a guest, in a public house, is a sufficient indication that the host keeps a <em>tavern.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b148-6\"><em>By the </em>Court, Nelson, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6F\">It is provided by 1 <em>R. S. </em>679 \u00a7 10 <em>(p. </em>678, 2d <em>ed.,) </em>that\u00a3\u00a3 no person who has not at the time a license to sell strong or spirituous liquors, or wines, to be drank in his house, shall erect or put up any sign indicating that he keeps a tavern ; and whoever offends against this provision, shall forfeit one dollar and twenty-five cents for every day such sign shall be so kept up.\u201d It is clear that throughout this statute regulating taverns and groceries, the terms <em>inn </em>and tavern, and <em>inn-holder </em>and <em>tavern-keeper </em>are used synonymously <em>; </em>as the phraseology \u201c no inn-holder or tavern-keeper,\u201d and &lt;c every inn-holder and tavern-keeper,\u201d and \u00a3&lt; every keeper of an inn or tavern\u201d runs through the various sections of the act. The same remark is also applicable to many of the English statutes. (1 <em>Hawk. </em>P. <em>C. </em>714, 715, <em>Cur. ed. of </em>1834.) Such also, beyond all doubt, is the common under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>standing of these terms. There may have been a slight difference at an early day ; but it is impossible to discover that any was intended by the framers of the statute. An <em>inn </em>and a <em>tav-ern </em>are both houses of public entertainment. The question in the case is, whether or not the sign erected and kept up by the defendant in front of his dwelling, indicated to the public that he kept a house of this character, within the meaning of the statute. These establishments, as houses for public accommodation, were well known at the common law, where we not only find a full description of the particular employment of an inn-keeper, but also many rules and regulations almost peculiar to that species of occupation. It is laid down that \u201c a person who makes it his business to entertain travellers and passengers and provide lodging and necessaries for them, their horses and attendants, is a common inn-keeper;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and it is no way material whether he have any sign before his door or not.\u201d (Bac. <em>Air. tit. Inns &lt;\u00a7\u2022 </em>Inn-keepers, (B). ) So, it is said that, though it be the entertaining of passengers that makes a man an inn-keeper, yet, if a person, having put up a sign before his door, afterwards pull it down, he thereby discharges himself of the burden of an innkeeper ; but if, after he takes it down, he continue to entertain travellers, it is as much a common inn as before. <em>(Id. ; Palm. </em>374 ; <em>Godb. </em>346 ; <em>Parkhouse </em>v. Forster, 5 <em>Mod. 428 ; Parker </em>v. Flint, 12 <em>id. </em>254.) It is said also, that \u201c every inn is not an alehouse, nor every alehouse an inn; but if an inn uses common selling of ale, it is then also an alehouse <em>; </em>and if an alehouse lodges and entertains travellers, it is also an inn.\u201d (1 <em>Burn\u2019s Just. tit. </em>Alehouses, I.) But, at common law, any person may erect an inn for the public accommodation, without a license; as the keeping of it is not a franchise, but a lawful trade open to every citizen. <em>(Bac. Air. tit. Inns &amp; Innkeepers (A). </em>) So, I apprehend, it is in this state, as far as it regards the keeping of these houses in the common law sense of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>term. The statute turns the employment into a franchise, only when it is sought to annex to the occupation the privilege of selling \u201c strong and spirituous liquors and wines to be drank in their houses.\u201d This is the only license granted to the keepers of inns or taverns, or which the statute makes necessary. It provides, (1 <em>R. S. </em>677 \u00a7 4, <em>2d </em>ed.,) that \u201c the commissioners shall have power to grant licenses to <em>keepers of inns and taverns fyc., to sell strong and spirituous </em>liquors,\u201d <em>fyc. ; </em>thereby clearly implying the existence of these houses and of this species of employment, already in common use. No license is necessary to authorize the business of keeping a tavern\u2014the right to do so being common to all citizens\u2014but if the keeper desire to annex to the employment the privilege of selling spirituous liquors or wines, a license must be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The argument for the plaintiffs in error goes, in effect, this length, viz : That no house of public entertainment can be kept in the state without taking out a license to sell spirituous liquors, &amp;c. which, I apprehend, is altogether a mistake. The only effect of the excise laws is to forbid the sale of such liquors in the course of this employment, to guests or others, without license. It is true, the act requires that every keeper of an inn or tavern shall keep two spare beds for his guests, sufficient stabling, provender, hay, pasturage, &amp;c.; (1 <em>R. S. </em>678, \u00a7 8, 2d <em>ed.,) </em>but this and all the other corresponding sections in the act refer to such houses as are licensed, and to those only.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The ninth section requires that the keeper shall, within thirty days after obtaining his license, put up a proper sign, &amp;c., indicating in some way that he keeps a tavern \u2022 and then follows the section in question, (\u00a7 10,) forbidding any person who has not at the time a license to sell spirituous liquors, &amp;c., to put up a sign indicating that he keeps a tavern\u2014meaning, obviously enough, a public house duly licensed within the act. As the sign in this case held out no such indication, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>below were right in deciding that it did not fall within the prohibition of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b149-5\"> See <em>Story on Bailm. </em>\u00a7 475.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\"> As to the meaning of the terms \u201c <em>house of </em>entertainment\u201d\u2014\u201c tavern\u201d\u2014 <em>\u201cordinary\u201d\u2014\u201cplace of public resort\u201d\u2014\u201cpublic place\" </em>&amp;c., see <em>\"Wortham </em>v. <em>Comm'th, </em>(5 <em>Hand. </em>669 ;) <em>Linkous </em>v. <em>Comm'th, </em>(9 <em>Leigh\u2019s Rep. </em>608.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
