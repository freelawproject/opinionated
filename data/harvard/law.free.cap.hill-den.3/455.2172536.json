The defendant Butterfield thereupon applied to the circuit judge and obtained an order that the plaintiff show cause before the judge <em>at chambers </em>why the defendant should not be discharged on filing common bail. On the appointed day for showing caus\u00e9 the judge made an order that Butterfield be discharged on filing common bail, and that the plaintiff pay $10, as costs of the motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-12\"><em>J.

Probably the attention of the judge was not called to the question of costs at the time the order was drawn up.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In cases where the defendant may be held to bail without a judge\u2019s order, he may apply to a judge at chambers or a commissioner for an order that the plaintiff show cause of action, and, after hearing the parties, the judge may make an order either mitigating bail, or discharging the defendant on his filing common bail. But I am not aware of any such practice where the defendant has been held to bail in pursuance of a judge\u2019s order. The remedy in that case, if the defendant has any grounds for complaint, is an application to <em>the court </em>to set aside or modify the order to hold to bail. Such was the course taken in <em>Classon </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>(2 <em>Caines, </em>47,) <em>Fan Vechten </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>(2 <em>John. R. </em>293,) and <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Barnum, </em>(20 <em>John. R. </em>337.) In general, when an order has been made by a judge at chambers or a commissioner, the proper course is to apply to the same officer to vacate his order, and his decision upon the application may be brought before the court on motion in the nature of an appeal. In the case of an order to hold to bail, however, the defendant, as will be seen from the cases already cited, may apply to the court in the first instance, and without asking the officer to vacate the order. But when an order has been made by one judge or commissioner, no other judge or commissioner can set it aside. That can only be done by the court, or by the officer who made the order. A different rule would lead to endless controversy. Two officers might alternately revoke each other\u2019s orders <em>ad, infinitum. </em>The order to hold to bail could only be set aside or modified by the recorder who made it, or on application to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
