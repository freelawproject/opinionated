From the affidavits in opposition to the motion it appeared, among other things, that the highway, as laid out, passes through the <em>dooryard </em>of Shelden, and leaves his <em>well, cow-shed </em>and part of his <em>corn-crib </em>in the highway, and that the road was laid out without his consent. The highway also encroaches on the <em>garden </em>and <em>cow-shed </em>of Snyder, and was laid out without his consent. All these erections existed before the road was laid out. The present commissioners stated in their affidavit that they were advised by their counsel and believed, that, by opening the road, they would subject themselves to damages, inasmuch as the road was so laid out by the former commissioners as to encroach upon the yards and fixtures of Shelden and Snyder.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-8\"><em>J. Pierson, </em>for the commissioners,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aen\">said, they would be liable to an action of trespass should they proceed to open the road. (1 <em>R. S. </em>514, \u00a7 57 ; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>4 <em>Cowen </em>190 ; <em>Lansing v. Caswell, </em>4 Paige, 519, 523.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>Hill, </em>in reply, said, the commissioners who laid out the highway and the judges who affirmed their doings must be taken to have adjudged, either that the road was not laid through any buildings or fixtures, or that the owners had consented; and although this was a jurisdictional fact, the decision of the judges especially is conclusive. He cited <em>Brittain </em>v. Kinnaird, (1 <em>Brod. &amp; Bing. </em>432 ;) <em>Van Steenburgh </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>(3 <em>Wend. </em>42 ;) <em>Barber </em>v. Winslow, (12 <em>Wend. </em>102 ;) <em>Birdsall </em>v. Phillips, (17 <em>Wend. </em>464 ;) <em>Cowen </em>&amp; <em>Hill\u2019s Notes to Phil. </em>1016\u201420 ; <em>Betts </em>v. Bagley, (12 <em>Pide. </em>572.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b452-4\"><em>By the Court, Bronson, </em>J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWO\">Without the consent of the owner, no road can be laid out <em>\u201c </em>through any <em>buildings; </em>or any fixtures or erections for the purposes of trade or manufactures ; or any <em>yards </em>or enclosures necessary to the use and enjoyment thereof.\u201d (1 <em>R. S. </em>514, \u00a7 57.) The words \u201c yards or enclosures\u201d apply to \u201c buildings,\u201d as well as to \u201c fixtures or erections for the purposes of trade.\u201d <em>(See Clark </em>v. Phelps, 4 Cowen, 190 ; <em>Lansing </em>v. Caswell, 4 Paige, 523.) The road passes through the door-yard and buildings of Shelden, and leaves his well in the street. It also encroaches on the cowshed of Snyder. The commissioners of 1840 exceeded their jurisdiction in laying out the road without the consent of the owners of the yard and buildings, and the matter is not helped by the subsequent affirmance of their proceedings by the judges on appeal. The present commissioners would be answerable in an action of trespass, if they should proceed to open the road through the yard and buildings of Shelden and Snyder. <em>(Clark </em>v. Phelps, 4 <em>Cowen, </em>190.) Clearly we ought not to compel them by mandamus; to commit a trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">There is room for doubt whether the case of <em>Brittain </em>v. <em>Kinnaird, </em>(1 <em>Brod. </em>&amp; <em>Bing. </em>432,) can be supported. But however that may be, the case can be distinguished from the one before us. There the magistrate had directly and necessarily adjudicated upon the fact on which his jurisdiction depended. But it is not so here. It does not appear that either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the commissioners or the judges have undertaken to de-cide that there was no door-yard or buildings in the site of the road. These officers in laying out highways exercise a special and limited jurisdiction, and although it may be presumed until the contrary appear that they have acted legally, it is quite clear that their acts may be impeached by showing that they exceeded their powers. I do not think it necessary to refer to books; the principle is a familiar one.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
