At the trial in the court below, one Warren was called as a witness for the prosecution, and gave material testimony. Afterward, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>defendant called several witnesses for the purpose of impeaching Warren on the ground of bad character. One of the witnesses called for this purpose, on being asked whether he knew Warren\u2019s <em>general </em>character, answered that he did ; but that he knew nothing as to his <em>character for truth and veracity. </em>The district attorney therefore objected that the witness could not be allowed to say, whether, from his knowledge of Warren\u2019s character, he would believe him on oath ; and so the court below held. The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted 5 and, after judgment, sued out a writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-5\"><em>G. </em>Tracy, for the plaintiff in error, was stopped by the court.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-6\"><em>T. </em>Jenkins, (district attorney,)</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ary\">contra, insisted, that the witness having expressly disclaimed all knowledge of Warren\u2019s character in respect to truth, he was incompetent to express a belief as to whether Warren should or should not be credited on oath.
