He cited <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hartford Ins. Co. </em>(19 <em>Wend. </em>46.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-8\">O.

There the attachment was issued within the first two weeks of the term 3 but here it was not issued until the third week, which should be regarded as in vacation for all the purposes of this proceeding, although the court was still sitting.

The intention of the legislature seems to have been that the court should be moved whenever that course wTas practicable 3 but in other cases, to prevent a failure of justice, the writ might be allowed at chambers. For some purposes the terms of the court are considered as ending with the second week 3 but the issuing of attachments is excepted from that provision. (2 <em>R. S. </em>197, \u00a7 5.) The commissioner was not authorized to allow the writ in term time.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
