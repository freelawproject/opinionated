But this was done on the ground that the attorney, as such, never tries or argues a case, and the fee for those services was supposed to be given for <em>preparing </em>the cause for trial or argument. <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>White, </em>2 <em>Wend. </em>265 ; <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>19 <em>id. </em>127.) The revised statutes give a <em>counsel </em>fee (i for the trial of a cause before a jury,\u201d &amp;c. <em>\u201c </em>or <em>attending prepared </em>for such trial.\u201d (2 <em>R. S. </em>632, \u00a7 17.) And a counsel fee was allowed, although the cause was not tried. <em>(Bank of Niagarav. Austin, </em>6 <em>Wend. </em>548.) But the act of 1840 has dropped the words \u201c attending prepared,\u201d &amp;c. and only gives a counsel fee \u201c for the trial of a cause.\u201d <em>(Statutes of </em>1840, <em>p. </em>327, \u00a7 <em>2.) </em>After this marked- change in the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>statute, I do not see how a counsel fee can be allowed, except where the cause is actually tried. And the question is the same in relation to the argument of a demurrer, bill of exceptions, <em>Sic. </em>They are all connected together in the same clause with the provision for a trial fee. Counsel get an increased fee under the present law, but they do not get it in all cases where it was formerly given.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
