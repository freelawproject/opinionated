The only question, therefore, is, whether an amendment be admissible on granting a new trial under the statute. The same consequences follow in all other respects as if the newr trial were for cause. In the latter case it is the constant practice to amend on reasonable ground being <em>shown; </em>and it is done either on granting the new trial,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> or at a subsequent term. The same thing may, I think, be done in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Motion granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b468-6\"> See <em>Gillett and </em>other v. <em>Stanley, </em>(1 <em>Hill, </em>121.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
