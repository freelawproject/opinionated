The plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, who lived at the distance of one hundred miles and upwards from the place of trial, were subpoenaed for the first day of the circuit, and started in season to arrive there at the opening of the court on the first day ; but, in consequence of an accident by the way, the witnesses did not arrive until the morning of the second day. On the morning of the first day, before any cause had been tried, the defendant put the cause over the circuit on payment of costs. After the witnesses arrived, which was before the cause had been reached on the calendar, the plaintiff taxed his costs, and was allowed for the fees of the witnesses.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-9\">D.

It is true that the plaintiff could not have made the necessary affidavit of the attendance of witnesses when the cause was put over on the morning of the first day; but as the witnesses had been subpoenaed from a considerable distance, it was not unreasonable to wait until the next morning for their arrival. If the parties had not arranged the question of witnesses\u2019 fees by stipulation, the judge would, I presume, have suspended his order for putting off the trial so as to give a reasonable time for the arrival of the witnesses. I agree that witnesses must attend at the time for which they are subpoenaed, at the peril of losing their fees if any detriment'comes upon the party in consequence of their absence; and where they are not entitled to fees, they cannot be taxed against the opposite party. But where, as in this case, there is no fault on the part of the witnesses, and the party who subpoenaed them has sustained no damage in consequence of their absence, fees may be allowed and taxed against the opposite party.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
