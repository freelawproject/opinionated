Tracy Beadle brought an action of assumpsit against The Chenango County Mutual Insurance Company upon a policy of insurance executed by the latter against fire, for five years, bearing date November 30th, 1838. The declaration set out those parts of the policy upon which the plaintiff\u2019s claim was based, and averred a loss by fire on the 17th of June, 1841. The defendants pleaded that one of the conditions of the said policy was, that should an assessment be made upon the premium note of the said Beadle, pursuant to the charter of the company, <em>(Sess. Laws of </em>1836, <em>p. </em>42, <em>in connection with id. </em>314,) and he neglected or refused to pay such assessment within thirty days after notice thereof, the policy was thenceforth to be null and void ; that the company, on the 9th of January, 1841, caused an assessment of ten per cent, to be made upon the premium notes of its members, including said Beadle; and that he, though duly notified of such assessment, &amp;c., refused to pay the same for more than thirty days after such notice, and still refuses, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-9\">The plaintiff demurred, assigning for cause that the condition of insurance alleged in the plea was unreasonable and arbitrary, unauthorized by the act incorporating the company, and not within the power of the company to enforce.

This is constantly done in marine policies, and the principle which upholds it there extends to all other policies. <em>The Matter of the Long Island Rail Road </em>Company, (19 <em>Wendell, </em>37,) has no application. The terms of forfeiture were there imposed by the company. Here the condition was inserted by mutual consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Judgment for the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
