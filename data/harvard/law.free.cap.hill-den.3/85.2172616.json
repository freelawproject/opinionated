Judge. The plaintiffs claimed the premises in question in right of Mrs. Fleming, oiie of the plaintiffs, who Was heir of Petef Tallman. At the trial the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ing facts appeared : Tallman acquired a valid title to the premises on the 27th of January, 1795. In 1805, Edward Griswold -held the premises adversely to Tallman, under a warranty deed from one Earll; and in 1811, the former,being still in possession, conveyed to Abraham Griswold, the defendant, who thereupon entered and continued to hold the premises till the commencement of this suit, in 1840. Tallman died in 1815 ; Mrs. Fleming, his daughter, having married the other plaintiff, J. B. Fleming, in 1807, while she was under the age of 21 years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-5\">The circuit judge charged the jury that, the defendant having shown in himself and the one under whom he claimed an adverse possession for more than twenty-five years, he was entitled to a verdict, notwithstanding Mrs. Fleming\u2019s disabilities by reason of infancy and coverture. The plaintiffs excepted, and a verdict having been rendered against them, they now moved for a new trial on a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b82-6\"><em>S. </em>Sherwood, for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqOh\">said, he found the opinion of the bar much against him on the question raised by the bill of exceptions, and some cases looked that way ; but he thought the latter distinguishable from the present. He should contend, if the court deemed the case open for discussion, that inasmuch as at the time Mrs. Fleming\u2019s right of entry accrued she was under disability, the statute (2 <em>R. S. </em>293,) did not run against her. <em>(Id. </em>295, \u00a7 16.) But</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The Court were clear that the opposite doctrine must prevail ; and they did not think their opinion could be changed by discussion, or any reflection they might bestow on the question. They considered the rule entirely settled, that \"where the statute has begun to run against the ancestor or other person under whom the plaintiff claims, it continues to run against the plaintiff, notwithstanding any disability when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the right accrues to the latter. The revised statutes have not changed the law on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">New trial denied, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b83-6\"><em> </em>See <em>Tillinghast\u2019s Ballantine on IAm. p. </em>59, <em>et </em>seq., and the English and American cases there stated in the text, and notes.
