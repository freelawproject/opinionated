S. Bowen Co., Inc. (Bowen), claims that the appellee (defendant below), Maryland National Bank (Maryland National), is liable to it for negligence and conversion. More specifically, Bowen claims that Maryland National wrongfully credited to the checking account of \u201cMrs. Patricia M. Andrews and Charles S. Bowen\u201d at Maryland National checks belonging to Bowen and has failed to reimburse it for the full amount of those checks. It is claimed that Mrs. Andrews, Bowen\u2019s employee, stole the checks from Bowen and that Maryland National accepted them for deposit in spite of a restrictive endorsement on all of them reading \u201cFor Deposit only, C. S. Bowen Company\u201d. After a jury verdict in favor of Maryland National in the Superior Court of Baltimore City (Ross, J., presiding) and a judgment entered thereon, Bowen appeals, presenting us with three questions for decision: <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">(1) Did the trial court err in not granting Bowen\u2019s motion for a directed verdict \u201con the issue of Maryland National\u2019s liability\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">(2) Did the trial court err \u201cin failing to instruct the jury that if they found the checks deposited by Andrews in the Andrews account at Maryland National were stamped \u2018For Deposit Only, C. S. Bowen Company\u2019, they would have to find Maryland National liable\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">(3) Did the trial court err \u201cin admitting irrelevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>and prejudicial activities of the president of C. S. Bowen\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\n<em>The Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">-Bowen is described in the testimony as a \u201csmall\u201d Maryland corporation <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> located in Baltimore City engaged in the business of selling and servicing paint spray equipment and sandblasting equipment. Mrs. Andrews was hired by Bowen in October 1965 as a bookkeeper. Her duties were \u201cto pick up the mail, to make deposits, keep the books and do some filing, those type of things\u201d. According to Bowen\u2019s president (Mr. Whitaker), with reference to deposits, \u201cIf a check came in the mail she was supposed to take it out, stamp it with <em>\u2018Deposit only to C. S. Bowen\u2019 </em>and then she would post it to the ledger card to whatever account it was to show that the invoice had been paid and then, of course, that posting, was posted into the cash receivable ledger and the check was put on a deposit slip and taken to\u201d the Union Trust Company for deposit in Bowen\u2019s checking account at that bank. Bowen had no account at Maryland National.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>On 20 March 1967, Mrs. Andrews, without the knowledge or authority of Bowen, went to a branch bank of Maryland National in Baltimore City and opened a \u201cregular\u201d joint checking account in the names of \u201cMrs. Patricia M. Andrews and Mr. Charles S. Bowen\u201d. She signed her name to a signature card and was asked to have Mr. Charles S. Bowen do the same. As \u201cCharles S. Bowen\u201d did not exist, Mrs. Andrews could not comply with this request. Instead, she took the card out of the bank, wrote the name \u201cC. S. Bowen\u201d on the card and returned it to the bank. Mrs. Andrews\u2019 bank statements and deposit slips, introduced in evidence, showed that thereafter, between March 1967 and September 1968 Mrs. Andrews periodically deposited in the \u201cjoint\u201d account checks totalling in the aggregate approximately $80,000.00, and that she drew on the account for her personal wants and needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Bowen claims that all the checks deposited by Mrs. Andrews were checks she had stolen from it, and that Maryland National is liable to it for their face amounts because, according to Bowen, <em>all </em>the checks were restrictively endorsed with a rubber stamp reading <em>\u201cFor Deposit Only, C. S. Bowen Company </em>\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Maryland National does not contest the fact that Mrs. Andrews stole checks from Bowen or that some of the stolen checks may have been accepted by it for deposit in her \u201cjoint\u201d account. Maryland National does, however, vigorously contend that Bowen has failed to meet its burden of showing which checks deposited by Mrs. Andrews belonged to Bowen or how they were each endorsed. Maryland National further claims that the evidence is such that the jury could have reasonably believed that Mrs. Andrews had repaid to Bowen the amounts of whatever checks she had stolen from Bowen and therefore that, in any event, no damages have been proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">As its principal witness, Bowen called Mrs. Andrews to testify. She admitted that she had stolen checks from her employer and deposited them in her \u201cjoint\u201d account. Her scheme for covering up her peculations was daring, if not ingenious. When a Bowen customer was billed, one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Andrews\u2019 duties was to receive a \u201cgreen copy\u201d of a numbered five-piece invoice. She was supposed to post the amount shown by the invoice on the customer\u2019s individual ledger card and place the green copy, in numerical sequence, in a loose-leaf monthly notebook. Two copies of the invoice were sent to the customer when he was billed for his purchase; another copy was used for \u201cback orders\u201d when necessary, and the fifth, or \u201cgold copy\u201d, was placed in a \u201ccustomer file\u201d to facilitate filling a customer\u2019s re-order of the same item. The \u201cgreen copy\u201d was the \u201ccontrol copy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Mrs. Andrews said that her scheme was, from time to time, to hide the green copy of the invoice and not post the amount due on the customer\u2019s ledger card or anywhere else among Bowen\u2019s records. Thus, when Bowen\u2019s accountant made his customary monthly examination of the company\u2019s books, he would find no record of the customer\u2019s order (which was kept with the \u201cgold copy\u201d and not ordinarily checked by the accountant, or anyone else unless there was a re-order) and no record of an account receivable from that customer. Mrs. Andrews, however, in furtherance of her scheme, kept a notation of her own of the \u201cgreen copy\u201d of the invoice she had hidden, listing the customer\u2019s name and the amount he had been billed. Then, when the customer\u2019s check arrived in the mail, instead of depositing the check in Bowen\u2019s account at the Union Trust Company, she deposited it in her \u201cjoint\u201d account with the fictitious \u201cCharles S. Bowen\u201d at Maryland National. She said she repaid Bowen for some of the checks but she did not know how much was \u201cinvolved\u201d and had \u201cno idea\u201d how much she owed Bowen. She said her method of repayment was to \u201cgo to the bank and purchase money orders and put them back in, but I don\u2019t know how much\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In September 1968, Mr. Whitaker discovered Mrs. Andrews\u2019 dishonesty while she was on vacation. By letter dated 19 September, Bowen\u2019s attorney notified Mr. John O. Montgomery, Maryland National\u2019s security\" officer, that Mrs. Andrews \u201chas apparently misappropriated funds of the Corporation by employing the use of an account in the Maryland National Bank\u201d and \u201cthat under no circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>should any of the funds which you presently have on hand be released to anyone without authority of Mr. Whitaker\u201d. Mr. Montgomery received the letter 20 September and on the same date ordered that the account be \u201cfrozen to prevent any further payment from the account\u201d. At that time the balance in the account was $4,353.06, Despite the \u201cfreeze\u201d order, however, Maryland National continued to honor some checks drawn on the account that were outstanding at the time the \u201cfreeze\u201d order was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">On 21 September, Mr. Montgomery interviewed Mrs. Andrews. She gave him a list of seven checks she said she had deposited in her \u201cjoint\u201d account. This list (Defendant\u2019s Exhibit No. 1) contained only the amount of each check with the payor\u2019s name noted after six of the amounts. The payor of one of the checks, in the amount of $3,909.08, was Bethlehem Steel Corporation. The evidence is uncontroverted that the named payee of this check was \u201cC. S. Bowen Company, Inc.\u201d, that its only endorsement was by a rubber stamp reading, \u201cFor Deposit Only, C. S. Bowen Company\u201d, and that it was accepted for deposit by Maryland National to the credit of Mrs. Andrews\u2019 joint account on 18 September 1968. It is also uncontroverted that on 19 November 1968, Maryland National repaid to Bowen the amount of the check because, according to Mr. Montgomery, Mrs. Andrews had told him at his 21 September interview with her that \u201cThis was money that belonged to C. S. Bowen and Company\u201d. It is clear that this check is not one of the checks for which Bowen seeks damages in conversion or negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">With respect to the payees of the checks she \u201ctook from C. S. Bowen\u201d, Mrs. Andrews said \u201csome were made out to C. S. Bowen Company, some were made out to Patricia Andrews\u201d. At another point in her testimony she said, \u201cThey were all made out to C. S. Bowen\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Regarding the endorsements, Mrs. Andrews testified she used a rubber stamp that belonged to Bowen on all the checks she stole. According to her, the rubber stamp read, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u201c \u2018For Deposit Only, C. S. Bowen Company, Inc.\u2019 \u201d or just \u201c \u2018C. S. Bowen\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">In a pre-trial deposition, Maryland National\u2019s security officer, Mr. John 0. Montgomery, testified that Mrs. Andrews told him that \u201csome of the checks she had put in her account belonged to the company, and some of them didn\u2019t\u201d. At trial, Mrs. Andrews testified that, except for \u201cseveral\u201d of her pay checks legitimately received from Bowen, all of the checks she deposited were checks belonging to Bowen. Her cancelled pay checks, however, for the period covering the life of the \u201cjoint\u201d account do not show that she deposited any of them at Maryland National. Thus, there is some evidence that Bowen was indeed the owner of all the checks deposited by Mrs. Andrews.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">At the close of all the evidence, Bowen, the plaintiff below, moved for a directed verdict. The motion was denied. On appeal, Bowen argues that the trial court erred in not granting the motion \u201con the issue of Maryland National\u2019s liability\u201d and asks that we remand the case for a new trial on the issue of damages only. We first consider whether this precise issue is properly before us. It is properly before us only if it was properly presented to the trial court and decided by it in the first instance. Md. Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Maryland Rule 552 a provides that in a jury case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">\u201c. . .. any party may move ... at the close of the evidence, for a directed verdict in his favor <em>on any or all of the issues. </em>Such motion shall state the grounds therefor .... \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">The motion in this case was general in nature and was not limited to any one issue. Rather it seems to have been directed to \u201call of the issues\u201d considered by Bowen to be necessary to render Maryland National liable to it for the aggregate amount of all checks deposited by Mrs. Andrews in her \u201cjoint\u201d account. The facts, claimed by Bowen to be established by the evidence, were that 1) <em>all </em>the checks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>deposited by Mrs. Andrews in her \u201cjoint\u201d account were \u201cC. S. Bowen Company checks\u201d; and 2) <em>all </em>the checks were restrictively endorsed with a rubber stamp, \u201cFor Deposit Only, C. S. Bowen Company\u201d, and were improperly applied by Maryland National to the \u201cjoint\u201d account. Bowen argued that, having established those facts, there was \u201c[no] issue to be submitted to the jury\u201d. Although Bowen\u2019s counsel also argued that \u201c[t]here is just nothing for the jury to determine with reference to the <em>liability </em>of the bank\u201d, we find nothing in the stated grounds for the general motion for a directed verdict indicating that the motion was limited to the issue of liability alone, leaving the issue of damages to be determined by the jury. Here, there was no concession that there was <em>any </em>issue left for determination by the fact finder. On appeal, however, Bowen seems to concede that the matter of damages is one properly for the jury and asks that we remand the case for a new trial on that issue alone. But, as we have indicated, whether that issue alone should have been submitted to the jury is not a question that was either presented to or decided by the lower court. The question is therefore not properly before us in this appeal. Md. Rule 1083.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Moreover, even if the question were properly before us as having been presented to and decided by the trial judge, we would hold that the motion was properly denied. This is so because the evidence claimed by Bowen to establish Maryland National\u2019s liability, <em>vel non, </em>as to <em>all </em>the checks deposited by Mrs. Andrews is not uncontroverted. Bowen argued to the trial court that it is the true owner of \u201ceach and every\u201d check deposited by Mrs. Andrews. We need go no further than to point out that this argued \u201cfact\u201d is not uncontroverted. Although the evidence may support such a factual finding, it does not compel it.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">While it is well settled that under Rule 552 a, a trial court may grant a directed verdict to a plaintiff as well as a defendant \u201con any or all of the issues\u201d, where the court is considering whether to grant such a motion to a plaintiff on any issue as to which he has the burden of proof, the motion should be denied unless the facts are <em>uncontroverted </em>(as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>opposed to merely uncontradicted) or the parties have agreed as to the facts and such facts and the circumstances surrounding them permit of only one inference with regard to any issue presented by the motion. <em>See, Alexander v. Tingle, </em>181 Md. 464, 30 A. 2d 737 and <em>Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Stallings, </em>165 Md. 615, 170 A. 163. In the latter case, at 619, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\">\u201c .... Nor it is true that the court can say as a matter of law that one upon whom the burden rests has discharged that burden merely because testimony offered by him was not contradicted. To so hold would be to override the decisions in a long line of cases that the jury has the right to disbelieve a witness even when uncontradicted, [citing cases] In <em>Harrison v. Central Construction Co., </em>135 Md. 170, at page 180, 108 A. 874, 878, it was said: \u2018When the facts have been ascertained and agreed upon by the parties, or are undisputed, and there is no dispute as to the inferences to be drawn from the facts, the question becomes one of law and may be decided by the court\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cThis was said in a case where there was an agreed statement of facts. And it will be found, on examination of all the cases where like language is used there was no controversy about the facts, [citations omitted]. \u2018Undisputed\u2019, as used in these cases, must be taken to mean \u201cuncontested\u2019, rather than \u2018uncontradicted\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Bowen excepted to the court\u2019s instructions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">\u201c.... I requested an instruction, that Your Honor, instruct the jury that if the jury finds that the checks, <em>For Deposit Only, C. S. Bowen, </em>then the jury would have to find the bank was negligent. Therefore, the jury would have to find the bank could not necessarily defend under preclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>section or under the other section that Your Honor read to them.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">On appeal Bowen contends that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u201cthe court below erred in its instructions to the jury which failed to instruct the jury that if they found the checks deposited by Andrews in the Andrews account at Maryland National were stamped <em>\u2018For Deposit Only, C. S. Bowen Company\u2019 </em>they would have to find Maryland National liable\u201d. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Here again, we find a material difference between the issue actually submitted to the trial court and the issue which we are asked to decide on appeal. Md. Rule 554 e provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cUpon appeal a party assigning error in the instructions, shall be restricted to (1) the particular portion of the instructions given or the particular omission therefrom or the particular failure to instruct distinctly objected to before the jury retired and (2) the grounds of objection distinctly stated at the time, and no other errors or assignments of error in the instructions shall be considered by the appellate court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">As the \u201cparticular failure to instruct\u201d now argued on appeal was not \u201cdistinctly objected to\u201d in the trial below, we are not permitted to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Moreover, we note that Bowen in its brief to us, after stating the contention, goes on to say that \u201cC. S. Bowen does not contend that the lower court failed to properly recite the language of the pertinent statutory sections [of the Uniform Commercial Code], but complains that the mere citing of the language was too confusing for the jury to understand\u201d. As no such \u201ccomplaint\u201d was made to the trial court, it cannot be considered here. Rule 554 e.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">The reason why we think there is a material difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>between the exception actually taken to the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct and that which is argued on appeal is this:</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The Uniform. Commercial Code requires that a depositary bank that is the transferee of a restrictively indorsed instrument \u201cmust pay or apply any value given by [it] for or on the security of the instrument consistently with the indorsement\u201d. Md. Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 3-206 (3). This section and other sections of the U.C.C. dealing with restrictive indorsements make it clear that a depositary bank that does not apply an instrument consistently with a restrictive indorsement is liable in conversion. <em>Salsman v. National Community Bank of Rutherford, </em>246 A. 2d 162 (N.J. 1968); <em>In Re Quantum Development Corp., </em>397 F. Supp. 329 (D.V.I.), aff'd on other grounds, 534 F. 2d 532 (3rd Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In the case ht bar, it will be recalled that one of the joint owners of the account was, so far as Maryland National knew, \u201cCharles S. Bowen\u201d, whose signature card bore the name \u201cC. S. Bowen\u201d..<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, with respect to any such checks, <em>(i.e., </em>with an indorsement reading \u201cFor Deposit Only, C. S. Bowen\u201d) it is at least a jury question whether Maryland National applied the value thereof consistently with the indorsement \u201cFor Deposit Only, C. S. Bowen\u201d. If it did, then it is not subject to what Bowen contends to be the absolute liability imposed upon a depositary bank that fails to honor a restrictive indorsement. Thus, in the unusual circumstances of this case, the trial court was correct in not granting the particular instruction requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">We observe that even if Maryland National could be said to have applied the proceeds of a particular check \u201cconsistently with the indorsement\u201d, it might still be liable in conversion to Bowen. As the trial court correctly instructed the jury, \u201cExcept as provided in the Uniform Commercial Code, a bank which takes checks from a person, who is not the true owner of those checks, and who has no authority [from the true owner] to transfer or negotiate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>checks, is liable to the true owner of the checks for the conversion\u201d. <em>See, National Union Bank v. Rubber Co., </em>148 Md. 449, 129 A. 688 (1925), a pre-U.C.C. case in which the basic pre-U.C.C. rule was stated thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">\u201cIf a negotiable instrument having a forged indorsement come to the hands of a bank and is collected by it, the proceeds are held for the rightful owners of the paper, and may be recovered by them, although the bank gave value for the paper, or has paid over the proceeds to the party depositing the instrument for collection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Section 3-419 (3)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code (Md. Code, Commercial Law Volume, \u00a7\u00a7 1-101 through 10-104, effective 1 February 1964), described in the Official Comments as \u201cnew\u201d, would appear to provide a depositary or collecting bank a complete defense at the suit of a true owner for conversion or negligence if the defendant bank can show 1) that it has in good faith and in accordance with reasonable commercial standards dealt with the instrument alleged to have been converted or negligently handled, <em>and </em>2) that it has no proceeds of the instrument remaining in its hands at the time suit is filed. Whether this section is indeed available to a collecting-depositary bank to limit its liability for conversion at the suit of a true owner has never been decided in this State and the issue is not before us for decision now. We mention it only because, upon remand, it is an issue that may require resolution by the trial court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>We further observe that any defense afforded by \u00a7 3-419 (3) would not be available to a depositary or collecting bank that applies the proceeds of a check inconsistently with a restrictive indorsement. This is so because of the express language of the section rendering its entire content \u201csubject to\u201d all provisions of the U.C.C. concerning restrictive indorsements, including \u00a7 3-206 (3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">During the cross-examination of Bowen\u2019s president, John Whitaker, counsel for Maryland National sought to explore the non-corporate use by Whitaker of corporate funds. A timely objection was interposed, and a bench conference followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201c(The Court) May I see counsel, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">(The Court) What\u2019s this all about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">(Mr. Orman [Maryland National\u2019s Counsel]) Your honor, I am going to proffer, because I think that Mrs. Andrews \u2014 I talked to Mrs. Andrews and got a statement from her and she advised me that in addition to her duties as set out by Mr. Whitaker, that Mr. Whitaker also had her do various other matters on company time and with company money, including payment of rent for his girlfriend\u2019s apartment, taking them to dinner and doing various other items, buying them furniture, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>charging all that to the corporation, as corporate expenditures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-4\">(The Court) What does that have to do with this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">(Mr. Orman) I believe it has to do with, first of all, the atmosphere he set up in the company and the use of the money for noncorporate events and that he said that all the money that was in the corporation was used only for corporate purposes and that the duties of Mrs. Andrews included just the duties he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">Now, she had these other duties which were actually noncorporate in nature but were for his own personal use as part of her duties. I believe I can use this to impeach the witness\u2019 credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">(The Court) ft\u2019s <em>all collateral.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">(Mr. Orman <em>Jit may be collateral.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">(The Court) Well, if it is collateral, that answers it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\">(The Court) Well, what bearing does that have on this case, <em>other than to prejudice the jury </em>on matters that are collateral to any of the issues before the Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">(Mr. Orman) Well, I think, Your Honor, it is not collateral, as I said before. He has set up himself a fraudulent atmosphere of writing off noncorporate obligations or noncorporate bills with corporate money. He has set up the use of corporate moneys to allegedly rent apartments and purchase furniture for his girlfriends, all of which were done by Mrs. Andrews at his request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-13\">(The Court) And the theory is that that gave her apparent authority to take whatever she wanted for her own use?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>(The Court) That\u2019s what I say. You haven\u2019t indicated anything to me, <em>other than an attempt on the part of the Defendant to introduce evidence purely to prejudice the jury in an attempt to present [irrelevant evidence. </em>This jury is already getting restless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\">(Mr. Orman) Your Honor, I would proffer that we have testimony to show that Mr. Whitaker, on his own, played with the corporate funds and took cash out of the corporation, ostensibly to pay corporate bills but, in fact, the payment of these moneys were used to put cash in his own pocket which would be nontaxable income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">We should be able to ask Mr. Whitaker about this and I would proffer also that we have evidence that Mr. Whitaker used corporation funds for non-corporate uses and paid the noncorporate bills with corporate funds through Mrs. Andrews, who prepared the checks and that he had Mrs. Andrews, on corporation time and with corporation money, squire around certain of his lady friends and pay for their apartments, furniture and other related expenses and I feel, Your Honor, that since we are in the \u2014 well, I am just repeating myself, but since we are looking at credibility and since we are looking at contributory negligence under the Uniform Commercial Code, it seems to me, if he testified in regard to everything that Mrs. Andrews did or was to do or what her obligations or duties were, all of this would be admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">(The Court) The ruling remains the same.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">On cross-examination, despite repeated objections and a motion to strike, Mrs. Andrews was allowed to testify to precisely these matters, despite the exclusion by the trial court of similar testimony by Mr. Whitaker. This testimony provided a basis for Maryland National\u2019s closing argument to the jury, in which it was repeatedly argued that Whitaker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>\u201ccreated a dishonest atmosphere\u201d, avoided payment of taxes and misused corporate funds, and that this \u201cdishonest atmosphere\u201d enabled Mrs. Andrews to steal the checks. Based upon our review of the testimony and the applicable law, we conclude that this testimony was irrelevant, erroneously admitted, and prejudiced the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Maryland National in its brief does not directly argue the relevancy of the challenged testimony, stating only that the \u201cdishonest atmosphere\u201d allegedly created \u201cby the manner in which the corporate funds were spent for non-corporate activities ... involving Andrews in tax avoiding schemes \u2014 his [Mr. Whitaker\u2019s] absences from the office and lack of sobriety when in office\u201d precluded Bowen from any recovery because of the provisions of \u00a7 3-404 and \u00a7 3-406 of the U.C.C.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Suffice it to say that we are not perguaded by the statement. It was error to admit the challenged testimony and in light of the lengthy cross-examination on these irrelevant matters, the extent to which they were emphasized to the jury in closing argument, and the initial recognition by the trial judge of the prejudicial nature of the testimony, the error was not harmless. We must therefore reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial. <em>Blondes v. </em>Hayes, 29 Md.

Typical of a large portion of the evidence in this case, there is considerable confusion concerning the appellant\u2019s precise corporate name. In its original pleadings, the name is \u201cC. S. Bowen and Company, Inc.\u201d At trial, Mr. John E. Whitaker, the president and sole owner of the corporation, testified on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">\u201cQ____What is the corporate name of C. S. Bowen? A. C. S.

And that\u2019s the way it has always been set up? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-14\">At the end of the case, following the court\u2019s instructions to the jury and before final arguments, appellant\u2019s counsel moved, out of the presence of the jury, to amend the name in the pleadings to \u201cC. S. Bowen Co., Inc.\u201d, although he said he was \u201cnot positive of the exact corporate name\u201d.
