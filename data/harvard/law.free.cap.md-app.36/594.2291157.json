Mason, J., dissents and filed a dissenting opinion at page 601 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">In the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, a jury found Samuel Edward Pitts, the appellant, guilty of storehouse breaking and stealing (count 2), and larceny to the value of one hundred dollars or more (count 4). On appeal, the appellant initially contends that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">The court instructed the jury in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">\u201cThis case comes before you by an indictment from the Grand Jury of this county,...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">\u201cThe fact that a man or a woman is indicted does not mean that he or she is guilty. It merely means that they must stand trial for the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-12\">\u201cAs gome of you perhaps know, but I will tell you again, the Grand Jury has a different function than you do. They make inquiries to determine two thingg; One, has a crime been committed in their opinion, and if so, must the person under investigation stand trial for that crime. This is one way that people are brought to trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-13\">\u201cAnother way is by a warrant, and another way is by a charge which we call an information by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office. But none of these indicate that the defendant is guilty. <em>There is no </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>presumption of innocence, no presumption of guilt. In other words, he comes into this court and the State must prove guilt beyond any reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the defendant whatsoever.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">\u201cThere are many definitions of reasonable doubt, and the one I always give juries is that kind of a doubt which would cause you to hesitate in important affairs in your lifetime, family affairs or business affairs, as distinguished from something of a trivial nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">\u201cAnother way to say it is it is a doubt based upon reason.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The appellant specifically objected to the words \u201cthere is no presumption of innocence.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The question of whether it is error to instruct the jury that there is no presumption of innocence has not been considered in Maryland. While courts in other jurisdictions have frequently held that it is error to fail to instruct that there is a presumption of innocence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the only jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>which appears to have considered the question presented here held that it was error to instruct that the presumption does not exist.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reach the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Common usage, not rigid rules, formal technicalities and logical analysis of scholars, linguists or grammarians, determines the meaning of words.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The phrase \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d has been used consistently by the courts of every jurisdiction in the United States.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, this presumption has been described as fundamental to American law.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In <em>Coffin v. United </em>States,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">\u201cThe principle that there is a presumption of innocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">\u201cIt is stated as unquestioned in the text-books, and has been referred to as a matter of course in the decisions of this court and in the courts of the several States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Similarly, this Court has said:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">\u201cThe fundamental principle of the administration of criminal justice under our judicial processes is that a person accused of crime is presumed to be innocent until proved guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Legal scholars recognize that the words \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d mean that the State must produce evidence to prove an accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In his treatise Wigmore says:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\u201c[T]he \u2018presumption of innocence\u2019 is in truth merely another form of expression for a part of the accepted rule for the burden of proof in criminal cases, <em>i.e., </em>the rule that it is for the prosecution to adduce evidence <em>(ante, </em>\u00a7 2487), and to produce persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(ante, </em>\u00a7 2497). As to this latter part, the measure of persuasion, the \u2018presumption\u2019 says nothing. As to the former part, the \u2018presumption\u2019 implies what the other rule says, namely, that the accused (like every other person on whom the burden of proof does not lie) may remain inactive and secure, until the prosecution has taken up its burden and produced evidence and effected persuasion; <em>i.e., </em>to say in this case, as in any other, that the opponent of a claim or charge is presumed not to be guilty is to say in another form that the proponent of the claim or charge must evidence it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">They point out, however, that the \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d is not a presumption at all and that the phrase is technically inaccurate. In his treatise McCormick says:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\"><em>\u201cThe presumption of innocence. </em>Assignments of the burdens of proof prior to trial are not based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>presumptions. Before trial no evidence has been introduced from which other facts are to be inferred. The assignment is made on the basis of a rule of substantive law providing that one party or the other ought to have one or both of the burdens with regard to an issue. In some instances, however, these substantive rules are incorrectly referred to as presumptions. The most glaring example of this mislabeling is the \u2018presumption of innocence\u2019 as the phrase is used in criminal cases, The phrase is probably better called the \u2018assumption of innocence\u2019 in that it describes our assumption that, in the absence of contrary facts, it is to be assumed that any person\u2019s conduct upon a given occasion was lawful. In criminal cases, the \u2018presumption of innocence' has been adopted by judges as a convenient introduction to the statement of the burdens upon the prosecution, first of producing evidence of the guilt of the accused and, second, of finally persuading the jury or judge of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Most courts insist on the inclusion of the phrase in the charge to the jury, despite the fact that at that point it consists of nothing more than an amplification of the prosecution\u2019s burden of persuasion.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Nonetheless, they advocate the continued use of the phrase \u201cpresumption of innocence,\u201d notwithstanding its technical inaccuracy, because it conveys to the jury a special meaning which affords the accused additional protection not contained in the rule concerning the burden of proof.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>In <em>Evans v. </em>State,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> this Court in dicta said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\u201cWhen the same word or phrase means one thing to the writer or speaker and something quite different to the reader or hearer, communicative chaos is inevitable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Here, at the time of the court\u2019s instruction, the jurors, like the legal scholars, understood the words \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d to mean that the State was required to produce evidence to prove that the accused was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court, also like the legal scholars, understood those words to involve a technically inaccurate use of the word \u201cpresumption.\u201d When the court initially advised the jury that there was no \u201cpresumption of innocence,\u201d communicative chaos ensued. The jury may well have concluded that the State did not have the burden of proof. The trial court\u2019s subsequent instructions that the defendant had no burden and that the State must prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, would in this context, be contradictory and therefore confusing. In essence, the jury may have been led to believe that the protections traditionally afforded by the presumption of innocence, for some unexplained reason, did not apply in this case. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>instruction was misleading.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, we shall reverse.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">\n<em>Case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Azp\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Montgomery County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-10\">.

Wigmore, <em>supra </em>at 407:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\u201cHowever, in a criminal case the term does convey a special and perhaps useful hint, over and above the other form of the rule about the burden of proof, in that it cautions the jury to put away from their minds all the suspicion that arises from the arrest, the indictment, and the arraignment, and to reach their conclusion solely from the legal evidence adduced. In other words, the rule about burden of proof requires the prosecution by evidence to convince the jury of the accused\u2019s guilt; while the presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>innocence, too, requires this, but conveys for the jury a special and additional caution (which is perhaps only an implied corollary to the other I to consider, in the material for their belief, <em>nothing but the evidence, i.e., </em>no surmises based on the present situation of the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\u201cSo far, then, as the \u2018presumption of innocence\u2019 adds anything, it is particularly a warning not to treat certain things improperly as evidence.\u201d (Emphasis in original.

I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Although it may have been improper because of practice and common usage for the trial judge to instruct the jury that there is no presumption of innocence, I do not think this misstep, even if error, was so misleading and prejudicial as to require a reversal. This is especially true since there was an abundance of evidence to sustain the verdict, and the jury was fully instructed on the burden of proof and the doctrine of reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">In my view, the misuse of the term \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d should be eliminated. The first and last occasion on which the appellate courts in this State came squarely to grips with this term was in <em>Evans v. State, </em>28 Md. App. 640, 349 A. 2d 300, <em>aff'd. </em>278 Md. 197, 362 A. 2d 629, where we said, by way of dictum, at 676 n. 13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-11\">\u201cThe \u2018presumption of innocence\u2019 is, of course, not a presumption at all. 9 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>(3rd Ed. 1940), \u00a7 2511, points out at p. 407, \u2018[T]he \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d is in truth merely another form of expression for a part of the accepted rule for the burden of proof in criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>cases, i.e. the rule that it is for the prosecution to adduce evidence ... and to produce persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt... .\u2019 Thayer, <em>Preliminary Treatise on Evidence </em>(1898), is equally clear, at p. 551, \u2018In the first place, the so-called presumption of innocence is not, strictly speaking, a presumption in the sense of an inference deduced from a given premise. It is more accurately an assumption which has for its purpose the placing of the burden of proof upon anyone who asserts any deviation from the socially desirable ideal of good moral conduct.\u2019 And see Morgan, <em>Basic Problems of Evidence </em>(1962), p, 44.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">If the \u2018presumption of innocence' were a true presumption of law or permitted inference of fact, it would be flagrantly unconstitutional under <em>Leary v. United States, supra, </em>and other cases requiring that a presumption be based upon a mathematical probability that it be true. Quite the reverse likelihood, of course, applies to one arrested, indicted and brought to trial. As McCormick, <em>The Law of Evidence </em>(1954), astutely pointed out, at 647-648: \u2018[W]hen it came to be employed, in argument and in instructing juries, in criminal trials under the common law, it became a source of mysticism and confusion. As applied to the accused, any assumption, or \u2018presumption\u2019 of innocence, in the popular sense of an inference based on probability, is absurd. The probability is the reverse. The assumption of innocence which is reasonable in the absence of contrary facts becomes quite unrealistic when we include in the picture the facts that the person has been officially charged with the crime and has been brought to trial. Nevertheless, the phrase \u2018presumption \u2018 of innocence\u2019 has been adopted by judges as a convenient introduction to the statement of the burdens upon the prosecution, first of producing evidence of the guilt of the accused and, second, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>finally persuading the jury or judge of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">It is enough to tell the jury in strong terms that the heavy burden is upon the prosecution to prove each and every element of a criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt. Beyond this, an additional instruction on the presumption of innocence would add nothing as a practical matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Although the erroneous usage of the phrase \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d has become so ingrained as to make its excision exceedingly difficult, I cannot countenance the perpetuation of this error simply because we have been doing it that way for a long time. Appropriate are the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes, <em>The Path of the Law, </em>19 Harv. L. Rev. 469 (1897):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">\u201cIt is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Notwithstanding the fiction that the law is an all-knowing monolith, the simple truth is that when we first began to use the word \u201cpresumption\u201d incorrectly in this regard, we did not know any better. We now do. I feel, therefore, as did Mr. Justice Jackson in <em>Massachusetts v. United States, </em>333 U. S. 611, 639-640 (dissenting opinion):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">\u201cI see no reason why I should be consciously wrong today because I was unconsciously wrong yesterday.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
