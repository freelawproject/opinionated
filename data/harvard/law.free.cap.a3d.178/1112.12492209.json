Redeker, Commissioner of Transportation (commissioner),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that sovereign immunity deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction because his written notice of claim pursuant to the state highway defect statute, General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was patently defective in its description of\n   the cause of his injury. We agree with the plaintiff, and accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following procedural history. On November 16, 2015, the plaintiff filed a single count complaint, in which he alleged that on or about December 26, 2014, he was struck by a vehicle while walking north on the western side of East Main Street in the pedestrian crosswalk at the entrance of Interstate 95 south in Bridgeport. By a letter dated February 13, 2015, the plaintiff sent written notice of\n   his intent to bring an action pursuant to \u00a7 13a-144 for personal injuries sustained as a result of the incident. The commissioner received the notice on February 17, 2015. The notice described the cause of injury as follows: \"On December 26, 2014 at approximately 6:06 p.m., Eric Boykin was injured due to the negligence [of the] State of Connecticut Department of Transportation, who failed to place a pedestrian cross walk button at the intersection of East Main St., and I-95, Bridgeport, CT, failed to inspect the pedestrian crossing, failed to repair the pedestrian cross walk button and failed to provide a safe pedestrian cross walk for pedestrians such as the plaintiff.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 18, 2016, the commissioner filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In his memorandum of law in support of the motion to dismiss, the commissioner argued that the plaintiff's claim did not fall within \u00a7 13a-144's waiver of sovereign immunity because the written notice was patently defective. Specifically, the commissioner argued, in relevant part, that \"the notice is fatally defective as to setting forth a general description of the cause of the particular injury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The commissioner contended that\n   \"[b]ased upon the notice, the commissioner has absolutely no idea how the particular injury occurred or what the cause of the injury was. The notice contains nothing more than bald allegations of responsibility ... without specifying the specific nature or cause.\" On April 29, 2016, the plaintiff filed an objection to the commissioner's motion to dismiss, arguing that the written notice satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 13a-144 because it provided a \"general description\" of the cause of injury, as required by the language of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 6, 2016, after a hearing, the court granted the commissioner's motion to dismiss. In its memorandum of decision, the court stated that it relied on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Frandy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Transportation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071600\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/132/750/\">\n    132 Conn.

Suffice it to say that how any of these claimed features caused injuries to plaintiff simply does not appear. Uncertainty begins with the inconsistent statements that the state failed to place a crosswalk button at this location and then failed to repair the crosswalk button.... The claims that the state was negligent or that the crosswalk was unsafe are simply conclusions and add nothing to the notice in terms of helping the reader understand how such caused the claimed injury.\" The court concluded that the notice failed to meet the minimal requirements of \u00a7 13a-144 by failing to state sufficiently the cause of the injuries alleged and, therefore, the state's sovereign immunity was not waived, depriving the court of subject matter jurisdiction. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We begin by setting forth the standard of review and legal principles that guide our analysis. \"A motion to\n   dismiss ... properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law\n   and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court.... A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.... [O]ur review of the court's ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [determination] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo.... Moreover, [t]he doctrine of sovereign immunity implicates subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore a basis for granting a motion to dismiss.... When a ... court decides a jurisdictional question raised by a pre-trial motion to dismiss, it must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light.... In this regard, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Filippi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5709286\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/273/1/#p8\">\n    273 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=866%20A.2d%20599\">\n    866 A.2d 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff brought this action pursuant to \u00a7 13a-144, which provides a waiver of the state's sovereign immunity\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   in civil actions alleging injuries caused by defective state highways or sidewalks. The statute provides in relevant part: \"Any person injured in person or property through the neglect or default of the state or any of its employees by means of any defective highway, bridge or sidewalk which it is the duty of the Commissioner of Transportation to keep in repair ... may bring a civil action to recover damages sustained thereby against the commissioner in the Superior Court. No such action shall be brought except within two years from the date of such injury, nor unless notice of such injury and a general description of the same and of the\n   cause thereof and of the time and place of its occurrence has been given in writing within ninety days thereafter to the commissioner....\" General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"[ Section] 13a-144 created a new cause of action not authorized at common law, in derogation of sovereign immunity.

The notice [mandated under \u00a7 13a-144 ] is to be tested with reference to the purpose for which it is required.... The [notice] requirement ... was not devised as a means of placing difficulties in the path of an injured person. The purpose [of notice is] ... to furnish the commissioner with such information as [will] enable him to make a timely investigation of the facts upon which a claim for damages [is] being made.... The notice requirement is not intended merely to alert the commissioner to the occurrence of an accident and resulting injury, but rather to permit the commissioner to gather information to protect himself in the event of a lawsuit....

The defendants could not know whether the specific defect was a pothole, a streetlight failure, or an automobile driving into the crosswalk. Without being provided with that knowledge, the defendants are left to guess as to what caused the plaintiff's alleged injuries. Accordingly, the plaintiff's notice is patently defective.\" We do not agree that the notice is patently defective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We conclude that the plaintiff's notice provided sufficient information as to the cause of his injury to permit the commissioner to gather information about the case intelligently and, therefore, was not patently defective.

Id., at 2-3,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=866%20A.2d%20599\">\n     866 A.2d 599\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The commissioner filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the notice was patently defective in that it \" 'describe[d] two different and distinct locations,' \" and therefore failed to sufficiently describe the location of the accident. Id., at 6,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=866%20A.2d%20599\">\n     866 A.2d 599\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Although the notice provided that the accident occurred at a point in the road immediately after a \" 'graded blind curve' \" between two exits on Interstate 95;\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=866%20A.2d%20599\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at 6 n.3,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=866%20A.2d%20599\">\n     866 A.2d 599\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; evidence in the record established that there was more than one curve in the road between the points identified. Id., at 11,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=866%20A.2d%20599\">\n     866 A.2d 599\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    On appeal from the trial court's denial of the commissioner's motion to dismiss, our Supreme Court concluded that the notice was not patently defective. Id., at 11-12,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=866%20A.2d%20599\">\n     866 A.2d 599\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court acknowledged that, although the notice described two different locations that were almost two miles apart from one another and the accident could have occurred in only one of those locations, no evidence in the record \"indicate[d] that there is more than one\n    <em>\n     graded blind\n    </em>\n    curve\n    <em>\n     immediately prior\n    </em>\n    to either of those two points.\" (Emphasis in original.) Id., at 11,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=866%20A.2d%20599\">\n     866 A.2d 599\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, the court could not conclude that \"the notice necessarily was too vague to permit the commissioner to identify the location of the accident and injury with reasonable certainty.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=866%20A.2d%20599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Just as one of the alleged locations in\n    <em>\n     Filippi\n    </em>\n    was legally insufficient, the plaintiff here concedes that two of his alleged causes of injury are legally insufficient to provide adequate notice to the commissioner. The inclusion of a cause of injury that would be legally insufficient on its own, however, does not invalidate the notice provided by the statements regarding the crosswalk signal, just as the inclusion of a second location in\n    <em>\n     Filippi\n    </em>\n    did not invalidate the entire notice, as it does not make the notice \"too vague to permit the commissioner to identify\" the cause of the accident and injury \"with reasonable certainty.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=866%20A.2d%20599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Furthermore, we agree with the plaintiff that \"[w]hether there was no button or the button was broken is irrelevant. The point is, in the absence of a working crosswalk button, there was no method to ensure safe passage across the street.... Once on notice that there was a problem with a crosswalk button, the commissioner could easily gather information about the matter.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
