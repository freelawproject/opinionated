Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 15-1201 through 15-1206 of the Environment Article (En.) authorizes a circuit court, under specified circumstances, to terminate a dormant \"severed mineral interest,\" thereby effecting a merger of that mineral interest with the estate overlying it. Respondents, Olin L. McKenzie, et al., owners of surface estates, invoked the Act in the Circuit Court for Garrett County. Petitioners, James H. Ellis, et al., owners of severed mineral interests, challenged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the constitutionality of the Act. The circuit court sustained the Act and terminated petitioners' mineral interests. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion. We granted certiorari.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314952,12314944,12489860,12489861\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/453/356/\">\n    453 Md. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314944,12489859,12489860,12489861,12489862,12314952,12314926,12314935\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/837/\">\n    162 A.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). For the reasons hereinafter set forth, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Between 1884 and 1898, one Sarah Wright conveyed, cumulatively, hundreds of acres in Garrett County by seven deeds that, by variously phrased clauses, reserved the mineral interests. She died in 1900, leaving a will that divided her estate into four equal shares. The respondents are the present owners of the fee simple interests in the surface tracts who trace their titles back to the seven deeds from Sarah Wright. Petitioners are, to the extent known, the individuals and\n   personal representatives who, prior to the termination of dormant mineral interests, owned or had claims to those mineral interests by tracing back to one of the four shares of Sarah Wright's testamentary estate. Prior to the filing of the initial Petition for Termination in this action, none of the petitioners in this case knew of the existence of the severed mineral interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   DMIA was enacted by the Acts of 2010, Chapters 268 and 269, effective October 1, 2010. The respondents learned that the mineral interests were severed from their surface interests and employed a genealogy expert who conducted a study to identify the present heirs and descendants who inherited the mineral interests. The respondents filed a Petition for Termination of Dormant Mineral Interests on January 10, 2013. Service of process was effected on the petitioners in personam or by publication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The circuit court entered default against forty-six of the petitioners. The remaining mineral interest owners filed answers to the petition, asserting that the DMIA is unconstitutional and that the petition failed properly to name several parties. Specifically the latter contention was that the petition incorrectly named Edward C. Boyce and his brothers, Kenneth and Leslie, as deceased parties with unknown heirs. It was further contended that the petition failed to name the personal representatives of Emma Englar Ellis and Helen L. Patchen Hafer pursuant to Md. Code (1974, 2011 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 1-301 of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article. The respondents thereupon conducted discovery to identify\n   the missing parties. During this period, George Thomsen, as personal representative of the Estate of Emma Englar Ellis, filed a notice of intent to preserve mineral interest on April 10, 2013; Doris J. Erb, as personal representative of the Estate of Helen Patchen Hafer, filed a notice of intent to preserve mineral interest on April 19, 2013; and Edward C. Boyce filed a notice of intent to preserve mineral interest on behalf of himself and his brothers on June 27, 2013.\n   Following discovery, the respondents filed their fourth amended petition, joining all of the owners of mineral interests. The parties commendably stipulated to the facts and limited the issues to the constitutionality of the DMIA and the validity of the Notices of Intent to Preserve Mineral Interest (\"notices to preserve\"). The stipulation also detailed that \"[n]o Notice of Intent to Preserve Mineral Interests as allowed under \u00a7 15-1204 of the Environment Article was filed in the Land Records of Garrett County by or on behalf of any Respondent or by any person identifying any of the Severed Mineral Interests in this proceeding before the initial Petition for Termination was filed in this action on January 10, 2013.\" The stipulation listed each of the notices to preserve recorded after the original petition and then noted that the \"[petitioners] who are parties to this Stipulation contend that the Notices of Intent are effective to preserve some or all of the Severed Mineral Interests. The [respondents] contend that the Notices of Intent are not effective to preserve any of the Severed Mineral Interests.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The circuit court heard argument on September 14, 2015. By memorandum and order entered on September 18, 2015, it concluded that (1) the DMIA is constitutional; (2) the respondents made the diligent inquiry to find unknown mineral interest owners required by the DMIA, as reflected in an affidavit; and (3) the notices to preserve are void because they were recorded after the commencement of an action to terminate mineral interests. On September 29, 2015, the circuit court entered a final order merging the terminated mineral interests of the petitioners into the surface estates of the respondents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The order also voided the notice of intent to\n   preserve mineral interest that had been filed in the Land Records of Garrett County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The petitioners noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals on October 15, 2015. That court affirmed on both issues. It concluded that the instant case is indistinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Harvey v. Sines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307275\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/228/283/\">\n    228 Md. App. 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307275\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/228/283/\">\n    137 A.3d 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), in which the Court of Special Appeals had held that the DMIA is constitutional because the Act does not retrospectively abrogate a property right. The Court of Special Appeals also determined that the notices to preserve did not preserve the interests because they were filed after the action commenced despite minor errors in the petition. The mineral interest owners petitioned for a Writ of Certiorari on March 27, 2017, and the respondents answered on April 10, 2017. This Court granted the writ on June 21, 2017. Additional\n   facts will be stated in the discussion of the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Questions Presented\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"1. Does the DMIA violate Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and Article III, \u00a7 40 of the Maryland Constitution by retrospectively taking a vested property interest from a mineral owner and transferring it to a surface owner without compensation?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"2. Is a notice of intent to preserve a severed mineral interest effective if recorded by the personal representative of a deceased owner's estate while an action to terminate the interest is pending against the decedent's descendants but not against the personal representative?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    The Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   DMIA creates a right in a surface owner of realty that is subject to a severed mineral interest to maintain an action to terminate that severed mineral interest as long as the mineral interest is dormant. No such action was permitted\n   during a one-year grace period following the effective date of the Act. En. \u00a7 15-1203(a)(1). A mineral interest is dormant if, for twenty or more years preceding an action to terminate, it has not been used and it is not the subject of a notice recorded during that minimum twenty-year period. En. \u00a7 15-1203(a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Owners of mineral interests can prevent a court from concluding that their interests are dormant by acting in such a way that is \"using\" the interest. These actions are active mineral operations, payment of certain taxes relating to the mineral interest, \"[r]ecordation of an instrument that creates, reserves, or otherwise evidences ... the mineral interest,\" or recordation of a judgment that specifically references the interest. \u00a7 15-1203(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The owner of a mineral interest who wishes to preserve it \"may record, at any time, a notice of intent to preserve the mineral interest,\" or part thereof. \u00a7 15-1204(a)(1). Certain information identifying\n   the mineral interest is required. \u00a7 15-1204(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addressing both the petition to terminate mineral interests and the notice of intent to preserve such interests, the Act recognizes that there most likely will be difficulties in identifying the owners of a severed, dormant, mineral interest. Section 15-1201(g)(1) defines \" 'Unknown or missing owner' \" as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"any person vested with a severed mineral interest whose present identity or location cannot be determined:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"(i) From the records of the county where the severed mineral interest is located; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"(ii) By diligent inquiry in the vicinity of the owner's last known place of residence.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The defined term includes heirs, successors, or assignees. \u00a7 15-1201(g)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, \u00a7 15-1203(b)(2) provides that an action to terminate \"may be maintained, whether or not the owner of the severed mineral interest is an unknown or missing owner.\" Such an action \"must be in the nature of and require the same notice as is required in an action to quiet title as set forth in \u00a7 14-108 of the Real Property Article.\" En. \u00a7 15-1203(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Act also recognizes that the owners of certain severed dormant mineral rights might, as here, not have filed a notice of intent to preserve because the owners were unaware that they owned such rights until they received notice of the filing of an action to terminate those rights. En. \u00a7 15-1205(b) &amp; (c) address these circumstances with a compromise. Section 15-1205(b) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"In an action to terminate a mineral interest in accordance with \u00a7 15-1203 of this subtitle, the court shall permit the\n   owner of the mineral interest to record a late notice of intent to preserve the mineral interest as a condition of dismissal of the action, if the owner of the mineral interest pays the litigation expenses incurred by the surface owner of the real property that is subject to the mineral interest.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Section 15-1205(c), however, imposes the following limitation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"This section does not apply in an action in which a mineral interest has been unused in accordance with \u00a7 15-1203 of this subtitle for a period of 40 years or more preceding the commencement of the action.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   We turn now to the arguments of the petitioning mineral rights owners.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Petitioners rest their first argument on two provisions of the Maryland Constitution. Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights provides: \"That no man ought to be ... disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges ... or, in any manner, destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the Law of the land.\" \"[T]he phrase 'law of the land' ... expresses the same concept as 'due process of law' in the Fourteenth Amendment\" to the Constitution of the United States.\n   <em>\n    City of Frostburg v.

To reiterate, the central issue, in cases like the present ones, is whether vested rights are violated and not whether the retroactive statutes are 'rational.' The Court's opinions indicate that the particular provisions of the Constitution which are violated by such acts are Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights and Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Constitution. Furthermore, these constitutional provisions literally cover the matter. A statute having the effect of abrogating a vested property right, and not providing for compensation, does 'authoriz[e] private property, to be taken ..., without just compensation' ( Article III, \u00a7 40 ).

With respect to \"reasonable reliance\" and \"settled expectations,\" there are differences between the ground rent statute and DMIA. The fatal flaw in the former was that it cut off, for failure to register, the income stream that the ground rent holders enjoyed and reasonably expected to enjoy. By definition a dormant mineral interest is not, and has not been for twenty years, producing any income, inasmuch as it has been \"unused\" for at least that period preceding the filing of a petition to terminate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   DMIA recognizes the value of the alienability of severed mineral rights by defining as \"use\" a transfer of such rights that is demonstrated by a land record within the twenty years preceding a petition to terminate. En. \u00a7 15-1203(c)(iii). Nor does DMIA automatically terminate the dormant interest upon\n   failure to register it by the expiration of a post-effective date grace period, as did the ground rent statute. Indeed, failure to register by the expiration of the grace period has no adverse effect on the owner of the mineral right. That owner may file a notice of intent to use so long as the surface owner has not petitioned to terminate. Then, unlike the notice of extinguishment of a ground rent that was issued automatically by the Department of Assessments and Taxation, the owner of a severed, allegedly dormant mineral interest has the opportunity to defend against the petition to terminate on any of four grounds, use, payment of taxes, recorded instrument, and reference in a judgment, En. \u00a7 15-1203(c)(1)(i)-(iv), which, if found to exist as to any part of the mineral interest at any time in the preceding twenty years, defeats termination as to the whole of the mineral interest. Even if the petition to terminate is found by the court\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   to lie, the owner of a severed mineral interest that has been unused for up to, but not including, forty years before the commencement of an action to terminate may compel dismissal of the action by filing a late notice of intent to use and by reimbursing the surface owner for that party's \"litigation expenses\" in bringing the action. En. \u00a7 15-1205(b) &amp; (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   There are additional reasons why petitioners had no reasonable reliance or settled expectation that their mineral interests would never be the subject of legislation that could lead to termination of those interests. The fact is that they did not even know that they owned the interests. Further, the record is silent as to whether there are any minerals below the surfaces of the lots, and petitioners have not presented their case on the basis that they have access to minerals and are prepared to exploit them. If there are no minerals worth exploiting, the value of the claim to mineral rights would seem to lie in the extent of the price that the surface owners might be willing to pay to clear title. If there are in fact minerals on the lands, petitioners and their predecessors have not exploited\n   them for over 100 years. The State has an interest in having title cleared or minerals exploited. Petitioners have no settled expectation that the State would not intervene and they have not acted in reasonable reliance on perpetual non-intervention by the State.\n   The issue of the constitutionality of DMIA was presented to the Court of Special Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Harvey v.

The State surely has the power to condition the ownership of property on compliance with conditions that impose such a slight burden on the owner while providing such clear benefits to the State.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189832\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/516/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189832\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/516/\">\n    at 529-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189832\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/516/\">\n    102 S.Ct. at 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189832\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/516/\">\n    70 L.Ed.2d at 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We find that petitioners had no reasonable reliance or settled expectation that the State would not undertake to create a balanced system that would \"enable and encourage [the] marketability of real property and ... mitigate the adverse effect of dormant mineral interests.\" Uniform Law Commission, Uniform Dormant Mineral Interests Act, \u00a7 1(a). DMIA is not retrospective legislation that abrogates vested\n   rights. DMIA's compliance with due process requirements is not to be measured by the added protection afforded by the Maryland constitutional provision against retrospective legislation. Because, in this case, the due process concepts of Maryland Constitution, Declaration of Rights, Art. 24 and of Maryland Constitution, Art.

III, \u00a7 40. They again rely on\n   <em>\n    Muskin\n   </em>\n   which invalidated the Ground Rent Registry Statute because it took \"private property impermissibly from the ground lease owner and transfer[red] it to the lease holders, without just compensation.\"\n   <em>\n    Muskin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702148\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/544/#p556\">\n    422 Md. at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702148\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/544/#p556\">\n    30 A.3d at 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We do not accept petitioners' contention because there has been no taking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The defect in the Ground Rent Registry Statute was that it indiscriminately extinguished ground rents that were being paid along with those that were not being paid. It differentiated \"rather strictly between registrants under an entirely new scheme and non-registrants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702148\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/544/#p556\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702148\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/544/#p556\">\n    at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702148\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/544/#p556\">\n    30 A.3d at 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Failure to register by the due date terminated valuable rents as well as worthless rents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In DMIA, the Legislature has taken pains to limit to dormant interests the extinguishment and merger. Mineral rights in use are not subject to termination, unlike the rents that were current in\n   <em>\n    Muskin\n   </em>\n   . Under DMIA, there is no automatic termination of rights on failure to register by a date certain. The process is not triggered unless and until the surface owner petitions to terminate. A mineral rights owner can forestall for twenty years a petition to terminate by first filing a notice of intent to preserve. Merely paying taxes on the mineral rights or recording some transaction evidencing\n   their existence is \"use.\" The mineral rights owner, who has failed to file a notice of intent to preserve before the surface owner petitions to terminate, may still file a late notice of intent to preserve by reimbursing expenses to the surface owner who brought the omission to the attention of the mineral rights owner. Only the owner whose rights have been unused for forty years prior to a petition to terminate is ineligible to file late. This process is a far cry from taking property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Indiana Dormant Minerals Act that was before the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Texaco, Inc. v.

It is the owner's failure to make any use of the property-and not the action of the State-that causes the lapse of the property right; there is no 'taking' that requires compensation. The requirement that an owner of a property interest that has not been used for 20 years must come forward and file a current statement of claim is not itself a 'taking.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189832\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/516/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189832\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/516/\">\n    at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189832\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/516/\">\n    102 S.Ct. at 792-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189832\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/516/\">\n    70 L.Ed.2d at 751-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A decision by this Court is somewhat analogous to the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Texaco\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v.

They posit an attenuated argument under which the late filing of notices to preserve is permitted because of defects in the original petitions identifying the holders of certain fractional interests in the severed mineral rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The facts are these. The original petition was filed January 10, 2013. It averred that a one-eighth interest held by Emma Englar Ellis who died October 14, 1980, passed to her heirs at law. Petitioners point out that title to a decedent's realty, by statute, passed to the personal representative. Ellis's personal representative filed notice to preserve on April 10, 2013. Similarly, Helen Hafer, who held a 1/96th interest died in 2009. Her descendants were named in the petition. Her personal representative filed a notice to preserve on April 19, 2013. The petition identified Edward C. Boyce, a 1/480th owner, as deceased and named his \"Unknown Heirs\" as defendants. Mr. Boyce filed a notice to preserve on June 27, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Petitioners' theory is that, in pleading an action to terminate dormant mineral rights, a surface owner must identify the holder of each ownership interest or explain why an interest's owner is unknown or unlocated. The latter is not simply a \" 'catch-all' category.\" Until the pleadings requirement is satisfied, petitioners assert, those interests are not subject to termination and the proper defendants may file a notice to preserve. Further, one co-owner may file a notice to preserve for the benefit of any or all co-owners. En. \u00a7 15-1204(b)(1)(iii). Here, the requirements under petitioners' theory were not satisfied until the Fourth Amended Complaint by the respondents was filed in May 2015, well after the filing of the three above-described notices to preserve. Petitioners conclude that their mineral rights have been preserved in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   It should be noted that the circuit court found as an ultimate fact that the surface owners made a diligent inquiry to designate interests held by unknown or missing heirs and that finding is not challenged before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The circuit court rejected the above-described contention by the petitioners for reasons with which we fully agree. Under En. \u00a7 15-1203(a)(2) a mineral interest is dormant if two elements are met:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"(i) The mineral interest is unused for a period of 20 or more years preceding the\n   <em>\n    commencement\n   </em>\n   of termination of the mineral interest; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \"(ii) Notice of the mineral interest was not recorded during the period of 20 or more years preceding the\n   <em>\n    commencement\n   </em>\n   of termination of the mineral interest.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   (Emphasis added). Nothing in the Act alters the ordinary rule that the \"commencement\" of an action, here to terminate mineral rights, is the date of filing of the initial petition. Maryland Rules of Procedure, Rule 12-704, \"Termination of dormant mineral interest,\" states that, after October 1, 2011, a surface owner \"may initiate an action to terminate.\" Rule 12-704(a)(1). Thus, the three above-described notices were late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   En. \u00a7 15-1205 permits the filing of a late notice to preserve \"as a condition of dismissal of the action, if the owner of the\n   mineral interest pays the litigation expenses incurred by the surface owner.\" \u00a7 15-1205(b). But, \u00a7 15-1205 does not apply where the mineral interest has been unused \"for a period of 40 years or more preceding the commencement of the action.\" \u00a7 15-1205(c). The parties stipulated that none of the specified acts that constitute \"use\" had taken place in the forty years \"preceding the filing of the Petition for Termination in this action,\" and that they had no knowledge of \"use\" at any time after the Sarah Wright deeds were operative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
