On appeal, the defendant claims that the court (1) erred in admitting a 911 recording into evidence, (2) erroneously found that the defendant had violated his probation, and (3) abused its discretion in imposing a sentence of three years incarceration. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the issues on appeal. On July 20, 2012, the defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-59 (a) (4), and sentenced to six years incarceration, execution suspended after ten months, followed by five years of probation. On June 23, 2015, during his period of probation, the defendant\n   punched the victim\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the face, causing her to suffer a swollen and bloody lip, as well as loose teeth. The victim called 911, reported the incident and requested an ambulance. Bridgeport Police Officer Minerva Feliciano was dispatched to the victim's home to investigate a domestic violence assault. When Feliciano arrived, the victim had already been transported to Bridgeport Hospital. Feliciano drove to the hospital, and found the victim crying with a swollen and bloody lip. On the same day, the defendant called his probation officer, Patrick Higgins, and told him that he had gotten into an altercation with the victim and that she had possibly called the police. On August 1, 2015, the defendant was arrested for this incident and charged with assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61. Rather than charge the defendant with a violation of\n   probation immediately, Higgins arranged for him to attend anger management classes, but the defendant did not attend. On October 6, 2015, the state obtained an arrest warrant for the defendant for violation of probation pursuant to \u00a7 53a-32 on the basis of the domestic violence incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following the violation of probation hearing on December 1, 2015, the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant, by assaulting the victim, violated a criminal law, \u00a7 53a-61, thereby violating a general condition of his probation. As a result of this violation, the court revoked the defendant's probation and sentenced him to sixty-two months incarceration, execution suspended after three years, followed by three years of probation. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court erred in admitting the 911 recording into evidence at the violation of probation hearing. Specifically, the defendant argues that \"[t]he trial court erred in admitting the 911 tape as reliable hearsay, as it was unreliable and uncorroborated, not admissible under any applicable hearsay exception, and admitted in violation of the defendant's due process rights.\" The defendant also argues that the 911 recording was not properly authenticated. To the extent this claim is not preserved, the defendant seeks review pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), or, alternatively, reversal as plain error. The state counters that the trial court reasonably exercised its discretion in overruling the defendant's objection to the admission of the recording of the victim's 911 call. The state also argues that the defendant cannot prevail on his due process claim because the record is inadequate to review that claim. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this claim. At the violation of probation hearing, the state presented the testimony of Feliciano and Higgins. The state also introduced a copy of the victim's medical records into evidence and sought to introduce an audio recording of the victim's 911 call. The defendant objected to the admission of the 911 recording, stating the grounds for his objection as a \"lack of foundation.\" The court overruled his objection and allowed the 911 recording to be admitted into evidence as a full exhibit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the 911 recording,\n   the victim\n   reported to the dispatcher that the defendant had \"hit [her] and put his hands on [her] and ... [her] teeth ... [were] messed up\" and that \"[h]e hit [her] in [her] mouth.\" The victim identified the defendant both by name and physical description, and also gave her own name and address to the dispatcher. Officer Feliciano testified that she was dispatched to the victim's address and later identified the victim by the same name at the hospital. While at the hospital, Feliciano also noticed that the victim had the injuries described in the 911 recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We turn to the defendant's claim that the trial court erred in admitting the 911 recording because it was not properly authenticated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state concedes that the\n   defendant's authentication claim was properly preserved by the defendant's timely \"lack of foundation\" objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We first set forth our standard of review. Challenges to a trial court's evidentiary rulings in a probation revocation hearing \"will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the [defendant] of substantial prejudice or injustice.... In reviewing claims that the trial court abused its discretion, great weight is given to the trial court's decision and every reasonable presumption is given in favor of its correctness.... We will reverse the trial court's ruling only if it could not reasonably conclude as it did.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187990\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/81/710/#p714\">\n    81 Conn.

The court identified the unique numbering system of the recording to link it to this incident, as well as the contents of the recording and circumstances surrounding the incident, in order to authenticate that the recording was what the prosecutor claimed it to\n   be. The defendant never questioned that the voice on the 911 recording was anything other than the victim's voice.

The defendant did not request that the court conduct the\n   <em>\n    Shakir\n   </em>\n   balancing test to determine whether good cause existed for not allowing the defendant to confront the victim. The state had no notice of the defendant's due process claim, and, accordingly, did not present evidence regarding its reasons for not producing the victim at this phase of the hearing. The record is silent as to the state's reasons for producing the 911 recording in lieu of the victim's testimony in the evidentiary phase of the probation revocation hearing, when she testified at the dispositional phase of the hearing later that day, and whether those reasons amounted to good cause.

The state elicited testimony from Higgins, who testified that the defendant called him on June 23, 2015, to tell him that the defendant had gotten into an altercation with the victim and that she had possibly called the police. The state also offered into evidence the victim's medical records describing her swollen, bloody lip and loose teeth. Feliciano testified that she was dispatched to the victim's address following the 911 call; she later interviewed the victim at the hospital and observed her injuries. The court also properly considered the authenticated 911 call, in which the victim identified the defendant as the person who assaulted her. Accordingly, we conclude that it was not clearly erroneous for the court to find that the defendant had violated his probation on the foregoing basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The defendant also claims that the court abused its discretion by revoking his probation and imposing an\n   additional three years incarceration. Having already determined that the state presented sufficient evidence to find a violation of probation, we now turn to the dispositional phase of the revocation of probation hearing.
