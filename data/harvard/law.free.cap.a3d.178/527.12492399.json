Haynesworth had no motor vehicle liability insurance coverage. In the Circuit Court for Prince George's County, Duckett-Murray filed suit for damages against Haynesworth and Encompass Insurance Company of America (\"Encompass\"), also an appellee, her own motor vehicle liability and UM insurance carrier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Duckett-Murray and Encompass filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment on the issue of the applicable UM limits. Duckett-Murray argued that by statute her policy's UM limits necessarily were equal to her policy's $300,000 liability limits. Encompass argued that the UM limits were $75,000, as stated on the policy declarations page. The circuit\n   court issued a memorandum opinion and order ruling that the applicable UM limits were $75,000 and granting partial summary judgment in favor of Encompass.\n   In a jury trial, Haynesworth was found liable to Duckett-Murray for $192,148.15 in damages. The court entered judgment against Haynesworth in the full amount of the verdict and against Encompass for $75,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, Duckett-Murray presents one question, which we have rephrased:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Did the circuit court err by ruling that the UM limits on her automobile insurance policy were not equal to the policy's liability limits?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We answer that question in the affirmative. We shall vacate the judgment against Encompass for $75,000 and remand the case for the court to enter judgment in favor of Duckett-Murray and against Encompass for $192,148.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By 1992, Md. Laws, Chap. 641 (\"the 1992 Law\"), the General Assembly amended Maryland's motor vehicle insurance laws to state that \"[u]nless waived ... the amount of [UM] coverage provided under a private passenger motor vehicle liability insurance policy shall equal the amount of liability coverage provided under the policy.\" Md. Code (1997, 2011 Repl. Vol., 2013 Supp.), \u00a7 19-509(e)(2) of the Insurance Article (\"Ins.\"). To be effective, a waiver of equality of coverage must be in writing and made by the \"first named insured\" under the policy. Ins. \u00a7 19-510(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 1992 Law included two sections that were not codified. Section 2 stated that \"[t]his Act shall apply only to motor vehicle insurance policies issued or delivered on or after the effective date of this Act[,]\" and section 3 established an effective date of October 1, 1992.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The accident that gave rise to the lawsuit in this case happened on January 3, 2014. At that time, Duckett-Murray was insured under a \"USP Deluxe\" policy from Encompass, for the policy period November 4, 2013, through November 4, 2014. Barbara Duckett (\"Barbara\"), Duckett-Murray's mother, was identified on the declarations page as the \"Policyholder.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The policy covered two vehicles: a 2003 Chrysler Town &amp; Country driven by Barbara and a 2008 Dodge Charger driven by Duckett-Murray. Barbara, Duckett-Murray, and Barbara's sister, Bertha Duckett (\"Bertha\"), were listed as drivers on the policy. The declarations page showed liability limits of $300,000 and UM limits of $75,000. It is undisputed that neither Barbara nor any prior policyholder ever executed a written waiver of UM coverage equal to liability coverage consistent with Ins. sections 19-509 and 19-510.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On cross-motions for summary judgment, the parties presented evidence pertinent to when the policy was \"issued or delivered.\" That evidence showed that on October 30, 1987, Edison Duckett (\"Edison\"), Barbara and Bertha's father and Duckett-Murray's grandfather, applied to CNA Insurance Companies (\"CNA\") for a combined policy of homeowners and automobile insurance. At that time, Edison; his wife, Mary Duckett (\"Mary\"); Barbara, then age 33; Bertha, then age 30; and Duckett-Murray, then age 10, all were living at 12809 Heatherwich Court, in Brandywine. Barbara and Duckett-Murray\n   continue to live at the Heatherwich Court residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 4, 1987, \"Universal Security Deluxe Policy\" No. US6021509 was issued to \"Named Insured[s]\" \"Edison and Mary and Barbara Duckett.\" The \"New Business Coverage Summary\" pages identified CNA as the insurer and Continental Casualty Company (\"CCC\") as the insurance underwriter. The liability limit was $300,000 and the UM limit\n   was $50,000. Three vehicles were covered: a 1987 Chevrolet Celebrity, a 1986 Ford Escort, and a 1980 Ford Pinto. Edison, Mary, and Bertha were listed as drivers, but Barbara was not. In fact, Barbara had her own automobile insurance policy with Allstate. The only reason Barbara was included as a \"Named Insured\" on the policy was because it covered the Heatherwich Court residence and she was a mortgagor on the house, along with her parents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The next year, for the policy period November 4, 1988, through November 4, 1989, only Edison was listed as a \"Named Insured.\" The policy was renewed for the policy years beginning November 4, 1988, through November 4, 1994, with Edison as the \"Named Insured\" and the coverage limits, number of vehicles covered, and drivers unchanged. In policy years 1990 through 1993, various automobiles were substituted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Beginning November 4, 1995, the policy name changed from \"Universal Security Deluxe Policy\" to \"USP Deluxe.\" The policy number, limits, vehicles, and drivers were unchanged. Edison remained the sole \"Named Insured.\" Beginning November 4, 1996, the name of the policy underwriter was changed from CCC to Continental Insurance Company (\"Continental\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The policy was renewed with no changes on November 4, 1997. On November 4, 1998, the policy was renewed but the Nissan Maxima assigned to Edison was removed and not replaced, so only two vehicles were covered, not three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 30, 1999, an endorsement added Barbara as a \"Policyholder\" and as a driver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Edison, Mary, and Bertha continued to be listed as drivers. Two vehicles were covered: one assigned to Mary and one to Bertha.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 4, 1999, the policy was renewed with liability limits remaining at $300,000, but with UM limits increased to $55,000, consistent with a change in the statutory minimum. Edison and Barbara remained the \"Policyholders.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Edison died in August of 2000. The policy was renewed on November 4, 2000, with no changes. On November 4, 2001, the policy was again renewed, still listing Edison and Barbara as \"Policyholders,\" but not listing Edison as a driver. The policy number, liability limits, and UM limits remained\n   unchanged, although the policy stated that it now was being issued by Glens Falls Insurance Company (\"Glens Falls\"). The policy was renewed on November 4, 2002, still with \"Edison &amp; Barbara Duckett\" listed as the \"Policyholders.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On December 23, 2002, the policy was amended by endorsement to delete Edison as a \"Policyholder\" and add Mary. Thus, \"Barbara &amp; Mary Duckett\" were now the \"Policyholders.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On November 4, 2003, Duckett-Murray, then age 26, was added as a driver, and a third vehicle, a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee, was added. \"Barbara and Mary Duckett\" remained the \"Policyholders.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bertha and Mary also were listed as drivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The \"USP Deluxe Renewal Policy\" for the November 4, 2004, through November 4, 2005 policy period bore a new policy number, No. # 261526627, and stated that it was being issued by Encompass, \"Formerly known as CNA Personal Insurance.\" The \"Coverage Summary\" page stated \"Policyholder\n   Since: 11/1987.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"Policyholders\" and coverage limits remained unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The USP Deluxe Renewal policy was renewed on November 4, 2005. The \"Renewal Policy Coverage Summary\" states: \"Policy Number: 261526627. This is a replacement of policy 006021509.\" It further states that the issuer is \"Encompass Insurance Formerly known as CNA Personal Insurance\" and includes the \"Policyholder Since: 11/1987\" language. The policy was renewed again on November 4, 2006, with no changes. The policy was renewed on November 4, 2007, with two vehicles covered instead of three.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In December 2007, Mary died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 4, 2008, the policy was renewed with \"Barbara Duckett\" as the sole \"Policyholder.\" Barbara renewed the policy in 2009 and again in 2010. Beginning November 4, 2011, the UM coverage was increased to $75,000, consistent with changes to the statutory minimum, while the liability coverage remained unchanged. A third covered vehicle, a 2008 Dodge Charger, was added.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The policy was renewed on November 4, 2012, with the 1998 Dodge Stratus removed, so the policy only covered two vehicles. On November 4, 2013, the policy was renewed with no changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As mentioned, the accident giving rise to this lawsuit occurred on January 3, 2014, during the 2013 policy period. Duckett-Murray made a claim against Encompass for UM benefits up to the $300,000 liability limits under the policy. Encompass took the position that the stated $75,000 UM limits applied. Duckett-Murray filed suit against Haynesworth and Encompass on May 21, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On July 1, 2016, Duckett-Murray moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that because Ins. section 19-509(e)(2) requires UM limits to equal liability limits for a private passenger automobile insurance policy, absent an affirmative written waiver, and because neither Barbara nor any other Policyholder made such a waiver, the UM benefits recoverable under the policy automatically were up to the $300,000 liability limits. Encompass filed a timely opposition to Duckett-Murray's motion\n   and a cross-motion for partial summary judgment. It maintained that Ins. section 19-509(e)(2) did not apply to the policy covering Duckett-Murray because that policy was not \"issued or delivered\" on or after October 1, 1992, having been continuously renewed since 1987.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court heard argument on September 1, 2016, and, on September 14, 2016, entered a memorandum opinion and order. It ruled that the policy covering Duckett-Murray had been issued and delivered in 1987 and renewed continuously thereafter, opining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   While there have been numerous changes to the policy, they are those of the routine variety. Individuals frequently change the covered drivers when necessary and change the covered vehicle when they purchase a new car. They then proceed to renew their coverage at the expiration of each term. This Court finds that is what the Duckett family did here. They renewed their motor vehicle insurance policy every November since the policy was issued in 1987. The best evidence is the most recent renewal itself that indicates \"Policyholder Since: 11/1987.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court concluded that because the policy merely was renewed yearly after it was first purchased in 1987, it was not \"issued or delivered\" after October 1, 1992, and, therefore, a waiver of enhanced UM coverage limits was not required. It relied upon\n   <em>\n    World Insurance Co. v. Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2211948\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/210/449/#p454\">\n    210 Md. 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 454,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20A.2d%20259\">\n    124 A.2d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1956), which holds that \"a renewal of an insurance policy by the payment of a new premium and the issuance of a receipt therefor, where the renewal is in pursuance of a provision to that effect, is not a new contract but an extension of the old.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A jury trial went forward on October 3-4, 2016, and, as mentioned, the jury found in favor of Duckett-Murray, and against Haynesworth, awarding damages of $192,148.15. On October 18, 2016, the court entered judgment against Haynesworth for $192,148.15 and Encompass for $75,000. Duckett-Murray noted a timely appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Duckett-Murray contends the circuit court's interpretation and application of uncodified section 2 of the 1992 Law is \"inconsistent with the text and purpose of the remedial statute creating a default of matching limits of liability coverage and uninsured motorist benefits.\" In her view, the legislature adopted a policy that favors equality of liability and UM coverage limits, by making that the default coverage circumstance absent an affirmative written waiver; and it intended for that policy to apply to motor vehicle insurance policies such as the one here, which, although labeled as a \"renewal\" policy, \"was not issued to the same person to whom it was issued on the effective date of\" the 1992 Law and \"was not issued by the same company, or an affiliated company, that issued\" the policy in 1992. She maintains that because, under Ins. section 19-510(a)(1), the \"first named insured\" has the power to execute a waiver of enhanced UM coverage on behalf of the other insureds, any time the first named insured under the policy changes, as happened here in 2002 and again in 2008, there is a new contract, not a policy renewal. In that circumstance, equality of coverage as mandated by Ins. section 19-509(e)(2) applies, and the new first named insured must be\n   given the opportunity to execute a waiver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Encompass responds that the circuit court correctly ruled that, for purposes of uncodified section 2, only a new policy,\n   not a renewal policy, is a policy \"issued or delivered\" on or after October 1, 1992. In its view, the renewal of a policy first issued and delivered before October 1, 1992, never will trigger the equality of coverage requirement, even if the policy has been renewed multiple times and the renewals have significantly changed the policy over time. Encompass asserts that, after the policy at issue here first was issued in 1987, it became a renewal policy, to which the 1992 Law did not apply. That is so, it maintains, regardless of which named insured actually renewed the policy each year. Encompass argues that\n   <em>\n    Swartzbaugh v. Encompass Ins. of America\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706959\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/425/614/\">\n    425 Md. 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706861,3706959\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/42/587/\">\n    42 A.3d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), supports this position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   No Maryland case has interpreted uncodified section 2, and the UM statute does not define the phrase \"issued or delivered.\" The words \"issued,\" \"sold,\" or \"delivered,\" usually in full or partial combination, appear throughout the motor vehicle insurance title of the Code (Title 19), however. As the author of the leading treatise on Maryland motor vehicle insurance law has commented, \"[t]he phrase 'issue, sell, or deliver' and its derivatives have not been given any special judicial interpretation by Maryland courts.\" Andrew Janquitto,\n   <em>\n    Maryland Motor Vehicle Insurance\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 5.5 at 140 (3d ed. 2011) (footnote omitted) (hereinafter \"Janquitto\"). But the way in which these words are used in Title 19, subtitle 5 \"suggests that 'issued' and 'sold' are synonymous,\" while \"delivery\" stands on its own.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 140-41 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The meaning of \"issued or delivered\" in uncodified section 2 is not entirely clear. From 1975, when UM coverage first was mandated, those words were used broadly: \"[E]ach motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued, sold, or delivered in the State after July 1, 1975, shall contain\" UM coverage as further described. Ins. \u00a7 19-509(c). Likewise, they have been used broadly from 1972 on, in mandating minimum liability coverage amounts: \"Each motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued, sold, or delivered in the State shall provide the minimum liability coverage specified in Title 17 of the Transportation Article.\" Ins. \u00a7 19-504. As the Janquitto treatise points out, because insurance contracts are said to come into\n   existence when sold and delivered, these words may have been used to make clear, for conflict of laws purposes, that any insurance policy formed in the State of Maryland after the effective date of those statutory mandates would need to provide the minimum liability and UM coverages. Janquitto, at 141. There is no case law or history to suggest a distinction between new and renewal policies in that context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The words \"issued or delivered\" in uncodified section 2 are not as broadly phrased as in Ins. sections 19-509(c) and 19-504, however, given the use of the word \"only\" in that section. Rather, they seem to have been meant as a limitation upon the insurance policies to which the 1992 Law would apply. \"This Act shall apply\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to ... policies issued or delivered on or after\" October 1, 1992, implies that there are policies to which the Act will not apply,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those not issued or delivered on or after that date. (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The parties to this appeal are in agreement that the limitation envisioned\n   by the General Assembly in uncodified section 2 applies to ordinary renewal policies. That is, a routine renewal policy is not a policy \"issued or delivered\" within the meaning of section 2. Maryland law is well-established that when an insured renews a policy that permits renewal, and the insurer accepts the renewal, the resulting policy merely is a continuation of the already existing policy.\n   <em>\n    World Insurance Co. v. Perry, supra\n   </em>\n   . We agree with the parties that it is unlikely that the legislature generally intended renewal policies to be included among the policies \"issued or delivered\" on or after October 1, 1992, as that would have eliminated any distinction, for purposes of UM limits, between policies sold or delivered before October 1, 1992, and policies sold or delivered on or after that date. The question is whether there can be circumstances in which a renewal policy that is issued or delivered has changed so much from the policy as originally sold that it is, in effect, a new policy. Duckett-Murray urges a broad reading of uncodified section 2 to that effect, while Encompass urges a narrow reading, so\n   that only a new contractual relationship with a new customer is a policy \"issued or delivered\" under uncodified section 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In determining the meaning of uncodified section 2, we must \"ascertain and effectuate the intent of the General Assembly.\"\n   <em>\n    Bottini v.

If the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written. In addition, we neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words that the General Assembly used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute's meaning.

In\n   <em>\n    Swartzbaugh\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals held that \"first named insured\" under Ins. section 19-510 means any of the named insureds on the policy declarations page. There, a husband and wife both were listed as \"Policyholders\" on the declarations page, with the husband's name first. The wife signed a UM coverage limits waiver as the \"first named insured,\" consistent with Ins. section 19-510, electing UM coverage limits less than liability limits (and therefore a lower annual premium). When the couple's daughter, who was insured under the policy, was injured in an accident caused by an underinsured driver, she brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that her mother's waiver of UM coverage equal to liability coverage was ineffective because her mother was not the \"first named insured\" on the policy.

The Court concluded that \"in the context of a motor vehicle insurance policy, the phrase 'first named insured' refers to a person insured under the policy and specifically named in the policy, who acts on behalf of the other insured parties and is designated as such in the policy documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Swartzbaugh\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706959\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/425/614/\">\n    425 Md. at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706861,3706959\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/42/587/\">\n    42 A.3d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Twelve years later, in 1990, Allstate offered him UM coverage, which he\n   rejected in writing. Effective January 1, 1993, Hawaii state law changed so that in some situations insurers were required to give their insureds the \"option to select [UM coverage] ... up to but not greater than the bodily injury liability coverage limits in the insured's policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262871\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/93/210/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262871\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/93/210/\">\n    at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262871\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/93/210/\">\n    998 P.2d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Hawaii's Revised Statutes \u00a7 431:10C-301(d) (1993) ).

Clyde signed a written waiver rejecting that coverage. Allstate issued a renewal policy to Clyde in February 1994. On March 3, 1994, he requested several amendments to the renewal policy. Most significantly, he advised his insurance agent that he and Kaneshiro were separated and were in the process of getting a divorce and asked that his name be removed from the policy and that Kaneshiro be substituted in his place as the named insured. After he signed a release, a renewal policy was issued in Kaneshiro's name only, with that change made retroactive to March 1, 1994.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Kaneshiro renewed the policy on September 1, 1994, adding another vehicle. On September 10, 1994, she was injured in a car accident. Allstate denied her claim for UM benefits and then filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district court. Kaneshiro counterclaimed. The federal district court certified to the Supreme Court of Hawaii the question whether an insurer that already had made an offer of enhanced UM coverage to its insured after\n   January 1, 1993, must reoffer enhanced UM coverage if the named insured is removed and replaced with a new named insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Hawaii Supreme Court answered the certified question in the affirmative. It explained that the central dispute was\n   whether the policy issued to Kaneshiro on March 1, 1994, was a new policy or merely a \"renewal or replacement policy.\" After reviewing cases from around the country, the court held that \"when a material change is made to an existing policy, the resulting policy is not a 'renewal or replacement policy' and a new offer of [UM] coverage is required.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262871\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/93/210/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262871\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/93/210/\">\n    at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262871\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/93/210/\">\n    998 P.2d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In so deciding, the court emphasized the remedial purpose of the UM statute, explaining that, under the circumstances, requiring a new notice would advance the legislative goals of informing consumers of their UM coverage rights and ensuring that consumers will make choices with adequate knowledge. The requirement would not cause insurers to incur additional costs when merely issuing renewal or replacement policies that have not changed in any material respect. The court stressed that Kaneshiro's substitution for Clyde altered the relationship between Clyde and Allstate, in that he was no longer insured; and altered the relationship between Allstate and Kaneshiro, in that she became a named insured. The addition of a new vehicle also was a material change because it caused the premium to increase by more than $200. The court concluded that Allstate had been required to make a new offer of enhanced UM coverage to Kaneshiro and, because it had failed to do so, UM coverage in an amount equal to the liability coverage would be implied in the policy as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Other courts likewise have adopted a \"materiality\" standard to assess whether a renewal policy is tantamount to a new policy for purposes of applying UM equality of coverage laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matheny v.

[whenever] an insured makes a 'material change' in coverage-whether by modifying liability limits or by adding or substituting vehicles\").\n   For many of the same reasons expressed by the courts in\n   <em>\n    Iverson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kaneshiro\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that a narrow interpretation of uncodified section 2 to limit equality of coverage to policies of new business \"issued or delivered\" on or after October 1, 1992, will undermine the General Assembly's purpose in enacting Ins. section 19-509(e)(2). The change in the law to make equality of liability and UM coverage the rule, and inequality of coverage the exception, was major and was aimed at providing full recovery to the highest number of victims of uninsured and underinsured motorists, with the financial risk and burden being borne by the private sector.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Uncodified section 2 must be read to further the legislative goal to expand the number of victims eligible for full recovery by means of equal UM benefits. Therefore, for purposes of the equality of coverage statute, changes to a policy that alter the level of risk insured, or introduce new decision-makers, so as to remove the policy from being a mere\n   continuation of coverage, should not be treated differently from \"new business\" policies. Accordingly, a policy \"issued or delivered\" on or after October 1, 1992, as that phrase is used in uncodified section 2, either is a policy of new business or an existing policy that through renewals has materially changed so as to \"meaningfully alter the risk relationship between the insurer and the insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Iverson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6986986\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/256/222/#p223\">\n    256 P.3d at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The \"materiality\" inquiry necessarily will depend upon the unique facts of each case considered in light of the totality of the circumstances. In some cases, the facts pertinent to whether changes to a policy are material, so as to effectively create a new policy for purposes of equality of UM coverage, will be in dispute, requiring a decision by the trier-of-fact. Here, the facts are not in dispute, and therefore we shall consider whether they constitute a material change as a matter of law. We conclude that a multitude of significant changes in the policy after October 1, 1992, resulted in a materially altered policy issued and delivered-and not simply renewed-after that date, requiring Encompass to make Barbara an offer of UM coverage equal to liability coverage, which it did not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The policy of insurance was renewed 22 times after October 1, 1992, and before the accident. Before October 1, 1992, Edison was the Policyholder, he and Mary and Bertha were the drivers, and the policy covered three vehicles, one for each driver. From November 1998, through November 2000, there were three major coverage changes. Edison's vehicle was removed (November 1998), so that only two vehicles were covered; Barbara was added as a Policyholder and a driver (July 1999); and Edison died and therefore no longer was a driver or Policyholder (August 2000). From the time of Edison's death in 2000 until Mary was added as a Policyholder in 2002, Barbara, who had not had any involvement with the policy before the 1992 Law went into effect, was the sole Policyholder in a position to make any decisions about the policy. (Edison was listed as a Policyholder after his death, but obviously could not make decisions). Moreover, in that same\n   time period, the risks covered changed, as Edison no longer was a driver, his vehicle was not covered, and the policy covered only two vehicles, not three. (Indeed, the number of vehicles covered did not return to three until Duckett-Murray was added to the policy in November 2003.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The changes in risks covered in that period of time were reflected by premium changes as well: from November 4, 1999, to November 4, 2001, the premium for motor vehicle insurance under the policy decreased by $821. That means that during\n   the time that Barbara was effectively the sole Policyholder-after Edison died and before Mary was added as a Policyholder-expanded UM coverage equal to liability coverage might not have resulted in a premium increase and it would have been Barbara's sole decision whether to execute a waiver of equal coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the risks covered were meaningfully altered and the decision about a waiver was in the hands of someone with no connection to the policy before equality of coverage became the law on October 1, 1992.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   There were many other significant changes to the policy in subsequent years. Indeed, by the time of the policy year in which the accident happened, Mary had died and Barbara was the sole Policyholder; Duckett-Murray, who was not an insured driver in 1992, was a driver and her vehicle was covered; the policy again insured three vehicles; and none of those vehicles had been covered under the policy in 1992. Bertha was the only driver under the 1992 policy who still was a driver under the policy at the time of the accident. The insuring company had changed (although there is no evidence as to why), as had the policy number. We are not suggesting that these changes, in and of themselves, would not have been\n   sufficient to make the policy effectively \"new.\" We conclude, however, that the changes in the policy during the 1998 through 2000 period took it out of the category of a routine renewal policy and triggered application of equality of coverage under Ins. section 19-509(e)(2). They were major material changes that altered the risks insured and the decision-makers and would have justified the insureds' thinking that the policy was new.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Because there was no waiver, the Policy must be treated as providing UM coverage limits equal to the $300,000 liability limits, as a matter of law.
