In this case, involving a rupture of a buried water main line, the question is whether evidence of water leaks generally and a failure to adequately maintain an aging water system is enough to create a jury question with respect to a buried water line that ruptures, either because it is sufficient to give rise to an inference of a specific act of negligence or it is sufficient to invoke res ipsa loquitur. We conclude that the evidence is legally insufficient to create a jury question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Circuit Court for Baltimore City entered summary judgment in favor of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (\"the City\"), the appellee, in a negligence suit brought against it by Brenda Colbert, appellant. In February 2015, an underground water main ruptured in close proximity to appellant's residence, causing flooding in her home. Appellant notified the\n   City, which denied liability. In her complaint, appellant alleged that the City negligently failed to properly maintain the water main. In this timely appeal, appellant contends that the circuit court's grant of summary judgment was legally incorrect. She presents the following issues for our consideration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1) Whether the circuit court erred by finding no dispute of material fact existed as to whether the City had actual knowledge of the defective condition of the water main;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2) Whether the circuit court erred in determining that no dispute of material fact existed as to whether the City had\n   constructive knowledge of the defective condition of the water main; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   3) Whether the circuit court erred in determining that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was inapplicable to this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties do not dispute that, on February 20, 2015, an 8-inch cast iron water main line that, in 1939, was buried beneath Elmley Avenue in Baltimore City, ruptured and caused water to flood the basement of appellant's house, which was located at 3544 Elmley Avenue. Appellant notified the City of her claim pursuant to the Local Government Tort Claims Act, Md. Code (2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-304 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"CJP\"). The City denied her claim. Subsequently, appellant filed a negligence action in the circuit court. In her amended complaint, appellant alleged that the City had breached its duty to maintain its water mains and protect her from resulting damages. Specifically, she alleged that the City was aware that its water system was \"quite old,\" that it had suffered years of neglect, that there was an increase in \"non-seasonal breaks,\" and that \" 'an out-of-sight, out-of-mind attitude has left [the City] with far too many crumbling water lines.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The City filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that there was no evidence that, prior to the break, it\n   had either actual or constructive notice of a defective condition in the water main beneath Elmley Avenue. The City argued that \"any defect with the water main was not of a 'nature' that [it] would have learned of its existence prior to the water main break because the water main was buried beneath the street.\" In support of its motion, the City provided an affidavit from its designated representative, Arthur Shapiro, the chief of the office of engineering and construction at the Department of Public Works and a map from the Department of Public Works depicting the water main in question. In his affidavit, Mr. Shapiro averred that the City had no knowledge of a defective condition in the eight inch cast iron water main on Elmley Avenue prior to the water main break on February 20, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellant opposed the motion for summary judgment, arguing that whether the City knew or should have known of the defective condition of the water main was a question for the jury. Appellant relied on data sheets, investigative reports, and work orders dating from 2014 to the time of the break that showed a number of \"incidents and water leaks,\" including water leaks on Elmley Avenue on November 10, 2014, and January 5, 13, and 23, 2015. The documents indicate that the incidents included complaints of water in basements and a leaking water meter. It appears from the documents that the leaks were remedied. There is no evidence that the leaks were from the main line. Appellant also directed the court's attention to statements on the Department of Public Works' webpage acknowledging that the City had \"noticed an increase in non-seasonal breaks,\" that \"many [water mains] are not in a serviceable state,\" and that \"[y]ears of an out-of-sight, out-of-mind attitude has left us with far too many crumbling water lines.\" In addition, appellant referenced newspaper articles in which the City acknowledged that it was replacing only five miles or less of pipe per year, that the replacement efforts were \"far short of what's needed,\" and that the City had not been keeping up \"with the maintenance that's needed over the past 40 to 50 years.\" Acknowledging that she had no evidence of knowledge of a defect in the main line,\n   appellant argued\n   that water leaks generally were \"symptomatic of a broader problem\" from which a trier of fact could \"infer that the City had notice that there were problems with the main itself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the alternative, appellant argued that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied and thus, even if the City did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the water main's specific condition, a genuine dispute of material fact existed as to whether such a break would ordinarily not occur in the absence of negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The City filed a reply to appellant's opposition and attached excerpts and exhibits from the deposition of Mr. Shapiro.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After a hearing on September 6, 2016, the court concluded that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was not applicable. The court also concluded that there was no evidence in the record to support appellant's argument that leaks in the City's water lines and the general need for maintenance \"were symptomatic of a larger problem[.]\" The court concluded that appellant failed to establish through facts admissible in evidence that the City had actual or constructive notice of a defect in the water main prior to the rupture on February 20, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A circuit court may grant a motion for summary judgment \"if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Md.

Appellant explains that Mr. Shapiro was \"entirely unfamiliar with the City's own information sheet expressly mapping the condition of the water main[.]\" Appellant argues that the circuit court improperly weighed the evidence, determined Mr. Shapiro's credibility, discounted the documents she provided, ignored \"the City's own admissions as to its neglect of the City's water main,\" and ignored the three prior complaints in close proximity to her home. According to appellant, the circuit court's ruling \"effectively absolves the City of any responsibility for maintenance of its water mains\" because \"the City operates on a complaint-driven and purely reactionary maintenance system for water mains[.]\" In support of her arguments, Colbert relies on\n   <em>\n    Keen v. City of Havre de Grace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2083888\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/93/34/\">\n    93 Md. 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20A.%20444\">\n    48 A. 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 445 (1901), in which the Court of Appeals cautioned that \"[i]t is the duty of the municipal authorities to exercise an active vigilance over the streets ... [t]hey cannot fold their arms and shut their eyes and say they have no notice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Appellant failed to present any evidence to dispute Mr. Shapiro's testimony that the City had no actual knowledge of a defective condition in the water main. Even though, before the leak in question, there were complaints of leaks in close proximity to appellant's home, and accepting that the City had trouble keeping up with needed maintenance projects, the evidence fell short of establishing that the City had actual or constructive notice that there was a defective condition in the water main in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Appellant relied upon the age of the water main, newspaper articles, a screenshot of the Department of Public Works' webpage, and the City's repair records for the area close to her property to support her contention that the City knew that its water system was old and in need of repair, that defective water mains were widespread throughout the City, and that there were multiple water leaks in the months leading up to the break in the subject water main. There was no evidence presented, however, to counter Mr. Shapiro's\n   deposition testimony that the \"longevity\" of the subject water main pipe, which was installed in 1939, \"is upwards of 120 years.\" Nor was there anything in the City's service records to link prior repairs or prior leaks to a defect in the subject water main. In addition, the nature of the defect in the water main was not readily observable because it was buried beneath the street. In short, there was no admissible evidence to suggest that the City should have learned of a defective condition in the subject water main by exercising reasonable care. As a result, the circuit court did not err in concluding that the City did not have actual or constructive notice of a defect in the water main prior to the break.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Appellant also contends that the circuit court erred in declining to apply the\n   doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. We disagree and explain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ordinarily, in an action for negligence, a plaintiff must present evidence tending to show that the defendant was legally responsible for his or her injury because that injury might have been caused by something other than the defendant's negligence.\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tele.
