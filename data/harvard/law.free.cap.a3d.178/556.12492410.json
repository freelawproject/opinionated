Episode aired 10 April 2003)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the core of this post-conviction case is the rectitude of the failure of trial counsel for Appellee, Kevin Armstead, to\n   object to a so-called \"anti-CSI effect\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question propounded on 25 March 2009 to the venire by a trial judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Armstead contends that that failure amounts to ineffective assistance of trial counsel because he would have had a reasonable probability of success on direct appeal had a challenge to the propriety of the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question been preserved. The circuit court granted Armstead a new trial in 2016 in this post-conviction proceeding, which Armstead initiated in 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant, the State of Maryland, complains that the award of a new trial is inappropriate because, on 25 March 2009, Maryland common law (such as it was) approved of such a CSI question. Mistakenly, according to the State, the 2016 post-conviction court relied on contrary, subsequently-decided case law to justify ordering a retrial. The State maintains that Armstead's trial counsel was not obligated in 2009 to \"see into the future\" and anticipate the outcomes in the later-decided cases. Moreover, Armstead \"did not call his trial defense counsel, or any other attorney, as a witness [in the post-conviction phase] to testify concerning the propriety of trial counsel's deliberate [trial strategy] decision not to object to the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question.\" Thus, \"there is no basis in which the post-conviction court could conclude that Armstead's [t]rial counsel was ineffective as alleged.\" Armstead failed, therefore, to satisfy his burden under the factors in\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to prove ineffective assistance of counsel. The State argued also that Armstead failed to demonstrate satisfactorily how he was prejudiced by the lack of an objection, the second factor in the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this appeal, Appellant poses one question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   I. Did the post-conviction court err when it determined, based on case law that issued after Armstead's trial, that Armstead's trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the circuit court's issuance of a CSI\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We hold that the post-conviction court erred when it granted Armstead's petition and ordered a new trial. Armstead's trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the CSI\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question. Even if we assumed his trial counsel's omission constituted ineffective representation, the claimed error was harmless, beyond a reasonable doubt, on the circumstances of this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Statement of Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We, like the post-conviction court, adopt in relevant part the summary of the evidence presented at Armstead's 2009 trial, as stated in our opinion regarding Armstead's direct appeal,\n   <em>\n    Armstead v.

He was discovered by his daughter, Deneen Woods, and his grandson, Ricardo McDonald.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Woods testified at trial that she had seen [Armstead], also known as \"Muggs,\" on the block on prior occasions with [Jamal] Fulton, who she knew as \"Nube,\" and with Trendon and Tremaine Washington, twin brothers, both of whom she knew as \"Twin.\" Fulton lived in the house next door, 500 East 43rd Street. Drugs were a \"big problem\" with Fulton. On the Friday before Woods's father was murdered, Fulton came to 502 East 43rd Street and argued with Paige. Fulton told Woods that her father was \"making his spot hot.\" Woods responded by telling Fulton that she did not want any drugs to be around her father, and Fulton replied that \"he would not say nothing else to [her] dad.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   At some point after Paige's death, Woods spoke to a person in the neighborhood she knew as \"Lurch.\" Lurch\n   provided Woods with some information, and Woods conveyed that information to Detective James Lloyd.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Leroy Simon testified that he is known as \"Lurch\" and that he knew Paige through Woods. In late March 2007, intending to exchange drugs for sex, he was with a woman behind the victim's residence. At that time, he saw [Armstead], Fulton, known to him as \"Nuke,\" and \"Twin\" and another unidentified individual near Paige's house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   He observed [Armstead] go into Paige's house first, and then he heard some \"tussling.\" A few minutes later, he saw \"Twin\" enter the house. Fulton went inside the residence as well. The unidentified person remained outside the residence where he was giving orders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   After [Armstead], Fulton, and \"Twin\" were inside, Simon heard gunshots. He then heard sounds as if someone was sweeping up some glass and then saw the trio emerge from the residence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Simon knew both Tremaine and Trendon Washington, and was aware that one of them was incarcerated at the time. He identified a photograph of Trendon Washington as the person he was referring to as \"Twin\" in his testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   After Simon testified that he spoke to Detective Lloyd on three occasions, the State sought to refresh his recollection with a statement, but Simon testified that he could not read or write. Because there was some confusion about whether Simon ever told police that he saw Fulton enter the residence, the jury was excused, and the tape of Simon's third interview was played to refresh Simon's recollection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   After the jury returned, Simon testified that Fulton was standing outside of the house and actually never went inside. Simon admitted he had made a mistake earlier during his testimony when he said Fulton had gone inside.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Simon continued his testimony as follows: While [Armstead], \"Twin\" (Trendon Washington), and an unidentified third person were inside the residence, Simon heard tussling. After he heard these sounds, Fulton, \"who remained outside, hollered, 'handle your business.' \" Simon then heard\n   two to three gunshots. After the shooting, Simon saw all four individuals run from the residence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Simon identified a photo of [Armstead] as a person who was present at the crime scene and had entered the residence.\n   </em>\n   He also identified both Tremaine and Trendon Washington, distinguishing between them and identifying Trendon Washington as the twin present at the scene. Simon was originally unable\n   to identify the person who remained outside the residence, but, after refreshing his recollection, recalled that during the third interview with police, he identified a photograph of Fulton, indicating that he was the one who stayed outside and \"gave orders.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Asked why he did not go to the police earlier, Simon stated: \"It ain't good to snitch, it ain't good to snitch. Snitchers get stitches, that's how I always looked at it.\" However, when he learned that the victim was Wood[s]'s father, Simon decided to come forward. He learned two days after he saw the individuals at Paige's residence that Paige had died.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   On cross-examination, Simon testified that he had not testified in the trial involving Trendon Washington and that he was incarcerated when he first spoke to Detective Lloyd about this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Detective Chris Glanville testified that he encountered [Armstead], and both Trendon and Tremaine Washington, on [28 April 2007]. At that time, he recovered a loaded .45 caliber Springfield nineteen eleven model firearm from Trendon Washington. All of the bullets recovered in this case were .45 auto caliber. The ballistics evidence was compared to the recovered firearm, and two of the cartridge casings recovered from the crime scene were fired from that pistol. Other bullet specimens could neither be identified nor eliminated as being fired from the recovered gun. However, three of the five bullets recovered in this case were fired by the same firearm, while the two remaining bullets lacked proper markings for comparison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Detective Lloyd testified that Trendon Washington, Fulton, and [Armstead] were arrested in connection with this\n   case. [Armstead] was arrested in Decatur, Georgia, where he gave the name \"James L. Jefferson.\" When [Armstead] was interviewed on [10 April 2008],\n   <em>\n    the parties stipulated that [Armstead] stated: \"I already looked up the case. Why am I not just charged with conspiracy, what about the other three?\" The charging documents at that time did not mention conspiracy. Also, Detective Lloyd testified that he had never told [Armstead] about a conspiracy charge or that there were three other people involved in the crime.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Detective Lloyd testified that he was aware that DNA evidence had been collected at the crime scene,\n   <em>\n    but the parties stipulated that all of that evidence came back as being consistent with the victim's DNA. Latent fingerprints recovered from the crime scene were also consistent with being from the victim. Additionally, a search warrant was obtained for [Armstead]'s home and nothing was recovered from that search relating to this investigation.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The State's last witness was the medical examiner, Dr. Theodore King. According to Dr. King, Paige died of multiple gunshot wounds, and the manner of death was homicide. He could not pinpoint the exact time of death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   After the State rested, defense counsel called Fulton. Fulton testified that he knew [Armstead] and that he knew him by the name of \"Muggs.\" Fulton used to live at 500 East 43rd Street in Baltimore City, \"[u]p to prior to [his] arrest\" in 2007. Paige, who Fulton knew as \"Poppy,\" lived next door at 502 East 43rd Street. Fulton also knew Woods, Woods's son, Ricky, and Simon, also known as \"Lurch.\" Fulton stated that he was originally charged with Paige's murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Fulton testified that, on [18 March 2007], Trendon Washington called and asked Fulton to drive him to the \"vial store.\" Trendon Washington sold drugs,\n   including crack and marijuana, and usually stored his drugs in a vacant house located nearby at 508 East 43rd Street. Fulton, along with [Armstead], accompanied Washington to the store to buy vials so he could package his drugs.\n   When they returned, Fulton parked in front of 508 East 43rd Street while Washington went inside. Moments later, Washington emerged and angrily informed them that his drugs were missing and that the back door to that location had been knocked down. Recalling that Paige was outside when the three of them left to go to the \"vial store,\" Washington and [Armstead] then went to Paige's home, while Fulton remained with his car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Trendon Washington engaged Paige in a conversation, but Fulton could not hear what they were saying. After that conversation, Washington and [Armstead] returned to Fulton's car, and Washington said, \"I'm going to go do that.\" Fulton understood this to mean that Washington was going to beat and then kill Paige.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Fulton testified that he saw Trendon Washington the next day, but he did not mention Paige or the drugs. Fulton then saw Trendon Washington again, on [20 March 2007], at around noon or 1:00 p.m., and Fulton asked him where Paige was because he had not seen him in two days. Washington replied, \"I done what I said I was going to do.\" Fulton understood this to mean that Washington had killed Paige. Around 5:00 or 6:00 p.m. that same day, Fulton learned that Paige was dead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Fulton further testified that he had seen Trendon Washington carry a .45 caliber semi-automatic handgun on prior occasions, including in January and February of 2007. Fulton described the gun, and then identified State's Exhibit 6A as Trendon Washington's gun.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   On cross-examination by the State, Fulton confirmed that he was not present at the time of the murder[ ]and, further, that Trendon Washington did not provide him with any details of what he had done. Nor did Washington tell Fulton if he was with anyone at the time of the murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Armstead was charged with \"conspiracy to commit murder, murder, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony and crime of violence, and wearing, carrying and transporting a\n   handgun.\"\n   <em>\n    Armstead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3981856\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/195/599/#p605\">\n    195 Md.

His jury trial lasted from 25 March 2009 to 2 April 2009. During\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   on the first day, the judge queried the venire as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Now I'm going to assume that many of you watch way too much television including those so-called realistic crime shows like Law and Order and CSI New York and CSI Miami and CSI Glenn Burnie and the rest of them. I trust you understand that these crime shows are fantasy and fiction and for dramatic effect to entertain you they claim to rely upon 'scientific evidence' to convict people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   This is certainly acceptable as entertainment but you must not allow your entertainment to interfere with your solemn duties as a juror. Therefore, if you are\n   currently of the view that you cannot convict the defendant without 'scientific evidence' regardless of all of the other evidence in the case and regardless of the instruction that I give you as the law, please stand.\n   <em>\n    All right, I see no responses\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Armstead's trial counsel did not object to this question. The empaneled jury convicted Armstead of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and second-degree murder. The court sentenced him to life imprisonment, plus a consecutive thirty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Armstead filed numerous post-trial motions, all of which the trial court denied. Armstead asserted five questions for review in his direct appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirmed Armstead's conviction in\n   2010. The Court of Appeals denied his petition for\n   <em>\n    writ of certiorari\n   </em>\n   in 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On 1 July 2014, Armstead filed a petition for post-conviction relief, calling-out his trial counsel as ineffective for failing to object to the circuit court's posing of the CSI\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question. As he perceived the query, it deprived him of his Sixth Amendment right\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and his right under Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The circuit court held a hearing on Armstead's post-conviction petition on 6 January 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The post-conviction court granted Armstead's petition and awarded a new trial. The court held, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Although trial counsel is not required to object to every possible trial judge error, trial counsel is ineffective for failing to object to rulings where there is a reasonable probability of success during an appeal ... the question propounded in [Armstead's] case, was inherently ... prejudicial ... Thus, the trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to preserve the issue for appeal because there is a reasonable probability that [Armstead] would have succeeded on appeal had trial counsel objected on the grounds that the question prejudiced the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   panel ... [Armstead's] first allegation of error [ ] is sufficient to grant a new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Appellant's Arguments.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Appellant avers that the post-conviction court granted erroneously Armstead a new trial. In support of its ambition, the State contends that, under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , Armstead failed to overcome the presumption that\n   his trial counsel's inaction in not objecting to the CSI\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question was strategic. Armstead called neither his trial counsel nor any other attorney during his post-conviction hearing as a witness to testify whether his trial counsel's election not to object to the CSI\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question deviated grievously from sound professional judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Furthermore, there was, at the time of the 25 March 2009\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , no reported Maryland jurisprudence suggesting the impropriety of such a CSI\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question. Rather, the common law (such as it was at the time) favored such a\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question. Trial counsel was not expected to possess foresight to anticipate the subsequent change in the law limiting substantially the situations in which a CSI\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question or jury instruction may be appropriate. Appellant finds error also in the post-conviction court's conclusion that, had trial counsel objected to the CSI\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question, \"Armstead stood 'a reasonable probability' of obtaining appellate reversal of his convictions.\" The State maintains \"that there was no evidence before the post-conviction court that Armstead's direct appeal counsel ... would have ... [raised] a challenge to the CSI\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question had that claim been preserved for appellate review.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    b. Appellee's Arguments.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Armstead responds that his trial counsel's failure to object to the court's deployment of the CSI\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question was \"not sound trial strategy because she knew that there was no\n   scientific evidence linking [him] to the crime, and that the very notion served as the substantial basis of the defense theory of innocence.\" Trial counsel's failure to object \"could not have been the result of reasonable professional judgment because it allowed the court to suggest to the jury that the lack of any scientific evidence [connecting him to the crime] could be ignored.\" The inherent prejudicial nature of the court's CSI\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question, notably the court's use of the word \"convict,\" rendered it untenable. This suggested to the potential jurors that convicting Armstead was a foregone conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Further, Armstead contends that he should benefit in this case from the state of the law regarding the proper use of CSI instructions and\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   questions that came into existence following his trial, i.e., the later-decided case law should apply retrospectively.

As to the latter, whether the argued prejudice of\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   questioning carries through in undiluted strength to the jury deliberation process is debatable. Evaluation of prejudice turns ordinarily on a contextual consideration of individual trial records.

Armstead's current case fails each predicate of\n   <em>\n    Allen's\n   </em>\n   analysis to support retrospective application of the relevant post-2009 case law. Moreover, Armstead's reasoning overlooks\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   , which, if applied retrospectively, would work a likely detriment to Armstead's objective. The post-conviction court, therefore, applied erroneously\n   <em>\n    Charles &amp; Drake v.

Dr. Theodore King did an autopsy. He said on the average it's about three hours to do one of those. There was nothing in the autopsy that pointed to Kevin Armstead as the one who murdered Ricardo Paige. Technician Havrilla lifted some suitable prints, and they were examined by Loraine Lansey of the latent print unit, and you can see that in defendant's exhibit 9, it's Teresa Gavrilla's run sheet .... Nothing they found pointed to Kevin Armstead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   The police searched [Armstead's] home and found nothing connecting [Armstead] to the murder.

The DNA that was found belonged to Ricardo Paige, not Kevin Armstead.

Atkins was convicted of second-degree assault because he threatened the victim (in alleged self-defense) using a pocketknife.\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700387\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/421/434/\">\n    421 Md. at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700387\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/421/434/\">\n    26 A.3d at 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Had the missing scientific evidence been offered, it was supposed that it \"could have been direct evidence to [linking affirmatively] the knife introduced to the alleged assaults.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700387\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/421/434/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Here, Armstead asserted that there was no scientific evidence, e.g., DNA, linking him to Paige's death. The absence of DNA evidence was unnecessary, however, for the State to convince a reasonable jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, to convict, considering the evidence adduced actually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Armstead was arrested in Georgia (where he had been living under the alias \"James L. Jefferson\" for the two weeks after the police discovered Paige's body). It was unlikely at that point in time that DNA evidence of Paige would be located on Armstead's person. Moreover, Leroy Simon (a testifying eyewitness) observed Armstead, Fulton, one of the twin Washington brothers (Twin), and a fourth unidentified individual outside of Paige's home on the night of Paige's death. Simon saw Armstead and Twin subsequently break-and-enter Paige's home. Fulton and the fourth unidentified individual stayed outside to give the other two directions. Simon heard \"tussling\" from inside the house, several gunshots, and then watched Armstead and Twin emerge from Paige's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   where the supposed non-existent evidence, i.e., pictures or videos of the heroin transaction, might have bolstered the eyewitness account, but was deemed cumulative, the circumstances of the present case are similar. The recovery of any DNA placing Armstead at the scene\n   would have bolstered Simon's testimony, but would have been cumulative\n   and thus not essential in the State's overall case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branch v.

Detective Lloyd testified, and the parties stipulated, that Armstead stated, \"I already looked up the case. Why am I not just charged with conspiracy, what about the other three?\" The charging documents at that time did not mention conspiracy. Detective Lloyd testified further that, before Armstead made this statement, he had not told Armstead about the conspiracy charge or that there were three other people known by the police to be involved in the crime. Armstead's statement was both voluntary and inculpatory. Had there been available DNA evidence corroborating further Armstead's participation in the crime, it would have been merely another layer on the already-baked cake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In conclusion, even if the trial judge's administration of its CSI effect\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question was an abuse of his discretion, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the supposed prejudice of the question was harmless. Had Armstead's counsel preserved the CSI\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   question for appeal, Armstead would not have had a reasonable probability of success under\n   <em>\n    Strickland's\n   </em>\n   prejudice factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Armstead had a high hurdle to surpass under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , which he failed to clear.
