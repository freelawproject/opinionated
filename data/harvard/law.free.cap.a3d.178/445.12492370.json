The plaintiff suffered injuries in a collision between his automobile and that of an underinsured motorist, Neil Nilson. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly determined that he was collaterally estopped from relitigating the amount of damages awarded to him in binding arbitration with Nilson. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On or about November 3, 2010, the plaintiff was involved in a multicar motor vehicle accident. On January 3, 2011, the plaintiff filed an action in Superior Court against Nilson, the driver of one of the other vehicles involved in the accident. In an amended complaint dated September 26, 2012, the plaintiff alleged that, as a result of Nilson's negligence, he suffered injuries, including, inter alia, a scapular fracture of the left shoulder, a left shoulder internal derangement, a rib fracture, a closed head injury, and nerve damage to his left arm, hand, and wrist. He further alleged that he had \"incurred and will incur in the future, considerable expenses for hospital, doctor and medical care\n   treatment, X rays, medicines and medical supplies, all to his financial detriment.\" In discovery, the plaintiff produced medical records and bills generated from medical treatment he sought with, inter alia, Dr. Andrew Caputo. The documents produced indicated that the plaintiff last consulted on or about March 22, 2011, with a medical provider for injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff and Nilson agreed to submit the matter, including the issues of liability and damages, to binding arbitration and executed an arbitration agreement dated December 4, 2012. Under the terms of that agreement, the parties stipulated that the plaintiff's recovery from Nilson would be limited to a low of $0 and a high of $100,000, which number represented exhaustion of Nilson's automobile insurance policy limits. The parties agreed not to communicate the high-low parameters to the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 28, 2013, the arbitrator, Attorney Richard C. Tynan, held a hearing, during which the plaintiff presented evidence and testimony from witnesses regarding the \"nature and extent of his damages-both economic and noneconomic.\" The plaintiff presented evidence that he might need future medical treatment, including surgery, as a result of the accident. The plaintiff did not refrain from presenting any evidence pertaining to his damages claim. On March 6, 2013, Attorney Tynan issued an award in which he found that the plaintiff had \"sustained his burden of proving that he is entitled to fair, just and reasonable damages for those injuries he sustained through the negligence of the\n   defendant, Neil Nilson.\" Attorney Tynan awarded the plaintiff the entirety of his claimed economic damages, $15,924, and noneconomic damages in the amount of $90,000, for a total award of $105,924. The parties executed a settlement and release agreement, and Nilson's\n   insurance company paid the plaintiff $100,000, representing the limits of Nilson's policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff thereafter filed the present action against Universal, his automobile insurance carrier, claiming that Nilson was underinsured at the time of the accident. In this action, the plaintiff again claims that he has suffered injuries as a result of Nilson's negligence and that he \"has incurred and will incur in the future, considerable expenses for hospital, doctor and medical care treatment, X rays, medicines and medical supplies, all to his financial detriment.\" The nature and extent of the damages the plaintiff claims in the present action are \"in essence, the same\" as the nature and extent of the damages he claimed in his action against Nilson. The plaintiff did not elect to undergo surgery as a result of the accident, and he has not received any medical treatment or incurred any additional medical expenses since March 22, 2011. On December 1, 2015, Universal filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground of collateral estoppel, which the court granted; see footnote 1 of this opinion; on May 11, 2016. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before addressing the plaintiff's claim, we note the applicable standard of review. \" Practice Book [\u00a7 17-49 ] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law....

The issue of the plaintiff's damages was plainly raised in the pleadings and submitted to the arbitrator for determination. The plaintiff's amended complaint alleged that he suffered injuries as a result of Nilson's negligence and that he had incurred medical expenses and expected to incur future medical expenses. The arbitration agreement indicated that the parties were submitting to binding arbitration to resolve \"the issues of liability and damages as the same were presented in the previously identified civil lawsuit.\" A review of the arbitrator's decision reveals that Attorney Tynan reviewed, inter alia, the transcript of the plaintiff's deposition and the videotape of Dr. Caputo's deposition. He also heard the testimony of the plaintiff and others, and reviewed the medical bills submitted by the plaintiff. The plaintiff concedes that he did not refrain from presenting any evidence pertaining to his damages claim and that he presented evidence that he might need future medical treatment, including surgery, as a result of the accident. Moreover, the plaintiff has not received any medical treatment or incurred any additional medical expenses since March 22, 2011, which was long before the arbitration proceeding commenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The issue of the plaintiff's damages was likewise clearly determined in the arbitration. Attorney Tynan found that the plaintiff had sustained fair, just and reasonable damages in the amount of $105,924, which included the entirety of the plaintiff's claimed economic damages, $15,924, and noneconomic damages in the amount of $90,000. Moreover, the plaintiff concedes that the \"nature and extent\" of the damages claimed against Nilson are \"in essence, the same\" as those claimed against Universal in this action. The plaintiff\n   further concedes that the \"coverage in the parties' contract is limited to the damages caused by the tortfeasor (the carrier stands in the shoes of the tortfeasor to the extent of its coverage and no more) ....\" Accordingly, the issues are identical for purposes of collateral estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court has previously held, under similar facts, that an injured party's underinsured motorist benefits claim was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\n   <em>\n    Marques\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

Recognizing that\n   <em>\n    Marques\n   </em>\n   involved a determination that the tortfeasor was not underinsured based on the amount of damages awarded by the arbitrator, we nevertheless find its discussion of collateral estoppel relevant to the present case. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Marques\n   </em>\n   , the issue raised-the amount of damages to which the plaintiff was legally entitled-had been \"actually litigated and necessarily determined\" in the binding arbitration hearing. Accordingly, collateral estoppel bars the plaintiff, as it did in\n   <em>\n    Marques\n   </em>\n   , from relitigating that issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, although our appellate courts are not bound to follow the decisions of the trial court, we find instructive the well reasoned Superior Court decisions, which have concluded that collateral estoppel bars relitigation of damages in an underinsured motorist action where a previous arbitration award has exceeded the limit of the tortfeasor's coverage. As the trial court in the present action noted, courts faced with such claims have rendered summary judgment in the plaintiff's favor, awarded the difference between the arbitration award and the amount of the tortfeasor's coverage as damages, and otherwise collaterally estopped further action.
