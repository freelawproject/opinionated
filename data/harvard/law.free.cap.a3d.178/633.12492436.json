Appellant timely appealed and presents three questions for our review, which we have reordered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   1. Was [a]ppellant deprived of a fair trial when the trial judge departed from a position of neutrality, directing the prosecutor to reopen the case after the State had rested to introduce critical evidence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   2. Is the evidence legally insufficient to sustain [a]ppellant's convictions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   3. Did the trial judge err by permitting Detective Riker to narrate a video\n   recording while it was being played for the jury?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While the evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant's convictions, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion when it departed from a position of neutrality and\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reopened the State's case, and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At approximately 6:00 p.m. on June 12, 2015, in West Baltimore, several eyewitnesses watched a man dressed in brightly-colored women's clothing and a floppy hat chase down and shoot another man. The victim, identified as Steven Bass, died from multiple gunshot wounds. The shooter fled into an alley by a nearby liquor store, whose security footage corroborated testimony about an individual wearing a floppy hat and floral blouse in the vicinity of the shooting. Police officers searched the scene and alley, but were unable to recover any bullets, shell casings, or articles of clothing belonging to the shooter. However, they were later able to lift a palm print from the car of a witness who believed the shooter may have touched the hood of his vehicle while passing by. A search for the print on an automated database returned a \"hit,\" and an arrest warrant for appellant was eventually issued on July 15, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellant was tried in September 2016 before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. During the trial, the State introduced testimony from two expert witnesses from the Latent Fingerprint Unit at the Baltimore City Police Department: Sean Dorr and Elizabeth Patti. Mr. Dorr testified that he examined three fingerprint lift cards taken from the witness's vehicle, and found one-a partial latent print-suitable for comparison. That lift card was uploaded to an automated system that compares unknown prints against Maryland's state database of known prints. After examining the results,\n   Mr. Dorr testified from his report that \"the partial latent print ... has been identified as an impression of the left palm of Brandon Payton, SID number 2476078.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Dorr further testified that he personally fingerprinted appellant on August 9, 2016, and that he was able to verify that the prints he took were also linked to SID number 2476078. Mr. Dorr, however, did not compare those August 2016 prints directly to the lift card taken from the witness's vehicle. Ms. Patti testified that she used magnifiers to physically compare the lift card to known prints in the system belonging to appellant. She also verified that the prints Mr. Dorr took from appellant in August 2016 were linked to SID number 2476078.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When the State rested, appellant made a motion for judgment of acquittal, asserting simply that \"the State has not proven its case at this point.\" Perhaps due to the State's confusing explanation regarding SID numbers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court immediately began to question the State about whether its experts had testified that the unknown print (on the lift card) had ever actually been compared to known prints of appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Despite replaying portions of Mr. Dorr's testimony, the State was unable to provide the trial court with a satisfactory explanation. During the following colloquy, the trial court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reopened the State's case and offered the State the opportunity to put on further evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: I am more than frustrated. Right this minute I don't think you've made your case. So my question is, do I simply grant the motion to dismiss which\n   I could easily do based on what I have heard of this testimony, because you have not convinced me that your client, that you have put this man at the scene of this crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Now, if you want me to allow you to reopen your case to call your expert back in-and Ms. Zeit [defense counsel] I'm sure is going to object to that-and ask that question, in your judgment, to a reasonable degree of certainty, is the print that was taken off of that car Mr. Brandon Payton's print, if you want to call your witness back for five minutes of testimony with whatever cross-examination, I am going to permit that, because I think justice needs to be done and I-generally speaking, I am generally speaking, not inclined to punish clients-in your case, the public is your client-for something that a lawyer may or may not have done. But I don't think you've made your case at this moment. I'm going to permit you to do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   And Ms. Zeit, you're going to object, I'm assuming?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [DEFENSE]: Absolutely, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE COURT: Yeah, I thought so, and I don't blame you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   But right this minute, I'm going to let you reopen your case Friday morning for brief testimony to fill in the gap in your case-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [THE STATE]: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: -because I think you intended to do it and I don't think you did it, and the fact that you can't point to me right now-I mean, I've listened to what you're talking about here and it is not convincing me at all. I think you got lost in the weeds, quite frankly. And so, I'm going to let you do it, but you know, right this minute, I'm not seeing it. You're not convincing me that you've made your case because you haven't put this man on the scene of the crime. And-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [THE STATE]: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE COURT: -again, if you can't do it on Friday, that's fine, then I will grant the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Two days later, Mr. Dorr was called back to the witness stand and testified that he had examined the palm print from the witness's car, prepared a report identifying the print as belonging to appellant, and that the associated SID number was 2476078. Mr. Dorr also testified that he personally took fingerprints from appellant on August 9, 2016, and that those prints were associated with SID number 2476078. Mr. Dorr explained that whenever a person is fingerprinted, those prints are tested against an automated database of known prints. If the prints are found to have an existing match within the system, they will be associated with the same SID number. Mr. Dorr explained that an individual may have two SID numbers, one for prints taken as a juvenile and one for prints taken as adult, but that appellant was only associated with SID number 2476078.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After the cross-examination of Mr. Dorr, the State rested. Appellant produced no evidence, and the case proceeded with jury instructions and closing arguments. Later\n   that afternoon, the jury found appellant guilty of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. On December 5, 2016, appellant received a life sentence for first-degree murder and a consecutive twenty-year sentence for use of a firearm in the commission of a felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant noted this timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Trial Court's Reopening of the Case\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Appellant argues that the trial court abandoned its position of impartiality when it declined to rule on the motion for judgment of acquittal,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reopened the State's case-in-chief, and told the State exactly what it needed to do to survive the motion for acquittal. We agree, and hold that the\n   trial court abused its discretion by abandoning its neutral role and\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reopening the State's case for further testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Generally, trial judges have broad discretion to reopen a case to receive additional evidence, and such decisions will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Hunt v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2045014\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/321/387/#p405\">\n    321 Md. 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 405,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2045014\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/321/387/#p405\">\n    583 A.2d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). When the State moves to reopen its case-in-chief to introduce additional evidence, \"the judge must consider whether the State deliberately withheld the evidence proffered in order to have it presented at such time as to obtain an unfair advantage by its impact on the trier of facts.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Instead, the trial court here\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reopened the State's case for additional evidence, in a jury trial, based on its belief that the State had not adequately proved its case. While we are not aware of any Maryland case directly on point, we addressed this type of scenario through dicta in\n   <em>\n    Cason v.

In making this decision, we acknowledged that courts have identified some factors which\n   may be considered when assessing a trial court's decision to vary the order of proof in a case, such as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Whether good cause is shown; whether the new evidence is significant; whether the jury would be likely to give undue emphasis, prejudicing the party against whom it is offered; whether the evidence is controversial in nature; and, whether the reopening is at the request of the jury or a party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670659\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/140/379/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670659\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/140/379/\">\n    at 391-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670659\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/140/379/\">\n    780 A.2d 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dyson v.

These cases are inapposite. The remaining case relied upon by [Cason] involved a trial judge's \"suggesting that the prosecutor should impeach [the defendant's] testimony by proof of a prior conviction,\" and reopening cross examination for him to do so. In those circumstances, it was clear that the trial judge had abandoned his neutral role and\n   had acted as an advocate by assisting the prosecution in the presentation of its case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670659\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/140/379/\">\n     Id. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670659\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/140/379/\">\n    393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670659\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/140/379/\">\n    780 A.2d 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Wisneski v.

Here, while perhaps not controversial, it was important for the State to establish a clear and explicit link between appellant's known prints and the unknown palm print taken from a witness's car. This evidentiary link was highlighted by Mr. Dorr's testimony, which was presented two days after the State had rested. Because appellant elected not to present any evidence, Mr. Dorr's testimony was the last evidence the jury heard, thereby increasing the danger of the jury placing undue emphasis on that testimony.

In response to the State's insistence that the prints had all been linked to the same SID number, the trial court responded that \"the same SID number frankly doesn't matter. They don't know what an SID number [is] except it's an identifier.... The SID number simply associates with a print.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    At sentencing, appellant's conviction for second-degree murder was merged into his first-degree murder conviction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    We reject the State's preservation argument. An appellate court generally will not decide any issue \"unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court[.]\" Md. Rule 8-131(a). Here, the trial judge explicitly recognized that reopening the State's case could \"very well ... be grounds for appeal[.]\" Appellant's objection to the trial court's action included, among other grounds, that the reopening was \"unfair\" and \"extremely prejudicial.\" We conclude that appellant properly challenged the trial court's decision on this issue, thereby affording the parties and the trial judge an opportunity to respond to the challenge.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"853610\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/385/706/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Rule 4-324(b) provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    <strong>\n     Action by the court.\n    </strong>\n    If the court grants a motion for judgment of acquittal or determines on its own motion that a judgment of acquittal should be granted, it shall enter the judgment or direct the clerk to enter the judgment and to note that it has been entered by direction of the court. The court shall specify each count or degree of an offense to which the judgment of acquittal applies.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    We address appellant's sufficiency of evidence claim because, if the evidence were legally insufficient, appellant would be entitled to a reversal of his convictions with no remand for retrial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Two witnesses described the shooter as male: Rhonda Berkley said she knew the shooter was male because he had facial hair on his chin, and Leah Rossman described the shooter as a man wearing a floppy hat and shorts. Another witness, Christopher Brinker, testified that he saw a man pass behind his car through his rear-view mirror, and then saw what he perceived to be a woman wearing a big hat run past the front of his car in pursuit of the man.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Investigators were able to link appellant to the shooting based on a left hand palm print lifted from the hood of a witness's car.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
