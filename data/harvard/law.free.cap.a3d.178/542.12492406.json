Appellees, Wais Jalali and Mena Jalali (\"the Jalalis\"), claimed that the advances were bona fide loans that were not repaid, and sought to deduct them as unreimbursed business bad debts. The Comptroller of the Treasury, appellant, rejected appellees' claim. When the Maryland Tax Court agreed\n   with the Jalalis and reversed the Comptroller's determination, the Comptroller sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, which affirmed the Tax Court. The Comptroller, now seeking judicial review in this Court, presents a single question, which based on the arguments in its brief, we have rephrased as two:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   1. Did the Tax Court err in determining that the advances were bona fide loans and therefore, business bad debt, which is deductible as an unreimbursed business expense?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   2. Even if the advances were debt, were they non-deductible because they were \"non-business bad debt\" due to Mr. Jalali being an investor, not an employee, of the companies?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Jalali and the companies to which he advanced money were in the business of the sales, manufacture, and installation of large commercial heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (\"HVAC\"); the customers were businesses and government entities. The business was carried on through several affiliated companies. The three companies relevant to this case were WDJ Capital Holdings, Inc. (\"WDJ\"), M &amp; I Air Systems Engineering West, Inc. (\"M &amp; I\"), and Potomac Environmental Technologies, Inc. (\"PEPTEC\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   WDJ, which was incorporated in 2006, was a holding company for three other companies, one of which was PEPTEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   PEPTEC was engaged in the sales of HVAC systems on the East Coast. Mr. Jalali, who was PEPTEC's CEO, owned 86% of WDJ. He began working as an engineer for PEPTEC in 1993, and around 2004 or 2005 he and two other individuals purchased the company. M &amp; I, incorporated in 2008, manufactured HVAC units. Mr. Jalali was the sole shareholder of M &amp; I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Over the years, the companies did \"really well.\" PEPTEC grew from a million-dollar-a-year company to a multi-million-dollar-a-year company. WDJ's revenue was almost $27 million and, in 2008, its net income totaled over $5 million. In October 2008, PEPTEC received a $3 million line of credit from Provident Bank,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to which it had full access until February or March 2010. M &amp; I, in December 2009, entered into a $1 million factoring agreement with Advance Payroll Funding Ltd. to borrow on its account receivables.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2008, PEPTEC won three bids to provide HVAC systems to the Johns Hopkins Cancer Research Center, the National Geospatial Agency, and Aberdeen Proving Ground (the \"Three Projects\"). If successfully completed, those projects would generate $30 million in income. The Three Projects, however, were larger than any previous projects handled by PEPTEC, and created, in the words of the Tax Court, the \"perfect storm.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The need to manufacture and deliver on all of the projects within the same time-frame resulted in major cash flow problems for the involved companies. It was to meet those delivery demands that Mr. Jalali contends that he made eighteen monetary advances to M &amp; I between January 2009 and December 2009 totaling\n   $1,799,000 and one advance to WDJ in December 2009 in the amount of $2,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Each advance was documented by a written promissory note that stated a \"loan amount,\" \"loan period,\" \"interest\n   rate,\" and other repayment terms. The M &amp; I notes stated a 30-day fixed maturity date and 5% interest rate. One of the M &amp; I notes, in the amount of $133,000, was repaid without adherence to the interest or repayment date terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The WDJ note was dated December 29, 2009 and provided for an 18-month term and 5% interest rate; it was not repaid. None of the notes were secured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Jalali testified to a history of prior lending between himself and the companies during 2008 and 2009. No previously paid notes or copies were offered into evidence, but the corporate books and bank records reflected previous repaid loans from Mr. Jalali to the companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Three Projects were ultimately completed, but the companies did not survive the storm. Costly delays, mechanical problems with the systems, and a lawsuit by one of the project customers resulted in financial doom. For the tax year 2009, WDJ reported a loss of about $2.4 million and M &amp; I reported a loss of about $2 million. M &amp; I went out of business in December 2009. In 2010, PEPTEC ceased operations, and WDJ and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2010, the Jalalis filed amended joint tax returns with the Maryland Revenue Administration Division and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the tax years 2008 and 2009. Claiming the unpaid advances as unreimbursed business expenses, the amended returns sought a carried-back net operating loss (NOL) of $3,799,000 and requested refunds of $141,211 for tax year 2008 and $67,132 for tax year 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When the Comptroller rejected the amended returns, the Jalalis requested a hearing under \u00a7 13-904 of the Tax-General Article\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   prior to a final determination on their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The hearing was conducted on March 13, 2014, and on June 3, 2014, the Comptroller issued a Notice of Final Determination. The refunds were denied, in part, because proof of acceptance of the 2008 return by the IRS had not been provided, and because the Comptroller concluded that the advances were not bona fide loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Jalalis appealed to the Maryland Tax Court, which held a hearing on January 28, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the hearing, the Tax Court reversed the Comptroller's determination and granted the refunds. The Comptroller filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County. The circuit court affirmed the Tax Court's decision in an Order dated September 8, 2016, and the Comptroller filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As an administrative agency, the Tax Court's final order is subject to judicial\n   review by this Court as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 10-222 and 10-223 of the State Government Article.\n   <em>\n    Supervisor of Assessments of Anne Arundel Cty. v.

In the Comptroller's view, the focus on Mr. Jalali's subjective intent caused the Tax Court to exclude proper consideration of those factors favoring an equity contribution determination, such as not observing maturity dates, not collecting interest, the inadequate\n   capitalization of the companies,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   the lack of outside financing, the identity of interest between the creditor and the shareholder,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the lack of security or a sinking fund.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Comptroller also argues that the Tax Court improperly considered irrelevant factors, such as no additional stock having been issued and the IRS's determination to grant the deduction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Contrary to the Comptroller's contention, we are not persuaded that the Tax\n   Court disregarded applicable principles of law or grossly overemphasized a few factors to the exclusion of others. In fact, the Tax Court remarked that it was \"pretty familiar with these kinds of things because this is sort of what [it] do[es].\" Rather, the record as a whole reflects, in our view, consideration and evaluation of many of the\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   factors in answering the \"ultimate question\": Did Mr. Jalali have\n   a genuine intention to create the debt with a reasonable expectation of repayment that was consistent with economic reality?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Tax Court's findings reflect consideration of many of the\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   factors (noted in footnotes 9 and 10 above), including, for example:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-63\">Finding #2: Ability to obtain outside financing <em>Roth</em> (8); <em>Bauer</em> (11) Finding #3: Name of instruments <em>Roth</em> (1); <em>Bauer</em> (1) Finding #4: Fixed maturity date; payment schedule <em>Roth</em> (2); <em>Bauer</em> (2) Finding #5: Interest rate and payments <em>Roth</em> (3) Finding #6: Security <em>Roth</em> (7) Finding #7: Subjective intent <em>Bauer</em> (7) Finding #8: Source of repayments <em>Roth</em> (4); <em>Bauer</em> (3)</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Certain factors that the Comptroller asserts that the Tax Court did not give proper consideration were considered in the context of how quickly things went bad in 2009. For example, the Tax Court found that the failure to observe maturity dates and collect interest was the result of the \"perfect storm\" that, in the end, financially ruined the companies (Finding # 1), but that interest would have been paid had the companies survived (Finding # 5). The lack of security was, as noted, expressly addressed by the Tax Court. In addition, some of the factors referred to by the Comptroller would not necessarily, based on the record, have weighed heavily against the Jalalis, including the identity of interest between the creditor and the shareholder\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the availability of outside lending. In Finding\n   # 2, the Tax Court found that outside lending was available to the companies because of PEPTEC's $3 million line of credit from a bank, which was used to alleviate short-term tax flow issues. In addition, M &amp; I had a $1 million factoring agreement beginning in December 2009. This outside credit was available until sometime in 2010; the advances were made in 2009. Mr. Jalali testified that he did not know that he would not be paid until about the middle of 2010.\n   The Tax Court did consider the Comptroller's arguments regarding the economic reality of repayment in light of the \"totality of the circumstances.\" For example, it stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court understands from the Comptroller's standpoint why initially they would think under the circumstances based on the bankruptcies [that the advances were capital infusions]. [B]ut this happened over a period of ... maybe six months to a year. This is not something that was happening long-term, this was a short-term situation that unfortunately [Mr. Jalali] got himself into when he took on three contracts that ... his company just couldn't handle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In regard to his expectation of repayment, Mr. Jalali testified that he expected, as in the past, repayment of the monies advanced upon the completion of the Three Projects. That was reasonable, in his view, because the three contracts were either government contracts or bonded commercial contracts worth approximately $30 million in expected income. In other words, repayment would come with the completion of the Three Projects, which is why the Tax Court found that the advances were made in the form of \"short-term notes.\" That, in the end, he was not repaid does not mean that his expectation of repayment was unreasonable and inconsistent with economic reality when the advances were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In short, the Tax Court applied correct legal principles, evaluated the applicable factors in light of the circumstances, made findings of fact and drew inferences from those facts,\n   and reached a conclusion that \"a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached.\"\n   <em>\n    Frey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702189\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/111/#p186\">\n    422 Md. at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702189\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/111/#p186\">\n    29 A.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Comptroller contends that even if Mr. Jalali's advances are properly determined to be debt, it is non-business bad debt and therefore non-deductible. This issue was neither raised nor addressed in the Tax Court, but the Comptroller argues that the taxpayers had the burden to establish that the unpaid loans were business bad debt because this issue was raised in the Notice of Final Determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Comptroller asks us to reverse the Tax Court and affirm the Notice of Final Determination.
