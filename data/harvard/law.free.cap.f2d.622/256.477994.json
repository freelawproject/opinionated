Pruett asked that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>inaccuracies be \u201cexpunged, corrected, or updated.\u201d The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that Pruett had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Pruett has received a copy of his FBI file, as provided for in 28 C.F.R \u00a7\u00a7 16.30-.34, 20.34(a)(1979). His complaint does not state the inaccuracies which he alleges are present in his file. Nor does the complaint allege that he requested the FBI to correct particular inaccuracies. An affidavit by a Special Agent Supervisor in the FBI\u2019s Identification Division accompanying the motion to dismiss states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">[BJased on Mr. Pruett\u2019s March 2, 1976, letter, it is not possible to identify the specific entries being challenged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">It should be noted that once the entry or entries under challenge are more clearly identified, this Bureau will expunge any non-Federal arrests at the request of the contributing agency. The FBI Identification Division will return to the contributing criminal justice agency, upon its request, the fingerprint card originally submitted in connection with the arrest. This procedure results in the deletion of the arrest in question from the subject\u2019s FBI Identification Record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">App. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Federal regulations control the collection and dissemination of information in criminal files by the FBI and by state and local law enforcement agencies. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.1 <em>et seq. </em>(1979). State and local enforcement agencies are required to formulate plans which will insure the completeness and accuracy of criminal records, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.-21(a); limit their dissemination, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.21(b); provide the individual with access to his file, an opportunity to request corrections, an opportunity to have administrative review of the request, and an opportunity to appeal the denial of a request, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.21(g); and require the state or local agencies to inform the FBI and other agencies of any corrections, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.21(g). State and local agencies must comply or face the possible loss of federal funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">Subpart C of the regulations establishes the procedures for the FBI and other federal agencies. Individuals are provided the right to receive copies of their criminal files. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.34(a). Individuals are instructed to apply for corrections to the contributing state or local agency; however, requests sent to the FBI will be forwarded to the proper contributing agency. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.34(b). The regulations declare that the contributing agency has the responsibility of assuring complete and accurate records, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.37, and they provide sanctions against the contributing agency for noncompliance. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.-38. The regulations establish time guidelines for reporting dispositions. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.37.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">On appeal Pruett argues that his complaint was erroneously dismissed because the FBI has an affirmative duty to delete from its files notations on nonserious crimes, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.32(b), and notations which lack dispositions. Pruett also contends that the district court should not have dismissed his constitutional claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">We must decide the limited question of whether or not Pruett must request particularized relief from the state and local law enforcement agencies and from the FBI before filing a claim for relief in federal court. The FBI has a duty to take reasonable measures to safeguard the accuracy of the information in its criminal files before disseminating them. <em>Tarlton v. Saxbe, </em>507 F.2d 1116 (D.C.Cir.1974). <em>See also United States v. Doe, </em>556 F.2d 391 (6th Cir. 1977). The regulations at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.1 <em>et seq. </em>are consistent with, and define, that duty. <em>See Tarlton v. Saxbe, </em>407 F.Supp. 1083, 1089 (D.D.C.1976). A person states a claim against the FBI only if the FBI violates a duty owed to that person, such as contravening its own regulations. <em>See Crow v. Kelley, </em>512 F.2d 752, 754-55 (8th Cir. 1975).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also Menard v. Saxbe, </em>498 F.2d 1017 (D.C.Cir.1974). For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>example, a person would state a claim if a contributing agency sent a corrected notation to the FBI, but the FBI refused or neglected to correct the notation in its files.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Pruett has not alleged or established that the FBI violated any regulation nor has he alleged any reason that would make the regulations\u2019 requirements inapplicable or futile. There are no inaccuracies alleged which the FBI must correct itself without further information from contributing agencies. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.32(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He has not alleged that the state or local contributing agencies are unable or unwilling to supply correcting information to the FBI. Furthermore, Pruett has failed to specify any notation which he alleges is inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">A person may state a constitutional claim if the FBI disseminates false information, after a proper request for correction has been made, and the false information is used to deprive the person of liberty, such as parole or probation. <em>Paine v. Baker, </em>595 F.2d 197, 201 (4th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 263, 62 L.Ed.2d 181 (1979). However, unless the FBI has violated a duty which it owes to a person, such as contravening its regulations in some manner, it has not injured a person. The mere existence of an inaccuracy in the FBI criminal files is not sufficient for Pruett to state a claim of a constitutional injury. <em>See Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 712-14, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1165-1167, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Therefore, the judgment of the district court is affirmed, though without prejudice to plaintiff to bring another claim after exhausting administrative remedies.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-18\">. The complaint was filed after this Court vacated the district court\u2019s dismissal of a prior action by Pruett styled as a petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-9\">. Though <em>Crow </em>is distinguishable because the complainant was challenging the validity of the underlying convictions, its reasoning is still persuasive. Exhaustion of administrative rem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>edies is favored, because: 1) only by applying to the state or local agency can the individual gain complete, relief, especially if the arrest or conviction itself is challenged; 2) the FBI will honor a request from the contributing agency to make corrections or to return records; 3) judicial and administrative efficiency is enhanced; and 4) such a procedure accords with notions of federal-state comity. 512 F.2d at 752.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b338-24\">. Pruett\u2019s criminal record does not include any nonserious or excludable offenses after February, 1973. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.32(c) and Appendix to 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.32. The complainant must seek the assistance of the contributing agency to update a notation having no disposition. The regulations do not exclude notations lacking dispositions. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.37.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
