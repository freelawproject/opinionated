The plaintiff and counter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>defendant, Bob Young, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeks reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, which: (a) awarded $17,364.82 to Vulcan Materials Company, the defendant and counterplaintiff; and (b) denied Young recovery against Vulcan on its breach of contract claims. Vulcan cross-appeals from the denial of both prejudgment interest and attorneys\u2019 fees. We affirm the trial court\u2019s award of judgment in favor of Vulcan in both respects, but we reverse the denial to Vulcan of prejudgment interest and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">\n<em>Capsule Statement of Central Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJ7\">The parties agree that, if applicable, the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, Fla.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 671.101 <em>et seq. </em>(1965), govern the transaction. In all respects relevant to the present transactions, the Florida provisions are identical to those of the Uniform Commercial Code (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Young, the appellant, contends that the district court failed to make the requisite factual findings necessary to reject its claim that it is entitled to damages under the UCC for Vulcan\u2019s anticipatory repudiation (breach) of the contract, Fla.Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 672.-610, 672.711, 672.714, UCC \u00a7\u00a7 2-610, 2-711, 2-714, or alternatively for failure to perform a severable and non-waived portion of an installment contract, Fla.Stats. \u00a7 672.-612, UCC \u00a7 2-612. Specifically, Young argues that the district court failed to find whether the contract was breached by Vulcan through its inability to deliver the material according to the contract specifications, or instead by Young through its failing to accept Vulcan\u2019s sand as meeting the contract specifications (although nevertheless unsuitable to Young for the purpose for which bought). Young suggests that, therefore, a remand is necessary to make the necessary findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">The district court found it unnecessary to reach these issues. In this bench trial, the court made findings that, before performance of the contract commenced, the parties mutually rescinded the contract after realizing that the materials under order did not meet Young\u2019s needs. Under this finding, there was no breach of the contract by either party and the (lack of) meeting of the minds on the precise specifications was irrelevant. As summarized at 2 Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 2-703:39, p. 349 (2d ed. 1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-10\">The fact that this \u201cremedy\u201d [of rescission] is not specifically listed in the Code is not controlling for the Code lists only the unilateral remedies of each party, that is, those which the seller may by himself exercise, and those which the buyer by himself may invoke. As mutual rescission is a bilateral agreement, it is manifest that it would not be listed as a unilateral remedy. Furthermore, the provision for the preservation of principles of contract law generally [citing UCC \u00a7 1-103; see Fla.Stats. \u00a7 671.103] and the recognition of an unlimited power to modify a sales contract [citing UCC \u00a7 2-209(1); see Fla.Stats. \u00a7 672.209(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ] amply confirm the conclusion that the parties to the sales contract may terminate the contract by mutual rescission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">\n<em>Facts and Findings by the Trial Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AjD\">As we understand Young\u2019s argument, it does not dispute as incorrect the factual findings of the trial court (insofar as those made); in any event, they are not clearly erroneous. Young\u2019s contention, rather, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>that the district court erred as a matter of law in its choice of the principles used to decide the parties\u2019 duties under those facts, and that it failed to make findings necessary to decide this case on the basis of the legal principles properly applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">The dispute arises out of a contract between Vulcan and Young whereby Vulcan was to supply Young with 220,000 tons of sand fill and 40,600 tons of road rock, at given prices of $1.16 per ton for \u201clake sand fill\u201d and $1.28 per ton for road rock. Young was the earthwork and paving subcontractor to a general contractor, Volpe Construction Company, Inc., for a federal postal facility in Florida.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The contract between Volpe and Young incorporated the government specifications applicable to the project. In the contract at issue, Vulcan contracted with Young to supply lake sand fill and DOT rock for the facility. This sales contract was signed on September 3, 1976. The precise standards that the materials would have to meet to enable Young to comply with its contract with Volpe were not given to Vulcan or the testing laboratory until September 16,1976.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result of the soils classification tests conducted on that date, it became clear that the lake sand fill that Young had contracted to purchase from Vulcan would not meet the specifications for the postal facility project and a representative of Vulcan immediately so informed Young. The parties to the original contract therefore discussed the possibility of Vulcan supplying another product in whatever quantity it had available, if one could be found that met the government standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">In the view of the district court, this series of events indicated that \u201cthe parties thereupon by mutual agreement rescinded the original agreement by their acts and conduct.\u201d The district court considered the subsequent ad hoc sales of two products that had not been the subject of the sales order, manufactured sand screenings and shot rock, to be the consequence of new agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">\n<em>Rescission of the Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">Young urges on appeal that any rescission of the original contract resulted from Vulcan\u2019s anticipatory breach of the contract by its disclosure to Young that the materials under order would not meet the specifications. Thus, under the relevant provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, adopted in Florida as Florida Statutes \u00a7 671.101 <em>et seq., </em>Young had the right to accept substitute materials without jeopardizing its right to damages for the initial breach of contract. Fla.Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 672.711, 672.610, 672.106, 672.720; UCC \u00a7\u00a7 2-711, 2-610, 2-106, 2-720. Young maintains that, therefore, the trial court erred as a matter of law by not awarding damages in favor of Young. Young suggests that a part of the trial court\u2019s error was its failure to make any finding with respect to the breach of the contract by either party and argues that the case must, therefore, be remanded for further findings to resolve this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">Young\u2019s argument assumes that rescission was necessarily premised on one party\u2019s breach of the contract<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>trial judge\u2019s failure to make a finding as to breach is therefore a critical omission. Such a finding was necessary, according to Young, because the UCC abrogated any former election-of-remedies doctrine and now permits the innocent party to a breached contract to rescind the contract, accept substitute materials in mitigation of damages, and claim damages for such loss as is nevertheless incurred. Fla.Stats. \u00a7 672.711, UCC \u00a7 2-711.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Young\u2019s argument overlooks that, as the district court concluded, a contract may be mutually rescinded by common agreement, as the district court found in findings which are not clearly erroneous. The Uniform Commercial Code does not regulate mutual rescission by the parties, see 2 Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code 349 (2d ed. 1971), quoted above in text. Thus, the general contract law of Florida rather than the UCC provides the applicable legal principles.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> American contract law recognizes that an executory bilateral contract may freely be terminated by mutual rescission, 5A Corbin on Contracts, \u00a7 1236 (1964), 6 Corbin on Contracts, \u00a7 1316 (1962), Calamari and Perillo, The Law of Contracts, \u00a7 21-2 (2d ed. 1977), Restatement of Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 406, 407, 409 (1932), and Florida law is in accord, <em>see, e. g., Cox v. Grose, 122 </em>So. 513 (Fla.1929); <em>Holmberg v. Hardee, </em>90 Fla. 787, 108 So. 211 (1925); <em>McMullen v. McMullen, </em>185 So.2d 191 (Fla.App. 2d Dist. 1966); <em>Ganaway v. Henderson, </em>103 So.2d 693 (Fla.App. 1st Dist. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">The rights of Vulcan and Young under the contract could thus be terminated not only by <em>breach </em>(and the appellant Young\u2019s contentions depend upon a finding of breach), but also by <em>mutual rescission. </em>The district court\u2019s factual findings, which are not clearly erroneous, are that \u2014 \u201cafter realizing that Young, on the one hand, would be in default on its contract with Volpe, and [Vulcan], on the other, without sufficient knowledge of the requirement for supplying a material [sand] that would satisfy the requirements [of Young to provide sand for its construction contract of the requisite specifications] of Military Standard 619 and 619B . . . the parties thereupon by mutual agreement rescinded the original agreement by their acts and conduct.\u201d The court further noted that, after the Vulcan sand was found unsuitable for Young\u2019s needs, the parties agreed that \u201cat the option of Young, the party could look elsewhere [than to Vulcan] for a substitute [sand],\u201d but \u201cYoung elected to accept\u201d a substitute from Vulcan at a different price in partial satisfaction of its needs for the limited amount Vulcan could supply. The district court characterized the delivery of the substitute material as \u201cupon the basis of a new agreement under which a limited quantity was contracted to be supplied.\u201d Tr. 401, 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">On the record before us, the trial judge\u2019s silence as to breach is clearly an unarticulated finding that this rescission was <em>not </em>breach-based. In fact, the choice of the word \u201crescinded\u201d in the factfindings and \u201crescinded\u201d and \u201cterminated\u201d in the conclusions of law, rather than \u201ccancelled\u201d, indicates the non-breach-based nature of the end of the sales contract between Vulcan and Young.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The finding of mutual error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>as to the sand specifications, coupled with those establishing the times when the sales order was signed and when the actual military standards were first given to Vulcan, is in effect a finding that the parties were <em>mistaken </em>at the time of contracting as to whether the quality of the product described by code number in the Vulcan sales order would meet the government standards applicable to the project for which it was being purchased. Aside from demonstrating the reason why the parties mutually rescinded the contract, it indicates a reason why either party might have secured its judicial rescission.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">Thus we conclude on review that underlying the trial court\u2019s conclusion of mutual rescission is the factfinding that the parties were mutually mistaken in assuming the compliance of Vulcan\u2019s lake sand fill, product code 009, with the required government specification,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that they therefore mutually decided to rescind the contract. The record supports this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Nor is the conclusion of mutual rescission coupled with a denial of damages to both parties at odds with the UCC, as Young contends, since the provisions cited by the plaintiff-appellant merely preserve the right to damages in any rescission that follows a <em>breach </em>of contract. They do not preclude rescission under circumstances in which no breach has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">\n<em>Young\u2019s Claim for Damages For Non-delivery of the Rock</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Young alternatively argues that any rescission of the contract affected only the lake sand fill portion of the sales order, that Vulcan\u2019s obligation to sell DOT rock under the second portion of the order survived, and that the district court therefore erred in not awarding damages for breach of the contract to sell rock. Assuming that the sales order in question was an installment contract, Young bases its argument on the statutory provision that breach of any one portion or installment of such a contract does not result in cancellation of the entire contract unless (1) the value of the contract as a whole was substantially impaired by the breach and (2) the aggrieved party made overt its intent to cancel the entire agreement. UCC \u00a7 2-612, Fla.Stats. \u00a7 672.-612.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">Pretermitting whether Young correctly classifies the present agreement as an installment contract, this argument depends upon Young\u2019s erroneous assumption that one of the parties breached the original agreement. The district court, however, found the entire contract was rescinded by mutual consent, and its factfinding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">\n<em>Prejudgment Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">As counterplaintiff, Vulcan was awarded $17,364.82 for substitute materials delivered to Young pursuant to the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>agreement, <em>for which </em>Young did <em>not </em>pay. Vulcan cross-appeals the judgment of the trial court insofar as it failed to award prejudgment interest or attorneys\u2019 fees. The defendant, as counterplaintiff, sought such interest in its Answer, Affirmative Defenses, and Counterclaim. In its oral findings and its judgment, the trial court was silent as to the plea for prejudgment interest,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and it subsequently denied without explanation Vulcan\u2019s motion to award such interest by amendment to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Young opposes this claim, reciting the Florida rule that prejudgment interest is awarded as a matter of right on liquidated claims only, and contending that the amount it owed was unliquidated because of its own claims against Vulcan for breach of contract. The Florida Supreme Court rejected a similar argument, when it announced that \u201can unliquidated counterclaim, even when established [which Young\u2019s ultimately was not], does not affect the right to interest prior to judgment on the amount found to be due on a liquidated or determinable claim, since the debt- or may not defeat the creditor\u2019s right to interest on such a claim by setting up an unliquidated claim as a setoff.\u201d <em>Manning v. Clark, </em>89 So.2d 339, 340-41 (Fla.1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Young cites, however, a recent Florida appellate case in which the court denied prejudgment interest because \u201cthe amount due . . . was unliquidated because of the numerous claims and cross-claims unresolved and at issue.\u201d <em>Parker\u2019s Mechanical Contractor\u2019s, Inc. v. Eastpoint Water and Sewer District, </em>367 So.2d 665, 668 (Fla.App. 1st Dist. 1979). The court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Parker\u2019s </em>was ultimately grounded on a particular contractual provision, by which the plaintiff was not entitled to final payment until it had \u201cnot only . . . complete[d] the project but . . . obtained] a waiver of all such subcontractor claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669. This explicit contractual provision appears to have removed the dispute, in the court\u2019s view, from the established Florida rule that prejudgment interest is to be allowed on liquidated amounts indisputably owed, despite the pendency of a counterclaim. An isolated appellate case, imbued with special circumstances, is insufficient reason for us to depart from the rule announced in <em>Manning, </em>which embodies an approach adopted in numerous other jurisdictions. <em>See, e. g., </em>cases cited at 22 Am. Jur.2d, Damages \u00a7 187, n. 3, 4 (1965); Annotation, Award of Prejudgment Interest to Contractor, 60 ALR 3d 487 \u00a7 5(e), p. 512 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">\n<em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">The district court denied attorneys\u2019 fees to Vulcan on the basis of <em>F.D. Rich Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States f/u/o Industrial Lumber Co., Inc., </em>417 U.S. 116, 94 S.Ct. 2157, 40 L.Ed.2d 703 (1974). The decision defined the limited availability of attorneys\u2019 fees in Miller Act claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">We note, however, that one of the sureties sued is not governed by the Miller Act. U.S.F.&amp; G.\u2019s performance and payment bond (see footnote 3) was executed under Florida law to guarantee to Volpe Bob Young, Inc.\u2019s payment of its laborers and materialmen. Under <em>Motor City Electric Company v. Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>374 So.2d 1068 (Fla.App. 3d Dist. 1979), this bond provided by a subcontractor is not a statutory bond limited by Fla.Stats. \u00a7 713.-23, but is rather a common law bond under which the materialman may recover as an intended beneficiary of its guarantee of payment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, attorneys\u2019 fees may be assessed against U.S.F.&amp; G. under the au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>thority of and within the limits established in Fla.Stats. \u00a7 627.756.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">However, Fla.Stats. \u00a7 627.756 provides no authority for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the Miller Act bond issued by co-defendant Travelers <em>(see </em>footnote 3). In <em>Rich, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court reversed a lower court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees in a Miller Act claim, where the award had been based on a \u201cstate policy\u201d in favor of attorneys\u2019 fees in public construction contracts. The court held that the traditional American rule that attorneys\u2019 fees are not recoverable except when provided <em>explicitly </em>by contract or statute governed the claim. Here, however, the Florida statute upon which the counterplaintiff Vulcan relies is specifically applicable to \u201cbonds written by the insurer under the laws of Florida.\u201d Fla.Stats. \u00a7 627.756.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Accordingly, we find that the district court correctly held attorneys\u2019 fees unavailable with respect to the Miller Act claim, but that it improperly denied such fees insofar as it awarded judgment under the Florida payment bond. <em>Accord United States ex rel. Garrett v. Midwest Const. Co., </em>619 F.2d 349 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Under the conclusions reached herein, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s award of judgment in favor of Vulcan, AFFIRM the court\u2019s denial of damages to Bob Young, Inc., REVERSE the court\u2019s failure to award prejudgment interest to Vulcan, and REVERSE the court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees with respect to the claim on the Florida state bond. We accordingly REMAND for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-6\">. We will designate the parties in the same manner as the trial court. Bob Young, Inc. first sued Vulcan under diversity jurisdiction for damages resulting from breach of contract. One day later Vulcan filed suit under the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 270a-270d, for payment of materials previously delivered to Young. Vulcan counter-claimed in Young\u2019s suit for lost profits resulting from Young\u2019s breach of the contract and for the amount of the price of the materials delivered. Volpe Construction Co., Travelers Indemnity Co., and U.S. Fidelity and Guaranty Co. are co-judgment debtors and appellants with Bob Young, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b962-13\">. Insofar as Young argues that any modification needs to be in writing, we note that, even if so, the failure to reduce a modification to writing may nevertheless operate as a waiver. Fla. Stats. \u00a7 672.209(4), UCC \u00a7 2-209(4). (The trial court, of course, found that the contract was entirely rescinded by mutual consent, not merely modified.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b963-6\">. Travelers Indemnity Company was the Miller Act surety for Volpe and United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (U.S.F. &amp; G.) was Young\u2019s surety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b963-7\">. At the time this contract was signed, the parties discussed in general terms the need for the materials to meet government specifications under Military Standard 619 for the sand for the construction project. As the parties stipulated, Young did not deliver the actual specifications until nearly two weeks later, and Vulcan\u2019s lake sand fill was not tested to ascertain its compliance with the <em>government </em>contract specifications until that time. Upon testing the parties learned that Vulcan\u2019s lake sand fill, although meeting Military Standard 619 would not satisfy the government specifications, (which included only eight out of the sixteen grades of the Military Standard for the fill).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b963-14\">. The argument that Vulcan breached the contract is also based on the allegation that <em>Vulcan </em>contracted to meet the government specifications for the project (as had Young), another matter on which the trial judge made no explicit finding. Vulcan points out that the sales order identified a particular product by code number (009 lake sand) and asserts that the reference to specifications in the printed form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>is intended to refer to the product\u2019s compliance with the characteristics described by the code number. The interpretation offered by Vulcan presents an internally consistent contract, while that urged by Young would make the contract self-contradictory in light of test results showing that 009 lake sand (seemingly specified by contract) could not satisfy the government project specifications. It was not necessary for the trial court to choose one of these interpretations, however, in light of its finding, discussed in text <em>infra, </em>that the parties <em>mutually rescinded </em>the contract, whatever it bound Vulcan to do prior to rescission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b964-10\">. <em>See </em>Fla.Stats. \u00a7 671.103, UCC \u00a7 1-103:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-11\">Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this code, the principles of law and equity, including the law merchant and the law relative to capacity to contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, bankruptcy, or other validating or invalidating cause shall supplement its provisions.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b964-12\">.
