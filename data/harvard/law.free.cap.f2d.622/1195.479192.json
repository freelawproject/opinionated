JONES, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1276-17\">The National Labor Relations Board (Board) petitions this Court pursuant to Section 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), for enforcement of its order requiring Respondent, The Cambridge Wire Cloth Company, Inc. (Cambridge Wire), to bargain with the United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO (Union). Cambridge Wire resists enforcement on the ground that the Union election, upon which the Board\u2019s order was based, was invalid because of certain improprieties, thus necessitating a new election. For reasons hereinafter set forth, the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-18\">On July 15, 1977, the Union, seeking to become the certified bargaining representative of Cambridge Wire\u2019s employees, petitioned the Board to conduct an election. The election was held on September 28, 1977, under the Board\u2019s supervision, and a majority of the eligible voters cast their ballots for the Union. Cambridge Wire challenged the propriety of the election and filed objections with the Board\u2019s Regional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>Director on October 4 essentially contending:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-5\">a) that the Union was responsible for defacing official election notices by affixing Union labels stating \u201cVote Yes\u201d on the plexiglass front of bulletin boards which contained sample ballots of the election;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-6\">b) that two persons acting on behalf of or with the acquiescence of the Union coerced and threatened various employees to vote for the Union;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-7\">c) that the Union issued material misrepresentations in its campaign literature, specifically:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-8\">(1) this union would never go out on strike;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-9\">(2) there would never be any \u201csympathy\u201d strikes; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-10\">(3) the employees would be dealing with a local union.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1277-11\">The Regional Director of the Board filed his \u201cSupplemental Decision and Certification of Representative\u201d on December 2 overruling Cambridge Wire\u2019s objections and certifying the Union. Cambridge Wire sought review of the Regional Director\u2019s decision pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69 (1979). The Board denied review on December 30 concluding that Cambridge Wire \u201craised no substantial issue warranting review.\u201d The Union filed a complaint with the Board on January 27, 1978 alleging that Cambridge Wire had refused to recognize it. Cambridge Wire, although admitting the technical correctness of the complaint, continued to challenge the election with the same allegations of improprieties that it had previously made, and further asserted that it had been improperly denied a hearing by the Regional Director and the Board as to these alleged wrongs. The Board found that Cambridge Wire had engaged in unfair labor practices within Section 8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) and (5). 236 NLRB No. 190 (June 30, 1978). The Board found it unnecessary to reach the merits of Cambridge Wire\u2019s allegations, concluding that absent arbitrary action, the Regional Director had the discretion not to direct a hearing. The Board found no abuse of discretion and the facts as previously found by the Regional Director were not disturbed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-13\">We find it unnecessary to reach the merits of Cambridge Wire\u2019s objections to the election because we find that the Board failed to comply with its own regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-14\">Cambridge Wire contends, for the first time on appeal, that the Regional Director failed to transmit to the Board the complete record in this case. Cambridge Wire maintains that it had assumed that upon filing its request for review to the Board from the Regional Director\u2019s ruling, all the material presented to him would have been transmitted to the Board. The error, Cambridge Wire claims, was on the Board\u2019s part in not reviewing the complete record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-15\">The record of the proceedings before the Regional Director consists of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxC\">the petition, notice of hearing with affidavit of service thereof, motions, rulings, orders, the stenographic report of the hearing and of any oral argument before the regional director, stipulations, exhibits, documentary evidence, affidavits of service, depositions, and any briefs or other legal memoranda submitted by the parties to the regional director or to the Board, and the decision of the regional director, if any. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.68 (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1277-16\">The record to be transmitted to the Board consists of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-17\">The notice of hearing, motions, rulings, orders, stenographic report of the hearing, stipulations, exceptions, documentary evidence, together with the objections to the conduct of the election or conduct affecting the results of the election, any report on such objections, any report on challenged ballots, exceptions to any such report, any briefs or other legal memoranda submitted by the parties, the decision of the regional director, if any, and the record previously made as described in \u00a7 102.68, shall constitute the record in the case. Materials other than those set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>out above shall not be a part of the record; except that in a proceeding in which no hearing is held, a party filing exceptions to a regional director\u2019s report on objections or challenges, a request for review of a regional director\u2019s decision on objections or challenges, or any opposition thereto, may append to its submission to the Board copies of documents it has timely submitted to the regional director and which were not included in the report or decision. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(g) (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An8\">The Board contends that the regulation clearly states that where there has been no hearing before the Regional Director, it is incumbent upon the party seeking review before the Board to append to its exceptions materials, such as in the present case, that were submitted to the Regional Director but which were omitted from his report or decision. Voluminous material containing, in part, affidavits and campaign literature, was submitted to the Regional Director. Appended to his decision of December 2, 1977, were three pictures depicting the alleged defacement by the Union of bulletin boards containing the sample ballots. This decision (with the three pictures appended), Cambridge Wire\u2019s request of the Board for review and a memorandum of law were all that the Board apparently considered in the denial of Cambridge Wire\u2019s request for review. Numerous items which were before the Regional Director were not transmitted to the Board. The bone of contention is whose responsibility it was to transmit to the Board the material that was before the Regional Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">We are asked to construe a somewhat ambiguous regulation, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(g) (1979). The Sixth Circuit recently addressed this issue in <em>Prestolite Wire Division v. NLRB, </em>592 F.2d 302 (6th Cir. 1979). In <em>Prestolite Wire, </em>the Regional Director was given numerous affidavits concerning objections to an election. The Regional Director apparently considered the affidavits in his decision, which was rendered without a hearing, but did not submit them as part of the record to the Board when Prestolite Wire sought review. As in the instant case, Prestolite Wire argued that sections 102.68 and 102.69(g) prescribe what constitutes the record before the Regional Director and what he must transmit to the Board on a request for review of his own decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-7\">The Court in <em>Prestolite Wire </em>held that \u201c[wjithout expressly ruling that the Regional Director is invariably required under Section 102.69(g) to transmit to the Board all of the materials considered by him (although the language says \u2018shall\u2019), we think that the better practice is to do so and we are unable to fault the company for having failed to anticipate that this procedure would not have been followed here.\u201d 592 F.2d at 305. The Court reasoned that the Regional Director assembles the record and then transmits it to the Board and thus is the proper party to bear the responsibility of transmitting a complete record. We adopt the reasoning and holding of <em>Presto-lite Wire </em>on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-8\">The Board argues that 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.-69(g) supports its assertion that it was Cambridge Wire\u2019s responsibility to transmit the record. Subsection (g) permits the party filing objections to \u201cappend to its submission to the Board copies of documents it has timely submitted to the regional director and which were not included in the report or decision.\u201d As did the Court in <em>Prestolite Wire, </em>we do not find that this language imposes responsibility on Cambridge Wire to transmit to the Board all the material it furnished the Regional Director in his investigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>As a matter of common sense, the Regional Director who has possession of the materials in the record, is the logical party to transmit that record to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-4\">Because we find that it is the Regional Director\u2019s responsibility to transmit the record to the Board, it is clear that he should have transmitted all the materials which were part of the record and considered by him. In fact, we note from the record that much of the material the Regional Director omitted to send to the Board was material which he specifically requested from Cambridge Wire. In a teletype message dated October 4, 1977, to Cambridge Wire\u2019s lawyers, the acting Regional Director acknowledged receipt of Cambridge Wire\u2019s objections to the conduct of the election and requested submission of all \u201cAffidavits, Signed Statements, Documents [and] Other Supporting Evidence.\u201d (App. 11). The material submitted by Cambridge Wire was part of the record in the Regional Director\u2019s investigation, section 102.68, and thus should have been transmitted by him to the Board pursuant to section 102.69(g). Where the Regional Director determines that a hearing is not warranted, which is within his discretion, <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. NLRB, </em>594 F.2d 8, 11 (4th Cir. 1979), we do not view the requirement that he transmit to the Board all the materials he considered in his investigation as an unduly burdensome chore.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">Our ruling in no way disturbs the settled law that it is within the Regional Director\u2019s discretion to grant a hearing if \u201csubstantial and material factual issues exist.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(d) (1979). We, however, cannot view the failure to transmit the record in this case as harmless. Therefore, the application for enforcement must be denied, and the case remanded to the Board with direction to the Regional Director to transmit all the material considered in his decision to the Board for its review. Our decision should not be interpreted as any indication of the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-11\">During the pendency of this appeal, the Board sought to withdraw its petition for enforcement to consider the issue of campaign misrepresentations under a new standard. We remand this issue to the Board to allow it to make its findings of fact and decision in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-12\">Prior to April 8, 1977, the standard the Board employed in judging whether campaign literature interfered with an employee\u2019s freedom of choice was set forth in <em>Hollywood Ceramics Co., </em>140 NLRB 221 (1962). The Board held that where there have been misrepresentations \u201cwhich involve^] a substantial departure from the truth, at a time which prevents the other party or parties from making an effective reply, so that the misrepresentation, whether deliberate or not, may reasonably be expected to have a significant impact on the election,\u201d 140 NLRB at 224, then the election may have to be set aside. The Board noted that even assuming such a misrepresentation, it must still be determined to have affected the results of the election. By this process the Board could \u201cbalance the right of the employees to an untrammeled choice, and the right of the parties to wage a free and vigorous campaign with all the normal legitimate tools of electioneering.\u201d 140 NLRB at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-13\">This standard met its demise in <em>Shopping Kart Food Market, </em>228 NLRB 1311 (April 8, 1977). A majority of the Board held that the rule in <em>Hollywood Ceramics </em>was no longer proper and stated that the Board \u201cwill no longer set elections aside on the basis of misleading campaign statements.\u201d 228 NLRB at 1313. This new standard lasted almost eighteen months. In <em>General Knit of Calif., </em>239 NLRB No. 101, 99 LRRM 1687 (December 6, 1978), a majority of the Board returned to the <em>Hollywood Ceramics </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>This same issue was considered by this Court in <em>Blackman-Uhler Chem. Div. Synalloy Corp. v. NLRB, </em>558 F.2d 705 (4th Cir. 1977). In that case we held that an election was valid under the standard of <em>Hollywood Ceramics. </em>Subsequently, <em>Shopping Kart </em>was decided and a rehearing <em>en banc </em>in <em>Blackman-Uhler </em>was granted. Upon rehearing the Court declined to rule on the merits of the case but rather held that the appropriate course was to remand to the Board to reconsider the case in light of its ruling in <em>Shopping Kart. Blackman-Uhler Chem. Div. Synalloy Corp. v. NLRB, </em>561 F.2d 1118 (4th Cir. 1977). We found controlling the Supreme Court\u2019s direction that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apo\">Appellate courts ordinarily apply the law in effect at the time of the appellate decision, see <em>Bradley v. School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 711, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 2016, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974). However, a court reviewing an agency decision following an intervening change of policy by the agency should remand to permit the agency to determine in the first instance whether giving the change retrospective effect will best effectuate the policies underlying the agency\u2019s governing act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANJ\"><em>NLRB v. Food Store Employees Union, Local 347, </em>417 U.S. 1, 10 n. 10, 94 S.Ct. 2074, 2080, 40 L.Ed.2d 612 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">Under the then proper standard, <em>Shopping Kart, </em>the Regional Director and the Board never considered the merits of Cambridge Wire\u2019s objections on the campaign misrepresentations issue. In reliance on <em>Blackman-Uhler we </em>decline to enforce the Board\u2019s order and the case is hereby remanded to the Board. The Board shall determine the applicability of <em>General Knit </em>to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">The case is remanded to the Board with direction to the Regional Director to transmit all the material considered in his decision to the Board; and to determine in the first instance the application of the <em>General Knit </em>standard to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">ENFORCEMENT DENIED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">. In <em>NLRB v. Osborn Transportation, Inc., </em>589 F.2d 1275 (5th Cir. 1979), the Court held that the failure to include affidavits in the Regional Director\u2019s report was harmless in that the contents of the affidavits were included in the Company\u2019s exceptions. \u201cBecause of our holding, we need not reach the question of whether the affidavit was \u2018documentary evidence\u2019 and therefore part of the record or was a \u2018document\u2019 which should have been appended to the list of exceptions to the Acting Regional Director\u2019s Report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1282. The Board there, as in the instant case, construed section 102.69(g) as requiring the party excepting to the Regional Director\u2019s decision to append any documents which were not included in the decision. <em>Accord, NLRB v. Dobbs House, Inc., </em>613 F.2d 1254, 1260-61 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>see Bir</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number><em>mingham Ornamental Iron Co. v.

NLRB, </em>592 F.2d 302 (6th Cir. 1979) represents the more persuasive construction of sections 102.68 and 102.69(g). <em>Accord, NLRB v.
