HUD took steps to terminate plaintiff\u2019s employment shortly before his one-year probation period expired. Plaintiff challenged the termination and was temporarily reinstated after a decision of the Civil Service Commission\u2019s Board of Appeals and Review (Board). The Commissioners of the Civil Service Commission, however, reopened plaintiff\u2019s case and in a final decision upheld plaintiff\u2019s termination by HUD. Plaintiff then filed suit in this court requesting reinstatement, back pay and correction of his records. He contends the Commissioners lacked authority to reopen the Board\u2019s decision, that his termination notice was not timely served, that he was wrongfully terminated while on sick leave and that other procedural standards were breached. For the reasons stated below we conclude the Commissioners\u2019 decision upholding plaintiff\u2019s termination is correct and that his termination was otherwise procedurally and substantively proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-13\">On January 4,1971, plaintiff was given a career-conditional appointment to the position of Director, Housing Services and Property Management Division, GS-14, in the Buffalo, New York, Area Office of HUD. The appointment was subject to a probationary period \u2014 one year in duration \u2014 beginning on the effective date of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">On December 28, 1971, S. William Green, HUD New York Regional Administrator, prepared and mailed a memorandum addressed to plaintiff through the Buffalo Area Office Director notifying plaintiff that he would be terminated within his probationary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-15\">At approximately noon of December 29, 1971, (Wednesday) the Buffalo Area Office Director, Frank Cerabone, told plaintiff in person that he had recommended plaintiff\u2019s termination and that a written memorandum effecting his dismissal had been signed and mailed from New York City by Green. The termination memorandum by Green, dated December 28, 1971, stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_9\">Based on the recommendation of Mr. Cerabone, Buffalo Area Office Director, I regret to inform you that your services have not proved satisfactory. It is my understanding that you have been unresponsive to the team effort deemed necessary to the effective operations of the Division and that you have been unable to get along with the Director of the Operations Division and his staff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">During that afternoon of December 29, 1971, plaintiff mentioned his termination to one or two co-workers and experienced a \u201csudden onslaught of illness.\u201d He left the office early at 4:30 p. m. and drove to a hospital thirty miles away, the Tri-County Memorial Hospital in Gowanda, New York. He was admitted to the emergency room at 7:41 p. m. complaining of pains in his side. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>At the hospital plaintiff underwent a series of tests and was released January 6, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Meanwhile, on December 30, 1971, a Thursday, at 11:30 a. m., plaintiff\u2019s termination notice arrived at the Buffalo office from HUD\u2019s New York Regional Office. An administrative employee of HUD\u2019s Buffalo office, Mrs. Ann Franceschini, changed the notice\u2019s effective date from January 3, 1972 to January 2, 1972, a change approved by a higher authority within the agency. Plaintiff, of course, had not reported to work that day nor had he notified the agency of his hospitalization. Since plaintiff\u2019s whereabouts were unknown, preparations were made to attempt delivery of the notice of termination by mail and messenger to plaintiff\u2019s home address. Specifically, office personnel, on December 30:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">1. Dispatched the original notice by special delivery, return receipt requested, registered mail, to plaintiff\u2019s home address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">2. Dispatched by regular mail a copy of the notice to plaintiff\u2019s home address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">3. Sent an employee to plaintiff\u2019s home to effect personal delivery of a copy of the notice of termination. The employee found no one at plaintiff\u2019s home and slipped a copy of the notice under plaintiff\u2019s front door.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Mrs. Franceschini learned of plaintiff\u2019s hospitalization that afternoon from plaintiff\u2019s wife. Though the next day, December 31, was a federal holiday, Mrs. Franceschini went to HUD offices and dispatched to plaintiff at the hospital a Western Union telegram containing the specific language of the notice of termination. She asked Western Union to make personal delivery of the telegram, but on Monday, January 3, 1972, Western Union notified the HUD office that, \u201cParty refused to accept message.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff finally received a letter on January 7, 1972, notifying him of his termination, after his release from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">Plaintiff first attempted to appeal his termination as a probationary employee on the grounds of religious discrimination (plaintiff stated his religion as Methodist).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An investigation of the allegation of religious discrimination was initiated but by an affidavit of March 1, 1972, plaintiff withdrew the complaint. On April 26, 1972, the Director of the Civil Service Commission\u2019s New York Region (Regional Director) denied plaintiff\u2019s appeal. The Regional Director found, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-13\">By letter, dated December 28, 1971, signed by the Regional Administrator, you were notified that you would be terminated during probation effective January 2, 1972, for unsatisfactory services. Accordingly, you were separated on January 2, 1972.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">The Regional Director also stated that under \u00a7 315.804 of the Civil Service Regulations [5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804 (1972)] a probationary employee could not appeal a termination based on inadequate performance or conduct on the job. Civil Service Commission review of probationary employee terminations, the Regional Director stated, was limited basically to charges of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-15\">Plaintiff appealed the Regional Director\u2019s decision to the Commission\u2019s Board of Appeals and Review (Board). In a decision of July 18, 1972, the Board determined that HUD\u2019s efforts to serve plaintiff his termination notice before the end of his probationary period were inadequate. Thus, the Board concluded plaintiff had completed his probationary period and was entitled to the procedural protections of regular employees. Plaintiff\u2019s restoration was recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-16\">On July 28, 1972, the Commissioners of the the Civil Service rescinded the Board\u2019s decision and ordered reconsideration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>second decision of October 10, 1972, the Board affirmed its first decision of July 1972 and again recommended that plaintiff be restored retroactively to his employment. As of October 30,1972, HUD restored plaintiff to employment but only on a temporary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">HUD asked the Commissioners to reopen the Board\u2019s decision again on November 29, 1972. The Commissioners did so on January 10,1973. By decision of March 27,1973, the Commissioners reversed the second Board decision which had ordered plaintiff\u2019s restoration. The Commissioners specifically determined that HUD\u2019s efforts to serve timely the notice of termination during plaintiff\u2019s probationary period constituted an \u201cintelligent and diligent effort, in the circumstances,\u201d under the Federal Personal Manual Supplement 752-1, \u00a7 S4-8, \u201cDelivery of Notice\u201d provisions. The Commissioners remarked that \u201cThe regulations do not require that the Notice of Termination actually be delivered, regardless of the cost or circumstances.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s termination, the Commissioners found, was correctly effected within his probationary period. As a result of this second Commission decision HUD was given authority to proceed with plaintiff\u2019s termination which was completed March 28, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">On March 30, 1973, plaintiff filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York alleging he was wrongfully terminated and that the Commission had no authority to reopen his case a second time. On June 7, 1977, that suit was dismissed without prejudice by stipulation of the parties. Plaintiff\u2019s petition in this court was filed (effective date) January 3, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s basic argument in this court is that the Commissioners lacked authority to reopen and reverse the Board\u2019s decision a second time. The Board\u2019s decision of October 10, 1972, reinstating plaintiff, it is argued, became final and conclusive when HUD failed to file a notice of appeal to the Commissioners within a specific time frame. Second, plaintiff argues his termination was in reprisal for a grievance he filed. In addition, plaintiff alleges several procedural violations, such as improper termination while he was on sick leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Defendant in response argues plaintiff\u2019s claim first accrued on January 2, 1972; the claim was not filed in this court until January 3, 1978, and is therefore barred by the six-year statute of limitations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501 (1976). Alternatively, plaintiff\u2019s petition should be deemed barred by the equitable doctrine of laches. On the merits, defendant insists pertinent regulations clearly gave the Commissioners authority to reopen plaintiff\u2019s case. Defendant emphasizes probationary employees have very limited rights. After giving the probationary employee a fair trial period, the Government needs only to provide a probationary employee written notice of termination, with a brief statement of the reasons, before the end of the probationary period. This was done in plaintiff\u2019s case; he was accorded all rights due a probationary employee and has no grounds to challenge his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">In view of the foregoing, the three questions before the court are: (1) whether plaintiff\u2019s claim is barred by the statute of limitations or by laches; (2) whether the Commissioners could reopen the second decision of the Board later to reverse that decision; (3) whether plaintiff\u2019s termination was for valid reasons and procedurally correct. We decide first that plaintiff\u2019s claim, under the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, is not barred by the statute of limitations or by laches. Second, the Commissioners could reopen the second Board decision as they did. Finally, plaintiff\u2019s termination was procedurally proper and supported by valid reasons. Consequently, we hold for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\"><em>Statute of Limitations. </em>In response to defendant\u2019s argument that plaintiff\u2019s claim is barred by the six-year statute of limitations, plaintiff argues his claim did not accrue until he had exhausted his administrative remedies; this did not occur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>until the final decision of the Commissioners on March 27, 1973. The question is whether exhaustion of the administrative remedy in this case is mandatory or merely permissive; if exhaustion is mandatory then the statute of limitations would not begin to run on plaintiff\u2019s claim until \u201ccompletion of that [administrative] process.\u201d <em>Friedman v. United States </em>159 Ct.Cl. 1, 11, 310 F.2d 381, 387 (1962), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Lipp v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 932, 83 S.Ct. 1540, 10 L.Ed.2d 691 (1963). <em>See Wright </em>v. <em>United States, </em>205 Ct.Cl. 831 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In <em>Williams v. United States, </em>193 Ct.Cl. 440, 444, 434 F.2d 1346, 1348-49 (1970) we held that a probationary employee was required to exhaust the mandatory administrative remedy and a portion of his claim was rejected for a failure to do so. There is, however, a slight but significant difference between <em>Williams </em>and this case, relating to the grounds upon which a probationary employee challenges his termination. During the time plaintiff was a probationary employee, <em>see </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804-\u00a7 315.-806 (1972), [as now printed, <em>see </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804 \u2014 \u00a7 315.806 (1979)] probationary employees could appeal their termination only when termination was for conditions arising before appointment, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.-805, or when an employee alleged the termination was based on discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In <em>Williams </em>plaintiff presented allegations of racial discrimination. It was therefore appropriate for the court to rule plaintiff was mandatorily required to exhaust an administrative remedy expressly provided for his type of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The case this plaintiff presents is different, for he challenges his termination on grounds of neither a condition arising before his appointment nor on the basis of discrimination. For this reason the Regional Director logically rejected plaintiff\u2019s appeal as being outside the Commission\u2019s appellate review authority in his decision of April 26, 1972. The subsequent decisions in plaintiff\u2019s case do not discuss this point but it is easy to understand why the Board and then the Commissioners believed they were acting within the regulations in deciding plaintiff\u2019s case. The thrust of plaintiff\u2019s argument is not merely a challenge to the <em>reason </em>for his dismissal as a probationary employee, he contends he in fact was <em>not a probationary employee at all </em>\u2014 that he completed his probationary period, thereby becoming entitled to the rights of regular employees, including rights of appeal within the Commission. We can find no direct precedent as to whether in such a case as this exhaustion of an administrative remedy should be deemed merely \u201cpermissive\u201d or \u201cmandatory.\u201d Sound policy, however, seems to call for exhaustion when individuals as plaintiff herein are challenging their very status as probationary employees. The Commission [now the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)] is certainly well qualified to assess whether an employee is a probationary employee or has duly completed the probationary period. As a general consideration the court would unquestionably benefit from OPM\u2019s opinion in such a case. Furthermore, as to the particular facts of this case it would strike us as somewhat unfair to rule plaintiff barred from this court when he has diligently and in good faith brought his case to the Commission and they confidently asserted jurisdiction. Hence, we hold that exhaustion of the administrative remedy in this case was mandatory. The statute of limitations did not begin to run until plaintiff had exhausted that remedy, which was March 27, 1973. The Commissioners\u2019 decision of that date itself told plaintiff: \u201cThis is the final administrative decision in this matter, and you have now exhausted all administrative rights and remedies.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s claim, filed in this court January 3, 1978, was not barred by the statute of limitations. Nor do we find the equitable doctrine of laches appropriate, in view of plaintiff\u2019s efforts to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Cason v. United States, </em>200 Ct.Cl. 424, 432, 471 F.2d 1225, 1229 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\"><em>Authority of the Commissioners to Reopen. </em>Plaintiff\u2019s central argument is that the Commissioners lacked authority to reopen the second Board decision and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>verse it. Plaintiff claims his rights as a regular employee vested when HUD failed to seek review of the Board\u2019s second decision in a timely manner (within thirty days). For support of his position plaintiff refers to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 772.312(b), a section prescribing a thirty-day period within which an agency challenging a Board decision may file a request to reopen with the Commissioners. Plaintiff also cites <em>Kelly v. United States, </em>133 Ct.Cl. 571, 138 F.Supp. 244 (1956), <em>Feldman v. United States, </em>149 Ct.Cl. 22, 181 F.Supp. 393 (1960) and <em>Goodwin v. United States, </em>127 Ct.Cl. 417, 118 F.Supp. 369 (1954), for the proposition his rights vested as of the second Board decision. In reply, defendant points to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 772.308 (1972)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cReview by the Commission\u201d which permits Commission reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">We believe defendant\u2019s view of the matter is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The regulation upon which plaintiff relies for his strict view of the time limitations for an agency request for reopening, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 772.312(b) first appeared in the 1975 Code of Federal Regulations. Regardless of the precise date the regulation went into effect, it is clear it was not operative in January 1973 when the Commissioners reopened the Board\u2019s decision a second time. As defendant notes, the controlling regulation is 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 772.308 (1972); this regulation contains no specific time limitation as to when an agency must request reopening or when the Commissioners may order reopening. If an unreasonable length of time had passed after the Board\u2019s second decision, before HUD\u2019s request to reopen and the Commissioners\u2019 assent to reopen, we might question whether the delay unfairly prejudiced plaintiff. The Board, however, rendered its second decision October 10, 1972. HUD requested reopening on November 29, 1972, and that request was granted January 10, 1973. No regulation was violated by this procedure nor did an unreasonable length of time elapse. The Commissioners acted within the authority granted by 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 772.308 (1972) in reopening plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">The <em>Kelly, Feldman </em>and <em>Goodwin </em>decisions do not control the question in this case. First of all, none of these cases treats the authority of the Commissioners to reopen a decision. They discuss in general terms an employee\u2019s rights pursuant to a favorable Board decision. For example, <em>Kelly </em>found that an agency had wrongfully attempted to evade the Board\u2019s recommendation of full reinstatement by appointing an employee to an artificial, temporary position but soon thereafter placing him in a much lower position. There is no credible suggestion of improper agency subterfuge in this case. Plaintiff was indeed appointed to a temporary position but only for a period of time to cover appeals of his reinstatement, \u201cpending final disposition of the case\u201d as 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 772.308(b) (1972) permits. <em>See </em>n. 4, <em>supra. </em>The <em>Kelly </em>decision is therefore of no help to plaintiff. The <em>Feldman </em>and <em>Goodwin </em>decisions dealt with an employee\u2019s rights pursuant to the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. Yet, that act applies \u201conly to preference eligibles <em>who have completed their probationary period.\" Williams v. United States, </em>193 Ct.Cl. 440, 443, 434 F.2d 1346, 1348 (1970) (emphasis added). Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>tiff failed to complete his probationary period, he was not covered by the protection of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act. Thus the <em>Feldman </em>and <em>Goodwin </em>cases are inapplicable to this case. The court is consequently unable to find any reason why the Commissioners should be prohibited from reopening the Board decision of October 10, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><em>The Propriety of Plaintiff\u2019s Termination. </em>The last set of arguments we address is plaintiff\u2019s contention that his termination was substantively improper (i. e., he was terminated for filing a grievance) and accomplished in violation of certain procedural requirements. For guidance as to the substantive and procedural rights of probationary employees we look to <em>Perlongo v. United States, </em>215 Ct.Cl. 982, 566 F.2d 1192 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 944, 98 S.Ct. 2844, 56 L.Ed.2d 784 (1978), where the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">The rights conferred by Civil Service Commission regulations are very narrow. Procedurally, a probationary employee has the right only to be notified prior to termination of his employment as to the agency\u2019s \u201cconclusions as to the inadequacies of [the probationer\u2019s] performance or conduct.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.804 (1975); <em>Horne v. United States, </em>190 Ct.Cl. 145, 148, 419 F.2d 416, 418 (1969). Substantively, the only limitation on an agency\u2019s power to dismiss a probationary employee is that the agency must honestly be dissatisfied with the probationer\u2019s conduct or performance after giving him a fair trial on the job. <em>Horne v. United States, supra </em>at 150, 419 F.2d at 419; <em>Dargo v. United States </em>176 Ct.Cl. 1193, 1206 (1966). <em>[Id. </em>at 983]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">As a <em>substantive </em>point plaintiff contends he was actually terminated in reprisal for filing a grievance on December 27, 1971. Plaintiff relies on his termination effected January 2, 1972, as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of his reprisal charge. The agency has flatly denied the accusation.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\"> Generally speaking, a fairly high standard of proof is required to sustain a claim of bad faith conduct on the part of Government agents, <em>see Grover v. United States, </em>200 Ct.Cl. 337, 343 (1973), and Governments officials are presumed to act in good faith. <em>Id. </em>A compelling reason existed independent of plaintiff\u2019s grievance for the timing of his termination, that is, so it could be accomplished before the end of his probationary period. Were we to conclude plaintiff\u2019s termination as a probationary employee in the final days of his probationary period <em>alone </em>constituted a wrongful reprisal, it would be a simple matter for any probationary employee to thwart termination by filing a grievance shortly before the time when such an employee is most liable to termination \u2014 just before the end of the probationary term. Putting the matter more directly, there is insufficient evidence of reprisal in this case. HUD enumerated sound reasons for plaintiff\u2019s termination. Plaintiff has failed to present a substantial justification for overturning the action. <em>See Perlongo v. United States, </em>215 Ct.Cl. 982, 566 F.2d 1192 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 944, 98 S.Ct. 2844, 56 L.Ed.2d 784 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s three major <em>procedural </em>arguments are that (1) he did not receive his termination notice prior to the end of his probationary period; (2) he was denied sick leave to which he was entitled by his wrongful termination while on sick leave; (3) the effective date on his termination notice was improperly changed by Mrs. Franceschini from January 3, 1972 to January 2, 1972. These contentions are judged against the standard that, \u201cProcedurally, a probationary employee has the right only to be notified prior to termination of his employment as to the agency\u2019s \u2018conclusions as to the inadequacies of [the probationer's] performance or conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perlongo, </em>215 Ct.Cl. at 983, 566 F.2d 1192. The Commissioners in their decision of March 27, 1973, rejected plaintiff\u2019s argument of untimely service and we find no reason to disturb their conclusion. The Commissioners determined that HUD\u2019s efforts to serve plaintiff his termination notice even though the written notice did not actually reach plaintiff until after his termination date, were sufficient to constitute constructive delivery. Their decision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The regulations do not require that the Notice of Termination actually be delivered, regardless of cost or circumstances. Nor do they require that all efforts to effect delivery must be made. Again, the regulation's require only that \u201can intelligent and diligent effort\u201d be made in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">We agree with the Commissioners that HUD\u2019s actions to serve plaintiff his notice were all that could be reasonably expected under the circumstances. Several copies of the notice were sent to plaintiff\u2019s home, one was delivered personally by a HUD employee and slipped under plaintiff\u2019s front door. When it was discovered that plaintiff was hospitalized, a telegram with the contents of the notice was sent to him there. Moreover, plaintiff was verbally notified of his imminent termination by Frank Cerabone on Wednesday, December 29, 1971, before he drove thirty miles to the hospital. He had every reason to expect a notice would soon be delivered to him, yet curiously enough, he received none of the many notices sent until the day after his discharge from the hospital. In view of these circumstances we conclude that constructive delivery of the termination notice was accomplished before the effective date of plaintiff\u2019s termination of January 2, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The Commissioners similarly considered and rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention that Mrs. Franceschini lacked authority to correct the termination date on plaintiff\u2019s notice. The Commissioners found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">[T]he administrative personnel of the Buffalo Area Office were only doing, in the cited instance, one of the types of normal duties for which they are hired. As footnote to this, the Commissioners note that the cited change was approved by duly constituted higher authority within the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Again, we discover no reason sufficient to overturn their conclusion on this point. The decision of the Commissioners stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s sick leave claim is based on the erroneous assumption that his sick leave status shielded him from an otherwise valid probationary termination. Plaintiff somewhat confusedly argues that since everyone has a right to sick leave no one can ever be terminated while on sick leave. Yet nothing in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 6307 (1976), the sick leave provision, nor any other regulation within our knowledge, bars termination of a probationary employee while on sick leave. As of the time plaintiff\u2019s termination became effective, January 2, 1972, he was \u201coff the rolls\u201d regardless of whether he was using sick leave. His sick leave status simply could not and did not vitiate his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Plaintiff also advances several other claims as to his alleged rights, all of which were either considered and rejected by the Commissioners or are beyond plaintiff\u2019s rights as a probationary employee. For example, plaintiff vigorously asserts his employment actually began on January 3, 1971. Were he correct, this could cause technical problems with the legality of his firing on January 2, 1972. The Commissioners carefully considered this issue and found plaintiff began employment on January 4, 1971, the date of his appointment evidenced in Standard Form 50, \u201cNotice of Personnel Action.\u201d His probationary period, the Commissioners found \u201cofficially ended at 5:15 p. m. on January 3,1972,\u201d but he had been effectively terminated midnight January 2,1972, before the end of the probationary term. Our review of the details of this issue convinces us that the Commissioners were correct in their findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">Plaintiff claims entitlement to notice of the quality of his performance sixty days before the end of his probationary period. But the regulation providing for such notice, Federal Personnel Manual, Chapter 315, subchapter 8-(3)(a)(5) demonstrates this notice is actually for purposes of <em>agency </em>evaluation of the probationary employee and specifically states failure to provide the notice will not be a bar to the probationer\u2019s termination during probation. The failure of plaintiff to receive this notice could not invalidate his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s briefs in this case were relatively voluminous. This opinion addresses what the court perceives as the major arguments raised by plaintiff. Any remaining minor or lesser arguments do not merit further comment. The court has carefully examined each and every one of plaintiff\u2019s submissions and remains convinced plaintiff\u2019s termination was effected in compliance with all applicable procedural and substantive standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Accordingly, upon consideration of the parties\u2019 submissions and after oral argument, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied. Defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment is granted and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-9\">.
