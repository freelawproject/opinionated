As the indictment was returned nine days after Boydston\u2019s twenty-sixth birthday, appellant motioned to be sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>nunc pro tunc </em>which would have permitted her to be eligible for sentencing under the Young Adult Offenders Act (Act).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She now appeals the decision of the trial court denying this motion and claims her inability to be sentenced under the Young Adult Offenders Act results from a violation of her constitutional rights of due process under the fifth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">We affirm the decision of the district court denying appellant\u2019s motion for imposition of sentence <em>nunc pro tunc </em>under the Act. As decided in <em>United States v. Barton, </em>566 F.2d 1106 (7th Cir. 1977), the statute is strictly construed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">The statute is specifically limited to \u201ca defendant who has attained his twenty-second birthday but has not attained his twenty-sixth birthday at the time of conviction.\u201d Although the term \u201cconviction\u201d has been liberally construed to include not only the time of judgment, but also the return of a guilty verdict or entry of a plea of guilty or <em>nolo contendere (United States </em>v. <em>Branic, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. 10, 495 F.2d 1066 (1974)), the term is not sufficiently elastic to encompass other steps in the trial proceeding antedating some kind of guilt determination. This is true even though the trial date is set after an arraigned defendant\u2019s 26th birthday because of court congestion, or other circumstances outside the control of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1107-08. Entering a conviction <em>nunc pro tunc </em>prior to a defendant\u2019s twenty-sixth birthday was permitted in <em>United States v. Villar, </em>416 F.Supp. 887 (S.D.N.Y.1976) (defendant denied the effective assistance of counsel) and <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>427 F.Supp. 89 (S.D.N.Y.1977) (thirty month delay between arrest and final sentencing during which appellant adjudicated other constitutional rights). However, the Fifth Circuit in <em>United States v. Riffe, </em>600 F.2d 1146, 1147 (1979) found such approval to be \u201cunpersuasive and in derogation of the clear express terms\u201d of the Act. We do not find that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">Additionally, we cannot say that appellant was denied any constitutional rights by failing to be sentenced under the Act. Appellant\u2019s crime was discovered in July of 1979 and she was fired from her position in the bank. Evidently, due to appellant\u2019s pregnancy, the investigator chose to defer taking any formal statements by interview until after the birth of appellant\u2019s child. The investigator did meet with appellant in October and after being given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, she admitted acts of embezzlement. The indictment against Linda Kay Boydston was returned on November 20, 1979, and on November 27, 1979, appellant who was represented by court appointed counsel, chose to enter a plea of guilty. We do not find this sequence of events to constitute undue or unreasonable pre-indictment delay or any other due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4216. Young adult offenders</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">In the case of a defendant who has attained his twenty-second birthday but has not attained his twenty-sixth birthday at the time of conviction, if, after taking into consideration the previous record of the defendant as to delinquency or criminal experience, his social background, capabilities, mental and physical health, and such other factors as may be considered pertinent, the court finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant will benefit from the treatment provided under the Federal Youth Corrections Act (18 U.S.C., chap. 402) sentence may be imposed pursuant to the provisions of such Act.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-16\">. Appellant\u2019s motion was denied by the sentencing judge on January 16, 1980. Apparently referring to the arraignment date of November 27, 1979, which was after appellant\u2019s November 11 birthday, the judge commented: \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have sentenced her under that Act anyway. Nevertheless, that appears to be academic because the court would not entertain a sentence under the Act at that time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
