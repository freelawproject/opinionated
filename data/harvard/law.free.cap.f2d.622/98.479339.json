C. Weston Houck, United States District Judge, District of South Carolina, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b179-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Calvin Cole was convicted of embezzling government funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. He appeals, alleging error in certain evidentiary rulings by the district court. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Appellant was president of Virginia International Testing Laboratories, Inc. [VITL], which was under government contract with the General Services Administration [GSA] to conduct a program for motor vehicle tire testing. All money due under the contract was to be paid directly to an assignee, the First National Bank of Western Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Testimony at trial showed that on September 20, 1974, the government erroneously issued a check payable directly to VITL in the amount of $69,894.08. On October 4, 1974, GSA claims examiner Mary Rowe spoke to appellant about the erroneous check, but he denied receiving it. A few days later a verbal stop payment order was issued but apparently had no effect. The government issued another check to fulfill its obligation to the assignee bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">Mary Rowe and GSA finance officer Stephen Tysinger questioned appellant about the missing check on October 7 and again on November 5, 1974. Each time appellant denied having received it. Appellant was later asked to sign a statement to that effect and did so in December 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">Subsequently, appellant admitted that he received the check in October and deposited it to VITL\u2019s account, and the funds were spent almost immediately on various VITL expenses. Appellant claimed, however, that he thought the check was payment properly issued to VITL pursuant to \u201cModification 5,\u201d a contract modification he had negotiated with GSA contracting officer James Williams to compensate for increased gasoline costs and other expenses resulting from the lowering of the national speed limit to 55 mph. It included some retroactive compensation, but it also specified no change in the manner of payment. Appellant explained that he thought the check he received on October 20 was the retroactive portion of \u201cModification 5,\u201d which had become effective five days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-17\">Cole was convicted on only one of the three counts charged in the original indictment. Another count charged that he had made \u201cfalse, fictitious and fraudulent statements\u201d concerning receipt of the check, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cole succeeded in having this count dismissed, with the government\u2019s consent, based on the \u201cexculpatory \u2018no\u2019 \u201d defense, which precludes conviction under \u00a7 1001 based only on false exculpatory denials in response to investigative questioning. <em>See Paternostro v. United States, </em>311 F.2d 298 (5th Cir. 1962); <em>United States v. Chevoor, </em>526 F.2d 178 (1st Cir. 1975); <em>cert. den. </em>425 U.S. 935, 96 S.Ct. 1665, 48 L.Ed.2d 176 (1976); <em>United States v. Ehrlichmann, </em>379 F.Supp. 291 (D.D.C. 1974) <em>but see United States v. Adler, </em>380 F.2d 917 (2nd Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-18\">Appellant\u2019s primary contention is that the \u201cexculpatory \u2018no\u2019 \u201d doctrine requires the exclusion of his statements denying receipt of the check. He asserts that the court violated the \u201cwidely recognized principle that a defendant should not be prosecuted for his negative responses to questions put to him by government officers,\u201d by allowing him to be convicted on the same evidence that would be impermissible to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 1001. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>The \u201cexculpatory \u2018no\u2019 \u201d doctrine is not a rule of evidence but rather defines the reach of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 1001 carries harsher penalties than those under the perjury statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621, but without the latter\u2019s materiality requirement and procedural safeguards. The \u201cexculpatory \u2018no\u2019 \u201d doctrine holds that to impose so severe a penalty under \u00a7 1001 for mere denials in the face of an investigator\u2019s questioning would circumvent the perjury statute. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shanks, </em>608 F.2d 73, 75 (2d Cir. 1979), <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chevoor, supra </em>at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Here we are faced with an entirely different question \u2014 whether Cole intended to misappropriate the check. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. There could hardly be a more relevant indication of that intent than appellant\u2019s denial that he ever received it. Appellant\u2019s objection that the statements are inadmissible hearsay is also meritless. F.R.E. 801(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Appellant also contends that the district court erred in limiting his cross examination of government witness James Williams. Williams testified concerning the operation of the contract. In the course of his testimony, he stated that he first became aware of Cole\u2019s desire to obtain a modification of the contract in early September 1974. Appellant sought to question him concerning a newspaper article dated two months earlier in July 1974 in which Williams was quoted as saying he was aware of VITL\u2019s problem. The district court sustained the government\u2019s objection that the inquiry was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s ruling. The date on which Williams knew that appellant was seeking additional compensation was clearly irrelevant to the issue of appellant\u2019s intent to misappropriate the check. The negotiations, terms, conditions and effect of \u201cModification 5\u201d were fully before the jury insofar as they had any bearing on the credibility of appellant\u2019s story-</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">The discrepancy in Williams\u2019 recollection of the dates, moreover, was brought out on cross examination. We fail to see how any further pursuit of the irrelevant issue of VITL\u2019s need for money in July 1974 could have had any effect on Williams\u2019 credibility, especially in light of the documentary nature of the case and the defendant\u2019s own admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">The right of confrontation and cross examination is a precious one, essential to a fair trial. <em>United States v. Caudle, </em>606 F.2d 451 (4th Cir. 1979). But it is not so broad as to deprive the district court of all discretion in limiting needless or confusing inquiry into collateral matters. <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1110, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974); <em>United States v. Haro, </em>573 F.2d 661 (10th Cir.); <em>cert. den. </em>439 U.S. 851, 99 S.Ct. 156, 58 L.Ed.2d 155 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">Accordingly, the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-19\">. A third count, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287, was dismissed upon the government\u2019s motion after the jury announced it was deadlocked.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\">. We express no view as to the merits of the \u201cexculpatory \u2018no\u2019 \u201d doctrine or the correctness of its application in the dismissal of the \u00a7 1001 count in this case. Assuming, <em>arguendo </em>that it precluded the \u00a7 1001 prosecution in this case, it has no bearing whatever upon the embezzlement statute under which appellant was convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
