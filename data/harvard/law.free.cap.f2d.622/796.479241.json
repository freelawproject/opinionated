The effect of the exemption would eliminate the requirement of obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity, and remove the gas from the regulatory controls over sales and uses of the gas and the abandonment or curtailment of service. The exemption would also mean that the gas would be freed from price controls after 1985, although it will be subject to price controls until then, in either event.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">The decision turns on the definition to be applied to certain words in the exempting provision of the Natural Gas Policy Act: \u201ccommitted or dedicated to interstate commerce.\u201d The owners of the leases, not wanting to be subject to the Natural Gas Act regulations, contend that these words should be defined in the same way that \u201cdedication of gas to interstate commerce\u201d was defined by judicial decision under the Natural Gas Act. Under that definition, gas was not \u201cdedicated\u201d until it actually commenced flowing in interstate commerce. If so defined the gas here, which had not commenced flowing, would be exempt. The intervenors, a number of gas purchasers wanting the gas subject to the Natural Gas Act, would define those words as they are defined in the definitional section of the new Natural Gas Policy Act, which says that the phrase \u201ccommitted or dedicated to interstate commerce\u201d means, among other things, \u201cnatural gas which is from the Outer Continental Shelf.\u201d The Commission agreed with the intervenors, holding that Congress intended not to exempt so-called \u201cold lease\u201d Continental Shelf gas, whether or not it had commenced flowing under those leases, from the certification requirements of the Natural Gas Act, and intended to exempt only so-called \u201cnew lease\u201d gas. That contest and the Commission\u2019s decision present the issue for this review. We affirm the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) denied the petitions of Conoco, Inc. and Exxon Corp. (jointly referred to as Conoco) seeking a declaration that a certificate under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) is not required for sales of natural gas produced from \u201cold\u201d Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases where no interstate deliveries of production under the leases had commenced prior to enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). The Outer Continental Shelf leases here involved were entered into prior to April 20, 1977. Under section 2(9) and (10) of NGPA, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3301(9) and (10), these are deemed \u201cold\u201d leases. There has been no production of natural gas from these leases at present.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-16\">Section 601(a) of NGPA, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3431(a), exempts certain categories of natural gas from the jurisdiction of FERC and the requirement of obtaining a certificate of public necessity under NGA. \u201cNew natural gas,\u201d which includes gas from \u201cnew\u201d OCS leases executed after the critical date, is exempt under section 601(a)(l)(B)(ii). The question in this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>whether the gas from \u201cold\u201d leases which had not flowed prior to the enactment of NGPA is exempt under section 601(a)(1)(A). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-4\">For purposes of Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act, effective on the first day of the first month beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act, the provisions of the Natural Gas Act and the jurisdiction of the Commission under such Act shall not apply to natural gas which was not committed or dedicated to interstate commerce as of the day before the date of the enactment of this Act solely by reason of any first sale of such natural gas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Section 2(18) of NGPA, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3301(18), states in plain language that the \u201cterm \u2018committed or dedicated to interstate commerce\u2019, when used with respect to natural gas, means \u2014 (i) natural gas which is from the Outer Continental Shelf . . .\u201d We probably could end this discussion by merely holding that the definition section of the controlling Act being plain, the Commission must be upheld under the well-settled general rule that \u201c[wjhen a legislature defines the language it uses, its definition is binding upon the court.\u201d 1A Sutherland, Statutes &amp; Statutory Construction \u00a7 20.08, at 59 (4th ed. C. Sands 1973). To be thorough, however, we shall examine each of Conoco\u2019s contentions as to why the definition in section 2(18) does not apply to section 601(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">The language of section 601(a)(1), says Conoco, makes it clear that the decisive question is whether the gas was committed or dedicated to interstate commerce as of the day before the date of the enactment of NGPA. The section 2(18) definition was not in existence on the day before the enactment of NGPA, Conoco argues, so it is therefore apparent that Congress intended that the well-established definition under the NGA \u2014 which did exist on the day before the date of enactment \u2014 must apply. That definition \u2014 natural gas did not become committed or dedicated to interstate commerce until the commencement of interstate deliveries of such gas \u2014 should be used in section 601(a)(1). <em>See Atlantic Refining Co. v. Public Service Commission, </em>360 U.S. 378, 387-89, 79 S.Ct. 1246, 1253-1254, 3 L.Ed.2d 1312 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Even though the section 2(18) definition had not been enacted on the day prior to enactment, Conoco\u2019s argument lacks merit. A statute or a definition contained within it may draw upon antecedent facts for its operation. <em>See Savorgnan v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 491, 504 n. 21, 70 S.Ct. 292, 299, 94 L.Ed. 287 (1950); <em>Cox v. Hart, </em>260 U.S. 427, 435, 43 S.Ct. 154, 157, 67 L.Ed. 332 (1922); <em>Patagonia Corp. v. Board of Governors, </em>517 F.2d 803, 810-12 (9th Cir. 1975). The language \u201ccommitted or dedicated to interstate commerce\u201d is used several times in NGPA and apparently is never used without reference either to \u201cthe day before the date of enactment.\u201d November 8,1978, or to April 20, 1977. <em>See, e. g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 104(a), 105(a), 106(a), 109(a)(2), 121(a)(2)(A), 122(d)(2)(A), 315(b)(1) (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3314(a), 3315(a), 3316(a), 3319(a)(2), 3331(a)(2)(A), 3332(d)(2)(A), 3375(b)(1)). It is thus quite clear that Congress intended to rely on antecedent facts in determining whether gas was \u201ccommitted or dedicated to interstate commerce\u201d under NGPA, and intended for the definition to be applicable as if it were in force prior to the effective date of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">Conoco'also relies on <em>Lawson v. Suwanee Fruit &amp; Steamship Co., </em>336 U.S. 198, 69 S.Ct. 503, 93 L.Ed. 611 (1949), which held that when use of the statutory definition creates \u201cobvious incongruities in the language\u201d and destroys \u201cone of the major purposes\u201d of the legislation, it should not be mechanically applied. 336 U.S. at 201, 69 S.Ct. at 504. In this case, it is contended, use of the statutory definition creates incongruity because it renders the \u201cday before the date of enactment\u201d test date meaningless and it frustrates one of the major purposes of the legislation, which is that this gas should not be subject to FERC\u2019s jurisdiction and the resulting regulatory burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">FERC\u2019s construction does not create an \u201cobvious incongruity\u201d in the statute by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>making meaningless the day before the date of enactment test date. Although the test date has little effect on OCS gas, due to section 2(18)\u2019s inclusion of all OCS gas within its definition, the test date has a significant impact on non-OCS gas. Since some non-OCS gas may not come within section 2(18)\u2019s definition of \u201ccommitted or dedicated to interstate commerce\u201d prior to the day before the date of enactment, it will not become subject to FERC\u2019s jurisdiction by reason of a first sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">In support of its contention that FERC\u2019s construction thwarts one of the Act\u2019s major purposes, Conoco cites the following language of the House conferees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-6\">The conference agreement limits the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act in a manner similar to the House-passed bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-7\">Natural gas not committed or dedicated to interstate commerce on the day before the date of enactment of this Act is never made subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction under sec. 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">H.R.Rep. No. 1752, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 123, <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 8983, 9039-40. This language, Conoco argues, makes it clear that Congress did not intend to subject to FERC jurisdiction OCS gas not flowing on the day before the date of enactment. That argument, however, begs the question. The question of FERC\u2019s jurisdiction cannot be answered independent of a determination of the definition of \u201ccommitted or dedicated to interstate commerce,\u201d which brings us back to the starting place. It is clear from section 601 that Congress intended to free certain natural gas from FERC jurisdiction while leaving other gas subject to that jurisdiction. In deciding that certain gas is subject to its jurisdiction, FERC does not thwart any of the Act\u2019s major purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Conoco cites other portions of the legislative history to bolster its position. It places particular reliance on the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-10\">With respect to natural gas from the Outer Continental Shelf that is not subject to a certificate of public convenience and necessity under the Natural Gas Act on the date of enactment, the term \u201ccommitted or dedicated to interstate commerce\u201d is used solely for the purpose of the pricing and other provisions of this Act. This definition does not create new freestanding obligations or expand the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">H.R.Rep. No. 1752, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 123, <em>reprinted in </em>[1978] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 8983, 8988. Applying the section 2(18) definition to section 601(a)(1) expands FERC\u2019s jurisdiction, says Conoco, contrary to this express congressional statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">It is difficult to perceive how failure to exempt certain gas from NGA\u2019s regulations is an expansion of FERC\u2019s NGA jurisdiction, and we reject the contention that it is. The quoted statement does not provide the support Conoco ascribes to it, and in fact is consistent with FERC\u2019s construction. The reference to \u201cpricing and other provisions of this Act\u201d is broad enough to encompass section 601(a)(1): The correct import of the passage, we believe, is to state that the term in quotation marks is used as a term of art in NGPA and the definition is used solely for purposes of that Act and is not intended to expand the enormous body of case law concerning \u201cinterstate gas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">Conoco also relies on a letter from Secretary of Energy Schlesinger to Senator De-Concini, reported in 124 Cong. Rec. S16254 (daily ed. Sept. 27, 1978).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-15\">First, the wellhead pricing provisions of the bill will lead to a significant reduction in the regulatory burdens under the Natural Gas Act of 1938. For virtually all new wells, producers selling in interstate commerce will not be required to file, and the FERC will not be required to process, certificate applications, rate increase filings, or abandonment applications or to conduct rate determination proceedings. The vast majority of FERC\u2019s current caseload deals with producer regulation. For example, the projected 1979 caseload for the Commission is 47,522 cases and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>producer certificates and rate filings under the Natural Gas Act constitute 81 percent or 37,682. Those types of cases would be eliminated for the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEV\">Secretary Schlesinger\u2019s statement that \u201cvirtually all new wells\u201d would not be subject to FERC nonpricing regulations is not inconsistent with the view that FERC would continue to process some certificate applications, especially in view of the statutory scheme. The statement does not compel the result Conoco seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Perhaps more relevant is the statement of Representative Dingell and four other members of the House Conference Committee, reported in 124 Cong. Rec. H13117 (daily ed. Oct. 14, 1978).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-5\">There has been some discussion whether \u201cnew reservoirs\u201d on \u201cold OCS leases\u201d in the Baltimore Canyon would be deregulated under the Natural Gas Policy Act. . <em>However, such gas would not be deregulated for pricing or non-pricing purposes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-7\">On the other hand, \u201cnew gas,\u201d that is, gas produced from a \u201cnew lease\u201d as defined under section 102(c), would be deregulated for pricing purposes under section 121(a)(1) as of January 1, 1985. This category of gas would also be deregulated for non-pricing purposes under section 601(a)(l)(B)(ii), effective as of the first day of the first month beginning after date of enactment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">(Emphasis added). This statement shows that FERC\u2019s construction of the Act is fully consistent with Congress\u2019 intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">We conclude the general rule that the definition supplied by the legislature should be used is applicable here and that the resulting construction is consistent with the legislative intent. Accordingly, we affirm FERC\u2019s denial of the declaration sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
