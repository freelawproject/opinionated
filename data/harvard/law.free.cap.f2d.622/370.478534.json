The gravamen of Robert M.\u2019s complaint was that defendants had violated provisions of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (the Act), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401 <em>et seq. </em>(1976), as well as 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (1976), by failing to insure that Renee K. was educated as much as possible with nonhandicapped children. The complaint also alleged violations of the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">On January 24, 1979, the district court issued a revised temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The court determined initially that it had jurisdiction of the action under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(2) (1976), which authorizes judicial review of the findings and decisions made by educational agencies under the provisions of the Act. The court then ordered that Renee K. be kept in her regular education classes while the action was pending, pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(3) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-16\">On April 9,1979, Robert M. filed a motion for partial summary judgment. In that motion, Robert M. alleged that defendant Dr. Robert D. Benton was an employee of Iowa\u2019s state educational agency when he presided over Renee K.\u2019s due process hearing, in violation of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b)(2) (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Robert M.\u2019s motion requested the district court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>to declare that Dr. Robert D. Benton and any other employee of the State Department of Public Instruction are barred from conducting due process hearings pursuant to the provisions of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b)(2) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 121a.507(a) (1); to order that the State Department of Public Instruction hire independent hearing officers to conduct future due process hearings; and to remand this case for further proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">On August 13, 1979, the district court issued an order granting plaintiff Robert M.\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. The court found that Dr. Robert D. Benton, Iowa\u2019s Superintendent of Public Instruction, was not technically an employee of the State Department of Public Instruction but rather its director, in conjunction with the State Board of Public Instruction. The court nonetheless found that Dr. Benton was connected with Iowa education, and that he would therefore have a personal and professional interest in the case. <em>See </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 121a.507(a)(2) (1979). The court also concluded that Dr. Benton must be considered an employee of Iowa\u2019s state educational agency, and held accordingly that the hearing over which he presided violated the statute by failing to provide due process. The court ordered that plaintiff\u2019s motion be sustained and that the case be remanded for a new hearing presided over by an outside hearing officer. Dr. Benton has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">This appeal presents us with serious jurisdictional problems. First of all, the district court did not enter a separate judgment upon its order, as required by Fed.R. Civ.P. 58. While this may be forgivable in a simple case, <em>see Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, </em>435 U.S. 381, 98 S.Ct. 1117, 55 L.Ed.2d 357 (1978) <em>(per </em>curiam), it is very doubtful that an implied judgment in this action could be considered final and hence appealable. Several claims for relief set forth in plaintiff Robert M.\u2019s complaint have not been adjudicated, and the district court has not made the express determination required for entry of a partial final judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). It follows that we do not have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">It appears, however, that plaintiff Robert M.\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment requested both declaratory and injunctive relief. In sustaining this motion and requiring an outside hearing officer to preside at plaintiff\u2019s new hearing, the district court may have granted what amounts to an injunction against Dr. Benton, notwithstanding the order\u2019s failure to comply with the formal requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d). If so, we have jurisdiction of this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (1976). Given the ambiguous nature of the proceedings below, we must remand this case to the district court so that it can clarify its order of August 13, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">During oral argument counsel advised the court that Renee K. was currently enrolled in special education classes, pursuant to a placement effective since October 9, 1979. This court inquired whether this fact rendered plaintiff Robert M.\u2019s claims moot. Robert M. has since filed a supplementary brief on this issue. Thus, the question of mootness as well as that of appealability poses an obstacle to our reaching the merits of this case. We believe the district court on remand should address and resolve the mootness issue. Subject to the district court\u2019s resolution of this issue and clarification of its order of August 13,1979, granting partial summary judgment, we retain jurisdiction over this appeal. We ask the district court to act as expeditiously as possible in deciding these matters, and we request that it certify to us a supplementary record of all proceedings conducted on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\">. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b)(2) (1976) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-12\">Whenever a complaint has been received under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the parents or guardian shall have an opportunity for an impartial due process hearing which shall be conducted by the State educational agency or by the local educational agency or intermediate educational unit, as determined by State law or by the State educational agency. No hearing conducted pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph shall be conducted by an employee of such agency or unit involved in the education or care of the child.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-6\">. While conceding that the district court\u2019s order is not final, Robert M. urges us to apply the \u201cexception\u201d to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 allegedly recognized in <em>Gillespie v. U. S. Steel Corp., </em>379 U.S. 148, 85 S.Ct. 308, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964). This argument misconceives the thrust of <em>Gillespie, </em>which did not recognize any such exception but rather applied a practical test in deciding whether the finality requirement was satisfied. Robert M.\u2019s concession, entirely appropriate on the facts of this case, thus vitiates his argument in favor of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
