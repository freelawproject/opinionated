Skelly Oil Co. v. FPC, </em>375 F.2d 6 (10th Cir. 1967), <em>aff\u2019d in part, rov\u2019d in part sub nom. Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, </em>390 U.S. 747, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968). Although affirming the Commission\u2019s rejection of the proposal, we nevertheless remanded the case with the following directions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-10\">We feel constrained, however, to note that the increasing problems wrought by the natural gas shortage may have substantially altered the Commission\u2019s assessment of the public interest during the two years that have elapsed since Dorchester first submitted evidence in support of its settlement proposal. Moreover, the Commission\u2019s disapproval of the terms of Dorchester\u2019s settlement agreement may be susceptible to recantation if Dorchester and Northern attempt to renegotiate the settlement terms. Accordingly, we feel that upon remand, the Commission should further stay its order for Dorchester to refund the escrowed funds in order to allow Dorchester the opportunity to submit an amended settlement agreement for FERC approval. Should Dorchester choose to do so, it should structure the terms of the new agreement to meet the specific objections voiced by the Commission in passing on Dorchester\u2019s original proposal. Should Dorchester choose not to submit a new proposal within a reasonable time, or should Dorchester submit a proposal that represents a materially unaltered version of the original agreement, the FERC is free to lift its stay in this case and to order forthwith Dorchester\u2019s compliance with the orders in issue here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">571 F.2d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">Following remand, Dorchester submitted to the Commission a revised settlement agreement. The Commission again rebuffed Dorchester\u2019s attempt to justify its settlement by reference to the special <em>Permian </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">Dorchester argues the Commission erred in rejecting newly proffered evidence on the ground that our remand was designed to provide it with an opportunity to prove it was entitled to special relief under the <em>Permian </em>test. The purpose of our remand, however, was not to give Dorchester a second chance to litigate the special relief question, which the Commission had decided adversely to it. Instead, we remanded to give the Commission an opportunity to assess the public interest in light of the current exigencies wrought by this country\u2019s natural gas shortage. The Commission concluded the public interest did not demand the questioned funds be applied to exploration, specifically finding that the new rate structure contained sufficient incentive for exploration for new gas. This finding must be sustained on this review.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">Dorchester argues the Commission improperly discriminated against it, since, only weeks before denying Dorchester\u2019s revised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>settlement, the Commission had approved a similar settlement proposal in an unrelated proceeding. <em>See Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>Docket No. CI68-815 (June 22, 1979). In approving that proposed settlement, however, the Commission specifically noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-4\">We think it is in the public interest to accept the proposed settlement. However, the exploration and development program proposed by Phillips has not played an important part in our consideration. Furthermore, we express no view as to the continued viability of the 3 for 2 split with respect to the funds for such program, and we reserve the right to reexamine this concept in a future case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avg\">As we recently noted in connection with a review of a FERC decision denying a refund request, \u201cThe fact that the Commission grants relief on one set of facts does not require it to do so on another.\u201d <em>Estate of French v. FERC, </em>603 F.2d 1158, 1166 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The Commission correctly understood the remand to require consideration of the public interest at the time of remand. Once it determined that the public had no interest in recapturing these funds for exploration, it became unnecessary for the Commission to consider the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Because the Commission proceedings complied with our prior mandate, its orders are due to be affirmed. <em>See FTC v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., </em>380 U.S. 374, 382-84, 85 S.Ct. 1035, 1041-42, 13 L.Ed.2d 904 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
