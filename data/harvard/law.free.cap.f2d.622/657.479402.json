Because we are persuaded by a careful review of the Ohio decisional law, as well as other relevant sources, that the Supreme Court of Ohio would not construe its statute of limitations so as to preclude recovery in this case, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-19\">James and Sondra McKenna brought this suit for negligence, misrepresentation, and products liability against Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation (Ortho). The plaintiffs charged that Mrs. McKenna suffered severe personal injury and permanent disability as a result of ingesting Ortho-Novum, an oral contraceptive manufactured and marketed by Ortho. Following the birth of the McKennas\u2019 second child, Mrs. McKenna began using Ortho-Novum in January 1965, after receiving assurances both from Or-tho\u2019s published brochure and from her personal physician, that the drug was safe and posed no serious risks. In 1967, Mrs. McKenna developed severe headaches and also experienced two attacks of transient ischemia. While hospitalized in 1969 for a stomach ailment involving vessel wall damage, Mrs. McKenna was told that she had high blood pressure, which was characterized as hypertension. In June 1969, Mrs. McKenna ceased using the oral contraceptives. Three years later, in March 1972, she suffered a catastrophic cerebrovascular stroke that left her severely and permanently paralyzed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>One year and nine months thereafter, in November 1973, the McKennas commenced this action in a Pennsylvania state court by a praecipe for a writ of trespass.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On Or-tho\u2019s motion, the suit was removed to the federal district court in Pittsburgh, where it was ultimately tried. The plaintiffs claimed that Mrs. McKenna\u2019s injuries were caused by her ingestion of Ortho-Novum; that Mrs. McKenna relied on Ortho\u2019s false assurances about the product\u2019s safety in deciding to use Ortho-Novum; that Ortho knew or should have known that these statements were false; and that Ortho-Novum posed a risk of serious harm to its users.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Prior to trial, the district court denied Ortho\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the McKennas knew, or reasonably should have known, more than two years prior to the commencement of the suit, that Mrs. McKenna\u2019s injuries resulted from the ingestion of Ortho-Novum. During the four weeks of jury trial, the McKennas introduced expert witnesses who testified that the cerebrovascular stroke was the ultimate result of either vessel-wall damage or high blood pressure, and that both of these conditions, as well as the headaches and transient ischemia attacks, were caused by Mrs. McKenna\u2019s ingestion of Ortho-Novum. At the close of trial, but prior to submission of the case to the jury, the district court granted Ortho\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the ground that the action was barred under Ohio\u2019s statute of limitations. The district court concluded that the Ohio statute began to run, at the latest, in 1969 when Mrs. McKenna developed high blood pressure, and that the cause of action was accordingly barred because it was filed more than two years after that time. It is this conclusion that we review here.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">Although Pennsylvania courts ordinarily apply the statute of limitations of the forum state,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Pennsylvania \u201cborrowing statute\u201d in effect when the case was tried provided a statutory exception to this rule. It declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-13\">When a cause of action has been fully barred by the law of the state in which it arose, such bar shall be a complete defense to an action thereon in any of the courts of this Commonwealth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4s\">The district court, in granting Ortho\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, reasoned that the Pennsylvania statute borrowed not only Ohio\u2019s two-year limitations period, but also Ohio\u2019s law governing the determination when the cause of action arises. In their appeal, the McKennas contend that this was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>error; they argue that even though the Pennsylvania statute \u201cborrows\u201d the law of Ohio regarding the length of the applicable limitations period, the question when that limitations period begins to run must be determined not by Ohio but by Pennsylvania law.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The McKennas premise their argument on this Court\u2019s prior decision in <em>Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Bendix-Westinghouse Automotive Air Brake Company.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Mack Trucks, we </em>were asked to decide when an action for indemnity arose, for the purpose of determining whether the Pennsylvania \u201cborrowing statute\u201d was applicable to that action. Noting the \u201cfamiliar rule\u201d that a statute of limitations \u201cbegins to run when the cause of action arises, as determined by the occurrence of the final significant event necessary to make the claim suable,\u201d we held that a \u201ccause arises <em>where </em>as well as <em>when </em>the final significant event that is essential to a suable claim occurs.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the final significant event essential to the action for indemnity happened in Florida, we concluded that Florida\u2019s statute of limitations applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\"><em>Mack Trucks\u2019 </em>application of the Pennsylvania \u201cborrowing statute,\u201d the McKennas claim, depended upon the ascertainment of where the cause of action arose, which in turn was based on the prior determination of when it accrued. In support of this interpretation, the McKennas rely on <em>Prince v. Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which held, on the basis of <em>Mack Trucks, </em>that the \u201cborrowing statute\u201d applies \u201conly upon satisfaction of two contingencies: (1) the cause of action must arise in another state; and (2) the cause of action must be totally barred by the law of that state. Under the <em>Mack Truck </em>analysis,\u201d the district court concluded, \u201csatisfaction of the first contingency is determined by finding where the cause of action arose, and the determination is to be governed by Pennsylvania law.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">The crux of the justification offered for this construction of <em>Mack Trucks </em>is the assertion that we determined when the cause of action arose in that case by references to Pennsylvania law. But, as the most recent decision addressing this issue points out, <em>\u201cMack Trucks </em>relied not only on Pennsylvania cases but also on cases from other jurisdictions.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nor was there any suggestion in <em>Mack Trucks </em>that Florida would have commenced the running of the statute of limitations at a time different from when Pennsylvania would have. Inasmuch as <em>Mack Trucks </em>did not even discuss this issue, we do not find that decision controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">We are persuaded, rather, that the apparent purpose of the Pennsylvania \u201cborrowing statute\u201d requires us to look to the law of the state where the cause of action arose to determine not only the prescribed period of limitations but also the point at which the statute begins to run. By its terms, the \u201cborrowing statute\u201d bars a plaintiff from suing in Pennsylvania \u201cwhen [the] cause of action has been fully barred by the laws of the state ... in which it arose . . ..\u201d In our view, the essential question posed under the \u201cborrowing statute\u201d is whether the action in question is precluded by the laws of the state in which it accrued, and the answer to that question also must be based on the law of the state in which the claim arose. To do otherwise might well revive an action which is \u201cfully barred by the laws\u201d of another state. Accordingly, because the McKennas\u2019 cause of action arose in Ohio, we must look to Ohio law to determine when Ohio\u2019s statute of limitations commenced to run. And the question for decision, then, is whether Ohio\u2019s statute of limitations commenced to run prior to the date Mrs. McKenna knew, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>or reasonably should have discovered, that her injuries were caused by Ortho-Novum.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Given that Ohio law governs the question for decision, the task remains to determine what the pertinent Ohio law is and then to apply it to this controversy. The question of how a federal court is to ascertain and apply state decisional law to a particular case has provoked considerable comment from courts and commentators alike.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As some have noted, the concept that a federal court must determine state law is somewhat misleading inasmuch as it implies the existence of a readily accessible and easily understood body of state law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On the contrary, the law of a state is frequently \u201cdynamic rather than static,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and consists of a working body of rules, which find expression in a number of sources. It is this working body of rules to which a federal court must look in order to ascertain the state law that governs in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-16\">In those few instances in which the highest state court has recently spoken to the precise question at issue in a particular setting, the duty of the federal court to determine and apply state law is easily met. After all, \u201c[t]he State\u2019s highest court is the best authority on its own law.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The problem of ascertainment arises when, as here, the highest state court has not yet authoritatively addressed the critical issue. Recent opinions of this Court make clear that our disposition of such cases must be governed by a prediction of how the state\u2019s highest court would decide were it confronted with the problem.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>have characterized this assignment as speculative or crystal-ball gazing, nonetheless it is a task which we may not decline.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">An accurate forecast of Ohio\u2019s law, as it would be expressed by its highest court, requires an examination of all relevant sources of that state\u2019s law in order to isolate those factors that would inform its decision. The primary source that must be analyzed of course, is the decisional law of the Ohio Supreme Court. In the absence of authority directly on point, decisions by that court in analogous cases provide useful indications of the court\u2019s probable disposition of a particular question of law. It is important to note, however, that our prediction \u201ccannot be the product of a mere recitation of previously decided cases.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In determining state law, a federal tribunal should be careful to avoid the \u201cdanger\u201d of giving \u201ca state court decision a more binding effect than would a court of that state under similar circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Rather, relevant state precedents must be scrutinized with an eye toward the broad policies that informed those adjudications, and to the doctrinal trends which they evince.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Considered dicta by the state\u2019s highest court may also provide a federal court with reliable indicia of how the state tribunal might rule on a particular question.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because the highest state court \u201cenjoys some latitude of decision in ascertaining the law applicable to a particular dispute even where there may be dicta in point,\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> however, a federal court should be circumspect in surrendering its own judgment concerning what the state law is on account of dicta. As Professor Charles Alan Wright has written, \u201cmuch depends on the character of the dictum.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Of somewhat less importance to a prognostication of what the highest state court will do are decisions of lower state courts and other federal courts. Such decisions should be accorded \u201cproper regard\u201d of course, but not conclusive effect.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, the Supreme Court has held that although the decision of a lower state court \u201cshould be \u2018attributed some weight the decision [is] not controlling . \u2019 where the highest court of the State has not spoken on the point. . Thus, under some conditions, federal authority may not be bound even by an intermediate state appellate court ruling.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Additionally, federal courts may consider scholarly treatises,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the Restatement of Law,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and germane law review articles<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>\u2014particularly, it seems, of schools within the state whose law is to be predicted.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In sum, a federal court attempting to forecast state law must consider relevant state precedents, analogous decisions, considered dicta, scholarly works, and any other reliable data tending convincingly to show how the highest court in the state would decide the issue at hand. The rule of <em>Erie </em>calls on us to apply state law and not, as the dissent notes, \u201cto participate in an effort to change it\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> merely because we doubt its soundness. At the same time, however, blind adherence to state precedents \u201cwithout evaluating the decision[s] in the light of other relevant data as to what the state law is, will result in injustice and a perversion of the state law which the federal court sets out to apply.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As this Court has declared:<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKQ\">A diversity litigant should not be drawn to the federal forum by the prospect of a more favorable outcome than he could expect in the state courts. But neither should he be penalized for his choice of the federal court by being deprived of the flexibility that a state court could reasonably be expected to show.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-15\">In support of its conclusion that Ohio\u2019s statutes of limitation bar the McKennas\u2019 actions, the district court relied, as does the dissent here, primarily on <em>Wyler v. Tripi,</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decided nine years ago by the Ohio Supreme Court. The central dispute in that case concerned the date on which a cause of action for medical malpractice accrued. Expressly following the rule announced in a series of prior decisions,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Wyler </em>held that the cause of action came into existence at the latest, at the time the physician-patient relationship terminated, and not when the plaintiff discovered the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-16\">The \u201ctermination of treatment\u201d concept was developed very early in Ohio law<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> as an exception to the traditional rule that statutes of limitation commenced to run at the time an individual sustained injury as the result of the tortious act of another.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>It was designed, as the <em>Wyler </em>court observed, \u201cto avoid the harsh results of the traditional rule\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> by tolling the applicable statute of limitations until the conclusion of the physician-patient relationship. Although this doctrine represents a \u201cmarked departure from the general rule,\u201d it \u201caffords little relief in cases where the injury is one which requires a long developmental period before becoming dangerous and discoverable.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In such cases, the termination exception extends the period before the statute of limitations begins to run, \u201cbut does so by a factor which bears no logical relationship to the injury incurred.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOR\">It was this kind of issue with which the Ohio Supreme Court was confronted in <em>Wyler. </em>The plaintiff there alleged that improper treatment by her physician ultimately resulted in the manifestation of asceptic necrosis, necessitating the replacement of her hip and the subsequent removal of her leg. Because the plaintiff failed to discover the alleged negligence within a year after she left the care of her physician, application of either the traditional rule or the \u201ctermination of treatment\u201d exception would not prevent what the <em>Wyler </em>majority itself termed \u201cthe unconscionable result that the injured party\u2019s right to recovery can be barred by the statute of limitations before [s]he is even aware of its existence.\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Troubled by this result, the Ohio court examined the laws of various jurisdictions and the growing trend away from the traditional rule and towards adoption of the discovery rule. According to this approach, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the plaintiff actually discovers, or with due diligence should have discovered, the negligence alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Although the court\u2019s examination of the cases persuaded it that \u201cthere is much to recommend the adoption of the discovery rule,\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> a bare majority nonetheless \u201creluctantly conclud[ed]\u201d that \u201cthe courts of Ohio should not decree such an adoption.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The sole justification for refusing to adopt the discovery rule was that such action should be left to the legislature. The court was \u201cconvinced that to [adopt the discovery rule] would place [it] in the obvious and untenable position of having not only legislated, but of having done so directly in the face of a clear and opposite legislative intent.\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Referring to the legislature\u2019s failure to adopt the discovery rule by legislation, the court concluded: \u201cIn consideration of the obvious and repeated disinclination of the General Assembly to amend its malpractice statute of limitations, we are compelled to adhere to our former decisions on the question and refrain from judicially adopting that which has so clearly been legislatively rejected.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">Notwithstanding this extensive pronouncement of the court\u2019s position, this same court during the following year employed the discovery rule in <em>Melnyk v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>Cleveland </em>Clinic<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The plaintiff there alleged that a physician employed by the Clinic had negligently left a metallic forceps and a nonabsorbent sponge in his abdomen. Even though the plaintiff failed to discover the negligence until more than one year after he left the care of the physician, the Ohio Supreme Court refused to bar his action, and held that the applicable one-year statute of limitations was tolled \u201cuntil such time as the patient discovers, or by exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the negligent act.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Although the <em>Melnyk </em>court took great pains, as does the dissent in this case, to distinguish <em>Melnyk </em>from <em>Wyler </em>on the ground that the former did not involve the \u201cproblems faced in the defense of a \u2018stale\u2019 claim for medical malpractice,\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> the distinction, as a recent commentator on Ohio law has argued, \u201cin essence is an artificial one.\u201d <footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Indeed, <em>Wyler </em>expressly took note of the fact that courts adopting the discovery doctrine viewed it \u201cas being entirely consistent with the policy of the statute of limitations to prevent \u2018stale claims.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The holding of <em>Wyler </em>declining to adopt the discovery rule depended not at all on the policy of discouraging stale claims, but solely upon the court\u2019s reluctance to contravene what it then believed to be the policy of the state legislature. By embracing the discovery rule in <em>Melnyk, </em>therefore, the Ohio Supreme Court \u201ccompletely abandoned the rationale which served as the basis and justification for the <em>Wyler </em>decision, namely, that of legislative prerogative in this area.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\"><em>Melnyk\u2019s </em>implicit rejection of the <em>Wyler </em>rationale \u2014 that only the state legislature may properly decide whether to apply the discovery rule \u2014 appears well justified. As evidence of the alleged intent of the legislature to eschew the discovery rule, <em>Wyler </em>referred to the legislature\u2019s failure to enact legislation modifying the court\u2019s prior decisions that interpreted the statute of limitations for medical malpractice.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Legislative inaction, however, \u201cis a weak reed upon which to lean in determining legislative intent.\u201d <footnotemark>50</footnotemark> A statute of limitations is a product of legislation, but it is the judiciary\u2019s task to interpret and enforce such an enactment. The Ohio statute in question here is phrased in general terms and requires only that an action for bodily injury \u201cshall be brought within two years after the cause thereof arose.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The legislature left unresolved when a cause of action arises and when the statute commences to run. And, in Ohio, these kinds of determinations have always been the product of \u201cjudicial interpretation, not legislative promulgation.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Consequently, application of the discovery rule to the facts of this case in no way intrudes on the authority of the state legislature. Indeed, Ohio\u2019s selection of the termination exception represented not only a marked departure from the traditional rule, but also a judicial determination as to when a cause of action accrues. <em>Melnyk\u2019s </em>choice of the discovery rule, at least in the absence of an expression by the legislature prohibiting such an adoption, therefore appears fully compatible with the court\u2019s responsibility to ascertain and comply with legislative intention.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Moreover, the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Melnyk </em>distinguished its decision in <em>Wyler </em>as speaking only to the question of <em>when </em>a cause of action arises, and not to the determination whether the running of the statute of limitations is, for some reason, tolled.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> It then proceeded to hold that the running of the statute of limitations on Melnyk\u2019s cause of action was tolled until such time as he discovered, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the negligent act, even though his cause of action accrued, under <em>Wyler, </em>at the termination of the patient-physician relationship. On this analysis, the holding in <em>Wyler </em>determines only <em>when </em>the McKennas\u2019 cause of action accrued; it is inapposite to the question whether the action was tolled until such time as the McKennas could know how Mrs. McKenna\u2019s injuries occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">It is claimed, nonetheless, that <em>\u201cMelnyk </em>does not overrule <em>Wyler,\u201d </em>but \u201cmerely carves out a very specific and narrow exception\u201d <footnotemark>55</footnotemark> to the termination rule when, as in that case, surgical instruments are left in a patient\u2019s body. For this reason, the dissent would not apply the discovery rule to the circumstances of this case. In its view, we are improperly modifying a \u201cdecadent\u201d and \u201cunenlightened\u201d doctrine of state law simply because we disagree with it. On the contrary, however, we fully recognize our responsibility to accurately apply the pertinent Ohio law. Indeed, we do not dispute that federal courts must faithfully adhere to state substantive law in non-federal matters. But, as commentators have emphasized, such adherence should be wise and discerning. This Court has noted only recently that \u201cwhile a federal diversity court must not fashion a wholly independent federal standard with which to determine matters of substantive right, it likewise must not conceive of its role as applying the state decisional law to the case at hand in a narrow and mechanical fashion.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Rather, a federal court must \u201cbe sensitive to the doctrinal trends of the state whose law it applies, and the policies which inform the prior adjudications by the state courts.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> \u25a0'</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">In our view, the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Melnyk </em>not only abandoned the sole justification proffered for its opposition in <em>Wyler </em>to the adoption of the discovery rule, but also manifested a recognition that this approach alone avoids the harsh and inequitable results of applying the traditional rule in such cases. \u201cCertainly a federal court sitting in diversity should not mechanically follow precedent and blindly apply principles of <em>stare decisis </em>when it appears that the corresponding state court would adjust its common law to meet changing conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> A fair scrutiny of the relevant Ohio precedents, with an eye toward the principles and policies underlying them, strongly indicates that the Ohio Supreme Court would extend the discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>rule set forth in <em>Melnyk </em>to include the type of personal injury action present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The task of a federal court sitting in diversity is often difficult, for it must forsake its own expertise and assume that of the foreign state. Required as we are to predict how the Ohio Supreme Court would decide the present case, however, we believe that the Court would hold that the applicable statutes of limitation in this case were tolled until the McKennas knew, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the cause of Mrs. McKenna\u2019s injuries. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-13\">.

Under the doctrine of <em>Erie R. R. v.

In the usual case \u2014 when the act constituting negligence causes direct and immediate injury \u2014 the action accrues and the period of limitations runs from the date of the act. When the negligent act is injurious only in its consequences, however, Ohio courts have held that the cause accrues and the limitations run only from the time that some consequential injury or damage manifests itself. In <em>Cook v. Yager, </em>13 Ohio App.2d 1, 233 N.E.2d 326 (1968), for example, the syllabus stated that where the negligent act \u201ccauses no contemporaneous injury or damage to the patient but the forces set in motion by such violation proximately cause injury or damage thereafter, then, . . the cause and the statute of limitations pertaining to the cause of action does not begin to run until the date such consequential injury or damage first manifests itself.\u201d 13 Ohio App.2d at 10-11, 233 N.E.2d at 332; <em>see Brush Beryllium Co. </em>v. <em>Meckley, </em>284 F.2d 797 (6th Cir. 1960). This principle of Ohio law apparently accords with the majority rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-22\">As a general rule, the occurrence of an act or omission, whether it is a breach of contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>or of duty, whereby one sustains a direct injury, however slight, starts the statute of limitations running against the right to maintain an action. It is sufficient if nominal damages are recoverable for the breach or for the wrong, and where that is the case it is unimportant that the actual or substantial damage is not discovered or does not occur until later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfI_\">51 Am.Jur.2d <em>Limitation of Actions </em>\u00a7 109, at 681 (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">In the present case, the district court determined that consequential injury or damage resulting from Mrs. McKenna\u2019s ingestion of Or-tho-Novum manifested itself, at the latest, in 1969 when Mrs. McK\u00e9nna developed hypertension. Although the classification of this development, rather than the occurrence of Mrs. McKenna\u2019s transient ischemia attacks or excruciating headaches or, for that matter, the occurrence of the cerebrovascular stroke in 1972, as the first manifestation of consequential injury or damage seems somewhat arbitrary, it nonetheless appears consistent with the applicable principles of Ohio law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b744-11\">. 25 Ohio St.2d at 168, 267 N.E.2d at 421.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b744-12\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b744-13\">\n<em>.

Code. While that section still states, as before, that \u201c[a]n action for bodily injury or injuring personal property shall be brought within two years after the cause thereof arose,\u201d the amendment now provides further that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">For purposes of this section, a cause of action for bodily injury caused by exposure to asbestos or to chromium in any of its chemical forms arises upon the date on which the plaintiff is informed by competent medical authority that he has been injured by such exposure, or upon the date on which, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, he should have become aware that he had been injured by the exposure, whichever date occurs first.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFe\">Relying primarily on this amendment, Or-tho submitted a petition for rehearing claiming that this provision removes the basis for our decision that \u201cthe Ohio Supreme Court would extend the discovery rule set forth in <em>Melnyk v. Cleveland Clinic, </em>32 Ohio St.2d 198, 290 N.E.2d 916 (1972) to include the type of personal injury action present here.\u201d (Majority opinion typescript at 666-667). The panel requested the Mc-Kennas to file an answer to Ortho\u2019s petition. After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs in light of the amendment to \u00a7 2305.10, we adhere to our original position.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">Prior to the amendment in question, \u00a7 2305.10 required that an action for bodily injury \u201cshall be brought within two years after the cause thereof arose.\u201d Regarding the question <em>when </em>a cause of action arises, however the statute was silent. In amending this provision, the legislature specifically stipulated that a cause of action for bodily injury caused by exposure to asbestos or to chromium arises upon the date on which the plaintiff is informed or reasonably should have become aware that he was injured by the exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">Ortho argues that this amendment represents a clear legislative pronouncement that the \u201cOhio courts are to apply a discovery rule in the two enumerated categories of cases and none other.\u201d Invoking the precept of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>Ortho relies on 50 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d \u00a7 188 to support its contention that in Ohio the specific enumeration by the legislature of items in a statute implies the exclusion of others. Ortho then concludes, in effect, that the legislature, in specifically postponing the time when a cause of action arises in cases involving injury resulting from asbestos or chromium, thereby precluded application of the discovery rule in all other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">As the section immediately following that relied on by Ortho points out, however, \u201c[t]he maxim \u2018expressio unius est exclusio alterius\u2019 is not of universal application and caution should be exercised in its use,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 189 at 166-67. In our view, the cautious and more reasonable construction of the amendment, a well as the one we believe the Ohio Supreme Court would embrace, is that it was not meant to preclude judicial adoption of the discovery rule in appropriate circumstances. Adoption of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>trary construction would effectively abrogate that court\u2019s well-established principle, expressly reaffirmed in <em>Wyler v. Tripi, </em>25 Ohio St.2d 164, 267 N.E.2d 419 (1971), that a cause of action for medical malpractice arises, at the latest, when the physician-patient relationship terminates. We believe the Ohio Supreme Court would hold that if the legislature had intended, by its passage of this amendment, not merely to extend greater protection to victims of asbestos and chromium poisoning but at the same time to deprive victims of medical malpractice of the protection they currently enjoy under the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decisional law, it would have done so expressly and not by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Even if the amendment to \u00a7 2305.10 does \u2014 by indicating specifically when a cause of action arises in cases of asbestos or chromium poisoning \u2014 effectively establish just when a cause of action must arise in all other cases, however, that would not affect our decision here. For we accepted the district court\u2019s determination that the McKennas\u2019 causes of action arose at the time consequential injury resulted from Mrs. McKenna\u2019s ingestion of Ortho-Novum. Nevertheless, we held that the Ohio Supreme Court would decide that the applicable statutes of limitation were tolled until the McKenna\u2019s knew, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the cause of Mrs. McKenna\u2019s injuries. In so doing, we expressly followed the distinction drawn by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Melnyk </em>between the question <em>when </em>a cause of action arises and the determination <em>whether </em>the statute of limitations may, for some reason, be tolled on such action. Since the amendment at issue, even if it implicates the question when a cause of action for bodily injury from birth control pills arises, does not affect the determination whether the statute of limitations respecting that action may be tolled, we adhere to our prior opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Judge Hunter joins in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b748-6\">A. LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aky\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">With all due respect to my colleagues, I believe that they err in their continuing adherence to their view on the roles of Ohio\u2019s legislative and judicial branches in the alteration of Ohio\u2019s statute of limitations. As I indicated earlier, it is my belief that the Ohio courts have in the past and will in the future adhere to the view that \u201cstatutes of limitation are a legislative prerogative and their operation and effect are based upon important legislative policy.\u201d <em>Wetzel v. Weyant, </em>41 Ohio St.2d 135, 323 N.E.2d 711, 713 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">As is noted by the majority, the Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation brought to the attention of this court legislation which amends Ohio\u2019s statute of limitations, \u00a7 2305.10 Ohio Rev.Code, to include a discovery period for two types of injury, those caused \u201cby exposure to asbestos or to chromium.\u201d This legislation is irreconcilable with the panel\u2019s rationale. It clearly evidences an intention of the Ohio legislature to reject a general discovery rule that would encompass the plaintiffs\u2019 suit and to continue their traditional role in the area of statutes of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">I agree with the majority that the Ohio Supreme Court would not blindly follow the rule of <em>expressio unius est exclusio </em>alterius; however, I believe that it would be followed here. First, <em>Wyler v. Tripi, </em>25 Ohio St.2d 164, 267 N.E.2d 419 (1971), where Ohio\u2019s Supreme Court rejected a general discovery rule, is an implicit application of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius. </em>The following passage indicates that the Ohio Supreme Court would apply the rule, adverse to the plaintiffs, when it reflected upon the new amendment to \u00a7 2305.10 of the Ohio Rev. Code.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">It should also be noted that although the General Assembly has refused to adopt the discovery rule for medical malpractice cases, it has nevertheless created certain exceptions to the general operation of various other statutes of limitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>Wyler, </em>267 N.E.2d at 423. Second, I believe that Ohio\u2019s Supreme Court would consider the members of the Ohio General Assembly to be perfectly capable of drafting a general discovery statute and the court would hold that the General Assembly would have done so had it felt that a more general discovery rule was desirable. I note that the General Assembly has had general statutes presented to it in the past and has chosen not to adopt them. <em>See Wyler v. Tripi, </em>267 N.E.2d at 423 (describing House Bill No. 177, introduced in the 101st General Assembly, which would have provided for a discovery period in all malpractice cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The majority\u2019s argument that legislative prerogative extends only to the issue of \u201cwhen\u201d a statute starts to run and not to whether it is \u201ctolled\u201d is simply a semantic one. The key issue here is which branch of government decides whether these plaintiffs\u2019 suit is timely. Unlike the relationship between many state appellate courts and their respective legislatures, the Ohio courts have more frequently deferred to the Ohio General Assembly in cases of this type. On this record I believe they would also defer to the Ohio legislature and so should the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Thus, I would grant the petition for rehearing and affirm the decision of the lower court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-10\">. In addition to the new amendment Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. has forwarded to this court a decision by the Court of Appeals of Ohio, Eighth District, <em>Saultz v. Funk, </em>No. 38328 (May 24, 1979), in which the court refused to extend the discovery rule. This too has failed to persuade the majority. <em>Saultz </em>is merely one of an unbroken line of cases from Ohio which rejects the discovery rule announced by the majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-16\">. In <em>Gemignani v. Philadelphia Phillies National League Baseball Club, Inc., </em>287 F.Supp. 465 (E.D.Pa.1967), I held that the Pennsylvania discovery rule tolled the statute of limitations until the plaintiff learns of the casual relationship between his physician\u2019s actions and his injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b749-7\">A. LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANk\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">Although I am as moved as my colleagues are by the alleged tragic effects from Mrs. McKenna\u2019s ingestion of appellee\u2019s birth control pills and while I am as convinced as they are that the discovery rule is a humane and desirable component of medical malpractice law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1 must respectfully dissent. I cannot join them because the Ohio Supreme Court has not adopted and would not now adopt the modern view on discovery in medical malpractice cases. I see no sign that Ohio is withdrawing from its views on the medical malpractice doctrines relevant to this case. The distinguished trial judge who tried this case so patiently, was not unsympathetic to the plight of Mrs. McKenna; yet from my view he is being reversed \u2014 not because he was wrong \u2014 but because the relevant Ohio law is unenlightened.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">With respect, I submit that the majority disregards Ohio\u2019s current (though archaic) doctrine and announces a rule of law that Ohio should adopt. In 1971 the Ohio Supreme Court firmly and resolutely rejected the discovery rule. <em>Wyler v. Tripi, </em>25 Ohio St.2d 164, 267 N.E.2d 419 (1971). Because I conclude that the Ohio Supreme Court would adhere to the <em>Wyler v. Tripi </em>decision, I must dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-14\">Ohio courts have long held that the plaintiff\u2019s inability to discover the tortious act of the defendant has no relevance to the running of the applicable statute of limitations. <em>E. g., Kerns v. Schoonmaker, </em>4 Ohio 331 (1831) (negligent acts of justice of the peace); 34 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 536. This doctrine was reaffirmed by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Wyler v. Tripi </em>in 1971 and applied to medical malpractice actions. In <em>Wyler v. Tripi, </em>the court rejected an explicit request of the plaintiff to overrule that harsh precedent. In declining the invitation, the court recognized that its action could \u201clead to the unconscionable result that [an] injured party\u2019s right to recovery [would] be barred by the statute of limitations before he is even aware of its existence.\u201d 267 N.E.2d at 421. The court relied neither on a policy justification for a short <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>period of limitations nor on humanity considerations when it rejected the discovery rule. Indeed, it noted that \u201c[tjhere is much to recommend the adoption of a discovery rule.\u201d It declined to adopt the rule on the ground that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\">to do so would place us in the obvious and untenable position of having done so directly in the face of a clear and opposite legislative intent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASq\"><em>Id. </em>at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In spite of this explicit statement the majority declines to follow <em>Wyler. </em>It argues that the <em>Wyler </em>rationale would be abandoned in a 1980 decision of the Ohio Supreme Court and thus it feels free to include the discovery rule in its decision. I do not agree. None of the materials the majority cites persuades me that an abandonment of the <em>Wyler </em>rationale is in the wind, nor have I unearthed any materials that foretell such an event.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The primary source of the majority\u2019s view is <em>Melnyk v. The Cleveland Clinic, </em>32 Ohio St.2d 198, 290 N.E.2d 916 (1972), a decision of the Ohio Supreme Court, decided one year after <em>Wyler. </em>In an opinion by Justice Herbert, who also wrote the <em>Wyler </em>opinion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-13\">. the negligent leaving of a metallic forceps and a nonabsorbent sponge inside a patient\u2019s body during surgery will toll the running of the statute of limitation upon that cause of action until such time as the patient discovers, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the negligent act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdJ\">290 N.E.2d at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-14\"><em>Melnyk </em>does not overrule Wyler; it merely carves out a very specific and narrow exception: when surgical instruments are left in a patient\u2019s body a discovery period tolls the running of the statute of limitations. The <em>Melnyk </em>court did not \u201cabando[n] the rationale\u201d of <em>Wyler </em>when it created this exception. Majority Opinion Typescript, at 666. The court held that the case before it did not disturb the legislative judgment. Justice Herbert noted that the limitations period in most malpractice cases reflected a balancing of the interests of physicians and patients and that the Ohio legislature had struck the balance in favor of physicians because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>the difficulties of proof in most malpractice cases. The court argued that in a \u201cforeign-objects\u201d case the plaintiff\u2019s proof of the physician\u2019s negligence, once the existence of the foreign object was established, was irrefutable, and therefore the court felt free to include a discovery period in the \u201cforeign objects\u201d cases. 290 N.E.2d at 917. The <em>Melnyk </em>court carefully noted that it did not \u201cneed to disturb the holding in <em>Wyler, </em>nor interfere in the affairs of our sister branch government, in order to accord this rule of law the viability we have determined it must have.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The following language from the beginning of the <em>Melnyk </em>opinion further suggests the court was reaffirming the legislature\u2019s authority in this area.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">The <em>Wyler </em>case involved the problems faced in the defense of a \u201cstale\u201d claim for medical malpractice. As in other fields of highly technical and inexact science, evidence in defense of such claims is unusually difficult to acquire and present. . [T]he General Assembly exercised its prerogative in this field and enacted a statute of limitation of comparatively brief duration. <em>Wyler </em>recognized the legislative authority to so act, but as heretofore noted, did so with an unmistakable lack of enthusiasm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 917 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">The validity of the <em>Wyler </em>rationale is underscored by a decision of the Ohio Supreme Court five years later, <em>Amer v. Akron City Hospital, </em>47 Ohio St.2d 85, 351 N.E.2d 479 (1976). There the court deferred to the legislative judgment on statutes of limitations. In <em>Amer </em>a husband brought an action for loss of consortium because of an alleged medical malpractice upon his wife. The court held that the applicable statute of limitations \u201cis not <em>tolled </em>until termination of the physician-patient relationship.\u201d 351 N.E.2d at 480. (quotation is from the court\u2019s syllabus) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The husband had argued that tolling was necessary because the malpractice was not discovered until after the termination of the physician-patient relationship. If tolling was not permitted, his action would be barred before his wife\u2019s was barred, even though his action arose out of the same negligence. The court held that it would not disturb its forty-year-old rule set forth in <em>Kraut v. Cleveland Ry. Co., </em>132 Ohio St. 125, 5 N.E.2d 324 (1936) because the legislature had failed to change the rule, although it had recently amended portions of the code covering statutes of limitations in medical malpractice cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">The <em>Amer </em>decision was rendered over the dissent of Justice Herbert, the author of the <em>Wyler </em>and <em>Melnyk </em>opinions. Justice Celebrezze also dissented and argued that the statute of limitations should not run until the physician-patient relationship terminated. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-13\">\u201cJustice in this case cries out for a remedy. How can anyone be precluded from asserting a claim by a statute of limitations which expires before the discovery of the injury? How can anyone charged with the responsibility of administering justice allow such an absurdity?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">351 N.E.2d at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">In spite of this plea, he was unable to persuade a majority of the court to reject the legislative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-16\">The <em>Amer </em>decision convinces me that the Ohio Supreme Court has not abandoned its decision not to \u201cinterfere in the affairs of [its] sister branch [of] government.\u201d <em>Melnyk, </em>290 N.E.2d at 918. Further it shows that whether or not the Oregon courts feel that legislative inaction \u201cis a weak reed upon which to lean,\u201d <em>Berry v. Braner, </em>245 Or. 307, 421 P.2d 996, 998 (1966), <em>quoted in </em>Majority Opinion Typescript, at 665, the Ohio Supreme Court has chosen to lean on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-17\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-18\">Finally, I am convinced that the majority reading of the <em>Melnyk </em>decision is incorrect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>because every state or federal court decision in Ohio on this question has rejected that reading, e. <em>g., Simmons v. Riverside Methodist Hospital, </em>44 Ohio App.2d 146, 336 N.E.2d 460 (1975); <em>Woodgeard v. Miami Valley Hospital Society of Dayton, </em>47 Ohio Misc. 43, 354 N.E.2d 720 (C.P.1975), <em>aff\u2019d mem. </em>No. C.A. 4772 (Ct.App. Sept. 12, 1975); <em>Shrewsbury v. Smith, </em>511 F.2d 1058 (6th Cir. 1975), including those courts that have considered claims for injuries allegedly resulting from birth control pills. <em>E. g., Gillan v. Searle Laboratories, </em>Civ. No. C-2-77-863 (S.D.Ohio, Oct. 13, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The instant case reflects the inherent disadvantage of a plaintiff making the tactical decision to litigate a diversity case in a federal court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> where the core of plaintiff\u2019s case is contingent upon a federal court anticipating a state law doctrine in the \u201cwomb of time, but whose birth is distant.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For we have been asked here to deliver prematurely a new Ohio statute of limitations doctrine despite the fact that that concept has been expressly rejected, and recently so, by every state and federal court in Ohio.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I do not claim that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s views on when the statute of limitations starts to run in cases such as these are part of the modern or enlightened trends. But if counsel wants to test whether Ohio will have more enlightened views on the statute of limitations issues, it is far better for counsel to litigate those issues in the state courts of Ohio which have the final say on when their recently expressed views will be repudiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">For the reasons expressed above I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\">. The <em>Wyler </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">The General Assembly has often considered and left standing our interpretation of R.C. 2305.11, as announced in <em>Gillette, Bowers </em>and <em>DeLong. </em>In the 106th General Assembly (1965-66),' House Bill No. 30 was introduced. In the 105th General Assembly (1963-64), House Bill No. 959 was introduced. Both bills would have amended R.C. 2305.11, by increasing the limitation period for mal- \u2019 practice to two years. Neither bill survived the scrutiny of the committee to which it was referred. A similar fate befell House Bill No. 907, which was introduced in the 103rd General Assembly (1959-60); and was designed to eliminate the statute of limitations for malpractice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">The most significant expression of legislative position occurred in the 101st General Assembly (1955-56), less than three years after this court\u2019s decision in the <em>DeLong </em>case. In that session, House Bill No. 177 was introduced to add the following language to R.C. 2305.11:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-10\">\u201cIf the action is for malpractice the cause thereof shall not accrue until the malpractice is discovered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-11\">House Bill No. 177 was rejected by the committee to which it was referred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-15\">It should also be noted that although the General Assembly has refused to adopt the discovery rule for medical malpractice cases, it has nevertheless created certain exceptions to the general operation of various other statutes of limitation. (Cf. <em>Mosby v. Michael Reese Hospital </em>[1964], 49 Ill.App.2d 336, 199 N.E.2d 633.) In R.C. 2305.15 and 2305.16, the General Assembly has provided that the statute of limitations is tolled if the person entitled to bring the action is under a legal disability, or if the person liable to an action departs or absconds from the state. Moreover, in R.C. 2305.09 the General Assembly specifically enacted a discovery rule \u201cif the action is for trespassing under ground or injury to mines, or for the wrongful taking of personal property.\u201d Finally, under R.C. 2305.04, if a person is entitled to recover the title or possession of real property, but is under legal disability, the statute of limitations is tolled. Significantly and intentionally absent is any statutory provision to the effect that the lack of knowledge on the part of an injured party in a medical malpractice action operates to delay the commencement of the running of the statute of limitations. See <em>Townsend v. Eichelberger </em>(1894), 51 Ohio St. 213, 38 N.E. 207.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-16\">267 N.E.2d at 423.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b751-10\">. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, Typescript at 666 n. 54, for a discussion of the importance of the court\u2019s syllabus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b752-6\">.
