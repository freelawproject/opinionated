Gordon filed this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Jack Watson, III, a Florida assistant state attorney, and George Cansler, the Director of the Volusia County Jail Department of Corrections. Gordon\u2019s complaint and amended complaint alleged that he was subjected to punitive confinement after complaining to a judge that Watson and Cansler had denied him telephone privileges. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants, ruling that \u201cthere is no issue of fact as to punitive confinement\u201d and that the denial of Gordon\u2019s access to the telephone did not violate his constitutional rights. Because we find that the proffered materials are insufficient to support the grant of summary judgment, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-21\">Gordon had been in custody at the Volusia County Jail since February 1978, when he failed to post bond on an arrest for possession of a controlled substance. On March 4 or 5, according to Gordon\u2019s allegations, Gordon was denied visitors and perhaps telephone privileges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 5, 1978, the Volusia County grand jury returned a four-count indictment against Gordon for first degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. On April 6, Gordon was brought before a judge to be formally arrested on the above charges. At that hearing, he complained to the judge that Cansler, under the direction of Watson, had denied him telephone privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-22\">When Gordon returned to the Volusia County Jail that day, Cansler, at Watson\u2019s request, moved Gordon to the Volusia County Annex facility and limited Gordon\u2019s access to the telephone, allowing him to call only his attorney. The next day (April 7), Cansler, again at Watson\u2019s direction, moved Gordon from the annex back to the main facility of the Volusia County Jail, where he once again had access to the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-23\">On April 13 Gordon filed this complaint. Pursuant to court order, he amended his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>complaint on May 12 to allege that he had been \u201csubjected to punitive confinement and isolation confinement and [had been] placed in the hole after telling Judge Griffin of the denial of phone call [sic] by officers under George Cansler by order of Jack Watson.\u201d He sought release from maximum security confinement, some contact visits, rules to protect other prisoners, and $300,000.00 in damages. By the time of the amended complaint (and perhaps as early as April 7) and until August 18, Gordon was incarcerated in a number of one-man cells. Over the next several months he was transferred several times back and forth between the Volusia County Jail and a state correctional facility, where he now remains. He was confined at various times in both one-man cells and so-called \u201cpopulation\u201d cells during his remaining confinement at the Volusia County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">After he had filed the amended complaint, Gordon moved for an order seeking his release from maximum security. The defendants filed a response to the motion, verified by Edward Froman, a Lieutenant in the Volusia County Jail and acting Chief Correctional Officer, which stated that Gordon was being held in one-man cells \u201cdue to the seriousness of the convictions and the pending charges.\u201d Before the court ruled on the motion, Watson and Cansler moved for summary judgment, attaching affidavits of Watson and Froman. Watson\u2019s affidavit stated that he had restricted Gordon\u2019s telephone privileges because he was afraid that Gordon would call certain persons in possession of, or with access to, instrumentalities of the first-degree murder charge, which they might then destroy or conceal. On April 6, the affidavit continued, Watson believed he would be able to get an immediate court order restricting Gordon\u2019s phone calls to his attorney. The next day, after researching the issue, Watson determined that such an order was unlikely and he ordered that Gordon be moved back into the county jail facilities, with telephone privileges restored. Froman\u2019s affidavit purported to incorporate his earlier verified response to Gordon\u2019s motion, in which he had stated that Gordon was incarcerated in one-man cells due to the seriousness of his crimes. It also recited the frequency of the telephone calls Gordon was allowed to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The court did not rule on the summary judgment motion but ordered the defendants to file an answer to Gordon\u2019s amended complaint. In their answers, defendants renewed their motions for summary judgment, attaching Cansler\u2019s affidavit stating that the entire jail is a maximum security institution, enumerating the cells in which Gordon was housed during his incarceration there, and averring that no cell in the institution is known as \u201cthe hole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Gordon filed no responsive affidavits. Instead, he filed an unsworn, unverified document styled \u201cAnswer to defendants Motion for Summary Judgment and Answer to Amended Civil Rights Complaint.\u201d He asserted that Watson never sought to obtain the order restricting Gordon\u2019s phone calls and as a skilled prosecutor knew that he had no grounds to obtain one. He also stated that Watson\u2019s conjecture that Gordon\u2019s friends would destroy or conceal evidence was totally without merit because Gordon\u2019s house had already been searched. The answer further contended that the defendants had not shown that Gordon was the only one in jail charged with so serious a crime or that he had broken any rule of the facility. In particular, he objected to being placed in one-man cells, in which he was confined from March until August 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">In granting the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, the district court relied on the affidavits of Watson and Cansler to conclude that there was no issue of fact as to punitive confinement. The court further found that the curtailment of Gordon\u2019s access to the telephone for two days was not a constitutional violation because \u201cplaintiff was then represented by counsel, the restriction was for a short period of time, and the plaintiff had ample access to the telephone prior to and subsequent to the brief period of restricted access.\u201d In view of the further fact that Gordon was never denied telephone access to his counsel we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>that any deprivation was slight indeed. However, the unresolved factual basis for the constitutional issue is not the extent of deprivation, but whether the slight was deliberately imposed as punishment for bringing his condition to the attention of the court. This is not addressed by the affidavits supporting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The punitive confinement issue has two parts: Gordon\u2019s transfer to the annex on April 6 and 7, and his confinement in one-man cells from April 7 to August 18. Watson\u2019s affidavit responded to Gordon\u2019s allegation that the transfer was for punitive reasons by demonstrating the legitimate administrative reasons for the transfer. Froman\u2019s affidavit, on the other hand, establishes that the defendants had legitimate, non-punitive reasons for confining Gordon in one-man cells rather than populated cells only to the extent that it incorporates his earlier verified response. Under the provisions of Rule 56, however, \u201c[s]worn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith.\u201d No such copy was attached to Froman\u2019s affidavit, so the materials that may permissibly have been considered on summary judgment did not resolve the issue of the motive for Gordon\u2019s confinement in one-man cells. In certain circumstances a verified pleading may itself be treated as an affidavit in support of a motion for summary judgment, but only if it satisfies the standards for affidavits set out in Rule 56(e). <em>Fowler v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>343 F.2d 150, 154 (5th Cir. 1965). Froman\u2019s verified response would not satisfy those requirements because it does not affirmatively show that he is competent to testify to the matters stated therein or that the facts are based on Froman\u2019s personal knowledge. It was therefore error for the district court to grant summary judgment for the plaintiffs on the punitive confinement issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">On the other side of this issue, we note that Gordon\u2019s \u201cAnswer to defendants Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d also fails to comply with Rule 56. It is an unsworn statement, which the court may not consider in determining the propriety of summary judgment. <em>Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 159, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1609, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); <em>Piper v. United States, </em>392 F.2d 462 (5th Cir. 1968); <em>Jones v. Menard, </em>559 F.2d 1282, 1285 n. 5 (5th Cir. 1977). <em>See </em>6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 156.11[l.-8], at 207 (2d ed. 1948); <em>id. </em>1 56.22[1], at 1304; 10 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 2738, at 702 (1973). Had it been sworn it would have raised a genuine issue as to the material fact of Watson\u2019s motive for moving Gordon to the annex facility and denying him telephone privileges and for incarcerating him in one-man cells. Although pro se litigants are not held to the same standards of compliance with formal or technical pleading rules applied to attorneys, we have never allowed such litigants to oppose summary judgments by the use of unsworn materials.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Summary judgment is an excellent device by which district courts may make expedited dispositions of those cases in which a trial would be fruitless. When summary judgment is inappropriate because the supporting or opposing materials are improper, the district court has ample discretion to call upon the parties to remedy the defects, by submitting supplemental affidavits or otherwise. <em>See Jones v. Menard, </em>559 F.2d 1282, 1286 (5th Cir. 1977) (Thorn-berry, J., concurring). <em>See generally </em>C. Wright, Law of Federal Courts \u00a7 99, at 492 (3d ed. 1976). In the circumstances presented here the district court should have required the parties to correct the deficiencies in their various pleadings and supporting papers if it intended to rely on them for its grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Because the entry of summary judgment was improper, we vacate that judgment and remand the action to the district court. Of course, we intimate no opinion on the mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>its of the issues yet to be reached. Furthermore, we intimate no opinion on whether summary judgment may be appropriate or a trial is needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-17\">. Gordon\u2019s original complaint alleged that he was denied visitors March 4, 1978. March 4 was a Saturday; regulations permitted visitors in the Volusia County Jail on Sundays only. In his \u201cAnswer to defendants Motion for Summary Judgment and answer to amended Civil Rights Complaint,\u201d however, Gordon suggested that the decision was taken on March 4 to deny him visitors on March 5, the regular visiting day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\">. Gordon\u2019s pleading was notarized. The notarization clearly refers not to the \u201cAnswer\u201d itself but to the proof of service.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
