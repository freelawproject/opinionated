We write only to clarify one part of our prior opinion. <em>See Adams v. United States, </em>615 F.2d 284 (5th Cir. 1980). In all other respects, the petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-20\">The present appeal does not present a case in which the notice of claim presented by the claimant in an executed standard form 95 was inadequate in content or detail. <em>See id. </em>at 289-90. We deal instead with another problem. We hold that the agency lacks the power to require that the claimant supplement a notice of claim, that contained \u201cenough details [about the underlying incident from which the complaint arose] to enable the agency to begin its own investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292. We reject the first circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Swift v. United States, </em>614 F.2d 812 (1st Cir. 1980), to the extent that it conflicts with such holding. We have not, however, intimated an opinion as to the effect, if any, a claimant\u2019s refusal to comply with an agency\u2019s reasonable request for supplemental information to clarify an inadequate claim would have on the issue of jurisdiction in a subsequent action for damages brought pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
