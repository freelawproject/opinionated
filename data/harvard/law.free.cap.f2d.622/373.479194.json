(Unique), and Duane F. Lilja (Lilja), and defendant Zotos International, Inc. (Zotos). Zotos appeals a judgment entered on November 29, 1979, for $398,760.00 in favor of plaintiffs. Zotos also appeals an order dated February 7, 1980, wherein the judgment was modified by changing its date of entry to November 30, 1978, <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Unique and Lilja appeal the denial of recovery of lost profits for the third and fourth year of the contract and the denial of prejudgment interest. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-16\">This case was originally brought in the District Court of Hennepin County, Minnesota, and was removed by Zotos to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The case was tried before the Honorable Robert G. Renner, United States Magistrate (now United States District Judge), pursuant to a stipulation and order of reference providing for Magistrate Renner to serve as master, with direct appeal, if any, to this Court. On November 30,1978, Magistrate Renner issued his Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, a Recommended Order for Judgment, and a Memorandum Opinion. United States District Judge Miles W. Lord adopted this Order on the same day, and judgment was entered accordingly. After cross-motions for amendments had been made, on March 5, 1979, the Magistrate issued an Order for Amended Findings and Conclusions, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Amended Recommended Order and another Memorandum Opinion. This Recommended Order was adopted by Judge Lord on March 9, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Zotos filed a notice of appeal on April 2, 1979. Unique and Lilja filed a notice of cross-appeal on April 11, 1979. On May 15, 1979, while the appeal and cross-appeal were pending, this Court decided <em>Duryea v. Third Northwestern National Bank, </em>602 F.2d 809 (8th Cir. 1979). In <em>Duryea </em>the Court determined that an order of reference to a magistrate could not properly provide for direct appeal to this Court, and that a district court\u2019s judgment entered on the magistrate\u2019s recommended findings was deficient if it failed to indicate that the court had considered and adopted the magistrate\u2019s conclusions of law. After counsel for plaintiffs and defendant advised the Court that the Order of Reference used in this case was substantially identical to that found to be defective in <em>Duryea, </em>this Court entered an Order remanding for reconsideration in light of <em>Duryea. </em>After a hearing and submission of briefs, Judge Lord issued an Order wherein he confirmed, without change, the Magistrate\u2019s Conclusions. On November 29, 1979, a new judgment was entered against Zotos in the same amount as the first judgment. Notices of Appeal and Cross-Appeal were again filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">On December 3, 1979, counsel for plaintiffs wrote a letter to Judge Lord requesting that he amend the second judgment <em>nunc pro tunc </em>so as to make it effective November 30, 1978, the date of Magistrate Renner\u2019s first Recommended Order. Zotos opposed the request by letter of December 6, 1979. By Order of January 18, 1980, this Court remanded the appeal from the second judgment for the limited purpose of permitting Judge Lord to rule on the letter request and thereby determine \u201cwhat interest on the judgment petitioner is entitled to\u201d (Designated Record [D.R.] 1038). On February 7, 1980, Judge Lord issued an order changing the date of entry of the second judgment from November 29, 1979, to November 30, 1978, <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Zotos now appeals that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\n<em>I. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The contract which is the subject of this case was signed January 30, 1974, and amended by letter on February 21, 1974. Lilja is the holder of a patent on a multistation hair-spray system intended for use in beauty salons. Zotos is a major manufacturer and distributor of \u201csoft goods\u201d (shampoos, permanents, and setting lotions) to the professional beauty field. Neither party had experience in the manufacture of hair-spray systems or any other type of beauty-salon equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Under the contract Lilja and Unique Systems, Inc., were to develop, manufacture, and place in inventory hair-spray systems. Zotos was to purchase the systems for resale through its nationwide system of wholesale distributors. The original contract of January 30,1974, set up a timetable for Lilja to stock the systems and Zotos to pay for them. The contract obligated Zotos to buy 15,000 systems over a period of two years with the option to buy at least 7,500 systems in each of years three and four. In the contract as amended the parties agreed that actual stocking and distribution of the systems would commence with \u201cmonth one,\u201d defined as a \u201cmutually agreed date in the year 1974.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">These changes in the agreement were made at Zotos\u2019s instigation. Zotos feared that the current oil shortage would make it impossible to obtain a sufficient supply of alcohol needed for the manufacturer of the liquid spray Zotos was required to develop and supply for the systems. Lilja agreed to the changes in schedule. At the time, February of 1974, both parties were confident that \u201cmonth one\u201d could be set before the end of the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">At the time the contract was signed, Lilja\u2019s hair-spray system was still in the design and development stage. During 1974 Lilja made several design changes which were approved by Zotos. During that year several unanticipated delays occurred, some of which were the fault of Lilja, some the fault of Zotos, and some the fault of third parties. By January of 1975 month one still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>had not been set, and neither party to the agreement had completed the steps necessary to market the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In a series of letters and telephone conversations during early 1975, Lilja repeatedly told Zotos that he was ready to set a schedule for marketing the systems and was ready for Zotos to \u201cplace an order.\u201d He also suggested some changes in the number of systems in the initial order and in the place of initial distribution. Other companies had introduced similar hair-spray systems into the market by this time, and Zotos began to fear a softening of the market. Zotos also began expressing fears about the mechanical viability of the system. In conversations with Lilja, Zotos\u2019s representatives insisted that the company would not place an order for any systems until they had seen a demonstration of finished sample components.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Lilja\u2019s reaction to Zotos\u2019s waivering commitment was to continue to insist that Zotos \u201cplace an order\u201d for the initial purchase of systems. The parties agreed to meet in July of 1975 at Zotos\u2019s main offices in Darien, Connecticut, to discuss all problems. At that meeting, Lilja demonstrated the system, which was by this time complete except for a prototype bottle holder made partially of wood. The demonstration was successful except for a minor problem with a dripping needle. Zotos\u2019s representatives agreed orally that the system as demonstrated met the warranty requirements of the contract, but they refused to put their agreement in writing unless Lilja would agree to a market test of completed systems. Written proposals and counter-proposals were made, but no agreement was reached. Lilja met with Zotos\u2019s personnel again in Chicago on August 3. Zotos again insisted on a test market. In light of Zotos\u2019s refusal to proceed without the market test period, Lilja considered the contract repudiated. He so notified Zotos and filed suit soon after.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\n<em>II. The Issue of Repudiation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Appellant\u2019s major contention on appeal is that the trial court erred in finding that Zotos repudiated the contract. We disagree. After a careful review of the record, including the transcript of the 23-day trial, we have concluded that the District Court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous. We also conclude that it applied the correct legal standard to the facts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">In its Conclusions of Law the Court held: The defendant\u2019s actions in refusing to honor its contractual obligations constitute a breach of the contract and a repudiation of the contract between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">There is ample evidence that as early as September of 1974 Zotos had decided not to comply with the contract as written. In the ensuing months Zotos\u2019s actions bore out this intention. Ralph Evans, President of Zotos, refused to authorize the purchase of capping equipment necessary for filling the bottles of liquid fixative. Zotos\u2019s representatives communicated to Lilja Zotos\u2019s insistence upon a demonstration of the finished sample components, although this was not required by the contract. Whether these acts in early 1975 amount to a repudiation of the contract, we need not decide, because on July 25 and 26, 1975, and again on August 3, after a successful demonstration of the system, Zotos unequivocally refused to perform. At these meetings, Ralph Evans, President of Zotos, made it clear that Zotos would not set \u201cmonth one\u201d or agree to purchase any systems until an extensive market test could be conducted in the field. Zotos\u2019s obligation to continue with the contract would be conditioned upon its approval of the market-test results, a requirement found nowhere in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">The rights of the aggrieved party after a repudiation are controlled by Minn. Stat. \u00a7 336.2-610.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Zotos argues that its actions do not amount to a repudiation of the contract. Anticipatory repudiation occurs only when one party expressly re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>nounces a contract and announces an intention not to perform. <em>Jurek v. Thompson, </em>308 Minn. 191, 241 N.W.2d 788 (1976). There must, at a minimum, be an \u201covert communication of intention or an action which renders performance impossible or demonstrates a clear determination not to continue with performance.\u201d Official Comment to U.C.C. \u00a7 2-610(1), codified as Minn. Stat. \u00a7 336.2-610(1). A secret intention not to perform or a negative attitude does not rise to the level of repudiation. <em>Teeman v. Jurek, </em>312 Minn. 292, 251 N.W.2d 698 (1977). If a party to a contract demands of the other party a performance to which he has no right under the contract and states definitely that, unless his demand is complied with, he will not render his promised performance, an anticipatory repudiation has been committed. 4 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 973 (1951). When Zotos told Lilja in August of 1975 that it would not proceed until market tests were performed with results subject to Zotos\u2019s approval, Zotos repudiated the contract and was in total breach. No market tests were required by the contract, a fact that Zotos admits that it knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Zotos argues that even if these acts amount to a repudiation, Lilja had already breached the contract in the spring of 1975 by trying to vary the terms of the contract. A suggestion for modification of a contract does not amount to a repudiation unless the party makes it clear that he will not perform without the modification. No one has even suggested that Lilja threatened not to perform. On the contrary, up until Zotos\u2019s actions in August, the record is full of Lilja\u2019s attempts to set \u201cmonth one\u201d and get on with the contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Lilja was justified in refusing to go into full production until the setting of \u201cmonth one.\u201d With the setting of \u201cmonth one,\u201d the interdependent obligations of the contract would arise. Lilja would have to have the systems in inventory by the first day of that month, and Zotos would be obligated to pay for the systems fifteen days later, subject to warranty requirements. Zotos was aware from the beginning of negotiations with Lilja in 1973 that he did not have the financial resources to develop the system alone and then find a buyer. As the contract was finally drafted, it gave Lilja assurance that he would have a buyer for the systems soon after their completion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In return Zotos received an exclusive distributorship for a product that it felt had great potential. We agree with the District Court that Lilja was never in breach of the contract. He made a good-faith effort to put it into effect up until the time of Zotos\u2019s repudiation in August of 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">\n<em>III. The Damage Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">Zotos atttacks the District Court\u2019s award of damages as \u201cpurely speculative and conjectural.\u201d Specifically, Zotos claims that plaintiffs should not recover $278,040.00 in lost profits on the 15,000 hair-spray systems Zotos would have been required to purchase during the first two years of the contract, that the award of anticipated lost profits from the sale of three years\u2019 worth of replacement guns and bottle caps for the 15,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>000 systems is based on unsubstantiated speculation, and that the amount of damages, if upheld, should be reduced by Unique\u2019s saved overhead expenses. Plaintiffs cross-appeal for an award of lost profits for the third and fourth years of the contract. These damage issues will be discussed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Zotos\u2019s central contention in its argument against an award of anticipated lost profits on the first two years of the contract is that Lilja\u2019s estimates of his expected profit margin on the systems are too speculative to support the award. The contract sets out in Paragraph three the price at which Lilja was to sell the system\u2019s component parts to Zotos. Contrary to the District Court\u2019s finding, Unique\u2019s profit margin was not expressly stated in the contract. Paragraph four, however, gave Unique the right to increase prices to Zotos upon proof of increased costs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It can be said, therefore, that the parties contemplated a fixed margin of profit for Unique based on the difference between the prices to be charged Zotos, as listed in the contract, and Unique\u2019s estimated cost of production as of January 30, 1974, with adjustments for increased costs during the life of the contract. Lilja testified that the prices to be charged Zotos were based upon cost bids from suppliers and, for some of the smaller items, his own estimates.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">A seller\u2019s damages upon repudiation by a buyer are specified by Minn.Stat. \u00a7 336.2-708. Subsection (1) provides that the measure of damages is the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the unpaid contract price, together with any incidental damages. In cases such as this one, where the measure provided by subsection (1) is inadequate to put the seller in as good a position as performance would have done (there was no \u201cmarket price\u201d here, since Lilja never got far enough to produce the system in marketable quantities), subsection (2) provides for recovery of profit (including reasonable overhead) which the seller would have made from full performance by the buyer. The Official Code Comment to subsection (2) states in part, \u201cIt is not necessary to a recovery of \u2018profit\u2019 to show a history of earnings, especially if a new venture is involved.\u201d Minn.Stat. \u00a7 336.1-106 provides, \u201c(1) The remedies provided by this chapter shall be liberally administered to the end that the aggrieved party may be put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">In order to recover for lost profits under \u00a7 336.2-708(2) the plaintiffs must prove the amount of damages with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the wrongful acts of the defendant caused the loss of profit, and that the profits were reasonably within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">The burden of proof of lost profits is particularly heavy in the case of a new business. The general rule in Minnesota is that \u201cproof of loss of profits in a new business is too speculative to be the basis for recovery.\u201d <em>Village of Elbow Lake v. Otter Tail Power Co., </em>281 Minn. 43, 46, 160 N.W.2d 571, 574 (1968). It is clear, however, that, given a reasonable basis upon which to figure the amount, a new business can recover lost profits under Minnesota law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-11\">We have adopted no <em>per se </em>rule that only an \u201cestablished business\u201d can recover damages for loss of prospective profits. The controlling principle governing actions for damages is that \u201cdamages which are speculative, remote, or conjectural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>are not recoverable.\u201d . . . The law does not require mathematical precision in the proof of loss but only proof to a \u201creasonable, although not necessarily absolute, certainty\u201d . . . Once the fact of loss has been shown, the difficulty in proving its amount will not preclude recovery so long as there is proof of a reasonable basis upon which to approximate the amount. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-7\"><em>Leoni v. </em>Beims <em>Co., </em>255 N.W.2d 824, 826 (Minn.1977) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">There is more certainty here than in many \u201cnew business\u201d cases. Zotos was obligated to purchase 15,000 systems over a two-year period no matter what developed in the resale market. There was testimony that a market did indeed exist for the systems up through 1977. The court below found that Lilja\u2019s system was a substantial improvement over the existing state of the art. Of particular interest is the fact that Zotos\u2019s own expert witness testified that he had attempted to buy the rights to Unique\u2019s system as late as 1977. There was no error in the District Court\u2019s finding that plaintiffs had proved damages to the required degree of certainty on the 15,000 systems covered by the first two years of the contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Zotos next argues that the award of damages for lost profits on replacement parts is not supported by substantial evidence. We do not agree. Although there was conflicting evidence as to the life-span of the hairspray systems, the number of bottles of spray to be used monthly by each system, the life of the applicator gun, and the likelihood that some systems would fall into disuse, the District Court chose a reasonable and conservative path through the maze of evidence in setting a three-year life for the system and the rate of replacement for parts. Unique had requested much more extensive damages for profits on replacement parts, and it is possible that it could have sold many more parts than it will be compensated for by this award. The award for lost profits on replacement parts is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">Zotos also argues that the damage award should be reduced to reflect certain direct and indirect expenses that it claims were not incurred by Unique as a result of Zotos\u2019s repudiation of the contract. Zotos\u2019s contention that Unique ceased to exist as a business enterprise is based on the fact that the hair-spray system had not been successfully marketed at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">Minn.Stats. \u00a7 336.2-708(2) provides for the recovery of gross profits, including reasonable overhead. Under that rule no deduction from damages for overhead expenses is required. Zotos argues, however, that a plaintiff who discontinues his business after a breach of contract is not entitled to recover overhead expenses which would have been incurred had the business continued. Annot., 3 A.L.R.3d 697 (1965); <em>French v. Pullman Motor Car Co., </em>242 Pa. 136, 88 A. 876 (1913). This may be the rule, but there is no proof in the record that Unique Systems, Inc., has ceased to exist. Apparently Zotos did not attempt to establish this fact at trial. Lilja testified at length as to his continuing efforts to market the system and keep Unique afloat. We see no basis upon which to reduce the damage award for saved overhead expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">\n<em>IV. Prejudgment Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A6o\">Plaintiffs challenge the District Court\u2019s denial of prejudgment interest. The Minnesota rule is that a plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest on a liquidated claim, or on an unliquidated claim if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the claim is ascertainable by computation or reference to generally recognized standards such as market value, and if the claim does not depend on a contingency. <em>N-Ren Corp. v. American Home Assur. Co., </em>8th Cir., 619 F.2d 784, 789 (1980); <em>Clements Auto Co. v. Service Bureau Corp., </em>444 F.2d 169 (8th Cir. 1971). The Minnesota Supreme Court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">[The test is] whether defendant could have determined the amount of his potential liability from a generally recognized objective standard of measurement, such as readily ascertainable market value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ami\"><em>Potter v. Hartzell Propeller, Inc., </em>291 Minn. 513, 519, 189 N.W.2d 499, 504 (1971). The District Court refused to award prejudgment interest on the basis that the amount of damages could not be ascertained before trial, because the Court had to weigh the evidence presented on the costs of the various components of the spray system. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">It is true that the figures necessary to compute damages on the minimum purchase requirement of 15,000 systems were in existence in January of 1974 when the contract was executed. Lilja testified at trial that the prices set out in the contract were based on bids he had previously received and, in some instances, his own estimates. He argues that his profit margin is, therefore, \u201cascertainable by computation to generally recognized standards.\u201d Plaintiffs ask for prejudgment interest on this part of the damage award, if not the whole award. They ask, alternatively, for interest on the entire award as a matter of \u201cjust compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">We cannot agree with plaintiffs\u2019 positions. The fact that the figures were in existence prior to judgment is not enough to support an award of prejudgment interest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Prejudgment interest is charged against a defendant only when he could have computed his potential liability with some degree of certainty and when the potential damage award does not depend on a contingency such as a court or jury finding on disputed facts or inferences. In the present case, it was necessary for the District Court first to decide whether damages could be awarded for lost profits on a product which had never been manufactured and did not even exist in finished form. Next the Court had to decide whether the cost bids and estimates upon which Lilja relied in computing his profits were sufficiently reliable to support an award of damages. In the case of the lost profits on replacement parts, the Court had to choose an estimated life span for the systems from strongly conflicting testimony. Each of these steps was a contingency of the type which under Minnesota law prevents the award of prejudgment interest. See <em>Potter v. Hartzell Propeller, Inc., </em>291 Minn. 513, 189 N.W.2d 499 (1971) (setting of market value of destroyed airplane a matter of jury discretion); <em>Layne-Minnesota p.r., Inc. v. Singer Co., </em>574 F.2d 429, 435 (8th Cir. 1978) (contingency existed when defendants argued th\u00e1t third parties were responsible for delay in construction contract). The District Court correctly denied prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">\n<em>V. Date of Entry of Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AHl\">In a separate appeal, No. 80-1122, Zotos challenges Judge Lord\u2019s February 7, 1980, amendment of the judgment changing the date of entry from November 29, 1979, to November 30, 1978, <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>Judge Lord\u2019s order was in response to this Court\u2019s remand order of January 18, 1980, for the limited purpose of determining \u201cwhat interest on the judgment petitioner is entitled to.\u201d The order apparently expresses the District Court\u2019s opinion that interest should be allowed from November 30, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Zotos relies on various statutes and rules regarding the award of post-judgment interest in civil cases in federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961; Fed.R.App.P. 37. We do not see this question as simply one of post-judgment interest. It is more nearly a question of whether under Minnesota law plaintiffs are entitled to interest between the time of the Magistrate\u2019s first Recommended Order and the clerk\u2019s entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Minn.Stats. \u00a7 549.09 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">When a judgment is for recovery of money, including a judgment for the recovery of taxes, interest from the time of the verdict or report until judgment is finally entered shall be computed by the clerk and added thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The Minnesota Supreme Court recently decided an analogous case. The Court held that under \u00a7 549.09 interest is to be computed upon an award of damages by a court-appointed referee from the date of the referee\u2019s report, rather than from the later date when the report is adopted by the court. <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. v. ThompsonYaeger, Inc., </em>258 N.W.2d 762 (1977). The referee had been appointed pursuant to Minn.R.Civ.P. 53, a provision cognate with Fed.R.Civ.P. 53, under which Magistrate Renner was appointed as master in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Whether this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Duryea v. Third Northwestern National Bank, </em>602 F.2d 809 (8th Cir. 1979), rendered the November 30, 1978, judgment defective is not dispositive. Were the plaintiffs relying on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, the situation would be different. That statute provides for post-judgment interest in civil cases in district courts. \u201cSuch interest shall be calculated from the date of the <em>entry of the judgment, </em>at the rate allowed by State Law\u201d (emphasis supplied). The statute has to do with interest on a judgment only, and not with interest on a debt before it is reduced to judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">Section 966, [now 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961] while providing only for interest upon judgments, does not exclude the idea of a power in the several states to allow interest upon verdicts, and where such allowance is expressly made by a state statute, we consider it a right given to a successful plaintiff, of which he ought not to be deprived by a removal of his case to the federal court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-11\"><em>Massachusetts Benefit Association </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>137 U.S. 689, 691, 11 S.Ct. 234, 235, 34 L.Ed. 834 (1891). In this diversity case where the right of action arises under state law, interest should be accrued from November 30, 1978, the date of Magistrate Renner\u2019s Recommended Order for Judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">The judgments are affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-6\">. No one has questioned the application of Minnesota law in this case or suggested that the result would be different if some other law were applied. <em>See </em>Minn.Stat. \u00a7 336.1 \u2014 105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-6\">. Zotos characterizes Lilja\u2019s repeated requests that Zotos \u201cplace an order\u201d as a repudiation. The District Court found, and we agree, that the requests were attempts by Lilja to set \u201cmonth one\u201d and receive assurance that Zotos was still committed to the contract. He had good reason to suspect that Zotos might want out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\">. In a telephone conversation on April 21, 1975, Bob Leyden, Marketing Vice-President for Zotos, described the situation as, \u201cYou won\u2019t proceed until you receive orders. From the company\u2019s point of view they don\u2019t want to give orders until they see the finished product.\u201d (D.R. 136). Under the contract Zotos had no right to require a fully finished production model months in advance of the earliest possible date for payment for the systems. In March and April of 1975, while Zotos was demanding a production model, Ralph Evans, Zotos\u2019s President, refused to order the capping equipment necessary for filling the bottles in the finished systems. The lead time, or time between the placing of the order and delivery, was at least fourteen weeks. Zotos was placing Lilja in a financially untenable position by demanding that he proceed as if \u201cmonth one\u201d had been set, while refusing either to set that date or complete preparations for marketing the system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b458-6\">. Paragraph four for the contract provides: \u201cUNIQUE may increase the above prices of any of the above products, upon not less than 60 days prior written notice to ZOTOS. Such price increase shall reflect increased costs of materials, labor, shipping charges and/or storage incurred, or such other costs incurred as substantiated by UNIQUE to ZOTOS.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b458-12\">. Of the forty-odd components or operations required to produce the system, fourteen were estimated, and the rest were based on cost bids. The estimated component costs represented only 3.3% of the total cost of the system. Two of Lilja\u2019s suppliers testified as to the reliability of their respective bids and as to the standard practice of relying on such bids as a method of determining cost.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b459-10\">. Plaintiffs cross-appeal from the District Court\u2019s denial of damages for lost profits on the third and fourth years of the contract. Plaintiffs basic argument is that by counterclaiming for damages and injunctive relief, defendant has asserted its claim of exclusivity, thereby exercising its option, for the third and fourth years of the contract. We cannot agree. The contract gave Zotos the option of keeping its exclusive-distribution right by meeting certain purchase levels in the third and fourth years. There is no way to determine whether Zotos would have exercised the option. Since \u201cmonth one\u201d was never set, years three and four never came into being. It cannot be said, therefore, that Zotos has, by asserting a counterclaim, chosen to extend the contract into the third and fourth year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b460-7\">. Zotos had no knowledge of plaintiffs\u2019 cost estimates when the contract was executed. Contrary to the District Court\u2019s finding, the profit margin was not stated. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint requested damages of \u201can amount yet undeterminable, but in excess of . . . $500,000.00.\u201d Zotos received the cost estimates in January of 1977 in answers to interrogatories, and the profit per system could have been determined at that time. Zotos had no way of knowing, however, how many years of the four years of the contract it would be held liable for.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b461-9\">. Plaintiffs correctly point out that had Judge Lord followed Minn.Stats. \u00a7 549.09 literally they would have been entitled to interest from November 30, 1978, to be added to the amount of the judgment rendered November 29, 1979. From that date they would be accruing interest upon that interest. They have not asked for such a correction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
