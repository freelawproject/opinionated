The object of the surcharge was to recover fuel costs which had been incurred by MPSC but not collected from its customers when MPSC in 1975 switched from one fuel adjustment clause to another. Under the earlier clause, a customer\u2019s monthly bill had been calculated on fuel prices averaged over the twelve month period ending the second month preceding the billing month. The result, in a period of rising fuel prices, was that customers\u2019 bills were based on unrealistically low price data and hence MPSC was not recovering its full fuel costs. To remedy the situation, MPSC adopted a new fuel adjustment formula whereby customers\u2019 bills were based on the price of fuel just one month prior to the billing month. However, unbilled fuel costs which had built up under the old formula remained uncollected, and the surcharge was instituted to recover these costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">The Commission originally ordered MPSC to refund the surcharge. This court vacated the Commission\u2019s order disallowing the surcharge and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Maine Public Service Co. v. Federal Power Commission, </em>579 F.2d 659 (1st Cir. 1978) (hereinafter <em>Maine I). </em>The Commission\u2019s decision had rested in part on the theory that the so-called filed rate doctrine of <em>Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Service Co., </em>341 U.S. 246, 71 S.Ct. 692, 95 L.Ed. 912 (1951), had so completely tied the Commission\u2019s hands as to preclude its allowing the surcharge. We disagreed with the Commission\u2019s absolutist legal analysis, 579 F.2d at 665-67, and, because we were unable to tell to what extent that analysis infected its order, we remanded for further consideration, <em>id., </em>669-70, and directed the Commission to undertake a policy analysis to determine whether the surcharge was \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d <em>id., </em>668.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The Commission, without affording MPSC an additional hearing or opportunity to submit further data, arguments, or briefs, considered the surcharge along the lines called for in <em>Maine I </em>and again concluded the surcharge should be disallowed. MPSC petitioned the Commission for rehearing advancing much the same argument it now asserts before this court and also contending that MPSC should be given a hearing before the Commission in order to develop the record in light of the newly emerged standards governing fuel adjustment surcharges. The Commission, rejecting MPSC\u2019s arguments and concluding that MPSC had failed to raise any material facts which could affect the Commission\u2019s decision and therefore would merit an airing in a hearing, denied the application for a rehearing. MPSC then filed the instant petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Subsequent to <em>Maine I, </em>this court confronted another fuel adjustment surcharge in <em>Boston Edison Co. v. FERC, </em>611 F.2d 8 (1st Cir. 1979). There, the Commission, after undertaking the policy appraisal called for in <em>Maine I </em>and presenting a more cogent legal analysis, disallowed Boston Edison\u2019s surcharge, and this court upheld the Commission\u2019s decision. The Commission\u2019s reasoning for striking down MPSC\u2019s surcharge is largely a reiteration of the position this court sustained in <em>Boston Edison.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">MPSC first argues that the Commission failed to comply with this court\u2019s directive in <em>Maine I. </em>We cannot agree. In <em>Maine I, </em>we stated that the validity of the surcharge presented a \u201cclose issue of rate-making policy which Congress expected the Commission, not the courts, to resolve: the ultimate source of an answer must lie in the Commission\u2019s own expert appraisal of whether such a surcharge is \u2018just and reasonable.\u2019 \u201d 579 F.2d at 668. On remand, the Commission did undertake a sufficient policy analysis although, in a footnote, it also stated that it believed its prior reasoning was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">In <em>Maine I, </em>this court criticized the Commission for failing to discuss \u201cthe effect of the surcharge on the reasonable expectations of wholesale and retail consumers, on the one hand, and the legitimate needs of the utility if it is to continue to serve the community efficiently, on the other.\u201d 579 F.2d at 669. MPSC contends the Commission\u2019s attention to these factors on remand was, at best, superficial and perfunctory. The Commission, based primarily on the language of MPSC\u2019s old fuel adjustment clause, determined the clause was a fixed rate tariff and not a cost of service tariff. While the latter type of clause provides for an exact recovery of fuel costs on a deferred basis, the former does not. Rather, under a fixed rate tariff, a prior period\u2019s fuel cost are used as the most recent test period to calculate a customer\u2019s current month\u2019s fuel adjustment bill. The formula may result in under or over collection by the utility, but once the customer has paid the bill, nothing more is owed. <em>Boston Edison Co. v. FERC, </em>611 F.2d at 9; <em>Public Service Company of New Hampshire v. FERC, </em>600 F.2d 944, 948 (D.C.Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 990, 100 S.Ct. 520, 62 L.Ed.2d 419. The Commission determined that MPSC\u2019s wholesale customers, operating under the fixed rate tariff, \u201chad a reasonable expectation that upon payment of their monthly bills, they had completely satisfied their obligation to Maine for the services received.\u201d MPSC argues that because its customers did not intervene, and no evidence concerning their expectations was received, the Commission\u2019s determination is not supported and is not in accordance with the evaluation called for in <em>Maine I. </em>We are not persuaded, however, that it was inappropriate for the Commission to gauge the customers\u2019 expectation on an objective basis from the language of the fuel adjustment clause, rather than to allow subjective testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Nor did the Commission ignore the financial impact on MPSC of disallowance of the surcharge. The Commission noted that the unrecovered fuel expenses under the old fuel adjustment clause equaled approximately 20 percent of MPSC\u2019s 1975 annual wholesale revenues but less that 3 percent of its total annual revenues. Contrary to Maine\u2019s contention, we cannot say the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>mission exceeded its authority by considering MPSC\u2019s larger financial picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">MPSC also argues the Commission failed to discuss the surcharge in terms of regulatory policy or the public interest. The Commission has taken the position that as between customer and utility, the risk of under-recovery should be borne by the utility \u2014 the one who has the obligation to design and file a clause that will produce a satisfactory recovery. That reasons may also exist for striking the balance elsewhere, or that state commissions may have allowed surcharges under similar circumstances, does not warrant this court\u2019s interference with the policy determination of the Commission \u2014 the agency to whom rate-making policy is primarily entrusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Our conclusion that the Commission\u2019s most recent action adequately complies with our order of remand does not mean that we are altogether happy about the agency\u2019s failure to have initiated some kind of a procedure \u2014 not necessarily a hearing but at least an invitation to submit briefs\u2014 which would have afforded MPSC an opportunity to present its position in light of this court\u2019s decision before the Commission made a decision. The Commission\u2019s eagerness to reinstate its former result unencumbered by further argument was not an ingratiating spectacle. MPSC, however, was able, in its petition for rehearing, to bring to the agency\u2019s attention both the theory and the facts it wished to establish were it granted a hearing. In all the circumstances, we see no useful purpose to be served by a remand. The Commission\u2019s refusal to hold a rehearing indicated that it rejected MPSC\u2019s approach and continued to adhere to the analysis it had announced subsequent to remand. That analysis was rooted in the Commission\u2019s determination that MPSC\u2019s superseded fuel adjustment clause was a cost of service tariff, and this determination, in turn, rested primarily on the language and operation of the clause. Nothing MPSC sought to establish would be material to the Commission\u2019s analysis which, as stated, fell within the spectrum of choices available to the agency under its broad authority in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\n<em>The petition for review is denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
