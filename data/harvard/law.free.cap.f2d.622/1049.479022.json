CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1130-8\">George Cermark appeals the denial by the district court of his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his 12-year sentence for armed bank robbery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-9\">Cermark, in 1968, was sentenced in state court to a 10-20 year sentence for robbery. In mid-1973, having escaped after failing to return from furlough, Cermark was arrested and later charged with having robbed, with an accomplice, the New England Merchants National Bank of nearly $24,000. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113. Following his arrest he was returned to state prison, and, upon the advice of a friend, contacted and retained as his attorney a Mr. Henry Quarles, Jr. On April 16, 1974, Cermark appeared with Mr. Quarles before the district court and expressed his desire to change his previously entered plea of not guilty to one of guilty. Before accepting this change of plea, the district court thoroughly questioned Cermark, Attorney Quarles and the Assistant United States Attorney in order to assure itself that Cermark\u2019s guilty plea was being entered voluntarily. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Crim.P. 11. At the later disposition proceeding, on April 26, 1974, the government recommended a 12-year sentence to run concurrently with Cermark\u2019s existing state sentence; Cermark\u2019s attorney urged an 8-year sentence, \u201choping that that recommendation would not be a strain on [the court\u2019s] judicial temperament.\u201d The court, indicating that it was \u201cnot disposed to impose a sentence which would add nothing to what [Cermark] is already doing,\u201d accepted the government\u2019s recommendation and imposed a 12-year concurrent sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-12\">Cermark, who at his change-of-plea hearing had expressed the belief that he would not be paroled from his state sentence until \u201cat least 1982,\u201d was returned to state authorities to serve out that sentence. Cermark\u2019s parole prediction proved pessimistic, however, and he was granted parole by state officials in August of 1975. After serving an additional 3-month state sentence for his conviction for a previous escape, Cermark was taken into federal custody. Over the next year, through various letters and motions, Cermark urged on a variety of grounds that his federal sentence should be modified or reduced. Finally, in February of 1977 Cermark filed the present section 2255 motion, <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra, </em>in which for the first time he raised the arguments that he continues to press upon us today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-13\">Cermark\u2019s section 2255 motion is premised mainly on the contention that his guilty plea was involuntarily entered. Such involuntariness resulted, Cermark suggests, because of his reliance in reaching a decision to plead guilty upon his attorney\u2019s erroneous advice concerning the effect of state parole on a concurrently imposed federal sentence. Cermark claims that his trial counsel informed him that the government would, in exchange for the guilty plea, recommend a concurrent sentence; counsel allegedly further instructed Cermark that if he were paroled from the underlying state sentence prior to the expiration of the federal sentence, federal parole would also be granted at that time, so long as Cermark had maintained a good institutional record. Cermark, as noted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>was in fact paroled from his state sentence in August 1975, only slightly more than one year after he began serving his concurrent federal sentence; he remains, however, in federal custody. Cermark argues that having thus been misled prior to entering a guilty plea as to the full consequences of such a plea his sentence must be vacated. Cermark further urges that such a result is required on the ground that the offer of erroneous legal advice by his trial attorney amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-4\">Cermark attempted to give form to these somewhat conclusory allegations at an evidentiary hearing on his section 2255 motion held before a magistrate on July 6, 1978. Cermark and his wife testified at this hearing in support of his allegations, with his trial attorney, Mr. Quarles, denying that he had given the supposed erroneous advice. In addition, copies of various letters, motions and other documentary evidence were introduced at this proceeding. Near the close of the hearing the government moved to dismiss, arguing that on all the evidence it was clear that Cermark\u2019s motion was factually baseless and that, at any rate, even assuming the truthfulness of Cermark\u2019s assertions, no legal relief was available. The magistrate took the matter under advisement, but before indicating his factual findings or legal conclusions, he relinquished his position as magistrate in order to accept an appointment as a state court judge. The case was therefore returned to the district court for decision. The court did not think it necessary to achieve a resolution of the factual issues. Instead, it \u201caccepted the defendant\u2019s testimony as true,\u201d but nonetheless denied relief, finding no legal foundation therefor. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">We affirm. In doing so, we need not go so far as did the district court in accepting defendant\u2019s testimony as true. It is enough that based upon a thorough review of the entire record of these various proceedings, we are persuaded that Cermark\u2019s claim lacks all factual support. Section 2255 authorizes courts summarily to dispose of motions made pursuant to that section \u201c[i]f it plainly appears from the face of the motion and any annexed exhibits and the prior proceedings in the case that the movant is not entitled to relief . . . Rule 4(b) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings. A section 2255 motion may be decided without awaiting the results of an evidentiary hearing when such motion \u201c(1) is inadequate on its face, or (2) although facially adequate, is conclusively refuted as to the alleged facts by the files and records of the case.\u201d <em>Moran v. Hogan, </em>494 F.2d 1220, 1222 (1st Cir. 1974). We regard the transcript of the undecided magistrate\u2019s hearing as part of an \u201cexpanded record,\u201d see <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>564 F.2d 103, 105 (1st Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 931, 98 S.Ct. 1504, 55 L.Ed.2d 528 (1978); Rule 7 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, from which to review Cermark\u2019s claim and determine realistically whether there is any ground on which Cermark could prevail. Our review of that record, particularly Cermark\u2019s prior conduct and statements, convinces us that Cermark\u2019s factual allegations are \u201cpalpably false,\u201d <em>United States v. Malcolm, </em>432 F.2d 809, 812 (2d Cir. 1970); <em>cf. Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 76, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 1630, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977) (\u201cpatently frivolous or false\u201d), and thus provide no basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-9\">In the section of his 2255 motion designated \u201cSupporting Facts,\u201d Cermark stated, \u201cMy attorney told me to plead guilty [and] I would get a Federal Sentence to run concurrent with state sentence and that if paroled from the state the Federal Authorities would go along with the Parole. Instead the Federal Authorities didn\u2019t grant me a Parole.\u201d At the magistrate\u2019s hearing Cermark basically repeated these allegations stating he had been advised by his attorney on two occasions that if he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>paroled by the state authorities \u201cThe Feds would go along with it, providing I had a good institutional record.\u201d Cermark\u2019s wife also testified at this hearing, and although somewhat sketchy concerning many of the particulars, she did recall her presence at a courtroom conversation between Cermark and his attorney prior to the commencement of the change of plea hearing. During this conversation Cermark allegedly expressed his awareness of the fact that he would likely receive a 12-year sentence and was, according to Mrs. Cermark, informed by his attorney that if paroled by the state he would at the same time \u201cget parolled [sic] by the Federal.\u201d Henry Quarles, Cermark\u2019s trial attorney, in an affidavit and testimony before the magistrate denied that he had given Cermark such erroneous parole advice. Rather, he stated that he explained to Cermark that even if paroled from the state sentence, some Federal time would have to be served. Quarles testified as follows,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-4\">\u201cA. We had a discussion as to where he would be sent after he left [the state prison at] Walpole, whether or not he would be sent to a local Federal institution, and I remember specifically explaining to him that I could give him no assurance as to where he would be sent in the Federal institution, because it would depend on where they had room. They could send him to Kentucky, Texas, Missouri, or wherever they had room; but unless he messed up in prison, as a rule, they tried to send prisoners as close to local residence as possible, and possibly he would get Danbury. I remember specifically telling him that and him again asking me where he would be sent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-5\">Q. Did you tell him when he would be parolled [sic] by the State he could also expect to be parolled [sic] by the Federal authorities?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-7\">A. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-8\">Q. Did you ever tell him anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-9\">A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1132-10\">Were this case one where the prisoner\u2019s allegations of attorney misfeasance stood rebutted simply by the attorney\u2019s statements to the contrary, we might require what is presently missing \u2014 a credibility determination. <em>Cf. Miller v. United States, supra, </em>564 F.2d at 106 (court may not resolve critical factual questions against petitioner simply on basis of <em>ex parte </em>government affidavits). Here, however, Cermark\u2019s own remarks and conduct utterly belie his factual claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-11\">We first observe that when confronted at his disposition proceeding with the district court\u2019s intention to impose a sentence which would \u201cadd ... to what he [was] already doing,\u201d Cermark, although given opportunity, voiced no opposition or indication that this proposed disposition ran counter to his sentencing expectations. Nor during the discussions of parole which took place at both the change-of-plea and sentencing hearings did Cermark introduce to the court his joint federal-state parole theory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1132-12\">Even more difficult to square with his current stance is Cermark\u2019s view of the consequences of his federal prison term expressed in his letter to the \u201cUnited States Probation Office.\u201d In this letter, written only 18 days after the imposition of sentence, Cermark stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-13\">\u201cDear Mr. Kelley;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-14\">On April 26, 1974 I was sentenced to 12 years concurrent with the state sentence I am now doing. On April 16, you interviewed me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-15\">I would appriciate [sic] it if you could answer the following questions for me??</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>(1) When am I elegable [sic] to be sent to a Federal Institution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-4\">(2) Where will I be sent to?? I was under the impression from what my attorney said, that if I made Parole from the state, I would be Paroled to the Federal system and most likely go to Danburry [sic], Ct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-5\">(3) How much time do I have to do before I am eligable [sic] to see the Federal Parol Board??? I was told 4 years l/3rd of the 12 because it\u2019s my first Federal sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-6\">(4) Do I receive credit for time served from time of indictment which was July, 24, 1973?? or from the time I received concurrent sentence which was April, 26, 1974??</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-7\">I would prefer to do remaining sentence at Danburry [sic] Ct. because it is closer fro [sic] my family to visit me . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1133-8\">The clear import of the above letter is that Cermark was laboring under no misconception as to the terms of his future incarceration and understood well that he would be doing federal time after being paroled from the state system. Importantly, Cermark\u2019s summary of the opinion expressed to him by Attorney Quarles \u2014 that after parole from the state sentence Cermark would serve his remaining federal term in the federal system, \u201cmost likely\u201d at Danbury\u2014 mirrors nearly identically Quarles\u2019 own recollection, offered through affidavit and testimony and discussed above, of the advice he had given Cermark. In the face of Cermark\u2019s own clearly expressed views as to his understanding of the relation between his federal and state sentences, his present contrary position lacks a credible foundation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1133-9\">Moreover, Cermark voiced no protestations when he was transferred following his state parole, to the custody of federal authorities in November of 1975. Surely one whose sentencing expectations were so plainly frustrated would likely register some indication of displeasure at learning of a breach of the basic terms of the plea agreement. Cermark, about one month after being taken into federal custody, did write the district court which had imposed sentence asking the court to consider a reduction or modification of that sentence. Nowhere in that letter, however, did Cermark even hint that a parole understanding had been violated or that he had been misled by his attorney as to the consequences of a guilty plea. In fact, passages in Cermark\u2019s letter indicate again that he fully comprehended the relationship between his state and federal sentences. Cermark, noting his parole \u201cfrom the State,\u201d informed the court that he was \u201cpresently . awaiting transportation to a Federal Prison to finish the remainder of [his] sentence\u201d and revealed his awareness that as his state term had been completed he now had \u201cto go to a Federal Prison for at least 2V2 years . .\u201d We find the inference compelling that Cermark harbored no belief that he would be paroled from the federal system concurrent with his receipt of state parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-12\">Finally, we note that in October of 1976, nearly one year after he had been taken into federal custody, Cermark filed a \u201cMotion for Modification and/or Reduction of Sentence Pursuant to Rules 35, and 45(c) Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and Memorandum of Law in Support Thereof.\u201d Nowhere in the accompanying materials did Cermark make any allegations even resembling those raised in the present section 2255 motion. Indeed the main grounds asserted in support of the Rules 35 and 45 request apparently were simply that \u201c[defendant has been in custody for nine (9) years and would show [the] Court that his attitude has completely changed and that he is ready to assume a responsible role in society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-13\">Cermark\u2019s current arguments, raised in a section 2255 motion filed nearly three years after the imposition of sentence and nearly one and one half years after his transfer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>federal custody, appear to us to be \u201ca mere afterthought,\u201d <em>United States v. Lowe, </em>173 F.2d 346, 347 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>337 U.S. 944, 69 S.Ct. 1499, 93 L.Ed. 1747 (1949), and without factual support. Cermark\u2019s present stance runs clearly counter not only to the testimony of his own attorney, <em>compare Castro v. United States, </em>396 F.2d 345, 347 (9th Cir. 1968) (attorney in affidavit acknowledged erroneous advice), but to a consistent course of conduct in which Cermark himself raised numerous grounds, although importantly not those now offered, in an effort to escape the consequences of his guilty plea. In these circumstances, where the movant\u2019s own words and actions conclusively rebut his present contentions, we find, without need for further hearing, that Cermark\u2019s allegations are \u201cpalpably false.\u201d <em>Malcolm, supra, </em>432 F.2d at 812. <em>Cf. Blackledge, supra, </em>431 U.S. at 76, 97 S.Ct. at 1630.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">We thus affirm, albeit on different grounds, the district court\u2019s denial of Cermark\u2019s motion for section 2255 relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1130-14\">. Actually Cermark\u2019s present section 2255 motion is a consolidation of two prior, nearly identical motions, filed in February and April of 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">. Interspliced with Cermark\u2019s ineffective assistance argument is a suggestion that the \u201cmisapprehension on the part of the defendant\u2019s counsel was . . . chargeable to the government.\u201d Suffice it to say that there is, as Cermark admits elsewhere, no evidence whatsoever indicating any type of misconduct on the part of the government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1132-6\">. We note also that Cermark and his attorney were questioned closely by the district court at the change-of-plea hearing as to whether Cermark had been promised \u201ca particular sentence, probation, or any other inducement of any kind to plead guilty\u201d or whether he had been informed \u201cby anyone what sentence the Court would impose in the event of a plea of guilty.\u201d Both responded in the negative. The Assistant United States Attorney did indicate that \u201calthough no specific promise or representation\u201d concerning sentencing had been made, he had informed Attorney Quarles of his willingness to \u201crecommend to the United States Attorney a concurrent sentence,\u201d although not a \u201cspecific term of years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1133-10\">. Cermark, while acknowledging that this letter was in his handwriting, attempted to explain it basically by claiming that he didn\u2019t recall writing it. This same explanation was offered by Cermark in regard to a later letter written to the district court and discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
