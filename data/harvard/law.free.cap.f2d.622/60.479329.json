The district court adopted the petitioner\u2019s position, but we reject it and, consequently, vacate the order directing the Commission to conduct a new parole hearing. Because the petitioner may be relying upon other commitments made as part of the plea bargain, however, we remand for clarification of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the district court alleging that the United States Parole Commission had improperly denied him release. The district court dismissed several of the claims but found meritorious the contention that in reaching its decision the Commission had improperly considered counts of an indictment that had been dismissed \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d The court directed the Commission to hold a new hearing, at which time only the charge to which petitioner had pleaded was to be evaluated.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">Petitioner was indicted along with several others and charged with participating in a scheme to defraud the United States by delivering meat that did not meet contract specifications. After negotiations between his trial counsel and the government, it was agreed that petitioner would plead guilty to one count of an information charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (1976), concealment of a material fact. In return the government agreed \u201cnot to allocute for any particular sentence\u201d but specifically reserved \u201cits right to comment on the evidence against this defendant.\u201d In addition, the government was to \u201cforego seeking any additional charges against said defendant in connection with his conduct in supplying meat to the Department of Defense, and at the time of sentencing will dismiss the counts in the indictment . . . with prejudice.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agreement did not mention parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-17\">The petitioner pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts to the one-count information. Before sentence was imposed, counsel acknowledged to the court that he had gone over the presentence report with petitioner, and said that there were no matters included that he wished to challenge. The presentence report, in the section captioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u201cOfficial Version,\u201d noted that petitioner had pleaded guilty to a one-count information and described the scheme to supply the Department of Defense with inferior meat. The names of the other six participants were listed, along with a description of their roles in the affair, which included bribery of government inspectors. According to auditors quoted in the report, the government had been defrauded of \u201cat least $1,468,951.\u201d Finally, the report contained a notation by the probation officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahc\">\u201cOffense Severity Moderate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aum\">Parole Prognosis</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">If defendant is committed, he will serve between 12 and 16 months according to the U.S. Parole Commission Guidelines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Petitioner received a prison term of four years and a $10,000 fine. All counts in the indictment pertaining to the petitioner were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">On May 4, 1978, after four months of imprisonment, the petitioner was given his initial parole hearing. The hearing examiner panel believed that the offense should be classified as \u201cGreatest I\u201d severity under parole guidelines promulgated by the Commission, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20 (1979), as <em>amended by </em>45 Fed.Reg. 6379 (1980), because the government had been defrauded of a sum in excess of $500,000. Such a rating under the guidelines, when combined with the other factors, \u201cwould indicate a range of 40-55 months.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Because the presentence report predicted a shorter incarceration period, the matter was referred to the Regional Commissioner for determination whether the sentencing court felt that \u201cthis case had guidelines of 12-16 months.\u201d In response to an inquiry from the Parole Commission, an Assistant United States Attorney in Massachusetts wrote that at the time of sentencing the court did not mention the time the petitioner would likely serve in prison. The letter went on to say that petitioner had requested a reduction in sentence in early May, but that on May 19,1978, the court had declined to alter its judgment. Thereafter, the hearing examiners and the Regional Commissioner agreed to continue the petitioner to the expiration of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">In February 1979 the National Appeals Board of the Parole Commission advanced the parole date because of the consideration given to a codefendant and told petitioner he would be eligible for release on March 19, 1980. At the same time, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the area where he was then confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">The habeas petition sought either an outright vacation or a reduction of the sentence, and, alternatively, a furlough so that petitioner could return to his family. Among the grounds for relief were that the Parole Commission, in considering information concerning the dismissed counts in the indictment, had breached the plea agreement, and that petitioner\u2019s health was in danger of irreparable harm because of the inadequate care available in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">The district court rejected the request for a reduction of sentence because of lack of jurisdiction and also refused the furlough request. The court found that despite the petitioner\u2019s allegation that he was simply a less culpable member of the scheme, the Parole Commission\u2019s denial of parole was not arbitrary or capricious; failure to exhaust administrative remedies precluded consideration of the claim of improper medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">The district court concluded, however, that it was \u201cnot proper for the parole commission to consider as an aggravating circumstance, see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20(d), counts of an indictment which have been dismissed with prejudice and for which there is no reliable evidence on the record.\u201d The Commission was directed to conduct a new hearing at which time petitioner\u2019s offense sever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ity rating would be recalculated solely on the basis of the count to which he had pleaded guilty. Petitioner was later enlarged pending this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In this court, the Parole Commission argues that it has broad discretion to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and that matters apart from the count to which a plea is entered may be relevant to a parole determination. The petitioner renews his contention that the Parole Commission\u2019s consideration of counts dismissed with prejudice violated the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The district court did not determine whether there had been a plea agreement on parole, but took the closely related position that since the counts in the indictment had been dismissed \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d the Commission should not have considered them. The court recognized that a sentencing court could properly consider evidence of crimes of which the defendant had been acquitted, e. <em>g., United States v. Sweig, </em>454 F.2d 181 (2d Cir. 1972), but distinguished that situation because there the sentencing judge had heard the testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">We must measure the district court\u2019s reasoning against the powers granted to the Commission by the Parole Commission and Reorganization Act of 1976 (PCRA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4201^4218 (1976). Section 4203 gives the Commission the power to grant or deny parole and to promulgate rules and regulations establishing guidelines necessary to carry out the national parole policy. The general criteria for making parole determinations are found in \u00a7 4206, which provides that eligible prisoners may be released on parole if \u201cthe Commission, upon consideration of the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the prisoner, determines that . . . release would not depreciate the seriousness of his offense or promote disrespect for the law\u201d and \u201cwould not jeopardize the public welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4206(a)(1), (2). Section 4207 lists the material that the Commission may consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae\">\u201c(1) reports and recommendations which the staff of the facility in which such prisoner is confined may make;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-15\">(2) official reports of the prisoner\u2019s prior criminal record, including a report or record of earlier probation and parole experiences;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-16\">(3) presentence investigation reports;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-17\">(4) recommendations regarding the prisoner\u2019s parole made at the time of sentencing by the sentencing judge; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-18\">(5) reports of physical, mental, or psychiatric examination of the offender.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-19\">The section concludes that \u201csuch additional relevant information ... as may be reasonably available\u201d may also be reviewed by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-20\">It is clear that the Commission is granted wide discretion to review material that would be helpful in its determination whether to release a prisoner on parole, a decision the Supreme Court has acknowledged is difficult. It is a \u201csubtle [one which] depends on an amalgam of elements, some of which are factual but many of which are purely subjective appraisals by the Board members.\u201d <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 10, 99 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979). The choice \u201cinvolves a synthesis of record facts and personal observation filtered through the experience of the decisionmaker and leading to a predictive judgment as to what is best both for the individual inmate and for the community. This latter conclusion requires the Board to assess whether, in light of the nature of the crime, the inmate\u2019s release will minimize the gravity of the offense, weaken the deterrent impact on others, and undermine respect for the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 99 S.Ct. at 2104 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The scope of information that the Parole Commission may consider, though perhaps statutorily not as expansive as that applicable to the sentencing judge, is nevertheless quite broad. The statute applicable to the sentencing court, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3577 (1976), places no limitation on information that may be received \u201cconcerning the background, character, and conduct\u201d of the convicted defendant. We have held, for example, that under this statute a sentencing judge may properly consider allegations in a pending, untried indictment. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>470 F.2d 1140 (3d Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 919, 93 S.Ct. 1558, 36 L.Ed.2d 311 (1973); <em>see United States </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>544 F.2d 681, 684 (3d Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In the parole context, Congress has authorized the Commission to view presentence reports, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207(3) (1976), despite the knowledge that \u201c[tjhere are no formal limitations on their contents, and they may rest on hearsay and contain information bearing no relation whatever to the crime with which the defendant is charged.\u201d <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 489, 492, 89 S.Ct. 1134, 1136, 22 L.Ed.2d 442 (1969). Thus, in <em>Billiteri </em>v. <em>United States Board of Parole, </em>541 F.2d 938, 944 (2d Cir. 1976), a pre-PCRA case, the court reasoned that if the sentencing judge may take into account offenses other than the one for which defendant was convicted, the Parole Board may use a presentence report to arrive at a severity rating. Similarly, in <em>Zannino v. Arnold, </em>531 F.2d 687 (3d Cir. 1976), another pre-PCRA case, we held that reports linking a prisoner to large-scale organized criminal activity provided a sufficient basis for a Board determination to deny parole. Nothing in the new Act or its legislative history, curtails what could have been considered by the old Parole Board.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">In fact, the PCRA emphasizes consideration of the nature and circumstances of the offense. Before enactment of the Act, House and Senate conferees reconciled conflicts between the House and Senate bills. In their report, the conferees stated that it was their intent that the Commission review and consider both the nature and circumstances of the offense, and that in making each parole decision, the Commission should recognize and determine the relative severity of the prospective parolee\u2019s offense. In so doing, the Commission \u201cshall be cognizant of the public perception of and respect for the law.\u201d H.Conf.Rep.No.838, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 25, <em>reprinted in </em>[1976] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 335,358. This inquiry was made explicit in the statute itself. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206. It is against this background, therefore, that we must decide if the Commission improperly considered the dismissed counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">In its opinion, the district court emphasized that the counts were dismissed \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d The plea agreement, however, did not in any way link this phrase to the question of parole, nor did it restrict the scope of the presentence report. On these matters the agreement was completely silent. Even at time of sentencing, after the presentence report had been examined by defense counsel, there was no request or suggestion that because these counts were dismissed with prejudice the report should not be reviewed by the Parole Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>We find nothing in the record to establish that the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d language was to have any effect on the scope of the presentence investigation or, more specifically, prohibit its disclosure to the Parole Commission. In this report, as we noted earlier, the details of the scheme and the amount of money allegedly involved are included. It is this information that apparently is also contained in the dismissed counts of the indictment or is the conduct to which they refer.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Petitioner seems to take the position that without any clarifying language, the use of \u201cwith prejudice\u201d is understood to require that those counts, and the conduct to which they refer, be treated as if they had never existed. But the petitioner has not demonstrated that such a restrictive interpretation is common in plea bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In negotiating for a plea, the defendant has a very real interest in limiting the number of counts to which he is exposed for the obvious reason that the total length of time to which he can be sentenced is reduced. It would be of little benefit to him if those same counts could be included in a new indictment, and so it is generally understood that if on a plea bargain charges are dismissed, they will not be revived. Should the government reinstitute the counts in a new indictment, the defendant could invoke the agreement as a defense under <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). Accordingly, the common understanding is that in the absence of contrary expression, counts dismissed as a result of plea bargaining are \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">In this case, the addition of the phrase added nothing but certainty to the terms of the plea bargain and insured that the petitioner would not again be charged with the same crime. The clause did no more than express what would otherwise have been implied. Nothing in the terminology suggests that it has any ramifications that would affect parole consideration or that would restrict the presentence report. Nor do the parties cite any decisional law to that effect. We conclude that, standing alone, the phrase \u201cwith prejudice\u201d does not bar comment in the presentence report about the charges in the dismissed counts and does not prevent consideration of that conduct by the Parole Commission in weighing all the factors bearing on the nature of the offense and the prisoner\u2019s character as well.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Inasmuch as it relied solely on that terminology for validity, the district court\u2019s order must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">As an independent basis for relief, amicus curiae contends that the Commission\u2019s almost total reliance on the presentence report in arriving at a parole determination denied petitioner an individualized consideration. This, in turn, touches upon the concerns addressed in our decision in <em>Geraghty v. United States Parole Commission, </em>579 F.2d 238 (3d Cir. 1978), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>- U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 1202, 63 L.Ed.2d 479 (1980). In <em>Geraghty, </em>we suggested that a wooden application of parole guidelines to arrive at the parole determination could usurp traditional judicial control over the sentencing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">In this case, however, there is no doubt that petitioner\u2019s parole determination took into account factors peculiar to him. The Commission took steps to insure that the sentencing judge\u2019s wishes were ascertained and complied with by forwarding an inquiry to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office in Massachusetts. Only after the response was received did the Commission set parole. This concrete example of considering factors peculiar to the particular prisoner negates any argument that petitioner received nothing more than a mechanical application of the parole guidelines. We therefore conclude that petitioner\u2019s parole determination complied with our dictates in <em>Geraghty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>We also reject an alternative argument advanced by the amicus that the \u201carbitrary\u201d reliance on the presentence report violated a Commission regulation requiring that parole determinations be made upon a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.19(c) (1979). That same regulation goes on to state that \u201cthe Commission shall rely upon such information only to the extent that it represents the explanation of the facts that best accords with reason and probability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this regard, we think it significant that after he had been given the opportunity to review the report, and before sentencing, petitioner did not challenge any of the factual matters included. Both the sentencing judge and the Parole Commission, therefore, were entitled to assume that the factual information in the report was correct. Conceding that in some instances an overreliance on the presentence report may hinder an impartial and a just decision, we find nothing in this record to suggest that the information received by the Commission here was inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Because of the procedural posture of the case when it was decided by the district court, however, we are unable to resolve all the issues at this time. The petitioner has alleged that the plea bargain incorporated the government\u2019s agreement not to use the allegations of the dismissed counts in considering eligibility for parole. A failure by the government to observe a promise with respect to parole recommendations may constitute a breach of a plea bargain. <em>See Cohen v. United States, </em>593 F.2d 766 (6th Cir. 1979). Although the plea agreement on its face does not link the dismissal to parole recommendation or consideration, the record is not clear if petitioner is raising a factual issue concerning the government\u2019s representations in addition to his interpretation of the phrase \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d If so, the matter must be resolved in the first instance by the district court. We will remand to the district court, therefore, to determine if there is an issue remaining, and, in that event, to decide the matter. If there are no further factual matters to be developed, however, the court may then dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Accordingly, this case will be remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-11\">. The plea agreement was prepared on paper bearing petitioner\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s letterhead in the margin, and we assume from that fact that the draftsmanship was that of petitioner\u2019s lawyer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-8\">. Under the guidelines, crimes are assigned a severity rating and placed into one of seven categories. Each prisoner is assigned a parole prognosis score on a scale of 0 to 11. The intersection of these two factors yields the anticipated time to be served in prison. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20 (1979), as <em>amended by </em>45 Fed.Reg. 6379 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\">. The petitioner has been enlarged since September 1979, months in advance of his parole date of March 20, 1980. The case, therefore, is not moot since he could be ordered to return in order to serve the remainder of his sentence. In view of our decision vacating the district court\u2019s order and remanding for possible further findings, we note that counsel for the Commission commented at oral argument that the petitioner will not be reincarcerated until his case has been reevaluated by the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b143-10\">. There is considerable doubt that the Parole Commission, in fact, ever did review the dismissed counts of the indictment. The documents in the record suggest that the Commission received its information about the petitioner\u2019s offense only from the presentence report. The one-count information is also in the record, but we do not find the original indictment or any evidence that it was ever in the possession of the Commission. The government chose to defend the case on an <em>arguendo </em>basis, assuming that the petitioner\u2019s allegations were correct but denying their legal efficacy. Thus, we must meet the issues as addressed by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b144-6\">. By regulation, the Commission has provided that it \u201cshall not consider in any determination, charges upon which a prisoner was found not guilty after trial unless reliable information is presented that was not introduced into evidence at such trial (e. g., a subsequent admission or other clear indication of guilt.)\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.19(c) (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">. The one count information to which petitioner pleaded charged him with covering up that he had misrepresented the quality of meat that he was supplying to the government and that he was making regular cash payments to government inspectors who were to inspect his company\u2019s production. The extent of the fraud being \u201ccovered up\u201d and the amount of cash given to the inspectors obviously would have a bearing on the severity rating attributable to the offense charged in the information.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
