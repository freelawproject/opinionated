Agreeing with the district court that <em>first, </em>the lender did not claim a security interest in certain household goods, as alleged, and fully disclosed the security interest it claimed in other household goods, and <em>second, </em>since Georgia law does not clearly prohibit and possibly supports the security interest claimed for future indebtedness, the lender could properly claim that interest without suggesting the possible invalidity of the claim, we affirm the judgment for the lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">Minnie Byrd Oglesby borrowed money from Blazer Financial Services, Inc. (Blazer) on November 29, 1976, to refinance a prior loan. On October 5, 1977, she filed a complaint alleging that Blazer violated the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1601-1667e, because the loan agreement did not contain required disclosures. Adopting the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation with some modification, the district court granted summary judgment in Blazer\u2019s favor. Oglesby appeals the district court\u2019s decision to this Court arguing that Blazer violated TILA and Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 226.1-226.15 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">\n<em>Security in Household Goods</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">Oglesby had borrowed money on two prior occasions: June 17,1974, and September 22, 1975. When the 1974 agreement was executed she lived on East Tupelo Street; when the 1975 agreement was executed she lived on Foxhall Lane; and when the 1976 agreement was signed she lived on Chandler Road. Each loan granted Blazer a security interest in the \u201cfurniture, appliances and other household goods and chattels located in or about Debtor\u2019s residence at the address shown above.\u201d Her complaint alleged a failure to disclose Blazer\u2019s security interest in household effects left at the Tupelo Street residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">Oglesby argues that since the security interest created by the 1974 agreement applied to \u201cany future advances to the undersigned,\u201d Blazer was obligated to disclose that security interest in the 1976 agreement. Blazer disclaims any interest in household goods left at the Tupelo address. It maintains that it relinquished the June 1974 security when the September 1975 agreement was made and had no security interest in the Tupelo Street property when the November 1976 note was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">The language of the 1976 agreement supports Blazer\u2019s contention. It grants Blazer a security interest only in household goods \u201clocated in or about Debtor\u2019s residence at the address shown above,\u201d 22 Chandler Road. The 1976 loan was a refinancing of the 1975 loan, from which Oglesby was released, and the 1975 loan in turn refinanced the 1974 loan and released Oglesby from that obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-17\">Blazer was not required to disclose in the 1976 agreement a security interest in the household goods at the Tupelo Street ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>dress because it neither claimed nor had any security interest in them. Blazer therefore did not violate Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.8(b)(5), which requires disclosure of the type of security interest to be retained by the creditor and \u201ca clear identification of the property to which the security interest relates.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">\n<em>Security for Future Indebtedness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Asd\">The security instrument claimed the same security for any future indebtedness of Oglesby to Blazer. Oglesby claims that Blazer violated Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.6(c) by failing to disclose a Georgia law limitation on a creditor\u2019s right to obtain security for future indebtedness contained in regulation 120-1-14-.13, Rules of the Comptroller General, promulgated under the Georgia Industrial Loan Act, Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 25-306. The regulation reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-6\">When the consumer is indebted to a particular creditor for two or more consumer loans, any security interest held by such creditor for any particular loan shall be discharged when the loan for which the security interest is held is paid irrespective of indebtedness to the creditor by the consumer on other outstanding consumer loans. As a general rule, security interests in terms of property shall terminate as the debt originally incurred with respect to each item is paid and in the case of the consolidation of two or more consumer loans or any circumstances in which the general rule is not followed, the creditor may be required by the Commissioner to show that his conduct with respect to such loan transactions was just, fair and reasonable. For the purposes of this Regulation, the renewal of a consumer loan shall not be deemed to be payment thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">Oglesby argues that this state regulation imposes a state law limitation on Blazer\u2019s right to secure future advances so that it claimed more security interest than it could legally assert. She says that since Blazer\u2019s disclosure was an incorrect statement of Blazer\u2019s rights it violated Regulation Z, \u00a7 226.6(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">Blazer initially contends that Ogles-by has waived any right to raise this issue on appeal by failing to properly object in the district court to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation on this point. The district court did not specifically address the future indebtedness claim in its order but did adopt the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation as the order and opinion of the court with modifications not relevant to this issue. In light of this, and inasmuch as Oglesby did incorporate the issue in her objection by reference to a previous objection to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, we shall treat it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">Blazer contends that regulation 120 1\u2014 14-13 is not a legal limitation on its right to secure future indebtedness but is at most only a guideline. Such a limitation, Blazer asserts, would invalidly contravene Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 109A-9-204(3), which provides that \u201c[ojbligations covered by a security agreement may include future advances.\u201d Blazer cites two district court cases to support its interpretation of the regulation. <em>Jones v. Blazer Financial Services, Inc., </em>No. C76-593A (N.D.Ga. Aug. 18, 1977); <em>Davis v. Kennesaw Finance Co., </em>No. C76-1481A (N.D.Ga. Feb. 2, 1977). Whether these deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>sions accurately reflect Georgia law is unclear since a federal court cannot make a binding judgment on a question of state law and to our knowledge no Georgia court has definitively interpreted regulation 120\u2014 1-14-.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Because Blazer claims a-right to secure future advances and under the Georgia statute it is not at all clear that the Comptroller\u2019s regulation limits that right, Blazer\u2019s failure to disclose the regulation was not a violation of Regulation Z. TILA does not require a creditor to disclose every potential .or questionable state law defense to rights claimed in the loan agreement, especially when that defense has been expressly negated by prior court decision, albeit not courts of ultimate authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">In light of this holding, we need not address whether, if there were a definitive state law limitation on the security claimed, it would have to be disclosed under Regulation Z. It is unnecessary in this case to resolve any conflicts which might exist between this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pennino v. Morris Kirschman &amp; Co., </em>526 F.2d 367 (5th Cir.1976), and its decision in. <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>General Finance Corp., </em>535 F.2d 295 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 891, 98 S.Ct. 265, 54 L.Ed.2d 176 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\">.
