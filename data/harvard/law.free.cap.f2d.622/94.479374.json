Without deciding whether as a matter of statutory construction, the appeal from such order is premature prior to final judgment, we feel that, absent some special circumstances, any award of attorney\u2019s fees prior to final judgment in any case should generally await the termination of the case on the merits, and that any appellate review of such an award should only be had in connection with the review of the final judgment in the case. Such a procedure avoids the interruptions that generally result from interlocutory appeals. Accordingly, any appellate review in this case of the award of attorney\u2019s fees, made prior to final judgment, should await final judgment, and should be subject to review and/or revision by the district court at the time of final judgment. The result of this ruling renders tentative the order from which this appeal is taken and thus makes unnecessary at this stage any bond to assure payment of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The cause is accordingly remanded to the district court for further action consistent with our ruling herein, including the vacation at this time of the bond heretofore required and given to assure compliance with the order of the district court from which this appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">\n<em>REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
