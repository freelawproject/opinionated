Campisi was serving a state sentence and was about to be sentenced on another state conviction. The district court imposed a federal sentence to run consecutively to the existing state sentence. After the federal sentencing hearing, Campisi was returned to the state prison where he was ser/ing the first state sentence. He now maintains that the federal sentence must be deemed to commence on the date he was returned to the state prison, rather than at the conclusion of the first state sentence, and has filed a motion accordingly to correct his federal sentence. The district court denied the motion, and Campisi has appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-15\">Campisi pleaded guilty on May 13,1975 to one count of conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (1976). At the time Campisi entered the plea, he was serving a fifteen to twenty year sentence in a New Jersey state prison on an unrelated state conviction, and was expected soon to be sentenced for a state murder conviction to an additional twenty-four to twenty-five years imprisonment. On June 30, 1975, the district judge imposed a five year sentence which he stated was to be served consecutively to the existing state sentence. Inasmuch as it was expected that Campisi\u2019s state sentence on the murder conviction would exceed five years, the United States Attorney and the New Jersey Attorney General agreed that Campisi would serve his federal sentence in a New Jersey state correctional institution. Campisi\u2019s plea agreement reflected this understanding, and the district judge recommended to the United States Attorney General that Campisi\u2019s five year federal sentence be served in a New Jersey state prison. Following imposition of the federal sentence, Campisi was returned immediately to state custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-16\">After Campisi pleaded guilty to murder and conspiracy, the New Jersey state court, in Burlington County, sentenced him on July 10, 1975 to concurrent sentences totaling approximately twenty-five years which were to be served concurrently with his existing state sentence. On August 22, 1978, Campisi was granted parole on his first state sentence and he subsequently gained parole, effective June 26, 1979, on his second state sentence. Upon his release, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Campisi was delivered to the custody of the United States Marshall and presently is incarcerated for the remainder of his five year federal sentence in the federal correctional facility at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">On July 2, 1979, Campisi, claiming that under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568 (1976) his federal sentence commenced to run on June 30, 1975, the date he was returned to state prison following sentencing on the federal conviction, filed a motion to correct his federal sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1976). Section 3568 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">The sentence of imprisonment of any person convicted of an offense shall commence to run from the date on which such person is received at the penitentiary, reformatory, or jail for service of such sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Campisi maintains that \u00a7 3568 mandates that his federal sentence commence from the date of his return to the state prison and urges that \u00a7 3568 rendered the district court powerless to impose a federal sentence that was to commence upon the expiration of his existing state sentence. Thus, he moved for release effective June 30, 1980 \u2014 five years from the date on which he was returned to the state prison. Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Campisi\u2019s argument, while creative, is based on a selective reading of the terms of \u00a7 3568. The statute provides that a sentence commences to run from the date on which the prisoner \u201cis received\u201d at the correctional facility \u201cfor service of such sentence.\u201d When Campisi was returned to the New Jersey state prison it was for service of the time remaining on his existing <em>state </em>sentence, not for immediate service of the <em>federal </em>sentence. Inasmuch as the federal sentence was not to begin until the state sentence was completed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Campisi\u2019s appearance at the state prison on June 30, 1975 could not have been for service of the federal sentence. Consequently, we hold that Campisi\u2019s five year federal sentence did not commence to run until he was granted parole on August 22, 1978 on the fifteen to twenty year state sentence and was thereby constructively received at the state prison for service of the federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">The interpretation of \u00a7 3568 that Campisi would have us adopt would effectively prevent a federal district court from imposing a term of punishment to be served consecutively to an existing sentence, whether state or federal. For if \u00a7 3568 requires that every sentence commence upon a prisoner\u2019s receipt at a correctional facility, it would be most difficult, perhaps impossible, for a court to impose a sentence that is to run consecutively to an existing or contemporaneously imposed sentence. It is well-settled that Congress did not intend \u00a7 3568 to bar the imposition of consecutive sentences. <em>See, e. g., Kay v. United States, </em>279 F.2d 734, 735 (6th Cir. 1960) (per curiam) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">Moreover, in cases such as this, in which the federal sentence is added to a state sentence, to interpret \u00a7 3568 as prohibiting the imposition of a consecutive term would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>effectively overrule a prior line of decisions of this Court. In <em>Gomori v. Arnold, </em>533 F.2d 871, 875 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 851, 97 S.Ct. 140, 50 L.Ed.2d 125 (1976), we held that a federal district court \u201chas no power to direct that a federal sentence shall run concurrently with a state sentence.\u201d Indeed, we observed that \u201c[t]he rule of presumptive concurrency of sentences . does not apply where one sentence is imposed by a federal court and the other by a state court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, if we were to construe \u00a7 3568 as requiring all sentences to commence upon the prisoner\u2019s receipt at the state correctional facility at which he is serving a term of incarceration, we would effectively be ordering that which we held in <em>Gomori </em>the district court had no authority to do \u2014 that is, impose a federal sentence to run concurrently with a state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The judgment of the district court denying the \u00a7 2255 motion will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-10\">. There is no question that the district judge intended to impose a sentence that was to run consecutively to Campisi\u2019s existing fifteen to twenty year state sentence. At the time of sentencing, the judge stated, \u201cThis sentence is to run consecutive to the present state sentence that the defendant is now serving.\u201d Transcript of Sentencing Proceeding, June 30, 1975, App. 46. In addition, at the hearing on Campisi\u2019s \u00a7 2255 sentence, the district judge who had imposed the sentence in question again made this intent very clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-11\">Under my intention at sentencing \u201c[SJervice of such sentence\u201d did not commence until August 22, 1978, the date the petitioner was paroled on his first [state] sentence. That the petitioner spent the period from June 30, 1975 to August 22, 1978 in a New Jersey state prison cannot alter the fact that his federal sentence did not begin until the time set by this court: the expiration of his first state sentence; and if my clearly stated intention is to be honored, time spent in a New Jersey prison on that 15 to 20 year [state] sentence cannot be counted as time spent in \u201cservice of such sentence,\u201d the latter sentence here referring to the five-year sentence imposed by me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-16\">Memorandum Opinion, Hearing on \u00a7 2255 Motion, September 12, 1979, App. 62, 67.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
