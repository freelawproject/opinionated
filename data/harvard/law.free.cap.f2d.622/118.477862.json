Appellant University Interscholastic League (UIL) interpreted its own transfer regulations to preclude John from playing football at his new school. The district court found that all four factors necessary for preliminary relief were present,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and granted a temporary injunction allowing John to play football. The UIL appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">During the pendency of this appeal, John has graduated from high school, having continued to play football throughout his senior year. This suit was not brought as a class action, and appellant sought only injunctive relief and not damages. There is, therefore, no longer a justiciable case or controversy and the case is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Appellants contend that this case is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review,\u201d and thus is within an established exception to the doctrine of mootness. <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 125, 93 S.Ct. 705, 713, 35 L.Ed.2d 147, 161 (1973); <em>Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, </em>219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 283, 55 L.Ed. 310, 316 (1911). This argument must fail in light of <em>DeFunis v. Odegaard, </em>416 U.S. 312, 94 S.Ct. 1704, 40 L.Ed.2d 164 (1974). In this case, as in <em>De-Funis, </em>the student has completed his final term in school, and \u201cwill never again be required to run the gauntlet\u201d of the UIL\u2019s transfer policies, <em>id. </em>at 319, 94 S.Ct. at 1707, 40 L.Ed.2d at 170. Moreover, as in <em>DeFunis, </em>there is no reason to suppose that future attacks on the UIL\u2019s rules will similarly evade review. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the case meets neither of the tests set out in <em>Walsh v. Louisiana High School Athletic Association, </em>616 F.2d 152, 157 (5th Cir. 1980): the effect of the rule is not too short in duration to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and there is no reasonable expectation that the plaintiff will be subjected to the same difficulties again.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">Appellants also contend that the fact that appellees were required to post a $15.00 injunction bond keeps the controversy alive, citing <em>Camenisch v. University of Texas, </em>616 F.2d 127 (5th Cir. 1980). <em>Camenisch </em>may be distinguished on two grounds. First, the bond in <em>Camenisch </em>could not be dissolved without an adjudication on the merits; the question presented in that case was which party ought to pay particular costs, and the bond constituted plaintiff\u2019s guarantee of payment should the burden ultimately fall on him. In this case, appellants have neither advanced monies nor suffered financial harm, so there will be no ultimate liability on the bond. Second, <em>Camenisch </em>involved a $3,000 bond; the $15 bond posted in this case must be considered de minimus by comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">Appellants\u2019 final argument is that appellee\u2019s request, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, for attorneys\u2019 fees salvages an otherwise moot case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This court has frequently refused to consider the merits of an otherwise moot case and has left the question of attorneys\u2019 fees for the district court on remand. <em>See, e. g., Johnson v. Mississippi, </em>586 F.2d 387 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>McDonald v. Oliver, </em>525 F.2d 1217 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 61, 50 L.Ed.2d 77 (1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Moreover, a determination of mootness does not prevent an award of attorneys\u2019 fees on remand. <em>Reiser v. Del Monte Properties Co., </em>605 F.2d 1135, 1140 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>Criterion Club of Albany v. Board of Commissioners, </em>594 F.2d 118, 120 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Ramey v. Cincinnati Enquirer, Inc., </em>508 F.2d 1188, 1196 (6th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>422 U.S. 1048, 95 S.Ct. 2666, 45 L.Ed.2d 700 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Thus a determination of mootness neither precludes nor is precluded by an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. The attorneys\u2019 fees question turns instead on a wholly independent consideration: whether plaintiff is a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Mississippi, </em>606 F.2d 635 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Iranian Students Association v. Edwards, </em>604 F.2d 352 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Morrow v. Dillard, </em>580 F.2d 1284 (5th Cir. 1978). Even preliminary relief may serve to make a plaintiff a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the statute; the lawsuit need not proceed to completion. <em>Bly v. McLeod, </em>605 F.2d 134 (4th Cir. 1979); <em>Iranian Students Association, supra; Criterion Club, supra; International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Andersen, </em>569 F.2d 1027 (8th Cir. 1978); <em>Brown v. Culpepper, </em>559 F.2d 274 (5th Cir. 1977). All that is required is that the plaintiff obtain the primary relief sought. <em>Iranian Students Association, supra, </em>604 F.2d at 353; <em>Adams v. Reed, </em>567 F.2d 1283, 1288 (5th Cir. 1978). That requirement has been satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">We therefore vacate the preliminary injunction as moot, and remand the case to the district court for a determination of appropriate attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-14\">. Section 504 creates a private right of action in addition to the administrative remedies it provides. <em>Camenisch v. University of </em>Texas, 616 F.2d 127 (5th Cir. 1980). We are thus not faced with a case in which no federal jurisdiction exists because the sole issue presented is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>interference with the right to play football. <em>See Mitchell v. Louisiana High School Athletic Association, </em>430 F.2d 1155 (5th Cir. 1970). Instead, the refusal to allow John to play football infringes on statutorily-created federal rights and thus the claim asserts a federal cause of action. See <em>Walsh v. Louisiana High School Athletic Association, </em>616 F.2d 152, 156 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\">. Those factors are:</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">1. Irreparable harm to the plaintiff from failure to issue the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">2. The relative lack of harm to the defendant from issuance of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">3. The public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">4. Probability that the plaintiff will ultimately succeed on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\"><em>Camenisch v. University of Texas, </em>616 F.2d 127, 130 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b199-16\">. Appellee also urges this contention, apparently fearful that a determination of mootness by this court would preclude any award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Our discussion of attorneys\u2019 fees rejects both arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b199-17\">. In <em>Rainey v. Jackson State College, </em>481 F.2d 347 (5th Cir. 1973), the court proceeded to the merits of a moot case in order to resolve a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Rainey </em>is inapposite. In that case, the district court reached a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>determination on the merits after a preliminary injunction had mooted the case. The case was thus already moot when it was tried in the district court. The Attorneys\u2019 Fees Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, had not been enacted when <em>Rainey </em>was decided and the standard for awarding attorneys\u2019 fees was whether defendant. had been \u201cunreasonable and obdurately obstinate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350. This standard required examining the merits. As discussed below, \u00a7 1988 requires only that plaintiff be a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
