The Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare has promulgated a regulation which provides that such cost reports shall be made available to the public upon written request. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After plaintiffs were notified by Blue Cross that it intended to comply with a request for their cost reports by a third person, they filed this action to enjoin disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-22\">In the court below, plaintiffs alleged that the Secretary\u2019s regulation mandating disclosure contravenes both exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>that release of the cost reports would likely cause substantial harm to plaintiffs\u2019 competitive positions, and held that they contain confidential financial information which was protected from disclosure by exemption 4 of the FOIA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Relying upon our decision in <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. Schlesinger, </em>542 F.2d 1190 (4th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. den. </em>431 U.S. 924, 97 S.Ct. 2199, 53 L.Ed.2d 239 (1977), the court enjoined disclosure of the cost reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Upon appeal we stayed argument pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979), which involved several of the issues presented in this appeal. In <em>Chrysler, </em>the Court held that the FOIA does not create a private cause of action to enjoin disclosure of information which may fall within any of its exemptions. 441 U.S. at 294, 99 S.Ct. at 1714. Moreover, the Court held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905 does not create a private cause of action to enjoin the disclosure of information in violation of that statute. 441 U.S. at 316, 99 S.Ct. at 1725. The Court, however, did hold that an agency\u2019s decision to release information which allegedly contravenes \u00a7 1905 is subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702, 706(2)(A). 441 U.S. at 317, 99 S.Ct. at 1725. Under the APA a reviewing court must set aside agency action which is \u201cnot in accordance with law,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), and as the Court indicated in <em>Chrysler, </em>any disclosure which violates \u00a7 1905 is \u201cnot in accordance with law.\u201d 441 U.S. at 318, 99 S.Ct. at 1726. The Court further noted, however, that \u00a7 1905 does not bar disclosure of information which is \u201cauthorized by law.\u201d For the purpose of this appeal, therefore, we must determine whether 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 provides the authorization by law contemplated by \u00a7 1905 which permits disclosure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 441 U.S. at 301, 99 S.Ct. at 1717.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In <em>Chrysler, </em>the Supreme Court outlined the criteria to determine whether a regulation has the \u201cforce and effect of law\u201d necessary to provide the authorization required by \u00a7 1905. First, the regulation must be a substantive or legislative-type rule. Secondly, the regulation must have been promulgated in accordance with the rule-making requirements of the APA. Finally, it must be established that a nexus exists between the regulation and some delegation of the requisite legislative authority by Congress. 441 U.S. at 301-304, 99 S.Ct. at 1717-19. Since appellees concede that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 satisfies the first two criteria, it is necessary that we consider only the latter requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The grant of authority relied upon by a federal agency in promulgating regulations need not be specific; it is only necessary \u201cthat the reviewing court reasonably be able to conclude that the grant of authority contemplates the regulations issued.\u201d 441 U.S. at 308, 99 S.Ct. at 1721. The appellants contend that congressional authority for the promulgation of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 is found in section 1106(a) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">No disclosure * * * of any file, record, report or other paper, or any information, obtained at any time by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare * * * shall be made except as the Secretary * * * may by regulations prescribe.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>We agree with this contention of the appellants. Section 1306 prohibits the disclosure of \u201cany file, record, report or other paper, or any information obtained at any time by the Secretary.\u201d Unquestionably, the cost reports fall within this comprehensive language, and absent any action by the Secretary, disclosure would be prohibited. Such material, however, is not exempt from disclosure for by its very terms the statute contemplates the issuance of regulations by the Secretary permitting such disclosure. We are in accord with those courts which have recognized the Secretary\u2019s broad discretion to permit disclosure of such information by regulation. <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital Health Center </em>v. <em>Blue Cross of Central N. </em>Y.,--F.Supp.----No. 79 -CV- 416 (N.D.N.Y. July 11, 1979), <em>affirmed by Court order, </em>614 F.2d 1290 (2 Cir. 1979); <em>cert. den. </em>- U.S. -, 100 S.Ct. 1650, 64 L.Ed.2d 238 (1980); <em>see Schecter v. Weinberger, </em>506 F.2d 1275, 1277 (D.C.Cir.1974). We are of the opinion that \u201c[a]t the very least \u00a7 1306 may reasonably be construed to contemplate the promulgation of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.-435.\u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, Inc. v. Harris, </em>604 F.2d 407, 410 (5 Cir. 1979), and that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 is entitled to the \u201cforce and effect of law.\u201d Accordingly, disclosure of the cost reports pursuant to the regulation is not prohibited by \u00a7 1905. <em>Accord, St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, supra; St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital Health Center, supra; Cedars Nursing and Convalescent Center, Inc. v. Aetna Life and Casualty Co., </em>472 F.Supp. 296 (E.D.Pa. 1979); <em>Brookwood Medical Center, Inc. v. Califano, </em>470 F.Supp. 1247 (N.D.Ga.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Appellees also contend that the promulgation of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.435 was arbitrary and capricious and must be set aside pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). In determining whether the promulgation of a regulation was arbitrary and capricious it is simply our function to ascertain whether the regulation was based on a consideration of the relevant factors. We are not to substitute our judgment for that of the Secretary, <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971), and our determination is to be made on the administrative record and not by <em>de novo </em>review. <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 87, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">A review of the statement of promulgation reveals that the Secretary was of the opinion that release of the cost reports would make providers more accountable to the public and thus help to assure that funds are properly spent. The Secretary also concluded there was no indication that disclosure of the cost reports would cause irreparable harm to the health care industry. Furthermore, the Secretary considered and rejected the alternatives to disclosure, and concluded that permitting disclosure only to those \u201cwho have a legitimate and beneficial use, and not to competitors\u201d would be inconsistent with the FOIA. In addition, the Secretary pointed out that giving the provider the option of preparing an abstract of the complete cost report was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>unacceptable since it would enable the provider to conceal from the public any information he chose. Finally, the Secretary found that although the cost reports may contain confidential financial information, \u201cit is not in the public interest to withhold the reports from the public.\u201d 40 Fed.Reg. 27,649. Based on the foregoing, we hold that the promulgation of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.-435 was not arbitrary and capricious. <em>Accord, St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, Inc. v. Harris, </em>604 F.2d 407, 410 (5 Cir. 1979); <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital Health Center v. Blue Cross of Central N.
