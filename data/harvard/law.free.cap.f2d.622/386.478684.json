A hearing was held on the motions and at the conclusion of the hearing the district judge carefully determined the facts and decided that continued representation of their respective clients by both lawyers would not be proper under the framework of the Canons of the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-25\">Our standard of review in cases involving the court\u2019s determination of disqualification of counsel is whether or not the ruling was an abuse of discretion. \u201cWe apply the scope of review in disqualification cases described in <em>Hull v. Celanese Corp., </em>513 F.2d 568 (2d Cir. 1975): \u2018The district court bears the responsibility for the supervision of the members of its bar. [Citing authorities.] The dispatch of this duty is discretionary in nature and the finding of the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>will be upset only upon a showing that an abuse of discretion has taken place. [Citing authorities.]\u2019 513 F.2d at 571.\u201d <em>Fred Weber, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>566 F.2d 602, 605 (8th Cir. 1977). <em>See also Arkansas v. Dean Food Products Co., Inc., </em>605 F.2d 380 (8th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">As to the cross-appeal of the City of Little Rock, No. 79-1856, the appeal is dismissed upon the motion of the appellant. As to the original appeal of appellant Johnnie Gilbert, No. 79-1836, we have carefully reviewed the record of the trial court and we cannot say that an abuse of discretion has taken place. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court pursuant to Rule 14 of the Rules of this court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-17\">.
