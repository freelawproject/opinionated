Corporations \u2014 Agreement Between Two Railroad Corporations Compromising Dispute as to Which Was Entitled to Saying in Interest Arising from Refunding Operations. In an action brought by minority stockholders of the New York and Harlem Railroad Company (the company upon request having declined to bring it) to have declared null and void a compromise agreement made' with the New York Central Railroad Company with respect to a division of the amount of interest saved by the refunding of the bonded indebtedness of the Harlem Company at a lower rate of interest, both parties having claimed to be entitled to the whole amount, it appeared that the dispute between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>the companies arose over the construction of the terms of a lease of the Harlem railroad to the Central Company; eminent counsel differed in their construction; a suit had been instituted by the Central Company and also by a stockholder of the Harlem Company to determine the questions involved; under these circumstances an amicable adjustment of the controversy was deemed advisable, and the directors of each of the contracting parties, a majority of whom were directors of both companies, entered into the agreement in question, substantially dividing the amount saved in interest between the two companies; the agreement was thereafter ratified by the stockholders. of both companies; notwithstanding the ratification the agreement was not executed by the Harlem Company until the Central Company upon demand had indemnified the former for its action; thereafter the Central Company discontinued its suit and secured a discontinuance of the stockholders\u2019 suit by transferring certain stock to the plaintiff therein; it was affirmatively found that the dispute between the two companies was an honest one and was in good faith compromised and \u201c that there was no combination, conspiracy, and no fraud.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that although by the terms of the original lease the Harlem Company was entitled, if it could procure the necessary funds-, to pay off the bonds and secure to itself any advantage in the reduction of interest arising from a new loan, that nevertheless the compromise agreement was binding on both parties thereto and concluded the rights of the plaintiffs.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-4\">2. Compromise Agreement Voidable, Not Void. Assuming that the fact that the majority of the directors of the Harlem Company were directors of the Central Company rendered the agreement voidable at the election of the Harlem stockholders, it was not absolutely void, and having been ratified by them, became binding upon the company.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-5\">3. When \u25a0 Minority Stockholders Not Entitled to Maintain Action. The right to avoid the agreement, however, rested in-the Harlem Company, not in minority stockholders, unless the ratification thereof was dictated by fraud or was procured by concealment and in ignorance of the true state of the facts, which it was affirmatively found was not the case hero.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-6\">4. Appeal\u2014Stipulation as to Evidentiary Facts Does Not Enable Court op Appeals to Consider Findings Unanimously Affirmed. Whatever may be the force of a contention that the existence of issuable ' or traversable facts having been stipulated by the parties on the trial, the Court of Appeals is bound to accept and consider them, notwithstanding the findings have been unanimously affirmed by the Appellate Division it is not applicable to merely evidentiary facts, not necessary to allege or plead, but constituting only evidence from which the issuable or traversable facts can be determined, especially in a case where all the stipulated facts fail to establish fraud or misconduct on the part either of the directors or of the majority of stockholders.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>5. Action of Common Dibectobs of the Two Cobfobations. That the common directors of the two corporations asserted the rights of each, as the occasion required, is not a proper ground for criticism, that being the right thing to do.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b259-4\">6. When Cibculab Alleged to Have Been Misleading Cannot Affect Result. A contention that a circular issued to stockholders calling the meeting to act on the proposed compromise agreement was misleading and insufficient is without force when not a single stockholder voting for the ratification has complained that he was misled or has sought to repudiate his action, where the controversy was of long duration and some public discussion and the plaintiffs at all times knew the exact situation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b259-5\">7.

Sufficiency of Vote Ratifying Agbeement. Assuming that the compromise agreement was in effect a new lease to be executed with the same formalities and vote as in the case of the original lease, under chapter 433 of the Laws of 1893, the vote of the'Central Company\u2019s stockholders was sufficient, two-thirds of the stock voted upon at the meeting being cast in favor of the lease.</headnotes>\n<history data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b259-7\"><em>Continental Ins.

The second supplementary contract, therefore, was without consideration and void. <em>(Feeter </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>78 N. Y. 334; <em>Fanners\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>Blair, </em>44 Barb. 641; <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Estate Co., </em>L. R. [32 Ch.

The second. supplementary contract is invalid for the reason that it was formulated, promoted and authorized in behalf of the Harlem Company, by directors of that company, a majority of whom were directors of the Central Company. (Morawetz on Corp. \u00a7 528; <em>N. </em>Y. <em>C. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Nat. Ins. Co., </em>14 N. Y. 85; <em>Voltz </em>v. <em>Blackmar, </em>64 N. Y. 440; <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>C. R. R.

The legal inferences which naturally flow from the referee\u2019s findings establish that the acts of the common <em>directors in </em>planning and authorizing- the second supplementary contract amounted to constructive fraud. <em>(Bosworth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>168 N. Y. 157.) The second supplementary contract is so unjust and unfair in its provisions and so manifestly in the interest of the Central Company and against the interest of the Harlem Company, that, having been authorized by directors of the Central Company, who were at the same time directors of the Harlem Company, it is voidable at the suit of the plaintiffs. (2 Cook on Corp. \u00a7 658; 3 Thomp. on Corp. \u00a7 4079 ; Morawetz on Corp. \u00a7 528 ; <em>Munson </em>v. <em>S. G. </em>&amp; <em>C. R. R. Co., </em>103 N. Y. 58; <em>Met. Elev.

The vote of the stockholders of the Harlem Company in approval oi the second supplementary contract is no obstacle to the maintenance of this action. <em>(Sage </em>v. <em>Culver, </em>147 N.

(2 Pars, on Cent. [9th ed.] 505, 661 ; <em>Dady </em>v. <em>O'Rourke, </em>172 N. Y. 452; <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>60 N. Y. 185.) Even had it been true that the compromise agreement had been adopted by a vote of the directors of the Harlem Company, of whom a majority -were directors of the Central Company, the agreement would not, therefore, have been invalid but merely voidable at the option of the company, which option must be exercised promptly. <em>(Wallach </em>v. <em>L.

The compromise agreement was ratified by an overwhelming vote of stockholders at a meeting duly called for that purpose. Such ratification eliminated any objection to the contract based upon the fiduciary relationship of the directors growing out of their common directorship in the two companies. <em>(Gamble </em>v. <em>Q.

The overwhelming vote of the stockholders in favor of the compromise was given with full knowledge of all the material circumstances of the case and is conclusive' upon the Harlem Company, and none of plaintiffs\u2019 objections to the same are well taken. <em>(Symott </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>C.

Previous to that time it had executed a mortgage to secure the payment of twelve millions of dollars of so-called consolidated bonds, which would mature May 1st, 1900. Of these bonds a certain amount had been issued, another amount was held to replace underlying mortgages on the road and the remainder was unissued. By the terms of the agreement the unissued stock and bonds were to be turned over to the Central Company to be sold and disposed of, and the proceeds to be applied to the betterment of the railroad, including the acquisition of any new property, the title to be taken in the name of the lessor. Under these provisions all the stock and bonds were outstanding long before the present controversy.

At the end of that year the Central Company contemplated a new issue of bonds and entered into negotiations with a firm of bankers for their sale. In connection with this negotiation there arose the question as to how the consolidated mortgage bonds of the Harlem Company were to be provided for at maturity, and the tender of the bankers was in the alternative, either to purchase the issue of Central bonds covering the Harlem property or to purchase with the Central bonds, bonds of the Harlem road to replace the consolidated bonds. At this time the rate of interest had so fallen that it was found possible to sell at par new bonds bearing interest at the rate of three and a half per cent per annum. The difference in the interest charge for the twelve millions of outstanding bonds and for the new bonds to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>substituted therefor would amount to four hundred and twenty thousand dollars annually, and the question seems to have immediately arisen as to which party, the lessor or the lessee, was, under the terms of the lease, entitled to this saving. Counsel for the Central Company advised that company that the reduction in interest inured solely to its advantage ; counsel advised the Harlem Company that it, by negotiating a new mortgage, could pay off the consolidated bonds and secure to itself the reduction in the interest charge. One eminent counsel took still a different view and advised the Harlem Company, which was the owner of a street surface railway line on Fourth avenue, in the city of Hew York, with valuable depot and station lands, that if it could raise the necessary funds by the sale of such property it might pay off -the consolidated bonds and thus secure the reduction in interest charge, but that under the lease it could not execute a new mortgage on the demised property' and obtain the necessary funds by that means. The Central Company instituted a suit against the Harlem Company to compel that company to issue and deliver to the Central Company under the last provision of the 7th clause of the lease, new bonds and to have it declared that the Harlem Company had not the right to pay off the consolidated mortgage bonds in its own interest or on its own behalf. Answer was interposed in that suit and it remained at issue until the final contract between the two companies. A stockholder in the Harlem Company brought an action against that .company and the Central Company to secure the rights of the Harlem Company and his own. This also remained at issue. The board of directors of the two companies met from time to time and considered the question at issue between them. The directors who were common to both companies supported the claim of the particular company as the directors of which they were at the time acting; that is to say, at the meeting of the Harlem Company they asserted the claim of that company; at the meeting of the Central Company they asserted the antagonistic claim of that company. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Matters remained in this indefinite condition until June, 1898, when, at a meeting of the Harlem board of directors a committee composed of members of that board who were not directors of the Central Company, and only one of whom was a stockholder therein, was appointed to confer with a like committee on the part of the Central Company, none of whom were directors in the Harlem Company, for a settlement of the differences between the companies, and a resolution was passed that any agreement effected between the two committees should be submitted to the stockholders of the Harlem Company for their action thereon. Similar measures were taken by the board of directors of the Central Company. The two committees agreed on a compromise which, in substance, increased the dividends to be paid to the Harlem stockholders from eight per cent to ten per cent, and the Harlem Company relinquished all further claim on the Central Company. In other words, of the reduction in interest charge, amounting to four hundred and twenty thousand dollars annually, the sum of two hundred thousand was to go to the Harlem Company and two hundred and twenty thousand to the Central Company. The compromise agreement was submitted to a meeting of the Harlem stockholders held on October 5th, 1898, at which it was adopted by the vote of 146,519 shares, out of 157,561 shares participating at the meeting and a total of 200,000 shares outstanding. The agreement was also ratified by a meeting of the Central Company stockholders. Despite of this ratification the directors and officers of the Harlem Company failed to execute the compromise agreement until April, 1900, when they demanded that the Central Company indemnify them for their action. Such indemnity being given they executed the contract. The suit between the two companies was discontinued as was also the suit brought by the stockholder of the Harlem Company. To obtain a discontinuance of the latter suit the Central railroad paid to the plaintiff therein two hundred shares of Harlem stock. On June 29th, 1900, the plaintiff instituted this action, praying as relief that the compromise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>agreement be adjudged void, and that by the payment of the consolidated mortgage bonds by the Harlem Company, that company was entitled to receive the full rent reserved in the lease, being the sum of \u00a7840,000, the equivalent of interest on twelve millions of the consolidated bonds. \u2022 The action was referred to the Honorable Charles Andrews to hear and determine. After a trial, in which most of the evidence consisted of stipulated facts, the learned referee decided in favor of the defendants. The judgment entered on the report of the referee' Was unanimously affirmed by the Appellate Division of the first department, and from the judgment of the Appellate Division this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The distinguished jurist before whom, as referee, this case was tried, was of the opinion that by the terms of the original lease the Harlem Company was entitled, if it could procure the necessary funds, to pay off the consolidated' mortgage bonds and thus secure to itself any advantage in the reduction in the interest charged on its road. We think that in this view he was clearly right. By the first clause of the lease all payments to be made by. the lessee were reserved as rent and by the second subdivision of the clause that rent was to be paid by paying certain specific interest charged to the holder of the bonds. This provision did not change the character of the payment, but merely the method of the payment. The payment was still to be of rent. By the second paragraph of the sixth clause it was expressly provided that in case of the payment of the bonds or any of them by the lessor, the lessee was to pay the lessor semi-annually, on the dates when interest would become due and payable, an amount equal to the interest thereon or such part as might have been paid by the- lessor \u201c so as fairly to adjust the obligation of the said party of the second part (Central Company) herein contained, as to the annual . rent on the said railroad and property herein demised.\u201d In the written opinion given to the Central Company by its counsel it'is merely7 stated that the requirement of the lease 'that the lessee should pay the interest on the outstanding bonds issued by the lessor was one of indemnity only. Hot a reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>is given nor a word stated in support of such a claim. It is in direct contravention of the terms of the lease which declare the amount of such interest to be rent and make provision for the contingency of the payment, by the Harlem Company, of the bonds. It is contended, however, that as by the fifth clause of the lease the Harlem Company covenanted and agreed that it would not, during the continuance thereof, \u201cauthorize, create or issue any stock or bonds additional to the amounts thereof respectively, now authorized or outstanding, as hereinbefore stated,\u201d the company could not issue new bonds to raise funds wherewith to pay off the old bonds. The language of the lease does not justify any such construction. The covenant is not to refrain from issuing any bonds other than those outstanding at the time of the lease and specified in the schedule, but not to issue bonds \u201c additional to the amounts \u201d then outstanding. Hew bonds issued in substitution of the old bonds would not in any respect increase the\" amount outstanding. There is this further answer to be made to the claim of the Central Company. As held by the learned referee, any new mortgage bonds issued by the Harlem company without the consent of the Central Company, would be subject to the lease held \u00bf by the Central Company, and that company, therefore, had no \u25a0 legal interest in the question whether the Harlem Company should mortgage its reversion or not. If the covenant is subject to the construction contended for by the Central Company it would be void and could not be enforced. Ever since the decision in <em>De Peyster </em>v. <em>Michael </em>(6 N. Y. 467) it has been the settled law in this state that a covenant restraining alienation by the owner of the property in fee is void, and that eueli a covenant can be supported only where the covenantee lias a reversion in the property. The Central Company had no reversion in the demised property, but solely the demised term. It was said by Chief Judge Rug\u00f3les in the case cited : \u201c By the old feudal law the tenant could not alien his 'fee without the lord\u2019s license, and the lord could not alien his seignory without the tenant\u2019s attornment. * * * The feudal restraint was mutual; but when the feudal relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>between the parties was broken up, these feudal restraints were thereby dissolved, and the common-law principle applicable to property not feudal immediately took effect, and rendered similar restraints created by contract entirely void.\u201d But though in the original dispute between the two companies the Harlem Company was in the right, we further agree with the learned referee that the compromise agreement executed by the two companies in pursuance of the action of their stockholders vras binding- on both the parties thereto, and concluded the rights of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Assuming that. the fact that the majority of the directors of the Harlem were also directors of the Central rendered the agreement made by the two boards for an apportionment of the interest reduction between the two companies voidable at the election of the Harlem stockholders, as doubtless was the case, nevertheless the agreement was not absolutely void, but could be ratified by the action of such stockholders, in which case it would become binding upon the company. The right, however, to avoid a contract made by common directors is in the corporation, not in minority stockholders. <em>(Burden </em>v. <em>Burden, </em>159 N. Y. 287.) In that case, speaking of minority stockholders, Judge Bartlett said: \u201cThe plaintiff is in the position of all minority stockholders, who cannot interfere with the management of the corporation so long as the trustees are acting honestly and within their discretionary powers.\u201d As already stated, it was so ratified by an overwhelming majority, and the ratification is conclusive upon the parties unless the action of the majority of the stockholders was dictated by fraud or was procured by concealment and in ignorance of the true state of the facts. We concede to its fullest extent the rule which \u201c requires of the majority of the stockholders the utmost'good faith in the control and management of the corporation, and in this respect the majority stand in much the same attitude towards the minority that directors stand towards all the stockholders.\u201d (2 Cook Stock and Stockholders, sec. 662.) The safety of corporate investments depends on the maintenance of this principle in its fullest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>integrity. It was expressly affirmed by this court in <em>Farmers' Loan and Trust Company </em>v. <em>N. Y. &amp; Northern Railway Company </em>(150 N. Y. 410). The difficulty, however, with the appellant\u2019s contention on this appeal is that the referee has affirmatively found that the dispute between the two companies was an honest one and was in good faith compromised, and \u201c that there was no combination, conspiracy and no fraud.\u201d It is insisted for the respondents that these findings, having been unanimously affirmed by the Appellate Division, are conclusive upon this court. To this the appellant responds that the facts having been stipulated by the parties on the trial, this court, is bound to accept and consider them, despite of any findings made by the trial court. It may be that the appellant\u2019s position is correct so far as the parties may have stipulated the existence of any issuable or traversable facts, and that the stipulation of the parties should be treated as supplementing or qualifying the pleadings, and thus narrowing the issues to be determined by the trial court. For illustration, in .an action against an indorser on a promissory note the answer might deny demand and notice of protest. If on the trial the parties stipulated the existence of facts which, as a matter of law, constituted due demand and notice, it may very well be that a finding by the trial court that no notice of protest had been given would not be conclusive on this court, even though unanimously affirmed by the Appellate Division. But this principle cannot apply to what we may term merely evidentiary facts; that is to say, facts which it is not necessary to allege or plead, but constitute only evidence from which the issuable, or traversable facts can be determined. We think that most, if not all, of the stipulated facts on which the appellant relies are of the latter character. However, we shall not attempt to differentiate, as we are of opinion that, considering all of them, they fail to establish fraud or misconduct on the part either of the directors or of the majority of the stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The learned counsel for the appellant lays stress on the inconsistent attitudes which the common directors of the two com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>panies at all times assumed. In the Harlem board they asserted the rights of that company; in the Central board, the rights of that company. We see no impropriety in this course of conduct. On the contrary, it seems to us to have been the right thing for these directors to do. They were large stockholders of each company, though as appears by the finding of the referee and by the stipulation of the parties showing the respective holdings of the common direetors in each company, the pecuniary interest of those directors in the Harlem Company far exceeded, so far as the disposition of the controversy in suit is involved, their interest in the Central Company. They adopted the proper method to adjust the dispute when a committee ivas appointed from each board of directors, who. had no interest in the other company, to negotiate a settlement and to submit that settlement to the stockholders of the companies. We do not think that the existence of this dispute necessarily required them to resign from either or both boards, for they had large interests of their own to protect which might be affected by many other matters than this particular controversy. It appears also that at all times a large majority of the stock of the Harlem Company was held by persons other that the directors, who could at any time choose another board if dissatisfied with the existing one. It is contended that the circular issued to the stockholders calling the meeting to act on the proposed compro- \u25a0 mise was misleading and insufficient. Of course, any circular that might have been issued would be subject to some criticism. Minds differ, and one person would suggest one change, one another. Hot a single stockholder that voted for the ratification of the compromise has complained that he was in any way misled or has sought to repudiate his action. ' The controversy was of long duration and of some public discussion. As early as December, 1896, or nearly two years before the stockholders\u2019 meeting, the eminent counsel for the plaintiff, Mr. Trull, in an elaborate opinion, which is found in the case, had advised that company that the claim of the Central Railroad was without foundation and that the Harlem Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>pany and its stockholders were entitled to the reduction in the interest charges on the road. The plaintiff at all times knew the exact situation of the controversy, and if it had any fears as to its co-stockholders being misled it could have apprised them of the true state of the case, if it deemed the circular insufficient in any respect. As already stated, out of a total of 200,000 shares ($50 each), 157,561 were voted at the stockholders\u2019 meeting. Of these 146,519 were cast in favor of the compromise, and 11,042 against it. Of the 42,439 shares not voted, all but 11,653 shares have for years accepted the terms of the compromise. The common directors of the Harlem and of the Central Companies held 58,936 shares, which were cast for the compromise. If these are thrown out, nearly a hundred thousand shares would remain in favor of the compromise, or nine times the adverse vote. A computation based on their respective holdings in the two companies shows that all of such directors, with one exception, lost by the acceptance of the proposed compromise, of course, on the assumption that the Harlem claim was well founded. Cornelius Vanderbilt, the president, held 39,668 shares and William II. Vanderbilt 18,718 shares. The net annual loss of the former was $40,224.80 ; of the latter, $10,029.80, he having greater holdings than the other in the Central Company. The holdings of the other common directors are comparatively small, still, all but one lost. The annual profit to the single director who was benefited by the compromise was $440. In the light of this showing it seems to us idle to argue that the action of the common directors or of the majority of stockholders was fraudulent or intended to subserve any interest except that which they held as stockholders in the Harlem Company. The Harlem Company gave up what, from our point of view, was a very good claim for somewhat less than half its amount. The action of the directors and of the majority of the stockholders may have been foolish and timorous, but in the light of the facts narrated, certainly, dishonest it was not. If in settling this dispute their action was dictated by excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>timidity or caution, still they were acting within their rights on a matter the ultimate determination of which rested in their discretion, and so .long as exercised honestly, in good faith, with their determination so made, whether wisely or foolishly, the courts cannot interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Two claims of the appellants remain to be noticed. It is urged that the settlement of the Harlem stockholders\u2019 suit by the Central Company, already mentioned, establishes fraud. We think not; though that settlement and the execution of the indemnity bond exacted by the Harlem directors does show that the parties were very fearful of litigation. It was, doubtless, to such timidity that the settlement of the Harlem stockholder, Mr. Hitchcock, was due. It is entirely possible that had the plaintiffs been equally prompt and instituted a suit before the compromise was adopted and executed they might also have secured a settlement of their claim. <em>Second. </em>It is urged that the compromise agreement was in effect a new lease modifying the provision for rent reserved-in the old lease, and that not sufficient in amount of the Central stockholders voted for its adoption to render the agreement valid in law as a lease. We concede that a modification of a lease must be executed with the same formalities and with the same vote as required by statute in the case of an original lease. But we think that, the vote of the Central Company\u2019s stockholders was sufficient. Under chapter 433 of the Laws of 1893, the only requirement is that two-thirds of the stock voted upon at the meeting shall be cast in favor of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">O\u2019Brien, Edward T.
