Because the Authority failed to adequately set forth its reasoning and also departed from precedent without sufficient explanation, we remand the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">The NTEU serves as the exclusive bargaining representative of employees of the U.S. Customs Service (Service or Agency).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the course of negotiations with the Agency over a new collective bargaining agreement in 2001, the NTEU made two proposals to require mid-term bargaining unless the matter at issue was \u201cspecifically addressed\u201d by the terms of the agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Agency refused to bargain over the proposals. It argued that the Union proposals involved a permissive, not mandatory, subject of bargaining under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-7135 (FSLMRS or Statute). The Union then filed a petition for review with the FLRA on December 13, 2001. In a decision and order dated September 25, 2003, the FLRA found the proposals negotiable only at the election of the Agency. <em>Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees Union &amp; U.S. Customs Serv., </em>59 F.L.R.A. 217, 2003 WL 22250526 (2003) (Order). It concluded that the \u201ccovered by\u201d doctrine, which \u2014 in the absence of a collective bargaining agreement between the parties to the contrary \u2014 limits the duty to bargain mid-term to matters not (1) expressly contained or (2) inseparably bound up with subjects covered in the agreement, <em>see U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Serv., Soc. Sec. Admin., Baltimore, MD. &amp; Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, </em>47 F.L.R.A. 1004, 1016-18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>(1993) (SSA), \u201cconstitutes ... a statutory right\u201d and that therefore an agency <em>may, </em>but \u201ccannot be required to,\u201d bargain over a proposal modifying the doctrine. Order, 59 F.L.R.A. at 220. Pursuant to section 7123(a) of the FSLMRS, the Union then petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A2\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">We review orders of the FLRA in accordance with section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(c). Thus, the Authority\u2019s decision will not be set aside unless it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). The Authority is entitled to \u201cconsiderable deference when ... applying the general provisions of the [Statute] to the complexities of federal labor relations.\u201d <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms v. FLRA, </em>464 U.S. 89, 97, 104 S.Ct. 439, 78 L.Ed.2d 195 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). We defer to the FLRA\u2019s interpretation of the FSLMRS if it is \u201creasonable and coherent.\u201d <em>Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees v. FLRA </em>712 F.2d 640, 643 (D.C.Cir.1983). \u201cIf an agency construes its charter erratically or inconsistently, however, little or no deference will be owed to its decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 643 n. 17 (citing <em>Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 275, 287, 98 S.Ct. 566, 54 L.Ed.2d 538 n.5 (1978), and <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944)).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The duty to bargain mid-term derives from the FSLMRS\u2019s command to both labor and management to \u201cmeet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7114(a)(4). Although the text of the FSLMRS imposes no explicit obligation to bargain mid-term, we concluded in <em>Nat\u2019l Treasmy Employees Union v. F.L.R.A., </em>810 F.2d 295 (D.C.Cir.1987), that mid-term bargaining is required under the Statute based on the purpose and legislative history of the Statute as well as analogous private sector precedent. <em>Id. </em>at 298-301.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The FLRA adopted our position, holding that an agency has a duty to bargain over mid-term proposals regarding matters not \u201ccontained in the agreement unless the union has waived its right to bargain about the subject matter involved.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Internal Revenue Serv. &amp; Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees Union, </em>29 F.L.R.A. 162, 166 (1987). The \u201ccontained in\u201d exception to the duty to bargain was borrowed from the private sector. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). The FLRA gradually refined its understanding of the \u201ccontained in\u201d requirement, settling on the \u201ccovered by\u201d test enunciated in <em>SSA: </em>parties are free from any duty to bargain mid-term over matters \u201cexpressly contained in\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cinseparably bound up with\u201d a contract term. 47 F.L.R.A. at 1016-18. This approach was intended to balance the twin aims of the Statute: stability in collective bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>agreements and promotion of collective bargaining to the broadest extent possible. <em>See id. </em>at 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The issue of mid-term bargaining under the FSLMRS reached the United States Supreme Court in <em>Natl Fed\u2019n of Fed. Employees, Local 1309 v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>526 U.S. 86, 119 S.Ct. 1008, 148 L.Ed.2d 171 (1999) (NFFE). There the Court held that \u201cthe Statute delegates to the Federal Labor Relations Authority the legal power to determine whether the parties must engage in mid-term bargaining (or bargaining about that matter).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 119 S.Ct. 1003. It further held that \u201cCongress delegated to the Authority the power to determine \u2014 within appropriate legal bounds \u2014 whether, when, where, and what sort of mid-term bargaining is required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98-99, 119 S.Ct. 1003 (internal citations omitted). On remand from the Supreme Court, the Authority iterated its earlier interpretation that \u201cunder the Statute, agencies are obligated to bargain during the term of a collective bargaining agreement on negotiable union proposals concerning matters that are not \u2018contained in or covered by\u2019 the term agreement, unless the union has waived its right to bargain about the subject matter involved.\u201d <em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Interior &amp; U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia, </em>56 F.L.R.A. 45, 50 (2000) <em>(Interior). </em>Like the instant case, <em>Interior </em>involved a union proposal made during end-term negotiations over a new collective bargaining agreement. The union proposal in <em>Interi- or </em>required mid-term bargaining over all negotiable union proposals \u201cnot covered by the provisions of this agreement.\u201d <em>Interi- or, </em>56 F.L.R.A. at 45. The Authority held the proposal to be a mandatory subject of bargaining because it \u201crestates a statutory obligation\u201d and \u201cis not otherwise inconsistent with federal law or government-wide regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">This ease presents an issue left undecided by the FLRA in <em>Interior: </em>the negotiability of a mid-term bargaining proposal that does more than \u201crestated a statutory obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the Statute, <em>mandatory </em>subjects of bargaining are those that involve \u201cconditions of employment,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(12). \u201cConditions of employment\u201d are broadly defined to include \u201cpersonnel policies, practices, and matters ... affecting working conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 7103(a)(14). The Authority\u2019s approach mirrors that of the private sector. <em>See Gen. Elec. Co. &amp; Int\u2019l Union of Elec. Radio &amp; Mach. Workers, </em>173 N.L.R.B. 253, 257 (1968) (\u201c[P]reliminary matters are just as much part of the process of collective bargaining as the negotiation over wages, hours, etc.\u201d), <em>enfd </em>412 F.2d 512 (2d Cir.1969). <em>See also NLRB v. Borg-Warner Corp., </em>356 U.S. 342, 349, 78 S.Ct. 718, 2 L.Ed.2d 823 (1958) (parties have an \u201cobligation ... to bargain with each other in good faith with respect to \u2018wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment\u2019 \u201d). Either party may bargain to impasse over mandatory topics. <em>Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. &amp; Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees Union, </em>18 F.L.R.A. 768, 771 (1985) <em>(FDIC). </em>Permissive subjects, by contrast, are those over which the parties have no obligation to bargain, either because they do not involve \u201cconditions of employment\u201d or because they involve \u201cproposals that a party negotiate to limit a right granted to it by the Statute.\u201d <em>U.S. Food and Drug Admin. &amp; Am. Fed. Gov\u2019t Employees, </em>53 F.L.R.A. 1269, 1274 (1998). Permissive subjects are not bargained to impasse. <em>FDIC </em>at 771 (\u201cClearly, if parties are not required to bargain over permissive subjects of bargaining, it follows that parties cannot insist on bargaining to impasse with respect to such matters.... \u201d). Because the parties do not dispute that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>mid-term bargaining involves a condition of employment, the question is whether the \u201ccovered by\u201d doctrine embodies a statutory right the agency cannot be required to waive and therefore the Union\u2019s proposals involve only a permissive subject of bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"As\">The Union first argues that, under FLRA precedent, the statutory right to decline mid-term bargaining extends only to matters \u201cresolved\u201d by the collective bargaining agreement and that the \u201ccovered by\u201d test is simply a substitute for the parties\u2019 intent. Under the Union\u2019s theory, the only matters \u201cresolved\u201d by the agreement are the ones intended by the parties to be resolved. Accordingly, a proposal to delineate the scope of the duty to bargain mid-term does not affect the statutory right because it merely clarifies the parties\u2019 intentions. The NTEU relies heavily on <em>U.S. Customs Serv., Customs Mgt. Ct. &amp; NTEU, </em>56 F.L.R.A. 809 (2000) <em>(Customs), </em>in which the Authority held that the parties\u2019 intent is an \u201cintegral component of [the second prong] of the \u2018covered by\u2019 analysis to determine whether the matter sought to be bargained is inseparably bound up with and thus is plainly an aspect of a subject covered by the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814. The Union also cites a 1997 memorandum issued by the FLRA General Counsel declaring that \u201cthe parties may agree that the contract contains the full understanding and obligation of the parties to negotiate over a specific matter during the term of the agreement.\u201d FLRA Office of Gen. Counsel Mem., The Impact of Collective Bargaining Agreements on The Duty to Bargain And The Exercise of Other Statutory Rights, at 16 (March 5, 1997) <em>(reprinted in </em>Appendix to Brief for Petitioner).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Although the Union\u2019s view of FLRA precedent is not unreasonable, we defer to the Authority\u2019s interpretation of its own precedent. The FLRA\u2019s decision in <em>Customs </em>explains that the second prong of the \u201ccovered by\u201d doctrine requires a review of \u201call the record evidence,\u201d of which the parties\u2019 intent is a \u201crequisite component\u201d but not the entire inquiry. <em>Customs, </em>56 F.L.R.A. at 814. In essence, in the FLRA\u2019s view, the \u201ccovered by\u201d test defines the scope of mid-term bargaining in a manner that may be broader or narrower than the parties\u2019 intent. In addition, the General Counsel Memorandum cited by the NTEU merely states that the parties \u201cmay agree\u201d to define the scope of the duty to bargain mid-term, presumably including an agreement to bypass the \u201ccovered by\u201d doctrine; it does not, however, address whether such a proposal would be a mandatory or permissive subject of bargaining. Moreover, the Union offers no statutory text, no FLRA decision and no case law to buttress its claim that the operative language governing the scope of the duty to bargain mid-term covers only \u201cmatters <em>resolved </em>through the[] agreement,\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 26 (emphasis added), as opposed to matters \u201c <em>\u2018covered by </em>\u2019 or <em>\u2018contained in </em>\u2019 a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of the Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base v. FLRA, </em>962 F.2d 48, 53 (D.C.Cir.1992) (emphases added). The \u201ccovered by\u201d doctrine embodies the FLRA\u2019s long-standing interpretation of the scope of the duty to bargain midterm under the Statute; accordingly, the Union\u2019s attempt to redefine that interpretation fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The Union\u2019s second argument\u2014 that even if the \u201ccovered by\u201d test defines the scope of a statutory right, it is not a \u201cunilateral\u201d statutory right, and thus not subject to permissive bargaining only \u2014 has more purchase. Many provisions of the FSLMRS confer benefits and impose obligations in varying degrees on labor and management. <em>See, e.g., </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7111 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>(agency must grant exclusive recognition to elected labor organization); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 7115 (upon request, agency must pay union dues from employee\u2019s paycheck); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 7119 (Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services available to either party); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 7121 (collective bargaining agreement must include grievance procedure). Not all of these provisions constitute \u201cstatutory rights\u201d that must be waived before they are negotiable. For instance, in <em>Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees v. FLRA </em>712 F.2d 640 (D.C.Cir.1983) <em>(AFGE), </em>we held that the scope of a statutorily-defined grievance procedure was a mandatory subject of bargaining notwithstanding the fact that bargaining might displace the \u201cstandard arrangement\u201d set forth in the Statute. <em>Id. </em>at 644. <em>See also U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv. &amp; NTEU, </em>37 F.L.R.A. 1423 (1990) (agency proposal to permit unilateral reassignment of employees a mandatory subject of bargaining despite union\u2019s statutory right to bargain over reassignment decisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">In <em>AFGE </em>we examined the negotiability of proposals that seek to alter the statutory scheme. We noted in particular the difference between provisions that confer \u201cunilateral rights\u201d on one of the parties\u2014 like the rights clauses found at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7102, 7106 and 7114<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 and a provision that \u201cdescribes in neutral terms a clause that must be included in every collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>AFGE, </em>712 F.2d at 646. \u201cAt a minimum,\u201d we found, \u201csection 7106 demonstrates that Congress knew how to write a provision defining permissive subjects of bargaining unambiguously.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe Act securely establishes that all \u2018conditions of employment\u2019 are presumed to be mandatory subjects of bargaining----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649. This statement holds true \u201cunless the Act explicitly or by unambiguous implication vests in a party an unqualified \u2018right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 647 n. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Subsequent decisions by the FLRA have adopted the reasoning of <em>AFGE </em>that limits permissive subjects of bargaining to \u201c \u2018unilateral rights specifically vested in one party.\u2019 \u201d <em>U.S. Food &amp; Drug Admin. &amp; Am. Fed. Gov\u2019t Employees, </em>53 F.L.R.A. 1269, 1275 (1998) (quoting <em>AFGE, </em>712 F.2d at 646) (FDA). <em>See also Am. Fed. of Gov\u2019t Employees, Local 225 &amp; U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Army Armament Research, Dev. and Eng\u2019g Ctr., </em>56 F.L.R.A. 686 (employee performance rating formula falls within statutory management rights under section 7106(a)(2) and therefore a permissive subject of bargaining); <em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric. Food Safety and Inspection Serv. &amp; Nat\u2019l Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, </em>22 F.L.R.A. 586, 592 (1986) (statutory right to file unfair labor practice charge under section 7118 a permissive subject of bargaining). In <em>FDA </em>the FLRA noted that \u201cunilateral rights may be specifically spelled out in the Statute\u201d or \u201crooted in more general statutory and policy consideration [sic].\u201d <em>FDA, </em>53 F.L.R.A. at 1275. In order to remain consistent with <em>AFGE, </em>however, any general statutory or policy consideration giving rise to a unilateral right must be manifested in the Statute by \u201cunambiguous implication.\u201d <em>AFGE, </em>712 F.2d at 647 n. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">The Authority\u2019s decision fails to address this precedent. \u201cIt is well-established in this circuit that where an agency departs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>from its prior eases, it must offer a reasoned explanation for its change in view.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of the Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base v. FLRA, </em>962 F.2d 48, 56 (D.C.Cir.1992). The FLRA ignored FDA\u2019s discussion (which echoed our <em>AFGE </em>holding) of unilateral rights in its treatment of the \u201ccovered by\u201d doctrine. Rather, the Authority merely stated that it had previously \u201cexpressly, and in [its] view correctly, held that the \u2018covered by\u2019 defense constitutes a right under the Statute.\u201d Order, 59 F.L.R.A. at 220 (citing <em>Soc. Sec. Admin. &amp; Am Fed. Gov\u2019t Employees, </em>55 F.L.R.A. 374, 377 (1999) <em>(SSA II)). </em>This approach might have sufficed had <em>SSA II </em>thoroughly addressed the precedent. <em>SSA II, </em>however, was equally conclusory in its discussion of the nature of the \u201ccovered by\u201d doctrine. <em>SSA II </em>involved the scope of the agency\u2019s duty to bargain mid-term under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) ratified by the parties as part of the collective bargaining agreement. The MOU modified the scope of \u201ccovered by\u201d in the context of a mid-term bargaining proposal. <em>Id. </em>at 376. In finding that the agency had waived the full scope of the doctrine, the FLRA, without elaboration, stated that \u201ca statutory right, such as the refusal to bargain based on an affirmative \u2018covered by\u2019 defense pertaining to the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, is subject to waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377. Notwithstanding its use of the phrase \u201cstatutory right,\u201d the Authority\u2019s declaration failed to shed much light on the issue presented here. First, its unsupported reference to the \u201ccovered by\u201d defense as a statutory right was unnecessary to the holding and is therefore dictum. Second, the Authority\u2019s statement did not address whether the \u201ccovered by\u201d defense is a \u201cunilateral right\u201d within the meaning of <em>AFGE </em>and <em>FDA, </em>that is, subject only to permissive bargaining. Third, the Authority was discussing the <em>waiver </em>of a statutory right under a collective bargaining agreement, not the <em>negotiability </em>of a proposal to modify that right. As noted earlier, <em>supra </em>note 4, the waiver inquiry is not relevant in the context of end-term negotiations over a new collective bargaining agreement. Thus, the issue is not whether the Union\u2019s proposals seek a \u201cpartial[] waive[r]\u201d of the \u201ccovered by\u201d doctrine or whether the latter \u201cflows from the Statute,\u201d but instead whether the \u201ccovered by\u201d defense is a unilateral right explicitly or by unambiguous implication conferred by the Statute. <em>See AFGE, </em>712 F.2d at 646-47 <em>&amp; </em>n. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The Authority\u2019s order also fails to explain (or even to discuss) the relationship between the Union proposals at issue and both FLRA and private sector precedent regarding zipper and reopener clauses. A zipper clause is a provision in a collective bargaining agreement that waives the right of either party to raise issues for bargaining during the term of the agreement, whether or not the matter was considered during initial bargaining over the agreement. <em>Internal Revenue Serv. &amp; Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees Union, </em>29 F.L.R.A. 162, 166 (1987). A reopener clause specifies the conditions under which a party may seek to renegotiate a term \u201ccovered by\u201d the agreement. <em>See, e.g., NLRB v. Lion Oil Co., </em>352 U.S. 282, 286, 77 S.Ct. 330, 1 L.Ed.2d 331 (1957) (describing reopener clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The Union argued before the FLRA that its proposals were \u201c \u2018similar to midterm reopener and zipper clause proposals which also allow the parties to determine for themselves what matters can and cannot be negotiated during the life of the parties\u2019 term agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>Order, 59 F.L.R.A. at 219. The FLRA declared the Union\u2019s argument \u201cwithout merit\u201d for two reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 221. First, it character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ized the Union\u2019s argument as premised on the view that the \u201ccovered by\u201d test is a contractual rather than statutory right; a view the Authority simply \u201crejected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But this one-word response fails to explain how the Authority distinguished the Union proposals from a reopener clause. \u25a0 Moreover, as our foregoing discussion of \u201cstatutory rights\u201d should make clear, the issue cannot be so easily disposed of. The dis-positive question is not whether the proposal involves a \u201cstatutory right\u201d but whether that right is \u201cunilateral.\u201d <em>See AFGE, </em>712 F.2d at 646-47 &amp; n. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Second, the FLRA treated its earlier cases discussing the negotiability of reopener clause proposals as \u201cnot dispositive\u201d because \u201cin none of those cases does the record reflect that an agency made the claim, as the Agency does here, that those proposals constituted permissive subjects of bargaining.\u201d Order, 59 F.L.R.A. at 221. The Authority, however, has often ordered an agency to bargain over a reopener proposal. <em>See, e.g., Am. Fed. Gov\u2019t Employees &amp; U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, </em>47 F.L.R.A. 470, 471-73 (1993); <em>Nat'' Ass\u2019n Gov\u2019t Employees &amp; Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., </em>24 F.L.R.A. 147, 148-49 (1986); <em>Am. Fed. Gov\u2019t Employees &amp; Fed. Deposit Ins. Co., </em>21 F.L.R.A. 870, 889-91 (1986). While these decisions do not expressly refer to a reopener provision as a mandatory subject of bargaining, they do involve the agency\u2019s refusal to bargain over a reopener proposal and the resulting issuance of a bargaining order. In <em>Am. Fed. Gov\u2019t Employees &amp; Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>58 F.L.R.A. 341 (2003) <em>(AFGE II), </em>the union proposed a limited reopener clause regarding the implementation of a new computer program. <em>Id. </em>at 342. The agency refused to bargain, claiming that the proposal required the waiver of its statutory management rights under section 7106 of the Statute. <em>Id. </em>This is precisely the argument made by the Agency here, which the Authority treats as a claim that the issue is a permissive subject of bargaining. But in <em>AFGE II, </em>the Authority rejected the argument and ordered the agency to bargain. <em>Id. </em>at 342-43 (agency \u201cfailed to establish\u201d reopener proposal \u201caffect[ed]\u201d its management rights under Statute). <em>Cf. id. </em>at 343 (criticizing majority for failing to acknowledge \u201clong and consistent! ]\u201d precedent that reopener proposal constitutes mandatory bargaining subject) (Member Pope, concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Additionally, although a reopener clause is a mandatory subject of bargaining in the private sector, <em>see McAllister Bros. &amp; Local 333, United Marine Div. Int'l Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n., </em>312 N.L.R.B. 1121, 1129 (1993) (citing cases), the FLRA conceded at oral argument that the implication of its opinion is that a reopener clause would be only a permissive subject in the federal sector. Yet while the FLRA declares that it imported the \u201ccovered by\u201d doctrine from the NLRB, it has failed to justify its departure from the NLRB\u2019s approach to reopener clauses by either identifying \u201cpractical distinctions between private and governmental needs\u201d or offering \u201csome evidence in the language, history, or structure of the statute suggesting that Congress intended a different result.\u201d <em>Am. Fed. Gov\u2019t Employees v. FLRA </em>853 F.2d 986, 992 (D.C.Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The precedent regarding the negotiability of a zipper clause is not as well established as that for the reopener clause. In one of the few cases involving a <em>proposed </em>zipper clause, rather than the implementation of a negotiated zipper clause, the parties seemed to assume that a zipper clause is a permissive subject of bargaining. <em>Am. Fed. Gov\u2019t Employees &amp; Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>44 F.L.R.A. 543, 546 (1992) (\u201cThe Agency conceded before the Arbitrator [with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>spect to zipper clause] that a party may not insist to impasse on a permissive subject of bargaining.\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 548 (according to union the \u201cdisagreement [was over] a permissive subject for bargaining \u2014 the union\u2019s refusal to agree [to] zipper language\u201d). While two members of this court have expressed their opinion that bargaining over a zipper clause may be mandatory, neither the FLRA nor our court has squarely addressed this issue. <em>See FLRA v. Internal Revenue Serv., </em>838 F.2d 567 (D.C.Cir.1988) (Edwards, J. and Silberman, J., concurring in denial of reh\u2019g) (disputing that FLRA precedent established zipper clause as permissive subject of bargaining); <em>See also Interior, </em>56 F.L.R.A. at 54 (declining to address negotiability of zipper clause). In the private sector, the precedent is also not clearly established. Only the Ninth Circuit appears to have decided the question, concluding that the zipper clause is a mandatory subject of bargaining. <em>NLRB v. Tomco Communications, Inc., </em>567 F.2d 871, 879 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The Authority omits any discussion of the relationship between a zipper clause and the Union\u2019s proposals. In some respects, the Union\u2019s proposals are arguably more analogous to zipper clauses than they are to reopeners. While a reopener clause is ordinarily limited to particular contractual provisions and by certain triggering circumstances, a zipper clause, like the Union proposals, alters the scope of the duty to bargain mid-term with respect to virtually all contract terms (or, in the case of the Union proposals, all terms not resolved by the agreement). In <em>Interior, </em>the Authority expressed its intent to wait to determine the negotiability of a zipper clause until the issue is \u201csquarely presented.\u201d <em>Interior, </em>56 F.L.R.A. at 54. While this case may not present the issue as squarely as the Authority might like, its short-shrift dismissal of the Union\u2019s arguments regarding the relationship between its proposals and a zipper clause provides us once again with little basis upon which to uphold the Authority\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we remand the case to the Authority for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-10\">. At the outset of this case, the Customs Service was a part of the United States Department of the Treasury.

At least one circuit took the opposite position, finding no duty under the FSLMRS to bargain mid-term. <em>Soc. Sec. Admin, v.

Whether a matter is \"covered by\u201d the agreement (and therefore exempt from any requirement to bargain mid-term) is analytically distinct from whether a party has \"waived\" its right to bargain mid-term over that matter. <em>See Dep\u2019t of the Navy v. FLRA, </em>962 F.2d 48, 50 (D.C.Cir.1992) (\"A <em>waiver </em>occurs when a union knowingly and voluntarily relinquishes its right to bargain over a matter; but where the matter is <em>covered by </em>a collective bargaining agreement, the union has exercised its bargaining right and the question of waiver is irrelevant.\u201d) (emphasis in original). Here, there is no issue of waiver because the Union made the proposals during end-term bargaining over a new collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b113-6\">. These sections are commonly referred to as the union (\u00a7\u00a7 7102, 7114) and management (\u00a7 7106) rights clauses. Section 7102 sets out the right of employees to participate in a labor organization and engage in collective bargaining, while section 7114 explains the obligations of the union both to its members and to the management group with which it negotiates. Section 7106 details management's authority to, <em>inter alia, </em>make staffing and budget determinations free from bargaining.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
