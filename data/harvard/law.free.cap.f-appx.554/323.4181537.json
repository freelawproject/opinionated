His brief consists almost entirely of legal boilerplate and generalized, conclusory assertions that he meets the relevant standards. He does not explain how he satisfies those standards or include citations to the administrative record. Much of his brief rests on the incorrect assertion that that the immigration judge made an adverse credibility determination which the BIA refused to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-22\">Because Pedroza-Gomez does not dispute the BIA\u2019s dispositive finding that he failed to show persecution on account of membership in a \u201cparticular social group,\u201d <em>see Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 518, 521-22 (5th Cir.2012), or the determination that he failed to establish a likelihood of torture upon his return to Mexico, <em>see Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 345 (5th Cir.2005), we \u201ctreat the issues concerning the merits of his immigration appeal as abandoned.\u201d <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003) (per curiam); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(8)(A) (requiring the appellant to include his \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987) (declining to raise and address legal issues the appellant failed to assert and holding that his \u201crecitation of familiar rules governing our review ..., without even the slightest identification of any error in [the district court\u2019s] legal analysis or its application to [his] suit\u201d was \u201cthe same as if he had not appealed that judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-23\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
