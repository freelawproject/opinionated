Jones, who is subject to a preclusion order in the Southern District of Texas, has filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying her motion seeking \u201creconsideration\u201d of the court\u2019s order denying her motion for leave to file a complaint and to appeal the district court\u2019s subsequent order striking additional motions. Because Jones has failed to present any coherent challenge to the district court\u2019s orders, she has \u201ceffectively abandoned\u201d those claims. <em>Mapes v. Bishop, </em>541 F.3d 582, 584 (5th Cir.2008). Jones has not shown that her appeal \u201cinvolves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citations omitted). Jones\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is denied. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-24\">This court has issued two prior sanction warnings to Jones, warning her that any future frivolous pleadings filed by her in this court or in any court subject to the jurisdiction of this court would subject her to sanctions and instructing Jones to review any pending matters to ensure that they are not frivolous. <em>See Jones v. Greenway Mercedes, </em>534 Fed.Appx. 244 (5th Cir.2013); <em>Jones v. Vouitton, </em>No. 12-20562, 544 Fed.Appx. 460, 460, 2013 WL 5916782, at *1 (5th Cir. May 28, 2013) (unpublished). In the light of Jones\u2019s failure to heed our previous warnings, we conclude that sanctions are appropriate. Jones is ordered to pay $100 to the clerk of this court. Until this sanction is paid in full, Jones is barred from filing, in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction, any pleading without first seeking and obtaining leave of the forum court. Jones is warned that future frivolous filings will invite the imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>progressively more severe sanctions, which may include dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on her ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. Jones should review any pending matters and move to dismiss any that are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; MOTION DENIED; SANCTION IMPOSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
