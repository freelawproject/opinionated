The presentence investigation report (PSI) applied the 1998 Sentencing Guidelines Manual to assign Frazier a base offense level of 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. After a four-level increase for being an organizer of the crime, and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Frazier\u2019s total offense level was 39.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on an offense level of 39 and a criminal history category of VI, Frazier\u2019s guideline range was 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment \u2014 the district court sentenced him to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-16\">In Frazier\u2019s instant motion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he argues that pursuant to the 2011 amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines his offense level should be 35, which combined with a criminal history category of VI yields a range of 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court denied Frazier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. On appeal, we noted that while the district court was not required to discuss each of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors individually, \u201cit was required to provide <em>some </em>explanation as to why it denied Frazier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>502 Fed.Appx. 863, 866 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (emphasis in original). We also pointed to cases that \u201cprovided some detail, however minute, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>to what was considered\u201d by the district court when denying a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and concluded that the district court\u2019s language was \u201cinsufficient to demonstrate that [it] properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d vacating the district court\u2019s order and remanding for further proceedings consistent with our opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 866-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">On remand, the district court noted at a sentencing hearing that Frazier\u2019s offense, under the current Guidelines, would lead to a lower sentencing range, but that the new guideline range would still encompass his original 360-month sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court stated that Frazier\u2019s history while incarcerated, the need to promote respect for the law, the need to provide adequate deterrence, and Frazier\u2019s history and circumstances all counseled against a discretionary reduction in sentence. Accordingly, the district court denied Frazier\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">On appeal, Frazier argues that the district court violated our instructions on remand by simply explaining its original decision as opposed to reanalyzing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Frazier also argues that the district court abused its discretion by not reducing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">We review compliance with our mandate from a previous appeal de novo. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 829 (11th Cir.2007). When acting under a mandate from this Court, the district court \u201ccannot vary it, or examine it for any other purpose than execution; or give any other or further relief; or review it, even for apparent error, upon a matter decided on appeal; or intermeddle with it, further than to settle so much as has been remanded.\u201d <em>United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cA district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)). A district court has discretion to reduce the imprisonment term if a defendant\u2019s sentence is based on a sentencing range that was later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">A district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence by \u201csubstituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780. In other words, \u201cthe court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). Second, the district court must decide whether, in its discretion and in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, to retain the original sentence or to resentence the defendant under the amended guideline range. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781; <em>see United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cThe grant of authority to the district court to reduce a term of im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>prisonment [under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] is unambiguously discretionary.\u201d)- The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense, history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to adequately deter criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A)-(B). The district court may also consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct in deciding whether to grant a reduction. U.S.S.G. 1B1.10, cmt. l(B)(iii); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). \u201cThe district court is not required to articulate the applicability of each factor, as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256 (internal quotations marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010(FSA) reduced the statutory penalties for crack cocaine offenses, eliminated the statutory mandatory minimum sentences for simple possession of crack cocaine, and directed the Sentencing Commission to amend the Guidelines for certain drug offenses. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). Amendment 750, which went into effect on November 1, 2011, made permanent a previous change to the drug quantity guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, to reflect the changes of the FSA. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 750 (2011). The FSA\u2019s lower mandatory minimum sentences do not apply retroactively to defendants sentenced before the FSA\u2019s enactment. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Upon review, Frazier\u2019s arguments regarding the district court\u2019s interpretation of the mandate lack merit. In remanding the district court\u2019s order, we held that the district court\u2019s denial of Frazier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion did not analyze the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and did not provide an explanation of its decision sufficient for appellate review. <em>Frazier, </em>502 Fed.Appx. at 866-67. Thus, we vacated the judgment denying the 2011 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>On remand, the district court held a hearing, considered the parties\u2019 arguments and evidence, and issued a new decision that analyzed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in detail. It therefore complied with our mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">Although we vacated the district court\u2019s judgment, we did not disapprove of the result or require a different analysis of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that the district court may have engaged in before but had not adequately explained. We only required the district court to provide an analysis of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and it did so. Finally, although the district court stated its understanding that our mandate required it only to articulate its analysis as opposed to reevaluate its decision, it also afforded Frazier and the government the opportunity to present argument on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court posed questions to the parties, responded to their arguments, and expressly stated that it considered the parties\u2019 statements. Thus, the district court clearly complied with our mandate to \u201cprovide <em>some </em>explanation\u201d for its denial of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion so as to show that it \u201cproperly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Further, the district court did not commit an error of law in declining to grant a sentence reduction. To the extent that the FSA introduced a new guideline range, those changes were taken into account at step one of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) analysis. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. The FSA is not a \u00a7 3553(a) factor, and Frazier cites no authority indicating that an intervening statutory change must be considered as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>mitigating in reference to the \u00a7 3558(a)(2)(A) factor requiring a sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense. The district court\u2019s comment that the \u201cnature\u201d of Frazier\u2019s offense had not changed was not an error of law but rather an accurate statement that Frazier\u2019s offense \u2014 not the crime of which he was convicted but his actual offense, as he committed it \u2014 remained the same, regardless of any intervening statutory changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">The district court\u2019s denial of Frazier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was not an abuse of discretion in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Indeed, we have explicitly rejected the suggestion that a district court must reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where a retroactive amendment lowers his applicable guidelines ranges. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760. Here, Frazier\u2019s six infractions while incarcerated went to his history and characteristics, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by determining that they militated against a sentence reduction. <em>See Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256 (permitting the consideration of post-sentencing conduct). The district court was also within its discretion to decide that the nature and number of the infractions, which included possession of narcotics and refusal to obey orders, showed disrespect for the law and a continued need for deterrence. Thus, contrary to Frazier\u2019s assertion, the district court did not base its decision on the sole sentencing factor of Frazier\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, but rather explained how Frazier\u2019s post-sentencing conduct affected several \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court also stated that it considered Frazier\u2019s arguments. <em>See id., </em>557 F.3d at 1256-57 (explaining that the district coui\u2019t need only demonstrate that the pertinent factors were considered); <em>see also United States v. Parrado, </em>911 F.2d 1567, 1572-73 (11th Cir.1990) (concluding that although a sentencing court should tailor its comments to show that the sentence is appropriate given the \u00a7 3553 factors, \u201c[t]his does not mean that a sentencing court must incant the specific language used in the guidelines\u2019 which applies to each reason given, nor does it mean that a court must state that a particular factor is not applicable in a particular case.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, Frazier\u2019s arguments regarding his family\u2019s support and his accomplishments while in prison are arguments about how the district court weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and do not establish an abuse of discretion. The record demonstrates that the district court took the pertinent sentencing factors into account, and Frazier has not established that the district court\u2019s decision to maintain his 360-month sentence, which was within his amended guideline range, constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-11\">. Frazier was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, but because the adjusted offense level was greater than it would be under the career offender guidelines, the PSI utilized the adjusted offense level of 42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b867-12\">. Frazier filed his first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in 2008, arguing that after Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines his total offense level should be 37 and his sentence should be adjusted to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court denied his motion because, based on an offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI, Frazier's amended guideline range remained 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b868-8\">. Indeed, we recognized that Frazier is eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 750 lowered his applicable sentencing guidelines range from 360 months of imprisonment to life imprisonment to 262 to 367 months of imprisonment. <em>Frazier, </em>502 Fed.Appx. at 866.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
