Gay, Jr., Assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, San Antonio, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-17\">Donald Paxson, Fort Worth, TX, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b325-19\">Before HIGGINBOTHAM, DENNIS, and GRAVES, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b325-20\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b325-21\">Donald Paxson, federal prisoner # 82915-180, pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography and receipt of child pornography, and the district court imposed concurrent sentences of 70 months in prison, to be followed by 35 years of supervised release. He now moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition seeking sentencing credit for the 33 months he spent in home confinement during pretrial release.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-23\">Paxson\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-24\">Paxson argues that the district court erred (1) in construing his motion, in part, as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and (2) in failing to use its powers to provide redress for the unconstitutional restraint on his liberty during his home confinement. Pax-son has not adequately addressed the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his petition. By failing to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, Paxson has abandoned any challenge he might have raised regarding the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-25\">Accordingly, Paxson\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. The IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-26\">Paxson\u2019s repetitive attempts to obtain relief under different provisions demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>strate a disregard for the strain on judicial resources caused by his motions and appeals. He is hereby warned that any future frivolous or repetitive filings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will invite sanctions, including monetary penalties and limits on his access to federal court. We hereby instruct Pax-son to review all pending matters to ensure that they are not frivolous or repetitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL, DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
