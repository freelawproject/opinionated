As a result of his conduct at the Wells Fargo in April 2011, Durham pled guilty to one count of attempted armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d), and 2; and one count of using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) and 2. Durham then went to trial on his charges related to the Weeyums robbery, and a jury convicted him of one count of conspiracy to commit robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a); one count of robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a) and 2; and one count of using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(e)(l)(A)(iii) and 2. On appeal, Durham raises three issues, which we address in turn. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">I. ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Durham contends that evidence of his conviction for the attempted robbery of the Wells Fargo Bank should have been excluded from his trial for the Weeyums robbery. The district court, however, did not abuse its discretion by admitting the evidence. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>913 F.2d 1552, 1556 (1 1th Cir.1990) (\u201cA trial court is afforded broad discretion in deciding the admissibility of extrinsic act evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).\u201d). Evidence of Durham\u2019s conviction for the attempted robbery of the Wells Fargo Bank was admitted pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), which allows for the introduction of evidence of \u201canother crime, wrong, or act\u201d for a purpose apart from establishing the defendant\u2019s criminal propensity. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>668 F.3d 1298, 1314 (11th Cir.2012); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). We employ a three part test in considering the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence. <em>See Sanders, </em>668 F.3d at 1314. Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-12\">Rule 404(b) evidence (1) must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character, (2) there must be sufficient proof to allow a jury to find that the defendant committed the extrinsic act, and (3) the evidence must possess probative value that is not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice, and the evidence must meet the other requirements of [Federal Rule of Evidence] 403.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-13\"><em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">In this case, evidence of Durham\u2019s conviction for the attempted robbery of the Wells Fargo Bank was used to establish his intent to commit the Weeyums robbery, and both offenses required the same mental state. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number><em>Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1345 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cWhere the extrinsic offense is offered to prove intent, its relevance is determined by comparing the defendant\u2019s state of mind in perpetrating both the extrinsic and charged offenses. Thus, where the state of mind required for the charged and extrinsic offenses is the same, the first prong of the Rule 404(b) test is satisfied.\u201d (citation omitted)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Durham maintains the intent required for the two robberies was different because he engaged in different activities during each offense, \u201c[a] prior crime need not be factually identical in order for it to be probative.\u201d <em>United States v. Sterling, </em>738 F.3d 228, 238 (11th Cir.2013). Both attempted armed bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a) and robbery under \u00a7 1951(a) require that the defendant have intended to take another person\u2019s property through force or violence. <em>Compare </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), <em>and </em>11th Cir. Pattern Jury Instructions, Crim. Instructions \u00a7 76.3, <em>with </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a), (b)(1), <em>and </em>11th Cir. Pattern Jury Instructions, Crim. Instructions \u00a7 70.3. As both crimes require the same mental state, the first prong of the Rule 404(b) test is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Regarding the third prong of the test,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the probative value of Durham\u2019s prior conviction was not substantially outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice. <em>See Sanders, </em>668 F.3d at 1314. By pleading not-guilty to the Weeyums robbery, Durham placed his intent at issue. <em>Edouard, </em>485 F.3d at 1345. Furthermore, the crimes were temporally proximate, as they occurred within approximately five months of each other, <em>see id. </em>at 1345-46, and any unfair prejudice was mitigated by the district court\u2019s repeated instructions to the jury that evidence of Durham\u2019s prior conviction could be used only for the limited purpose of establishing his intent to commit the Weeyums robbery, <em>see id. </em>at 1346; <em>United States v. Diaz-Lizaraza, </em>981 F.2d 1216, 1225 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201c[A]ny unfair prejudice possibly caused by [the introduction of Rule 404(b) evidence] was mitigated by the trial judge\u2019s limiting instructions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">II. ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">Durham next argues the district court erred by denying his Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal and that insufficient evidence supported his conviction because the Government failed to prove he was the individual who robbed the Weeyums. <em>See United States v. Gamory, </em>635 F.3d 480, 497 (11th Cir.2011). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and drawing all inferences and credibility determinations in the Government\u2019s favor, sufficient evidence established Durham committed the Weeyums robbery. Cell phone records introduced at trial established that Durham\u2019s and his eo-defendant\u2019s cell phones were located near the restaurant around the time of the robbery, the victim identified Durham as the robber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>from a photo lineup, and a witness testified that Durham admitted he robbed the Wee-yums. On this record, a reasonable jury could have found Durham guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">III. ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Finally, Durham asserts his 608-month total sentence was substantively unreasonable because the 420-month mandatory minimum consecutive sentences he received for his two \u00a7 924(c) firearms offenses, in conjunction with the 188-month guidelines sentences, were unduly harsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Specifically, Durham received concurrent sentences of 188 months imprisonment for his convictions for attempted armed robbery of the Wells Fargo, conspiracy to commit the Weeyums robbery, and substantive robbery of the Weeyums. He also received a consecutive mandatory minimum 120-month sentence for his firearm offense arising from the attempted robbery of the Wells Fargo and another consecutive mandatory minimum sentence of 300 months imprisonment for his firearm offense arising from the Weeyums robbery, yielding a total 608-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing Durham\u2019s 608-month sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The court correctly calculated Durham\u2019s guidelines range and imposed a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). As the district court found, Durham\u2019s total sentence was warranted in order to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment, to afford adequate deterrence, and to protect the public. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court, moreover, did not commit a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and Durham\u2019s sentence lies well within the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of his case. <em>See United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">Although Durham contends the mandatory minimum sentences he received were unduly harsh and negated the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court is \u201cbound by statutes designating mandatory minimum sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1362 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[The Supreme Court\u2019s] instruction to district courts to consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) in fashioning a reasonable sentence cannot be read to authorize using the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to impose a sentence below an applicable statutory mandatory minimum.\u201d). The district court was not free to vary below the statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums, and it did not err by imposing a sentence at the low end of Durham\u2019s advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-6\">. It is immaterial that the attempted bank robbery took place subsequent to the Wee-yums robbery. We have held that \"the standard for evaluating the admissibility of a subsequent bad act under Rule 404(b) is identical to that for determining whether a prior bad act should be admitted under this Rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b927-7\">. Durham does not raise any argument in his initial brief regarding the second prong of the Rule 404(b) test, and the issue is therefore abandoned. <em>See United States v. McKinley, </em>732 F.3d 1291, 1298 n. 4 (11th Cir.2013). Regardless, the Government introduced certified copies of Durham\u2019s convictions in the Wells Fargo Bank robbery case. <em>See United States v. Lamons, </em>532 F.3d 1251, 1266 (11th Cir.2008) (\"It is elementary that a conviction is sufficient proof that the defendant committed the prior act.\u201d (quotation and alterations omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
