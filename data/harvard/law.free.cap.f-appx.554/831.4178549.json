The indictment charged appellants with multiple offenses, including, in Count 1, violating 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70506(b) by conspiring to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States in violation of 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70503(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants pled guilty to that count pursuant to a plea agreement containing an appeal waiver, and, on December 28, 2011, the District Court sentenced them to prison for a term of 46 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-29\">In February 2013, appellants severally moved the District Court, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(a) or, alternatively, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, to dismiss the indictment based on our decision in <em>United States v. Bellaizac-Hurtado, </em>700 F.3d 1245 (11th Cir.2012), which, they asserted, held the MDLEA unconstitutional as applied to the facts of their case. The Government responded with a statement that the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the motions because appellants\u2019 cases were no longer pending. The court agreed and dismissed their motions. They now appeal <em>pro se, </em>asking this court to issue a writ of mandamus compelling the District Court to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>sider their motions to dismiss on the merits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">A motion, filed under Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3), alleging a defect in the indictment generally must be filed prior to trial, although, while the case is pending, the court may consider a claim that the indictment fails to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction or allege an offense. <em>Id. </em>This case was no longer pending when appellants submitted their motions to dismiss to the District Court; hence, the court lacked jurisdiction to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The appropriate vehicle for appellants\u2019 attack on their convictions is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Their briefs concede, however, that a \u00a7 2255 motion would be time-barred and do not identify any other jurisdictional basis upon which the District Court could have considered their motions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court\u2019s rulings are, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-22\">. Section 70503 <em>et seq., </em>referred to as the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA), prohibits possessing with intent to distribute a controlled substance aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Appellants were arrested aboard a fishing vessel containing 57 bales of cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b856-16\">. Appellants present arguments in their reply briefs, but failed to raise them in their initial briefs. We do not consider them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
