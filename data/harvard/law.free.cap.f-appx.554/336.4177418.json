The precise nature of the alleged violation is unclear, but it seems that Mendonca is unhappy with a state appellate court\u2019s decisions and with a monetary fine imposed as a sanction for abusing his <em>in forma pauperis </em>status. In addition, he objects to the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s denial of his writs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After examining these contentions, the federal district court found no jurisdiction over the case and dismissed the claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). Mendonca filed timely appeal. We review 12(b)(1) dismissals <em>de novo. Union Planters Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Salih, </em>369 F.3d 457, 460 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-18\">The jurisdiction of the federal courts is established by the Constitution and by federal statute. <em>Weekly v. Morrow, </em>204 F.3d 613, 615 (5th Cir.2000). Federal district courts \u201clack appellate jurisdiction to review, modify, or nullify final orders of state courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(referring to <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983)) (other citations omitted). Parties may not obtain federal review of state decisions merely by recasting an appeal as a civil rights claim. <em>Liedtke v. State Bar of Tex., </em>18 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.1994). Our review of the record confirms that this ostensible \u00a7 1983 <em>claim </em>\u2014 i.e., that various state judges violated Mendonca\u2019s rights by dismissing his claims and imposing sanctions \u2014 is simply an appeal of state court decisions. To the extent that Mendonca raises any new issues related to the state court litigation, those contentions are inextricably intertwined with the state court judgments. The federal district courts have no jurisdiction to consider such arguments. <em>Liedtke, </em>18 F.3d at 318. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the dismissal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
