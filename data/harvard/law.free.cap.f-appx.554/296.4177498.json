In this appeal, she challenges the district court\u2019s denial of her request to have her federal sentence run concurrently to the state sentence she is now serving. Because Nash\u2019s request challenges the execution of her sentence, it is best classed as arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 900 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also Jones v. Joslin, </em>635 F.3d 673, 674 (5th Cir.2011); <em>Hunter v. Tamez, </em>622 F.3d 427, 428 (5th Cir.2010). When considering a ruling on a \u00a7 2241 petition, we conduct a de novo review of the district court\u2019s legal conclusions and examine its factual findings for clear error. <em>Royal v. Tombone, </em>141 F.3d 596, 599 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">District courts have discretion to decide whether to impose a federal sentence to run consecutively or concurrently to an anticipated state sentence. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1217 (5th Cir.1991), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Setser v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1463, 1466-73, 182 L.Ed.2d 455 (2012). The district court did not err by denying Nash\u2019s request for concurrent sentences. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, and Nash\u2019s request for appointed counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
