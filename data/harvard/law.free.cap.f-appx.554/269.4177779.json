Avdeef, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s granting of motions to dismiss in favor of the appellees and denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-17\">In 2008, Avdeef (along with two other plaintiffs) filed a lawsuit in federal district court in his individual capacity and as next friend of his minor daughter, A.A., against three of the appellees: Rockline Industries, Inc. (\u201cRockline\u201d), Sam\u2019s East, Inc., d/b/a Sam\u2019s Club (\u201cSam\u2019s Club\u201d), and Wal-Mart Stores Texas, LLC.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The claims arose from the purchase of baby wipes from Sam\u2019s Club; the plaintiffs contended that the wipes were contaminated with <em>B. Cepacia </em>bacteria, and that their use had led to the plaintiffs and A.A. becoming \u201cincreasingly ill, suffering cold and flu-like symptoms, urinary tract infections, severe upper respiratory infections, and digestive illnesses.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court concluded that since the plaintiffs were proceeding <em>pro se, </em>they had no standing to bring any claims on A.A.\u2019s behalf and dismissed those claims without prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As to the other plaintiffs, the district court granted the defendants summary judgment on all claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, in <em>Avdeef v. Rockline Industries, Inc. (Avdeef I),</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we affirmed the district court because the defendants had offered evidence the wipes were <em>not </em>contaminated and evidence that the wipes the plaintiffs were complaining of were not included in a recall by the manufacturer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-18\">Subsequently, in 2012, Avdeef brought a Texas state court action against one of the other appellees, Patrick W. Powers, his former attorney in <em>Avdeef I.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Avdeef con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>tended that Powers violated the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct and the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code \u00a7 41.001 <em>et seq. </em>and was thus entitled to recover exemplary damages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court granted Powers\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the Texas court of appeals affirmed in <em>Avdeef v. Powers (Avdeef II) </em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Next, Avdeef brought the present lawsuit against several defendants. As relevant to this appeal, the following defendants were named in the complaint: First, the original defendants from <em>Avdeef I, </em>Rockline, Sam\u2019s Club, and Walmart. Second, Alan Perlman, Rockline\u2019s former Technical Director. Third, Gary D. Elli-ston, Pamela J. Williams, and Courtney G. Bowline, who represented the <em>Avdeef I </em>defendants (\u201cthe DeHay defendants\u201d). Fourth, Powers and Peyton J. Healey, who represented Powers in <em>Avdeef II. </em>The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and denied Avdeef s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Upon careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we find no error in the district court\u2019s granting of motions to dismiss and denial of the motion for reconsideration. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Similarly, upon review of the pending motions for damages under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38, we deny these motions. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">IT IS ORDERED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">IT IS ORDERED that the opposed motion of appellees Courtney Gene Bowline, Gary Dale Elliston and Pamela Jean Neale Williams for damages under Rule 38 is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the opposed motion of appellees Peyton Jame-son Healey and Patrick William Powers for damages under Rule 38 is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
