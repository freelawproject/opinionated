He first contends that the BIA and IJ erred in admitting an uncertified criminal judgment to find that his prior conviction was an aggravated felony for purposes of determining whether he was removable. It is undisputed that this document did not meet the authentication requirements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(B) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.41(a). However, Morka has not demonstrated that these requirements are mandatory or exclusive. He has also not demonstrated that this document, which was printed from a website maintained by the federal Judiciary and accompanied by testimony from the officer who obtained it, rendered the hearing fundamentally unfair. <em>See Bustos-Torres v. INS, </em>898 F.2d 1053, 1055 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-23\">Because Morka is removable for having committed an aggravated felony, we lack jurisdiction to review the final order of removal and retain jurisdiction only to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>view constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1252(a)(2)(C), (D). Morka contends that the IJ improperly denied his motion to change venue because he had erroneously labeled the motion as unopposed. However, we lack jurisdiction to consider whether the IJ abused its discretion by denying the motion to change venue. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Ogunfuye v. Holder, </em>610 F.3d 303, 306 n. 4 (5th Cir.2010). He contends further that the IJ deprived him of his rights to counsel and due process by denying his motion because he had counsel willing to represent him in another venue and was forced to proceed pro se. Morka had no Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>See Ogbemudia v. INS, </em>988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir.1993). The IJ granted Morka two continuances to obtain counsel. Accordingly, the proceedings were not fundamentally unfair in violation of due process under the Fifth Amendment. <em>See id. </em>at 598-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Morka frames his challenge to the denial of CAT relief as whether the BIA and IJ applied the correct legal standards to evaluate his eligibility for CAT relief. His arguments, however, challenge the BIA and IJ\u2019s factual and credibility determinations regarding whether he would be tortured if he was removed to Nigeria. An alien cannot cloak his arguments in constitutional garb to avoid the jurisdiction-stripping provision of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). <em>Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 801 (5th Cir.2006). Morka\u2019s challenges to the BIA and IJ\u2019s weighing and consideration of the evidence do not raise constitutional or legal issues regarding the denial of CAT relief. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to consider Morka\u2019s challenge to the denial of CAT relief. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Last, Morka contends that his rights to due process and equal protection were violated because he was not advised of his right to contact the Nigerian Consulate as guaranteed by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Assuming, arguendo, that Morka\u2019s right under the Vienna Convention is protected by due process, Morka \u201chas not shown that he suffered prejudice due to the IJ\u2019s failure to inform him of his right to contact the [Nigerian Consulate.\u201d <em>Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 737 (5th Cir.2005). Morka did not present his equal protection claim to the BIA. His failure to exhaust this claim before the BIA is a jurisdictional bar to our review of the issue. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 319 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Morka\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED in part for lack of jurisdiction and DENIED in part. Morka\u2019s incorporated motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
