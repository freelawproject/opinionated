He also pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft, for which he received a consecutive 24-month prison term. Lawrence now challenges the 51-month sentence he received on his conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-21\">As part of his plea agreement, Lawrence waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence. We enforce such waivers when knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). To the extent Lawrence is claiming that he was misadvised about the waiver at the re-arraignment hearing, he has failed to include the hearing transcript as part of the record on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. Pro. 10. More importantly, he has wholly failed to raise any issue about the validity of his appeal waiver, 414 F.3d at 544, or brief any challenges to it despite acknowledging the existence of the waiver and receiving the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss based upon the waiver (to which no response was filed). Accordingly, we conclude any such challenge is waived. <em>United States v. Reagan, </em>596 F.3d 251, 254 (5th Cir.2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We GRANT the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-22\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
