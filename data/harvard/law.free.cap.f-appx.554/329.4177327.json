Baker challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized from his residence and challenges the district court\u2019s admission of exhibits consisting of utility bills and bank statements found at the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The district court did not err in determining that the information set forth in the affidavit supporting the application for a search warrant was not stale. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>625 F.3d 830, 842-43 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Craig, </em>861 F.2d 818, 822-23 (5th Cir.1988). Baker has not demonstrated plain error with respect to his argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that an attachment describing the items to be searched for and seized was not attached to the search warrant, rendering the warrant constitutionally deficient. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 448 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 361 (5th Cir.2010). Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in overruling Baker\u2019s objection to the admission of the exhibits. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>530 F.3d 348, 351 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Arrington, </em>618 F.2d 1119, 1126 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion 'should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
