He now seeks to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that he never received notice of his deportation hearing and thus the underlying deportation order was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-23\">We review the denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment and the underlying constitutional claims de novo. <em>See United States v. Villanueva-Diaz, </em>634 F.3d 844, 848 (5th Cir.2011). An alien prosecuted for illegal reentry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 may collaterally attack the underlying removal order. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, </em>481 U.S. 828, 838-39, 107 S.Ct. 2148, 95 L.Ed.2d 772 (1987). To succeed, he would need to establish that (1) the removal hearing was fundamentally unfair, (2) the proceeding improperly deprived him of the opportunity for judicial review, (3) the procedural deficiencies caused him actual prejudice, and (4) he exhausted any administrative remedies that were avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>able to challenge the order. <em>United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>318 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir.2002); \u00a7 1326(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">As noted by the district court, Serrano-Vera could have filed a motion to reopen the deportation proceedings, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C), the current rule, or 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(B), the identically phrased 1994 rule. However, during the 15-year period from the date of his original order of removal until his arrest in the instant proceeding, Serrano-Vera failed to do so \u2014 despite the fact that, from 2004 through 2010, he was removed from the United States via reinstatement of the original order of removal on five separate occasions. Serrano-Vera therefore has failed to establish that he exhausted his administrative remedies. In addition, Serrano-Vera did not show that there was a reasonable likelihood that but for the errors complained of he would not have been deported. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Mata, </em>322 F.3d 829, 832 (5th Cir.2003). He does not say what evidence or arguments might have been made to counter the basis of his deportation, nor does he provide any authority, statutory or case-law, suggesting that he was eligible for relief from deportation. Nor does he identify what that relief would have been. Accordingly, Serrano-Vera failed to show that the alleged procedural deficiencies actually prejudiced him. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Because Serrano-Vera failed to satisfy the requirements to collaterally challenge his deportation proceedings, his original order of removal order may permissibly serve as a basis for his conviction under \u00a7 1326. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Vasquez, </em>227 F.3d 476, 485 (5th Cir.2000). Thus, the district court did not err in denying Serrano-Vera\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. <em>See id. </em>at 485-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
