On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in applying the enhanced base offense level provided in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) for recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person after determining that Guzman endangered the lives of 3 aliens by attempting to transport them on a jet ski, which had a range of 86 miles, on a 90-mile trip from Cuba to the United States. He contends that his conduct did not create a risk of death or serious bodily injury to his passengers because the jet ski had a four-person capacity and, thus, was not overloaded. He further argues that each passenger had a life vest, and that jet skis are designed to operate in the ocean.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-23\">For sentencing guideline calculation issues, we review purely legal questions <em>de novo </em>and the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1136-37 (11th Cir.2004). We usually review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts with due deference. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-24\">The enhancement under \u00a7 2L 1.1 (b)(6) applies when an alien-smuggling offense involves \u201cintentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>bodily injury to another person.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6). Application Note 5 for this provision indicates that the enhancement is applicable to a wide variety of reckless conduct, including, for example, carrying substantially more passengers than the rated capacity for a vessel or harboring people in dangerous conditions. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1, comment, (n.5). We have upheld the enhancement where a defendant smuggled 11 aliens from the Bahamas to Florida on a boat where they were held in cramped conditions with only 3 life vests available. <em>United States v. Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d 1214, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2010). We noted that the conditions were \u201cundeniably dangerous and inhumane,\u201d and that the passengers would have faced serious injury or death if the boat had capsized. <em>Id. </em>In another case, we upheld the enhancement where the defendant had 36 people aboard a boat designed to hold 12, and where there were no life vests available. <em>United States v. De La Cruz Suarez, </em>601 F.3d 1202, 1220 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The district court correctly applied the enhanced base offense level under \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) because Guzman could not make the trip from Cuba to the United States without risking running out of fuel, and even if he had been able to refuel the jet ski in open ocean waters, his plan to do so was dangerous. He further risked the lives of his passengers by bringing extra fuel aboard the jet ski and by attempting the trip at night without any external lights, signals, or communications equipment that he could use to summon help when the watercraft became distressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Upon consideration of the entire record on appeal, and after review of the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
