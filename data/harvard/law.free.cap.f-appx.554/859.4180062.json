On appeal, Parada-Tala-mantes argues that the district court erred by imposing a three-level enhancement for being a manager or supervisor of more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>than five participants, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">A. Section 3Bl.l(b) Role Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), the three-level managerial role enhancement applies if (1) the defendant was a manager or supervisor, but not an organizer or leader; and (2) the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). To qualify for the enhancement, the defendant need only manage or supervise one other participant in the criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">At sentencing, Parada-Talamantes objected to the application of \u00a7 3Bl.l(a)\u2019s four-level leadership-role enhancement, arguing that he was not a leader or organizer. The district court sustained that objection and instead applied the three-level enhancement in \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) because Para-da-Talamantes was a supervisor or manager. Parada-Talamantes never objected to the three-level enhancement. Thus, our review of the issue on appeal is for plain error. <em>See United States v. McNair, </em>605 F.3d 1152, 1222 (11th Cir.2010); Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b). Here, as explained below, Parada-Talamantes has not shown error, much less plain error, in applying the three-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">B. Defendant Parada-Talamantes\u2019s Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">First, there is no merit to Parada-Tala-mantes\u2019s contention that the district court did not make adequate findings of fact to support the enhancement. The district court explicitly found that Parada-Tala-manets \u201cwas the manager ... that handled all of the arrangements.\u201d The district court had no duty to make further specific subsidiary factual findings so long as the ultimate conclusion as to the defendant\u2019s role is supported by the record. <em>See United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939-40 (11th Cir.1999) (involving a minor-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">Second, the district court\u2019s decision to impose the three-level enhancement was supported by the record. Specifically, undisputed facts in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) established that Defendant Parada-Talamantes and his co-defendant, Luis Alonso Delarca-Munguia, were sources of cocaine for a family-run drug trafficking organization involving Gabino Ortiz, Sr. and his two sons. In post-arrest statements, all three Ortiz men said that Defendant Parada-Tala-mantes and Delarca-Munguia were a source of supply for them and that the defendants made multiple deliveries of cocaine and/or marijuana. In his post-arrest statement, Delarca-Munguia said, among other things, that Defendant Para-da-Talamantes recruited him to help deliver cocaine to the Ortizes and, when Ortiz refused a cocaine delivery for poor quality, Defendant Parada-Talamantes directed him to find another buyer, which he did. <em>See United States v. Wade, 458 </em>F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that a defendant\u2019s failure to object to a factual allegation in the PSI constitutes an admission for sentencing purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">In addition to these undisputed PSI facts, sentencing testimony showed that Defendant Parada-Talamantes supplied cocaine to the Ortiz family\u2019s drug trafficking organization, which then gave distribution-level quantities to multiple individuals. Defendant Parada-Talamantes contacted Ortiz, Sr. to arrange cocaine deliveries and met with Ortiz, Sr. to accept payment for the delivered cocaine. Another individual, Jamie Rodriguez, was Defendant Parada-Talamantes\u2019s source <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>for cocaine and, after the transactions were completed, Defendant Parada-Tala-mantes gave the proceeds to Rodriguez. Codefendant Delarca-Munguia told investigators that Defendant Parada-Tala-mantes recruited him into the cocaine distribution conspiracy and instructed him to retrieve a shipment of low-quality cocaine from the Ortizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Although Parada-Talamantes contends that the facts of his recruitment and deci-sionmaking were disputed, the testimony at the sentencing hearing established that he recruited Delarca-Munguia and that he arranged for the sale of drugs to the Or-tizes. Resolving factual disputes, the district court found that Parada-Talamantes handled all the arrangements of the drug transactions and concluded that the \u00a7 3B 1.1(b) enhancement was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Moreover, the facts are sufficient to support the managerial-role enhancement. Defendant Parada-Talamantes recruited and directed his codefendant Delarca-Munguia, which is generally sufficient to show the defendant is a manager. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 2; <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1251 (11th Cir.2000) (stating that \u201cthe assertion of control or influence over only one individual\u201d is sufficient to support a role enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1). In addition, Defendant Parada-Talamantes arranged the drug transactions and negotiated the sales with the Ortizes. <em>See United States v. Perry, </em>340 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2003) (upholding a \u00a7 3B1.1 role enhancement where, among other things, the defendant recruited two others to transport drugs and then arranged for one of those individuals to transport cocaine). Given .that Defendant Parada-Talamantes exerted some influence and authority over De-larca-Munguia, he was more than a mere middleman between Rodriguez and the Ortizes. <em>See United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, 1304 (11th Cir.2006) (upholding a \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement where the defendant recruited and instructed cocon-spirators). The mere fact that Defendant Parada-Talamantes was subordinate to Rodriguez did not render Parada-Tala-mantes ineligible for the \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) enhancement. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>933 F.2d 1541, 1546-47 (11th Cir.1991) (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that he was not a manager or supervisor because he was subordinate to another individual in the drug distribution scheme because he coordinated and managed delivery and transportation of the drugs).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">There is also no merit to Defendant Parada-Talamantes\u2019s claim that there were less than five participants in the criminal activity. A \u201cparticipant\u201d is defined as a \u201cperson who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense\u201d even if the person was not charged or convicted. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 1. To determine the number of participants, the district court must examine the number of individuals involved in the relevant conduct for which the defendant was responsible. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 3, Pt. B, intro, cmt.; <em>United States v. Holland, </em>22 F.3d 1040, 1046 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">Here, the three Ortizes were involved in, and criminally responsible for, Defendant Parada-Talamantes\u2019s criminal activity of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, as they were the recipients of the drugs supplied by Parada-Talamantes\u2019s conspiracy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>addition to the three Ortizes, codefendant Delarca-Munguia and Defendant Parada-Talamantes\u2019s superior, Rodriguez, were also involved. Thus, under the undisputed facts, there were at least six participants in Defendant Parada-Talamantes\u2019s criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying \u00a7 3Bl.l(b)\u2019s three-level managerial role enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">. Parada-Talamantes contends that the Or-tizes cannot be counted as participants because they were part of a separate conspiracy to distribute drugs at the retail level. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that there were two conspiracies, the Ortizes still can be counted as \u201cparticipants\u201d in Parada-Talamantes\u2019s criminal activity under \u00a7 3B1.1. <em>See Holland, </em>22 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>F.3d at 1046 (\"[I]n deciding whether individuals were participants in the criminal activity, the court must consider, in addition to the criminal act itself, the individuals\u2019 involvement in the events surrounding the criminal act.\u201d). The Ortizes participated in Parada-Talamantes\u2019s criminal activity by purchasing distribution-level quantities of drugs from him and Delarca-Munguia, and the Ortizes were criminally culpable for their part in those drug transactions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
