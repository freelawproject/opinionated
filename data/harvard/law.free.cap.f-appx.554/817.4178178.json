On appeal, Bennett challenges only the district court\u2019s relevant conduct finding used to determine the amount of drugs attributable to Bennett at sentencing. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"AJ4\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">In 2011, law enforcement conducted an undercover investigation of Donald and Martha Fowler, who were operating a large prescription drug distribution scheme in Chatham County, Georgia. To conduct their operation, the Fowlers used between three and five \u201cdrug mules\u201d to obtain prescription medications from various \u201cpill-mill\u201d doctors in Georgia and Florida. During the investigation, agents searched the Fowlers\u2019 residence and seized approximately 2,500 prescription pills and drug ledgers dating back to 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Defendant Bennett was one of the Fowl-ers\u2019 drug mules and traveled to various locations in Georgia and Florida to obtain pills. Defendant Bennett was aware that he was not the Fowlers\u2019 only drug mule. After his arrest, Bennett was interviewed by agents and admitted to his role in the Fowlers\u2019 pill distribution scheme. Defendant Bennett said that the Fowlers kept drug ledgers with each drug mule\u2019s transactions and acknowledged that his own participation in the scheme was recorded in the drug ledgers.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">According to the drug ledgers and witness interviews, Defendant Bennett participated in the Fowlers\u2019 drug conspiracy from October 2007 to November 2011, for about 50 months. Defendant Bennett\u2019s name appeared on at least 52 separate pages of the drug ledgers, and each of those pages listed between 3 and 15 monetary transactions involving Defendant Bennett. A specific summary of Defendant Bennett\u2019s transactions does not exist. According to a prescription summary for Lori Jones, another of the Fowlers\u2019 drug mules, Jones obtained between 7.56 grams and 8.82 grams of oxycodone in each month between January and May 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">B. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) noted that there was no prescription summary of Defendant Bennett\u2019s transactions with the Fowlers. Using the prescription summary of Jones\u2019s transactions, the PSI estimated that each mule in the drug conspiracy was \u201cattributed with obtaining a minimum of 7.56 grams of oxycodone each month,\u201d and that, therefore, Bennett was accountable for 378 grams of oxycodone (7.56 grams x 50 months). The PSI stated that the 378 grams of oxycodone was a conservative quantity representing \u201cthe reasonably foreseeable relevant conduct in the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">Based on the drug quantity equivalency tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, the PSI converted the 378 grams of oxycodone to 2,532.6 kilograms of marijuana. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 8(D) (providing that 1 gram of oxycodone is equivalent to 6,700 grams of marijuana). Using this drug quantity, the PSI calculated a base offense level of 30 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5) and (c)(4). The PSI recommended that the offense level be decreased by three levels for acceptance of responsibility and by four levels because Bennett was minimal participant in the jointly undertaken criminal activity. With a total offense level of 23 and a criminal history category of IV, the PSI recommended an initial guidelines range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, because the statutory maximum sentence was five years, the advisory guidelines sentence became 60 months under U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>\u00a7 5Gl.l(a). In light of Bennett\u2019s substantial assistance to the government, the PSI recommended a 50-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Bennett objected to the 378 grams of oxycodone attributed to him. Bennett argued that Jones\u2019s oxycodone transactions with the Fowlers were outside of the scope of the criminal activity he agreed to undertake with the Fowlers and thus were not reasonably foreseeable to him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">In an addendum to the PSI, the probation officer stated that 378 grams of oxyco-done was properly attributed to Bennett as relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a). The probation officer had interviewed Martha Fowler and reviewed the drug ledgers with her. According to Martha Fowler, Bennett visited the Fowl-ers\u2019 residence daily either to sell or buy pills or to \u201chang out,\u201d and Bennett knew he was not the only drug mule \u201cbecause he was often present during drug transactions involving\u201d Donald Fowler and the other mules.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">During his post-arrest interview, Bennett also admitted, among other things, that he knew he had made the Fowlers a lot of money and that other individuals also had obtained pills and sold them to the Fowlers. In fact, although Bennett conspired with the Fowlers and several other drug mules in furtherance of jointly undertaken criminal activity, Bennett was \u201conly attributed with the drug amounts of one \u2018mule.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">B. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">At sentencing, the parties agreed that there was no dispute as to the PSI\u2019s facts and that the dispute as to relevant conduct was a legal question. The district court summarized the facts as follows: (1) Bennett worked as a drug mule for the Fowl-ers obtaining pills from doctors, keeping some, and selling the rest to the Fowlers; (2) on some occasions, the Fowlers accompanied Bennett on his doctor visits; (3) Bennett knew that other drug couriers were also supplying pills and that the Fowlers were selling the pills; and (4) Bennett knew the Fowlers well, visited with them often, and was aware that he made a lot of money for them. Bennett\u2019s counsel stated that he had no problem with the district court\u2019s understanding of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">The district court then heard testimony from the probation officer and Bennett. According to this testimony, Bennett obtained for the Fowlers Xanax, hydroco-done, and Soma, schedule III and IV drugs. Defendant Bennett also sometimes bought prescription pills from the Fowlers, including oxycodone, a schedule II drug. Lori Jones obtained oxycodone pills for the Fowlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">Defendant Bennett began supplying the Fowlers with his prescription drugs because he needed help getting to the doctor. The Fowlers loaned Defendant Bennett money to finance his trips to buy medications. Defendant Bennett would keep some pills, and sell the rest to the Fowlers to reduce his debt to them. The Fowlers also sometimes accompanied Defendant Bennett to his doctor visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">Defendant Bennett was close to the Fowlers and was a friend of the Fowlers\u2019 son, who employed Bennett to do lawn care and automotive work. Defendant Bennett visited the Fowlers\u2019 home frequently, at least two or three times a week. The Fowlers sold pills in their kitchen, and Defendant Bennett sometimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>observed these transactions, but was not directly involved in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Defendant Bennett admitted that he knew that the Fowlers made money selling prescription pills, that they used other drug mules to obtain pills, and that they kept ledgers of their transactions. Defendant Bennett often saw Lori Jones at the Fowlers\u2019 home and assumed that she also supplied pills to the Fowlers. However, Defendant Bennett and Jones did not travel together to obtain pills, did not visit the same doctors, did not exchange pills or pool resources with each other, did not discuss obtaining or selling pills, and were not present for each other\u2019s transactions with the Fowlers. Defendant Bennett knew that, in addition to Jones, another source of supply for the Fowlers was Thomas Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the district court found that there was no objection to the factual statements in the PSI and adopted the PSI\u2019s findings of fact. As to drug quantity, the district court stated that it \u201cagree[d] with the findings in the [PSI] and concurred] with those findings, including the addendum.\u201d The district court stated that it had \u201cmade an individualized finding as regards to Mr. Bennett.\u201d The district court further stated that (1) the Fowlers\u2019 criminal activity was widespread, with drug mules going outside of Chatham County; (2) the Fowlers used several drug mules, some of whom Bennett knew and some of whom he did not; (3) Bennett\u2019s involvement with the Fowlers lasted for many months; (4) Bennett both furnished to, and received drugs from, the Fowlers; and (5) Bennett knew of the Fowlers\u2019 widespread activities getting pills from others and distributing them because Bennett was in the Fowlers home on an almost daily basis and \u201ccould witness firsthand the comings and goings at the Fowler residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">The district court concluded that \u201cthe estimate of drugs attributable to Mr. Bennett in this case is a conservative estimate\u201d and agreed with the PSI that \u201cthis was in fact a jointly undertaken criminal activity by the Fowlers and Mr. Bennett and other individuals such as himself and that Mr. Bennett should have easily reasonably foreseen the acts and the omissions of others.\u201d The district court stressed that Bennett admitted he had assumed that Lori Jones \u201cwas doing the same thing he was doing and that what he and the others were doing was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s calculations and advisory guideline sentence of 60 months. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on substantial assistance and, after considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, imposed a 48-month sentence. Bennett renewed his objections to the district courts drug quantity finding and relevant conduct determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">The district court must approximate the drug quantity when, as here, a defendant\u2019s base offense level under the guidelines is determined by drug quantity, and the amount of drugs seized does not reflect the scale of the offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number><em>Frazier, </em>89 F.3d 1501, 1506 (11th Cir.1996); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 5. In estimating the drug quantity attributable to the defendant, the district court may rely on evidence demonstrating the average frequency and amount of the defendant\u2019s drug sales over a given period of time. <em>Id. </em>This determination may be based on fair, accurate, and conservative estimates of drug quantities attributable to the defendant, but not on mere speculation. <em>United States v. Zapata, </em>139 F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir.1998). It is the government\u2019s burden to prove drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d 1559, 1566 (11th Cir.1995). However, the district court may rely on undisputed statements in the PSI. <em>United States v. Hedges, </em>175 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Here, the district court had to estimate the amount of drugs involved in the underlying drug conspiracy while Bennett participated in it. The district court did this by calculating the average amount of drugs that one of the Fowlers\u2019 drug mules, Lori Jones, obtained for the Fowlers per month (between 7.56 grams and 8.82 grams) and then attributing the low end of that amount (7.56 grams) to each of the three to five drug mules (including Bennett) who the Fowlers used in the drug conspiracy. The district court then multiplied that average monthly drug quantity for one drug mule by the number of months Bennett participated in the conspiracy (50 months), to arrive at a conservative estimate of the total amount of drugs (378 grams) attributable to Bennett (representing 7.56 grams x 50 months = 378 grams).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">On appeal, Bennett does not challenge the district court\u2019s factual findings as to the amount of drugs involved in the Fowl-ers\u2019 overall drug scheme or argue that the district court\u2019s method for estimating that drug amount was not conservative or was mere speculation. Instead, Bennett argues only that the district court could not use Jones\u2019s oxycodone transactions with the Fowlers to calculate his drug quantity because Jones\u2019s oxycodone transactions were not part of the criminal activity he jointly undertook with the Fowlers and thus were not relevant conduct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Under the advisory guidelines, a defendant is held accountable for his \u201crelevant conduct,\u201d which includes his own \u201cacts or omissions\u201d and also \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A), (B). In drug conspiracy cases, relevant conduct includes drug amounts with which the defendant was directly involved and also \u201call reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the criminal activity that the he jointly undertook.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 2.; <em>United States v. Ismond, </em>993 F.2d 1498, 1499 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">A \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d is a criminal plan or scheme undertaken by the defendant together with others, even if not charged as a conspiracy. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 2. The scope of the jointly undertaken activity is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>Thus, to hold the defendant responsible for the conduct of others, the district court must determine: (1) the scope of the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake; and then (2) whether the conduct of others was in furtherance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>of, and reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Hunter, </em>323 F.3d 1314, 1319-20 (11th Cir.2003). In determining the scope of the criminal activity, the district court may consider any implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The district court also must make individualized findings as to the scope of the criminal activity undertaken by the defendant. <em>Hunter, </em>323 F.3d at 1319; <em>Ismond, </em>993 F.2d at 1499. We need not reverse if the district court failed to make such findings, however, where the record as a whole supports the amount of drugs attributed to the defendant. <em>Ismond, </em>993 F.2d at 1499.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Here, Bennett had an individual sentencing hearing separate from the other participants in the Fowlers\u2019 drug ring. The district court explicitly made individualized findings about Bennett\u2019s involvement in the Fowlers\u2019 drug scheme on the record at the sentencing hearing. Specifically, the district court found that Bennett agreed to a \u201cwidespread\u201d criminal undertaking with the Fowlers and other drug couriers \u2014 to obtain prescription medications from \u201cpill mill\u201d doctors throughout Florida and Georgia to distribute in Chat-ham County, Georgia \u2014 and that Bennett was aware of Jones\u2019s involvement in the undertaking as one of the drug couriers. The district court also noted the length of Bennett\u2019s involvement with the scheme, his near-daily visits to the Fowlers\u2019 home, and his presence during some of the transactions. Thus, the district court did not fail to make particularized findings as to the scope of Bennett\u2019s involvement in the drug conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Bennett claims that Jones\u2019s oxycodone transactions are not relevant conduct because they were not in furtherance of the criminal activity he personally agreed to jointly undertake with the Fowlers. Bennett argues that his criminal activity was limited to selling his own schedule III and IV prescription drugs to the Fowlers and that he never agreed to jointly undertake the Fowler\u2019s larger scheme or Jones\u2019s criminal activity of selling the Fowlers the schedule II drug oxycodone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">We find no merit to Bennett\u2019s contention that the district court was required to find that the Fowlers were engaged in <em>separate </em>criminal undertakings with Bennett and Jones. Rather, the undisputed facts in the PSI and presented at the sentencing hearing amply support the district court\u2019s finding that Bennett, Jones, and the other drug mules were all participating in one scheme with the Fowlers to distribute prescription medications obtained from \u201cpill mill\u201d doctors in Georgia and Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">The record shows that Bennett knew he was involved in a widespread criminal undertaking that included Jones\u2019s conduct because: (1) Bennett visited the Fowlers\u2019 home almost daily, (2) he was present when the Fowlers conducted drug transactions in their home; (3) he supplied Xanax, Soma, and hydrocodone to the Fowlers repeatedly over 50 months knowing they were reselling those drugs; (4) he relied on the Fowlers to fund his travel to doctors to obtain those drugs; (5) he knew the Fowlers used other drug mules, including Jones, and resold the drugs the mules supplied; and (6) he sometimes purchased drugs from the Fowlers, including oxyco-done, one of the drugs that Jones, but not Bennett, supplied to the Fowlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">Bennett correctly points out that mere awareness of the larger criminal undertaking is insufficient to show that a defendant agreed to participate in that larger criminal undertaking. <em>See Hunter, </em>323 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>1320-21. However, the extent of a defendant\u2019s knowledge of and participation in the undertaking may be indicative of an agreement to participate in the larger scheme. <em>See McCrimmon, </em>362 F.3d at 732-33. The facts here show that Bennett was more than merely aware of the Fowl-ers\u2019 overall drug operation; he was an active and trusted participant in the Fowl-ers\u2019 operation as both a courier and a purchaser for an extended period of time. Bennett was such a close associate of the Fowlers that they conducted transactions with others in his presence. In addition, Bennett relied upon the Fowlers to finance his doctor visits, which suggests Bennett was invested in and dependent on the success of the Fowlers\u2019 larger criminal undertaking. Likewise, Bennett\u2019s long-time and reliable supply of Xanax, Soma, and hydro-codone helped the Fowlers\u2019 scheme to succeed. And, Bennett furthered the scheme from the \u201cdemand\u201d side by buying oxyco-done from the Fowlers, which provided them an incentive to purchase more oxyco-done from their oxycodone suppliers, including Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">In light of Bennett\u2019s long-term, extensive knowledge of and participation in the Fowlers\u2019 scheme, the district court properly inferred from Bennett\u2019s conduct that he agreed to jointly undertake the entire criminal scheme involving all the drug mules. Given that the scope of the criminal activity Bennett agreed to jointly undertake, the district court did not err in including Jones\u2019s oxycodone transactions as relevant conduct and using them to estimate the amount of drugs involved in that criminal activity. Accordingly, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-10\">. Bennett also objected to the denial of safety-valve relief. The district court overruled Bennett\u2019s safety-valve objection because Bennett\u2019s criminal history disqualified him for such relief. Bennett does not challenge this safety-valve ruling on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\">. Section 2E1.2, the provision applicable to Bennett\u2019s offense, provides that the base offense level is either 6 or the offense level applicable to the underlying unlawful activity, whichever is greater. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E1.2(a)(l),(2). In Bennett's case, the offense level for the underlying drug conspiracy is determined using the drug quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Thus, the district court had to estimate the amount of drugs involved in the conspiracy to determine Bennett\u2019s offense level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b845-6\">. Although we review a district court\u2019s finding of the drug quantity attributable to the defendant for clear error, <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>584 F.3d 1354, 1367 (11th Cir.2009), we review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court misapplied the relevant conduct provisions of U.S. S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.3, <em>United States v. McCrimmon, </em>362 F.3d 725, 728 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\">. On appeal, Bennett does not argue that Jones\u2019s drug transactions were not reasonably foreseeable to him or were not in furtherance of the Fowlers\u2019 overall drug operation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
