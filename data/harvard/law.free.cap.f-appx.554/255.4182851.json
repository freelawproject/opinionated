We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-23\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b280-24\">Accepting as true the factual allegations contained in the Mangwiros\u2019 complaint,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the facts are as follows. Travisha Mang-wiro, a citizen of the United States, married Tinashe Mangwiro, a citizen of Zimbabwe, on August 22, 2007. The following year Mrs. Mangwiro filed a Form 1-130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(l)(A)(i) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.1(a)(1) to have her husband classified as an immediate relative (the Form I-130 petition).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such a classification would have allowed Mr. Mangwiro to become an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> USCIS thereupon interviewed the Mangwiros separately in order to determine whether they had entered into the marriage for the purposes of evading the immigration laws. After finding discrepancies and inconsistencies in the Mangwiros\u2019 answers, USCIS issued to Mrs. Mangwiro a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) her petition. Following the Mangwiros\u2019 response to the NOID, USCIS denied the petition, citing \u00a7 204(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">In 2010, Mrs. Mangwiro again petitioned the USCIS to have her husband recognized as an immediate relative. Following separate interviews, USCIS issued another NOID alleging discrepancies and inconsistencies. After the Mangwiros responded, USCIS again denied the petition, citing \u00a7 204(c). Thereafter, the Mangwi-ros\u2019 appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The BIA dismissed the appeal based on a finding that the Mang-wiros had failed to prove the bona fides of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The Mangwiros then filed suit in federal district court. Their complaint contained two causes of action. First, they asserted that USCIS violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by misinterpreting \u00a7 204 of the INA. Second, they claimed that USCIS violated their due process rights by refusing to provide them with recordings of their interviews. The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), concluding that the Mangwiros had failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim, using the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That standard requires the plaintiff to plead sufficient facts \u201cto state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA plaintiff meets this standard when it \u2018pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In engaging in our review, we \u201caccept[ ] all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>This case requires us to review USCIS\u2019s denial of a visa application. Although we generally lack jurisdiction to review immigration decisions statutorily committed to the discretion of the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we have previously held that \u201c[d]etermina-tions regarding the validity of marriage for 1-130 petition purposes are ... subject to review by courts.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, \u201c[i]t is well settled that the applicant for a visa bears the burden of establishing eligibility.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, USCIS\u2019s denial of a visa application \u201cmay be reversed only if the decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The first cause of action in the Mangwiros\u2019 complaint asserted that US-CIS violated the APA by misapplying \u00a7 204(c) of the INA. Codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(c), that provision prohibits the Attorney General from granting a Form I-130 petition if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">(1) the alien has previously been accorded, or has sought to be accorded, an immediate relative or preference status as the spouse of a citizen of the United States ... by reason of a marriage determined by the Attorney General to have been entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws, or (2) the Attorney General has determined that the alien has attempted or conspired to enter into a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">The Mangwiros contended that this provision could not form the basis for a denial of their petitions because it \u201crequire[s] a <em>previous </em>finding of marriage fraud in order for a <em>subsequent </em>1-130 petition to be denied.\u201d Since the Mangwiros have each only been married once, USCIS could not have made a previous finding of marriage fraud (at least in their initial application).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">The district court held that this cause of action failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. Although it agreed that subsection (1) only applied if the alien had filed a previous petition, it held that the plain language of subsection (2) made clear that it applied any time the Attorney General determined that the petitioner had attempted or conspired to enter into a marriage for the purposes of evading the immigration laws, irrespective of whether that attempt was a prior petition or the present one. It noted, moreover, that to interpret subsection (2) as the Mangwiros urged would make it duplica-tive of subsection (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">On appeal, the Mangwiros argue that the district court erred because both the text of \u00a7 204(c) and the provision\u2019s legislative history make clear that its reach is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>limited to previous marriages. Further, they contend that the BIA and USCIS have adopted this understanding in their decisions and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We agree with the district court that the plain language of \u00a7 204(c)(2) makes clear that it applies to both the current and previous petitions. There is nothing in the language of subsection (2) to indicate that its scope is limited to previous petitions. The subsection employs the present perfect tense. \u201cThis tense indicates action that was started in the past and has recently been completed or is continuing up to the present time.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, if an individual says, \u201cI have conspired to evade the immigration laws,\u201d he could be saying that he previously entered into a sham marriage; or he could be saying that he is currently in the process of petitioning the government for a change in immigration status on the grounds of a fraudulent marriage. Congress would not rely merely upon the use of \u201chas\u201d to limit the application of subsection (2) to previous petitions. Moreover, the rest of the statute indicates that Congress knew how to limit this section to prior activity. In subsection (1), for instance, Congress specifically provides that the Attorney General shall deny an application if he determines that the applicant \u201chas <em>previously </em>been accorded\u201d an immigration preference on the basis of a sham marriage.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> If Congress had intended to limit the application of subsection (2) to prior petitions, it would have employed similar language.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">This understanding is confirmed by the interrelation of subsections (1) and (2). Were the application of subsection (2) limited to previous petitions, the two subsections would be largely, if not entirely, du-plicative.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The language of subsection (1) requires the Attorney General to deny an application if the alien has previously sought to be accorded immediate relative status by entering into a sham marriage. The only way in which subsection (2) has meaning is if it encompasses not only individuals who engaged in such previous attempts, but also those who are presently attempting to evade the immigration laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">The Mangwiros contend that subsection (2) could have independent meaning under their interpretation as well. They argue that subsection (1) only includes instances in which a petition is actually filed and that subsection (2) covers \u201call other instances in which an alien has attempted or conspired to enter into a fraudulent marriage.\u201d But this understanding lacks support in the text. Subsection (1) requires a petition\u2019s denial if the alien has previously \u201csought\u201d to be accorded a preferential immigration status. To seek means \u201c[t]o try to obtain\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and thus is not limited to instances in which the alien actually files a petition. Moreover, as the Mangwiros admit, using a separate subsection would be a cumbersome manner for Congress to cover merely those prior attempts and conspiracies that did not result in actual petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">The other assertions put forward by the Mangwiros do not mandate a contrary result. They claim that \u00a7 204(c) only applies to previous attempts because it employs a different article from that used in \u00a7 204(b). The latter provision states that the Attorney General shall grant the Form 1-130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>petition \u201cif he determines that the facts stated in <em>the </em>petition are true,\u201d while \u00a7 204(c)(2) provides that the Attorney General shall deny the petition if he determines that the \u201calien has attempted or conspired to enter into <em>a </em>marriage\u201d to evade the immigration laws.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Mang-wiros claim that the use of \u201ca\u201d \u201cclearly indicates a marriage which happened previously.\u201d This argument is without merit. Although \u00a7 204(b)\u2019s use of \u201cthe\u201d makes clear that that provision only applies to the specific petition under consideration, the use of \u201ca\u201d in the context of \u00a7 204(c) means \u201c[a]ny,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> including the current petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Since the intent of Congress is thus clear based on the ordinary tools of statutory construction, we must give effect to that intent, irrespective of any contrary interpretations by the agency.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But even if \u00a7 204(c) were ambiguous, that would be of no aid to the Mangwiros, since the agency has not clearly interpreted the provision to apply only to previous petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In support of their view that the BIA and USCIS have interpreted \u00a7 204(c) to apply only to previous petitions, the Mang-wiros point to a decision of the BIA and to the regulation implementing \u00a7 204(c). Neither, however, interprets \u00a7 204(c) to apply only to previous petitions. In <em>Is-ber,</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the BIA agreed that the language of \u00a7 204(c) was sufficiently broad to require the denial of a petition if the government had previously determined that the alien entered into her current marriage to evade the immigration laws.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Nonetheless, in view of the purposes of that provision, it stated that it should not be interpreted in this manner.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This statement was mere dicta, however, since the BIA ultimately determined that the petitioner had adduced insufficient evidence to show that her marriage was bona fide.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-15\">The regulation the Mangwiros cite provides that, in order for USCIS to deny a Form 1-130 petition on the basis of \u00a7 204(c), \u201cthe evidence of the attempt or conspiracy must be contained in the alien\u2019s file.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Mangwiros assert that \u201c[o]b-viously, if this section applied to the current 1-130 petition being adjudicated there would be no need to reference evidence that must be \u2018contained in the alien\u2019s file.\u2019 \u201d Such is not \u201cobviously\u201d the ease. There is no reason why USCIS would be unable to have information in the alien\u2019s file about the current petition. Moreover, in numerous other matters, both the BIA and US-CIS have understood \u00a7 204(c) to apply to the current petition, understandings which we have consistently affirmed, albeit in unreported opinions.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in holding that the Mangwiros first cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>action failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The Mangwiros\u2019 second cause of action asserted that they were denied due process because USCIS refused their \u201crepeated requests to be provided with copies of their 1-130 interview recordings.\u201d Without access to these recordings, they argue, they were unable to confirm that there were actual discrepancies between their answers. The district court also held that this cause of action failed to state a claim. It held that the regulations governing Form 1-130 petitions and any due process rights guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment required only that the Mangwiros be given notice of the derogatory information relied upon by the USCIS to deny their claims as well as an opportunity to rebut that information. Since the NOIDs provided to the Mangwiros included the discrepancies that formed the basis of the USCIS\u2019s denial of their petition, the court concluded, the Mangwiros were not denied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The Mangwiros contend that the district court erred because 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.2(b)(16) requires that they be furnished with the actual documents that formed the basis for the USCIS\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> That regulation states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">An applicant or petitioner shall be permitted to inspect the record of proceeding which constitutes the basis for the decision, except as provided in the following paragraphs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-13\">(i) Derogatory information unknown to petitioner or applicant. If the decision will be adverse to the applicant or petitioner and is based on derogatory information considered by the Service and of which the applicant or petitioner is unaware, he/she shall be advised of this fact and offered an opportunity to rebut the information....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-14\">(ii) Determination of statutory eligibility. A determination of statutory eligibility shall be based only on information contained in the record of proceeding which is disclosed to the applicant or petitioner.... <footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-15\">According to the Mangwiros, the language of this regulation requires USCIS to provide petitioners with all of the evidence and documentation that forms the basis of a denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-16\">We disagree. The plain language of \u00a7 103.2(b)(16)(i) requires that USCIS \u201cadvise[]\u201d the petitioners whose claims are about to be denied of the \u201cderogatory information\u201d that forms the basis for the denial. As many of our sister circuits have recognized, it does not require USCIS to provide documentary evidence of the information, but only sufficient information to allow the petitioners to rebut the allegations.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Moreover, as the Mangwiros con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>cede, the agency has interpreted \u00a7 103.2(b)(16)(i) as \u201conly require[ing] that a petitioner be advised of the derogatory evidence of record; the regulations do not place upon USCIS a requirement that the actual documents be provided to a petitioner.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201cWhen an agency interprets its own regulation, the Court, as a general rule, defers to it unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Thus, the district court did not err in denying their claim that USCIS violated their due process rights.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In addition to challenging the reasons the district court gave for dismissing the complaint, the Mangwiros assert on appeal that the BIA failed to consider issues they raised in the appeal of the denial of their second petition. The Mangwiros did not assert any cause of action based on this failure in their complaint, however. As mentioned, they only alleged two causes of action, (1) that USCIS violated the APA by misinterpreting \u00a7 204(c) and (2) that USCIS denied them due process. The district court therefore had no opportunity to consider the merits of this allegation and whether it stated a cause of action under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It is well settled that \u201cwe do not consider issues on appeal that were not presented and argued before the lower court.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Thus, we may not examine this final argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">\u2756 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
