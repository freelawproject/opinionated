Nelson argues that the fine will \u201cunduly burden [her and] her dependents.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The district court did not clearly err when it ordered Nelson to pay a $7,500 fine. The Sentencing Guidelines require the district court to impose a fine unless \u201cthe defendant establishes that [she] is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5E1.2(a) (Nov.2012). Nelson admitted, by \u201cfail[ing] to object to [the] allegations of fact in [her presentence report],\u201d <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006), that she had ten bank accounts containing more than $61,000; she had earned more than $30,000 the preceding four years as a medical assistant; and she had received financial assistance from her family. And Nelson acknowledged that she had sufficient cash to pay the fine and to retain more than $8,000 in cash and $7,000 in savings bonds. The district court was entitled to find that Nelson was \u201cable to pay [the] fine\u201d despite her arguments about her financial obligations to her three children and an outstanding $14,000 loan from a friend. Although the district court did not discuss the individual factors used to determine an appropriate fine, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 5E1.2(d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(a), we \u201cinfer without hesitation\u201d that the district court took those factors into account because it considered Nelson\u2019s presentence report before imposing her fine. <em>See United States v. Khawaja, </em>118 F.3d 1454, 1459 (11th Cir.1997). Nelson argues that payment of the fine will leave her \u201cvirtually destitute,\u201d but the undisputed evidence establishes that Nelson can pay her fine immediately and that her future earnings will be unencumbered.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">We AFFIRM Nelson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
