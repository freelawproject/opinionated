Morgan also appeals his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2). Mathis and Morgan argue, for the first time, that the district court should have questioned and replaced a juror who allegedly slept during the first day of trial and that their trial attorneys were ineffective for failing to object to the juror\u2019s inattentiveness. We affirm Mathis\u2019s and Morgan\u2019s convictions, but we decline to review their arguments about ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Because Mathis and Morgan did not object to the juror\u2019s alleged sleeping in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1018 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cTo establish plain error, a defendant must show there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1019. \u201c[T]he law of this circuit [is] that ... there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving\u201d the issue. <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The district court did not plainly err by failing to question and replace the juror. \u201cDefense counsel [has] a duty to call a juror\u2019s inattentiveness to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>United States v. Curry, </em>471 F.2d 419, 422 (5th Cir.1973). Mathis\u2019s and Morgan\u2019s attorneys observed the juror allegedly sleeping during voir dire, but decided to \u201ckeep him\u201d because he was one of the only men on the jury panel. When the district court learned that the juror might have neglected to respond to a question during voir dire, the district court and Morgan\u2019s attorney speculated that the juror had been sleeping during voir dire and the first day of trial. Mathis\u2019s attorney, who was concerned that the juror was the \u201csole African-American\u201d on the petit jury, commented that the juror might have been \u201cconcentrating.\u201d The prosecutor suggested the juror\u2019s behavior was \u201csomething ... that possibly needs to be addressed,\u201d but the district court decided not to question the juror about sleeping. Neither defense counsel objected to that decision. \u201cThere is no per se rule requiring an inquiry in every instance of alleged [juror] misconduct,\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>921 F.2d 1569, 1577 (11th Cir.1991), and we cannot fault the district court for failing to investigate the juror\u2019s alleged sleeping when defense counsel failed to object to it. When examined about his potential knowledge of any witnesses, the juror\u2019s responses suggested that he was awake and attentive during the trial. <em>See id. </em>at 1577-78; <em>United States v. Holder, </em>652 F.2d 449, 451 (5th Cir.1981). We will not permit Mathis and Morgan to disregard the juror\u2019s behavior to \u201csew[ ] a defect into the trial, and later claim its benefit,\u201d <em>Curry, </em>471 F.2d at 422, particularly when they fail to cite any precedent that requires the district court <em>sua sponte </em>to remove a sleeping juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">We decline to address Mathis\u2019s and Morgan\u2019s arguments that their attorneys were ineffective. Mathis and Morgan failed to develop a record that would allow us to evaluate their arguments that their attorneys should have made a \u201cformal motion to remove or object[ ] to the presence of the sleeping juror.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). Mathis and Morgan can raise their arguments in a postconviction motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">We AFFIRM Mathis\u2019s and Morgan\u2019s convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
