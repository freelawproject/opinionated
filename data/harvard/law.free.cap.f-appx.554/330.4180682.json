Lopez, who is proceeding pro se, argues that that the IJ and BIA failed to consider whether she was eligible for dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>cretionary relief based on two memorandums issued by the Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement regarding the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. However, when she was before the IJ and the BIA, Lopez did not raise this issue. Accordingly, she failed to exhaust it, and we lack jurisdiction to address it. <em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 318-19 (5th Cir.2009). Lopez does not challenge the BIA\u2019s reasons for denying relief, namely, that she failed to meet her burden to show that she did not receive notice of the immigration hearing and failed to establish that she acted diligently with regard to her immigration proceedings. Consequently, she has abandoned any challenge to the BIA\u2019s ruling. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
