She argues that a spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>cial condition of supervised release included in her written judgment conflicts with the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence. Specifically, at the revocation hearing, the district court ordered various conditions of supervised release, including Juarez-Luna\u2019s participation in a \u201cprogram approved by the United States Probation Office for the treatment of narcotic, drug, or alcohol dependency.\u201d In the written judgment, however, the court included an additional drug testing requirement associated with this condition. Juarez-Luna contends that the conflict between the written judgment and oral pronouncement warrants remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Because Juarez-Luna had no opportunity to object to the written judgment in the district court, we review the court\u2019s sentencing decision for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vega, </em>332 F.3d 849, 851 n. 1 (5th Cir.2003). \u201c[A] defendant has a constitutional right to be present at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 852. Accordingly, if the written judgment conflicts with the oral pronouncement of sentence, the oral pronouncement controls. <em>Id. </em>If, however, the difference between the written judgment and oral pronouncement creates merely an ambiguity, we \u201clook to the intent of the sentencing court, as evidenced in the record to determine the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 935 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The written judgment reflects that drug testing is both a special and a mandatory condition of supervised release. Thus, the district court\u2019s inclusion of a drug testing component, as part of the special condition of supervised release requiring substance abuse treatment, does not broaden the restrictions or responsibilities of Juarez-Luna\u2019s supervised release. <em>See United States v. Mireles, </em>471 F.3d 551, 558 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Vega, </em>332 F.3d at 852-54. Accordingly, there is no conflict warranting remand. <em>See Mireles, </em>471 F.3d at 558; <em>Vega, </em>332 F.3d at 852-54</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
