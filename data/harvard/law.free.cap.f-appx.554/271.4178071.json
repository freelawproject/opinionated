He also moves for the appointment of counsel and for the production of documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">In his appellate brief, Granger challenges several facts, asserting that he did not have medications with him when he was admitted to the TPJ, that his mother did not bring him medication, and that he was never treated outside the TPJ. He also asserts that the defendants administered medications to him without performing proper tests. He does not argue, however, as he did in the district court, that he was denied specific requests for medical treatment nor does he brief that issue. Accordingly, he has abandoned that claim. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Granger has not alleged or set forth any facts to show that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs. The record reflects that he was examined, treated, and administered medication on a regular basis during his detention at the TPJ. His unsubstantiated assertions to the contrary do not create a genuine dispute as to a material fact regarding whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs. <em>See Hare v. City of Corinth, Miss., </em>74 F.3d 633, 639 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc); <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). The fact that he may be disappointed with the treatment he received or that he received unsuccessful treatment is insufficient to establish a constitutional violation. <em>See Hare, </em>74 F.3d at 643; <em>Mace v. City of Palestine, </em>333 F.3d 621, 626 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">We do not consider Granger\u2019s claims, which he raises for the first time, that he suffered a \u201cmild stroke\u201d when someone else\u2019s medications were administered to him and that a nurse gave him the wrong medication \u201cin retaliation for his rejection of her sexual advances.\u201d <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Granger\u2019s motions for the appointment of counsel and the production of documents are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
