Because Woodhull\u2019s complaint requires review of state-court judgments, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider this case under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>cordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for the district court to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">I. Facts and Procedural Posture</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">This litigation concerns the guardianship and estate of Louise Falvo, Woodhull\u2019s mother. According to Woodhull\u2019s complaint, Falvo owned an account that was held in trust for Woodhull. (R. 1 at \u00b6 39.) Over a period of approximately six months, Falvo executed a series of documents transferring the beneficiary designation of her financial accounts back and forth between Woodhull and Defendants Shirley and John Mascarella. (R. 1 at \u00b6 39, 40, 42, 52, 55, 65). After these events, Defendant Judge Nancy Allen of the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit Court in and for Seminole County, Florida froze Falvo\u2019s accounts and appointed Defendant Rebecca Fierle as Falvo\u2019s Guardian. (R. 1 at \u00b6 68, 69.) After a hearing, Judge Allen ordered \u201cthe destruction of the beneficial interests\u201d on Falvo\u2019s accounts. (R. 1 at \u00b6 82.) Woodhull appealed this order, among others, to Florida\u2019s Fifth District Court of Appeal. <em>Woodhull v. Guardianship of Louise A. Falvo, </em>43 So.3d 708 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2010). After briefing and oral argument, the District Court of Appeal affirmed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In the meantime, Falvo died on July 21, 2008, and probate proceedings commenced. (R. 1 at \u00b6 85, 88.) During the probate process, Defendant Judge Victor Hulslan-der of the Circuit Court of the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Alachua County, Florida ordered that some of the funds previously designated in trust for Woodhull be used to pay attorney and guardianship fees. (R. 1 at 93-99.) Woodhull has appealed this order to Florida\u2019s First District Court of Appeal in <em>Woodhull v. Mascarella, </em>Case No. 1D13-536. The appeal is still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Concurrent with the state-court appeal, Woodhull filed this case in federal court \u25a0with one federal claim \u2014 that the Defendants seized her property in violation of the Fourth Amendment. (R. 1.) Woodhull also alleged various state-law claims under supplemental jurisdiction. <em>(Id.) </em>Although Woodhull does not explain precisely how the Defendants violated the Fourth Amendment, she seems to claim that the Defendants violated Florida law by destroying the beneficiary designations on Falvo\u2019s accounts \u2014 the same argument that was rejected by two Florida Circuit Courts and one Florida District Court of Appeal. After providing the parties an opportunity to respond, the federal district court dismissed the Fourth Amendment claim with prejudice and dismissed the state-law claims without prejudice. (R. 57.) Woodhull appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">On appeal, Woodhull contends that the district court erred by dismissing her Fourth Amendment claim for failure to state a claim. However, before we reach the merits of Woodhull\u2019s appeal, we must consider the Defendants contention that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars consideration of the Fourth Amendment claim since it essentially seeks appellate review of the state-court proceedings. Woodhull replies that she is not seeking review of any state-court judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">\u201cThe <em>[Rooker-Feldman </em>] doctrine is a jurisdictional rule that precludes the lower federal courts from reviewing state-court judgments.\u201d <em>Alvarez v. Attorney Gen. for Fla., </em>679 F.3d 1257, 1262 (11th Cir.2012) (citation omitted). We apply the doctrine to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>those judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005)). The doctrine applies to cases that are \u201cinextricably intertwined with the state-court judgment so that (1) the success of the federal claim would effectively nullify the state-court judgment, or that (2) the federal claim would succeed only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">In this case, Woodhull complains of injuries caused by a state-court judgment that she contends was wrong. These arguments were considered and rejected by multiple Florida courts before the federal district court proceedings commenced. Woodhull\u2019s claim would succeed only to the extent that these state-court decisions are wrong. Accordingly, the district court lacked jurisdiction in this case under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Review of this case, by the district court, is barred under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. Accordingly, the judgment below is vacated and we remand with instructions that the district court dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">VACATED and REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTION.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
