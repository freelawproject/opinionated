At his original sentencing in 2000, the district court sentenced Mr. Smith to 360 months in prison after he pled guilty to conspiring to distribute powder and crack cocaine. Although the district court found that Mr. Smith qualified as a career offender, with a total offense level of 37 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, it ultimately sentenced him under the drug-quantity guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, which yielded a higher adjusted offense level of 40. Mr. Smith\u2019s counsel objected to the career-offender designation at sentencing, but Mr. Smith did not raise these objections on appeal. It is undisputed that if Mr. Smith were sentenced today, he would not qualify as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">In the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings at issue on appeal, the district court reduced Mr. Smith\u2019s sentence by 30 months due to the retroactive application of Amendment 750 to the crack-cocaine guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In so doing, the court applied the career-offender guideline for the first time, as it resulted in a higher sentencing range than the amended drug-quantity guideline. On appeal, Mr. Smith argues that the district court erred in applying the career-offender guideline and refusing to reduce his sentence to the low end of the amended drug-quantity range.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012). Following a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Mr. Smith argues that the district court \u2022erred in limiting the reduction of his sentence to the low end of the career-offender guideline range because (1) it is now undisputed that he does not qualify as a career offender; (2) the parties entered a written plea agreement stipulating to a base offense level under the drug-quantity guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1; and (3) the court originally sentenced him pursuant to his drug-quantity guideline range. We address each of these arguments in turn and find each unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Even if the parties agree that Mr. Smith\u2019s career-offender designation is now erroneous, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not authorize the district court to revisit or correct that designation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where the guideline range for that sentence is subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. In so doing, however, the district court must \u201csubstitute only the [retroactive] amendments ... for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). This policy statement, in essence, requires that \u201cany mistakes committed at the initial sentencing are imposed anew.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2694, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Under <em>Dil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number><em>lon, </em>because Mr. Smith\u2019s career-offender designation was not affected by Amendment 750, it was \u201coutside the scope of the proceeding authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the District Court properly declined to address [it].\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">According to Mr. Smith, the district court nonetheless erred in applying the career-offender guideline because his plea agreement stipulated that his base offense level would be calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 and did not include \u201cany provision or special clause by which Mr. Smith might have been found to qualify as a career offender.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 19. But, as Mr. Smith\u2019s plea agreement expressly provides, such sentencing stipulations and agreements were not binding on the district court. <em>See </em>D.E. 71 at 8 (\u201cPursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(B), the United States and the defendant stipulate and agree that the defendant\u2019s base offense level be calculated at level 38 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1 and 1B1.3. The defendant understands that this stipulation or agreement is not binding on the Court, and if not accepted by the Court, the defendant will not be allowed to withdraw from the plea.\u201d). <em>See also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(B) (1999) (providing that any sentencing recommendations in a plea agreement \u201cshall not be binding upon the court\u201d). Accordingly, the plea agreement\u2019s silence as to Mr. Smith\u2019s career-offender status did not preclude the district court from designating him as a career offender. And because the career-offender guideline yielded a higher offense level following the retroactive application of Amendment 750, the district court correctly determined Mr. Smith\u2019s amended sentence under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (directing courts to determine a career offender\u2019s offense level by using either the offense level that would ordinarily apply or the table in \u00a7 4B 1.1(b), whichever results in a higher offense level).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Finally, binding circuit precedent bars Mr. Smith\u2019s argument that the district court should have applied the amended drug-quantity guideline range because his initial sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d the drug-quantity guideline. In support of his argument, Mr. Smith cites the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2692-93, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) (plurality opinion), which held that \u201c \u00a7 3582(c)(2) modification proceedings should be available to permit the district court to revisit a prior sentence to whatever extent the sentencing range in question was a relevant part of the analytic framework the judge used to determine the sentence.\u201d But nothing in <em>Freeman </em>required the district court to disregard its prior finding that Mr. Smith qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. As we held in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>\u201ca reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where [an amendment to the sentencing guidelines] is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range <em>because of the operation of another </em>guideline.\u201d 541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although Mr. Smith argues that <em>Moore </em>has been undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman, </em>he concedes that we have already rejected this argument. <em>See Law</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number><em>son, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Accordingly, <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision refusing to reduce Mr. Smith\u2019s sentence below the amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-6\">. The district court had previously reduced Mr. Smith's sentence by 68 months due to the retroactive application of Amendment 706 to the crack-cocaine guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b894-7\">. Mr. Smith does not dispute that the district court made a finding as to his career-offender status during his original sentencing hearing. In his brief on appeal, he states in passing that \"any statements the district court made at sentencing concerning [his] career offender designation w[ere] essentially <em>dicta </em>because the district court noted that any argument or issue concerning a career offender designation \u2018was neither here nor there.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14. He, however, fails to further develop this argument. In any event, during the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings below, counsel for Mr. Smith conceded that the Mr. Smith \"was determined to be a career offender\u201d at his original sentencing hearing. D.E. 366 at 215.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b895-6\">. Mr. Smith\u2019s counsel conceded as much during the proceedings below. <em>See </em>D.E. 366 at 215 (\u201cAnd I would agree, your Honor, that [\u00a7 ] 3582 would not be the type of proceeding where [the district court] would go back and undo [Mr. Smith's career-offender designation], That would probably have to be through a habeas proceeding.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
