Sawyer, late of Gloucester.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-11\">The testator died on December 15, 1889. The paragraph in question is as follows: \u201c 41. I give and bequeath to my executors and trustees, the survivors and survivor of them, the sum of four thousand dollars, to be safely invested, and the income only paid over semiannually to my coachman, William Wynn of Gloucester.\u201d The will contained a residuary clause. The plaintiff\u2019s intestate died on June 6,1892, and is the William Wynn named above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-12\">The defendants demurred to the declaration, assigning as ground therefor'that the intestate took only the income for life in the fund in question. In the Superior Court, Braley, J. sustained the demurrer, and ordered judgment for the defendants; and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-13\"><em>J.

It is, however, obvious that it was right. The language of the bequest was that \u201c the income only \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>should be paid to Wynn; and there was a general residuary clause. There is nothing to show an intention that anything should be paid to him except the income during his life. <em>In re Grove\u2019s trusts, </em>28 L. J. (N. S.) Ch. 536. <em>In re Morgan, </em>[1893] 3 Ch. 222. <em>Judgment for the defendants affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
