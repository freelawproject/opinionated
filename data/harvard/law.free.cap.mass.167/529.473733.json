J., the plaintiff contended that the check was given in payment of a claim which he held against the defendant Weston, to secure the payment of which he held a lien on certain horses and a dog, which were delivered up on the acceptance of the check.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The defendants set up in their answer, that the \u201c plaintiff claimed to have boarded, stabled, and broken said horses and dog, and charged for such board, stabling, and breaking an exorbitant and unreasonable price, and refused to deliver said animals to said Weston unless the sum so claimed by him was paid, . . . and the said Weston, denying said liability, and under protest, made the check as alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, and obtained from said plaintiff said animals as aforesaid.\u201d The answer also set up want of consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">The defendants admitted that they signed and delivered the check, and obtained the property mentioned therefor, and that the plaintiff claimed at the time to have a lien thereon, as set forth in his declaration, but denied that he had such lien. The judge ruled that, under the defendants\u2019 answer and admission, there remained no legal ground of defence, and directed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount of the check; and'the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-6\"><em>J.

Thereupon the check in suit was given to obtain possession of the animals, Weston denying his liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">It is not contended that there was any fraud, and there was no duress. Instead of pursuing his rights, the defendant Weston saw fit to pay the price charged, and to take the horses and\u2019 dog. The giving of the check must be regarded as voluntary on his part, and not as the result of compulsion on the part of the plaintiff. <em>Silliman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>101 U. S. 465. There was no want of consideration. All \u00f3f the facts were known to the defendant. The plaintiff asserted a claim which he denied. By giving the check he effected a settlement of the plaintiff\u2019s demand and obtained possession of the animals, and, whether the whole amount which the plaintiff claimed was justly due or not, the defendant received a consideration for his check which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>gave, and must abide by the settlement which he made. <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>8 Met. 403. <em>Front </em>v. <em>Pittsfield Fire District, </em>154 Mass. 450. <em>Knibbs </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Esp. 84. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>M\u2019Kinally, </em>1 Esp. 279. <em>Cartwright </em>v. <em>Rowley, </em>2 Esp. 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
