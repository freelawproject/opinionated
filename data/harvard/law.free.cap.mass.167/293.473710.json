The surface of the ground on the petitioner\u2019s estate is higher than the surface on the Simpson and Fette estates, and lower than on the Walker estate, the surface of the Walker estate having been raised within ten years by filling in. The ground of the petitioner\u2019s estate is substantially on a level. The surfaces of the yards in the rear of the \u2022estates on Walnut Street now owned by the respondents were at different levels, corresponding to the grade of the slope from Chestnut Street down Walnut Street before they were covered with buildings, and at the date of the covenant the distance from the back of the buildings to the wall in question was about eighteen feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-6\">The wall is built of the same kind of bricks as the house on the petitioner\u2019s estate, and was built- over the wooden plank vaults belonging to the estates of the respondents, and at the ends of the yards the top of these vaults was six feet below the surface of the ground. These vaults years ago were abandoned,, and as the yards were built upon they were filled up, and have all been filled up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-7\">During the hearing, the respondent Walker was allowed to file an additional answer setting up an estoppel, and evidence was admitted in support of its allegations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-8\">Such order or decree was to be entered as law- and justice might require.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>D. E. Ware, </em>for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-5\"><em>J. C. Gray &amp; F. Rackemann, </em>for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b317-6\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuG\">It is quite plain that the literal construction which is contended for by the petitioner could not have been in the minds of the parties to the covenant. Under that construction, the covenantor might at once have erected a building or wall directly abutting upon the existing wall, and carried it up as high as he saw fit. Such a construction would lead to an absurd consequence. So far as light and air were concerned, there would have been no practical difference to the covenantees between such a structure and carrying up the existing wall. It cannot be supposed that this covenant was given and received with the intention of restricting Mr. Coolidge and his heirs and assigns from building a higher wall on the space then occupied by the existing wall, but leaving him at liberty to build as high as he pleased just inside that wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The only question then is whether the words of the covenant will admit of a broader meaning. In our opinion they will. The instrument was in effect a grant of an easement; <em>Bronson </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>108 Mass. 175, 180; <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>151 Mass. 585; and the words may be construed with a leaning against the grantor or covenantor, in order to carry out the obvious intention of the parties. That intention was that no wall or anything else should be built to obstruct in the least degree the light or air above'the height specified. Looking at the words with reference to this obvious intention, they mean that nothing shall be built on that lot next to the wall to obstruct light or air more than the existing wall, or such other wall as is described, would obstruct them.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Such a construction is warranted by the rules which are applied in the construction of contracts, statutes, and other written instruments, with a view of avoiding results which are absurd, or inconsistent with what was meant by the parties to or the framers of the instrument. Met. Con. 278, 279, 303, 307, 312. Leake, Con. \u00a7 189. <em>Grey </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>6 H. L. Cas. 61, 106. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Beech, </em>11 Q. B. 852, 866. <em>Oates </em>v. <em>National Bank, </em>100 U. S. 239, 244. <em>Staniels </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>4 Cush. 314, 316. <em>Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>15 Wall. 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">The petitioner now contends that, if an easement of light and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>air was granted, it has been extinguished or abandoned. If this ground of contention is open, we find no evidence sufficient to support it. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\">We are therefore of opinion that the petitioner\u2019s lot adjoining the wall, to wit, No. 4 Chestnut Street, is subject to an easement in favor of the three lots belonging to the respondents on Walnut Street for light and air, to the extent above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"AlL\">It becomes unnecessary to consider the question of estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
