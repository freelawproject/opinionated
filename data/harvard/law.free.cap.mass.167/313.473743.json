Hearing before <em>Fessenden, </em>J., who refused to rule as requested by the petitioner, and denied the petition; and the petitioner alleged exceptions. The facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-10\"><em>W. R. Bigelow, </em>for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-11\"><em>A. E. Avery, (H. H.

He might have thought that the default resulted from the negligence of the petitioner\u2019s attorney, and that it was best to leave the petitioner to look to him for its remedy. See <em>Sylvester </em>v. Hubley, 157 Mass. 306; <em>Amherst College </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>165 Mass. 178. He might have thought that there was negligence on the part of the officers of the corporation which resulted in the default, and that justice did not require a review of the action. It appeared that, of the five directors of the corporation, only two acted in bringing and prosecuting the .petition, and that two opposed it; the other took no action for or against it. The respondent, who was the treasurer and one of the directors of the corporation, testified that no stock had ever been - issued by the corporation ; that no meeting of the directors or owners had been held since November, 1894, which was ten months before the bringing of the petition ; that the other original corporators of the company had resigned, and that he owned a very large interest in the company. There was also evidence of differences and negotiations between the contending directors in regard to the respondent\u2019s claim, which well might be considered by the judge in determining whether a writ of review should issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">It was plainly a question addressed to -the discretion of the court, whether it was just and equitable, having regard to the interests of all parties, to issue a writ of review. <em>Bowditch Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>3 Gray, 415. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>114 Mass. 54. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>116 Mass. 313. <em>Stillman </em>v. <em>Whittemore, </em>165 Mass. 234. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
