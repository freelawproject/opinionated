S. Walker, and said he wanted to look at that note again, and it was again shown to him; that Wentworth and the witness were present at that inter-Ariew; that after examining the note Walker said, \u201c That is n\u2019t my signature,\u201d and the defendant repeated substantially the same statement, \u201c The signature isn\u2019t mine\u201d; that the witness said to them, \u201c You know what that means, \u2014 then it is a forgery,\u201d and the defendant said, \u201c Yes, that is what I mean \u201d ; that Wentworth inquired of them if they could not arrange to take it up and save the disgrace that would fall on H. S. Walker, who was the brother of the maker of the note, but the reply was made that they had settled up a number of his misdeeds, that he had cost them a great deal of money, that there were a number of other forged notes that were out, that they did not care to do anything about it, and that the matter must rest with the bank ; that Wentworth inquired of the defendant why he had changed his lines from the previous day when he led him to believe he would pay it, and whether it was because he had found there was other forged paper out; that, later in the day, C. P. Walker, the maker of the note, called in and was arrested for forgery; that immediately after C. P. Walker had been removed by the officers, the witness had the property in his store attached and a keeper put in ; that, after Walker was removed from the bank, the witness had a conversation with the defendant, in which the latter said he recognized the signature as a forgery as soon as he saw it; that it was not at all like his own signature, and that he went out to other banks to see if he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>find out how much more of the forged paper bearing his indorsement was out; that he then saw Walker, who told him that there were a number of pieces of paper with his forged indorsement upon them; that Walker was indebted <em>to him, </em>and he was Walker\u2019s bondsman in a criminal action against him for embezzlement; and that he had lost all he intended to by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-4\">The witness further testified : \u201c The bank counsel brought a notice which was shown to me, signed by counsel for Walker, demanding the release of the property held on attachment, as being the property of C.

After examination into the circumstances, I directed the withdrawal of the keeper and the release of the property attached.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-5\">On cross-examination, the witness testified that the exact words that the defendant used in their first interview were, \u201c That note will be paid,\u201d or \u201c The note will be paid <em>\u201d; </em>that he said only those words, and left the bank; that he looked at the paper, turned on his heel as the question was asked, and left without further words; that the second conversation, with the defendant and H. S. Walker, lasted for fifteen minutes ; that when the defendant called the first time he was there only two or three minutes; that his appearance at that interview indicated that the note was news to him ; that the witness supposed from his appearance that he liad \u201c got stuck \u201d on an accommodation indorsement; and that he supposed the note would be taken care of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-6\">Andrew Houghton testified, for the plaintiff, that on June 8, 1893, he, as inspector of police, arrested Charles P. Walker for forgery of the note in suit at the plaintiff bank; that after that he went down to Walker\u2019s place and met the defendant on the sidewalk; and that \u201c he asked me what I had done with him, and I said I had locked him up.

Walker for fifteen years, and had had business dealings with him ; that he first saw the note in suit on the morning of June 6, at the plaintiff bank ; that there was no payment on it at that time; that the indorsement on it was not his signature, and that he never authorized any one to write that name; that his first visit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>to the bank was because of the protest of the note in suit; that he saw there Wentworth, the cashier, but did not know who he was ; that he said, \u201c I have to deny this signature, I have not seen this note before,\u201d and that was all that was said there to him; that during the conversation he did not say to Jaquith or to Wentworth, either in words or in substance, u The note, or that note, will be paid \u201d; that he said nothing, \u201c only what I have just told you, that was all the conversation I had \u201d ; that, at H.

He looked at it. He said nothing, but threw the note down on the cashier\u2019s desk. The cashier said, 6 It is all right, isn\u2019t it? \u2019 The defendant said, \u2018 The note will be paid.\u2019 On June 8, the defendant came to the bank with H. S.

Walker of the same property in part as that attached. The bill of sale was made at the Tombs on the night of June 8.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-4\">\u201c The court is not satisfied that the conversation took place on June 7, 1893, as related by Mr. Wentworth. The court is not satisfied that the defendant made the remark, 1 The note will be paid,\u2019 with intent to mislead the plaintiff bank, and give its officers' to understand that the signature in question was his and genuine, or(with intent to induce the bank to assume that his said statement was an admission of the genuineness of the signature. Nor is the court satisfied that the plaintiff bank relied and acted upon his statement as an admission of the genuineness of his signature.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-6\"><em>A. A. Strout &amp; W. R. </em>Bigelow, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-7\"><em>O. R.

The plaintiff contends that, if the defendant, when the note was first shown to him, knew that the indorsement of his name upon it was a forgery, he was bound to inform the plaintiff of this fact, and that his omission to do so amounted of itself to an affirmation of the signature; There was nothing to show that the defendant had received any benefit from the forgery, or that the forger was his agent for any purpose. Under these circumstances, the defendant was not bound, as a matter of legal duty, to repudiate or disclaim at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>once the genuineness of the signature. His failure to do so was evidence in the nature of an admission, which might be considered as bearing upon the question whether he assumed the signature as his own; but it was not conclusive. <em>Greenfield Bank </em>v. Crafts, 2 Allen, 269, 273. <em>Harrod </em>v. <em>McDaniels, </em>126 Mass. 413. Nor was the defendant\u2019s statement that \u201c the note will be paid \u201d conclusive evidence of a ratification of the signature. It was consistent with the idea that the defendant was surprised at finding his name upon the note, and left the bank saying as little as possible, but meaning only to give the impression that he thought the note would be taken up by some one other than himself. Indeed, his words and manner would seem to have left this impression upon Mr. Jaquith himself. It was competent for the court to find, as it did, upon the evidence, that it was not satisfied that the defendant made the remark with the intent to give the plaintiff's officers to understand that the signature was his, and genuine, or with intent to induce the bank to assume that his statement was an admission of the genuineness of the signature; and this finding negatives ratification. <em>Creamer </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>17 Pick. 332. <em>Wellington </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>121 Mass. 157. <em>Greenfield Bank </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>4 Allen, 447, 455. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Tramel, </em>68 Iowa, 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">2. It was also competent for the court to find, as it did, upon the evidence, that it was not satisfied that the defendant made the remark above mentioned with intent to mislead the plaintiff, or that the plaintiff relied and acted upon his statement as an admission of the genuineness of his signature. According to the rule of law as established in this Commonwealth, this negatives an estoppel. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>164 Mass. 537. <em>Stiff </em>v. <em>Ashton, </em>155 Mass. 130. <em>Fall River National Bank </em>v. <em>Buffinton, </em>97 Mass. 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
