The defendants Shields, Wrightmeyer, Busher, Sheehan, and Ryan being then or theretofore members of the association, in pursuance of a common purpose, in effecting which they all took part, have wrongfully, without right or authority therefor, taken, disposed of, and misappropriated funds and moneys belonging to the association, to the amount of $380.25, less $21.50 returned. This money was paid to and received by the members who seceded or withdrew, as and for their <em>pro rata </em>share of the funds of the association, and without any fraudulent intention, and under a claim of right. The plaintiffs are members of the association, and bring this bill in behalf of themselves and of all the members of the association, and they are entitled to recover from Shields, Wrightmeyer, Busher, Sheehan, and Ryan the sum of $358.75, with interest on the same from December 29, 1894, making in all the sum of $389.54, together with costs of suit, taxed as in an action at law, and as to the other defendants the bill is to be dismissed without costs; and a decree was entered accordingly.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVT\">This case was heard by a justice of the Superior Court upon the pleadings and evidence, and a decree entered for the plaintiffs against some of the defendants, and the bill dismissed without costs as to the other defendants. The evidence was taken by a commissioner appointed by the court at the request of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel contends that the decree should be affirmed against the defendants held liable by the Superior Court, and also that it should be modified so as to include among those held liable some of the defendants as to whom the bill was ordered to be dismissed. We are of opinion that this last contention is not open to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have not appealed from the decree, and it does not appear that they asked to have the case reported. It appears that the evidence was taken and the case reported at the request of the defendants. Although it does- not appear that the defendants have in form appealed from the decree, yet we think that the case as reported should be treated as if the defendants had appealed and the plaintiffs had not. <em>Moors </em>v. Washburn, 159 Mass. 172, 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">The principal question in the case is whether such an association as is described in the bill and shown by the evidence can, by a vote of a majority of its members voting on the question, lawfully authorize its officers to pay out of the money and funds of the association to certain members who are permitted to secede from it and set up another and a different organization, their <em>pro rata </em>share of the property of the association. The constitution and by-laws of tbe association put in evidence contain no provisions which seem to us to authorize such an appropriation of the property of the association. The association was not dissolved by the vote, but continued to exist the same as before. The case on the evidence falls within the decision in <em>McFadden </em>v. Murphy, 149 Mass. 341. See <em>Altmann </em>v. Benz, 12 C. E. Green, 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">We are of opinion that the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
