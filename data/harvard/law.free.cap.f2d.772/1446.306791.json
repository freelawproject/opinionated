We agree that the prescribed thirty-day requirement is jurisdictional and we hold that the NLRB\u2019s regulations governing the filing of EAJA applications do not violate due process. Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-4\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-5\">On January 22, 1982, the NLRB entered a final order dismissing the underlying unfair labor practice complaint against Lord Jim\u2019s, thereby triggering the thirty-day time limit under the EAJA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1536-6\">A party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall, within thirty days of a final disposition in the adversary adjudication, submit to the agency an application which shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award under this section____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1536-7\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a)(2). Although Lord Jim\u2019s contends that its application for attorney\u2019s fees was mailed February 19, 1982, and was received in the NLRB Regional Office on February 22, 1982, the NLRB found that it did not receive the application in its Washington, D.C. office until February 24, 1982, more than thirty days after entry of the final disposition in the underlying proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1536-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"A40z\">This court has jurisdiction over the underlying unfair labor practices adjudication under section 10(f) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f), and thus over the award of fees under the EAJA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(c)(2). We may modify an agency fee determination only if we find that the agency abused its discretion. <em>Id. </em>Lord Jim\u2019s, however, challenges the constitutionality of the NLRB\u2019s filing requirements. This due process challenge and the NLRB\u2019s conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction involve questions of law and are subject to de novo review. <em>See Columbia Manufacturing Corp. v. NLRB, </em>715 F.2d 1409, 1410 (9th Cir.1983) (per curiam); <em>but see Monark Boat Co. v. NLRB, </em>708 F.2d 1322, 1326 (8th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-12\">III. PROVISION AS JURISDICTIONAL</p>\n<p id=\"amo-dedup-0\">Lord Jim\u2019s contends that the thirty-day filing period should be liberally construed, as if it were a statute of limitations. We disagree. The thirty-day period is jurisdictional, <em>see Columbia Manufacturing, </em>715 F.2d at 1410, and the NLRB therefore has no authority to act on applications filed beyond this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-13\">IV. NLRB REGULATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"ADA\">Lord Jim\u2019s also attacks several NLRB rules and regulations as violative of due process. First, Lord Jim\u2019s argues that the NLRB\u2019s failure to notify it more promptly of the final disposition denied it its statutory rights and that the thirty-day period should not begin until the party has actual notice of the disposition. Because the EAJA time limitation is jurisdictional, the NLRB does not have the power to toll the time period until parties receive actual notice. Otherwise, the NLRB would have to read the statute to permit a filing \u201cwithin thirty days <em>after receipt of notice </em>of a final disposition,\u201d <em>see Monark Boat, </em>708 F.2d at 1327-28 (emphasis in original), and this would expand jurisdiction. In this case Lord Jim\u2019s received notice of the NLRB\u2019s decision at the latest within seven days,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> leaving twenty-three days to file its application for fees. Thus we are not confronted with a situation involving such late notification as to deprive a party of its right to file an application. While the NLRB could notify parties of the entry of a final disposition on the date of entry, we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number>believe failure to do so per se violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-5\">Lord Jim\u2019s next contends that the NLRB\u2019s requirement that an EAJA application be received by the NLRB in Washington, D.C., rather than merely in a regional office, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.148 (1984), violates due process by preventing equal access to statutory rights. Congress, however, in enacting the EAJA, permitted each agency to establish procedures for the processing of applications that are consistent with its existing organization. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(c)(1); <em>see also </em>46 Fed.Reg. 15,895 (1981) (Chairman of Administrative Conference noted agency regulations cannot be identical). The NLRB\u2019s requirement that EAJA applications be filed in its central office is consistent with its existing procedures and does not generally prejudice parties. We hold that the requirement as applied in this case does not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-6\">Finally, Lord Jim\u2019s contends that the NLRB\u2019s requirement of receipt, not merely mailing, of an application for attorney\u2019s fees within thirty days after entry of the final disposition violates due process. The EAJA requires only that a party seeking attorney\u2019s fees \u201csubmit\u201d an application within thirty days, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a)(2); neither it nor the legislative history defines the term. The NLRB, under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.148(a) (1984), interpreted \u201csubmit\u201d to mean \u201cfile,\u201d which under NLRB regulations, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.114(b) (1984), means that the application \u201cmust be received by the Board____\u201d The Eighth Circuit in <em>Mo-nark Boat, </em>708 F.2d at 1328-29, upheld this interpretation as consistent with cases holding that a document is filed in a court only when it is received, not when it is mailed. <em>See, e.g., In re Bad Bubba Racing Products, Inc., </em>609 F.2d 815, 816 (5th Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Easement and Right-of-Way, </em>386 F.2d 769, 771 (6th Cir.1967), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>390 U.S. 947, 88 S.Ct. 1034, 19 L.Ed.2d 1136 (1968). <em>But cf. </em>EAJA rules for the FCC, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1.4(e), 1.1521 (1984)(application to be filed in same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding); and OSHA, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2200.8(c), 2204 (1984)(filing deemed effected at the time of mailing). We agree that the NLRB\u2019s interpretation complies with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-11\">Lord Jim\u2019s petition for review of the NLRB\u2019s order dismissing an application for an award under the EAJA is</p>\n<p id=\"Aex0\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1535-12\"> Because the attorney\u2019s fees question presented by this appeal was dependent upon Lord Jim\u2019s being the prevailing party in the underlying labor dispute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504(a)(1), we found it necessary to withhold submission of this case until the appeal from the decision in favor of Lord Jim\u2019s was resolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1535-24\">. The NLRB order is reported at 264 N.L.R.B. No. 147 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1535-25\">.

Lord Jim\u2019s challenges the NLRB\u2019s finding that the application was received on February 24. The NLRB, however, supplemented the record by filing a copy of the application with an NLRB time-stamped date of receipt of February 24. The NLRB relied on this evidence for its finding, and \u2018\u201cevery presumption of regularity attends the action of the Board.\u2019 \u201d <em>Monark Boat Co. v. NLRB, </em>708 F.2d 1322, 1325 (8th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1536-15\">.
