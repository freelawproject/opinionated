We reverse the denial of attorney\u2019s fees and affirm the judgment denying punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">In 1978, CNA sold Starkville an insurance policy especially designed for school districts and school officials. Under the policy terms, CNA agreed to reimburse Starkville for expenses it might incur if it were sued for certain covered causes of action. Specifically excluded from reimbursement, however, were payments of fines and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-15\">Three years later, Starkville submitted a claim under the policy for expenses it had incurred in connection with the defense of a wrongful termination suit. Although the plaintiff had requested both punitive and compensatory damages, the final judgment awarded only costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and minor compensatory damages for mental distress. Starkville\u2019s claim for reimbursement included this judgment, as well as its own costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-16\">CNA, however, denied that the policy covered all of the claimed expenditures, insisting that the damage award and related attorney\u2019s fees were not recompensable under a policy exclusion for \u201cbodily injuries.\u201d In addition, because the policy did not provide reimbursement for punitive damages, CNA contended that Starkville could not recover any of its own attorney\u2019s fees spent in its successful defense of the original plaintiff\u2019s plea for punitive damages. Dissatisfied with this interpretation of the policy and CNA\u2019s final offer to pay about three-fourths of its claim, Starkville brought this bad faith insurance suit, requesting full reimbursement under the policy and punitive damages for CNA\u2019s alleged bad faith refusal to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-17\">The district court ordered CNA to pay all of Starkville\u2019s expenses in connection with the original plaintiff\u2019s damage award. It upheld CNA\u2019s refusal to pay Starkville\u2019s own attorney\u2019s fees in full, however, allowing the exclusion of whatever portion was attributable to the punitive damage defense. The parties stipulated that $500 had been spent on that defense; the court then entered judgment against CNA for the full amount of Starkville\u2019s claim minus the stipulated $500. The court also denied Stark-ville\u2019s request for punitive damages because CNA had a legitimate reason for refusing to pay. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-18\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b257-19\">Starkville contends that the policy provides for reimbursement of all its attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defense of covered causes of action. It further argues that it is entitled to punitive damages because CNA unjustifiably refused to pay its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Under Mississippi\u2019s rules for the construction of insurance contracts, unambiguous language in an insurance policy must be given its ordinary and plain meaning. <em>Benton v. Canal Ins. Co., </em>241 Miss. 493, 507-09, 130 So.2d 840, 846 (1961). Terms susceptible to two interpretations, however \u2014 particularly those involving exceptions and limitations to the policy\u2019s coverage \u2014 must be construed more strictly against the insurer, as drafter of the disputed provisions. <em>National Old Line Ins. Co. v. Brownlee, </em>349 So.2d 513, 514 (Miss. 1977). Where an insurer wishes to exclude certain items from the policy\u2019s coverage, it must do so explicitly. <em>See Michael v. National Sec. Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>458 F.Supp. 128, 130 (N.D.Miss.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The controversy in this case centers around the definition of reimbursable expenses, or \u201closs.\u201d The definitional paragraph lists types of covered expenses, including the \u201ccost of investigation and defense of legal actions, (excluding ... salaries of officers or employees of the School District ...),\u201d and then provides that \u201csuch subject of loss shall not include fines imposed by law, or matters which shall be deemed uninsurable under the law.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties agree that punitive damage awards constitute a \u201cfine\u201d or \u201cuninsurable matter\u201d; however, CNA contends, and the district court concurred, that the proviso also excludes all other expenses related to a plea for punitive damages, whether or not those damages are actually assessed. Starkville interprets the proviso as excluding only an assessed fine or punitive damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Applying the Mississippi rules of construction to this proviso, we agree with Starkville\u2019s interpretation: the $500 spent defending against the punitive damage plea constitutes a \u201closs\u201d for which CNA must reimburse Starkville. Although the language of the proviso may be susceptible to a broader interpretation, only fines and other uninsurable matters are expressly excluded from the definition of reimbursable \u201closs.\u201d While punitive damages themselves may be uninsurable for reasons of public policy, that same public policy does not apply to costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in a defense against a plea for punitive damages, particularly where the defense is successful. If CNA intended to exclude these other costs from the policy\u2019s coverage, it needed to do so more explicitly \u2014 as it did elsewhere both in the same paragraph, for employee salaries, and in Part IV, for all losses \u201cin connection with\u201d excluded causes of action. <em>See </em>R. 11-12. We reverse this part of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Mississippi bad faith insurance law permits the award of punitive damages only when the insurer had no \u201carguable or legitimate reason\u201d for denying an insured\u2019s claim. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mississippi v. Campbell, </em>466 So.2d 833, 841 (Miss.1984); <em>Standard Life Ins. Co. of Indiana v. Veal, </em>354 So.2d 239, 248 (Miss.1977). Here, CNA convinced the able district court that it reasonably refused to pay the claim in full. There can be no doubt that it had a tenable position. This part of the judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part. The cause is REMANDED for modification of the judgment to award Stark-ville its full attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\">. The full text of the paragraph reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">Loss shall mean any amount which the Assureds are legally obligated to pay or for which the School District may be required or permitted to pay as indemnity to the Assureds, for a claim or claims made against the Assureds for a Wrongful Act and shall include but not be limited to damages, judgments, settlements and costs, cost of investigation and defense of legal actions, (excluding from such costs of investigation and defense, salaries of officers or employees of the School District or any other governmental body) claims or proceedings and appeals therefrom, cost of attachment or similar bonds, provided always, however, such subject of loss shall not include fines imposed by law, or matters which shall be deemed uninsurable under the law pursuant to which this policy shall be construed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">(R. 11-12).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
