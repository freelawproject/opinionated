MNB cross-appeals the district court\u2019s order denying its first motion for summary judgment. For the reasons which follow, we affirm the district court in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-12\">On March 18, 1983, the United States brought this action alleging that under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3505(a) &amp; (b), MNB was liable to it for unpaid federal income and social security taxes owed by Dri-Mix Products, Inc. (Dri-Mix). The complaint alleged that beginning in January, 1977, MNB paid wages directly to employees of Dri-Mix and supplied funds to Dri-Mix for the specific purpose of paying net wages to employees with notice or knowledge that Dri-Mix did not intend to, or would not be able to, make timely payment or deposit of the amounts of taxes required by law to be deducted and withheld. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1611-15\">MNB answered, and both parties subsequently filed motions for summary judgment. These motions were denied by the district court on May 16, 1984. MNB thereafter sought and was granted leave to amend its answer to assert the affirmative defense that the United States failed to give MNB notice of the assessments against Dri-Mix within the 60-day period required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6303(a). Defendant filed its second motion for summary judgment, contending that the United States\u2019 failure to give MNB the \u00a7 6303(a) notice precluded the United States from bringing suit. The district court, relying on <em>United States v. Associates Commercial Corp., </em>721 F.2d 1094 (7th Cir.1983), agreed with MNB and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The United States filed a timely notice of appeal, and MNB cross-appealed the district court\u2019s order denying its first motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-16\">II. THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1611-17\">The United States argues on appeal that it was not required to give MNB the \u00a7 6303(a) notice of assessment as a prerequisite to suit against MNB for Dri-Mix\u2019s unpaid employment taxes. The Seventh Circuit, in <em>Associates Commercial Corp., </em>rejected an identical argument. In that case, the court noted that \u00a7 6303(a) \u201crequires that notice of an assessment of unpaid taxes must be provided to 'each person liable for the unpaid tax\u2019 within sixty days after the assessment was made, unless otherwise provided by the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d 721 F.2d at 1098. Since \u00a7 3505 did not exempt from \u00a7 6303(a) lenders potentially liable, and since no other exemption could be found, the court concluded that the lender, a \u201cperson liable for the unpaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1524\">*1524</page-number>tax\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 6303(a), was entitled to notice of assessment of the unpaid tax. 721 F.2d at 1098. The court held that the government\u2019s failure to provide the statutorily required notice barred its suit. <em>Id. </em>We agree with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s reading of the applicable statutory provisions and hold that the United States\u2019 failure to provide MNB with the \u00a7 6303(a) notice bars the present suit against MNB.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1612-4\">III. MNB\u2019S CROSS-APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1612-5\">MNB appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its first motion for summary judgment. Counsel for MNB all but conceded at oral argument, however, that this appeal is without merit. We agree and affirm the district court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1612-6\">Summary judgment is appropriate only when the moving party has sustained its burden of proving that there exists no genuine issue of material fact after reviewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. [citations omitted]. The district court\u2019s order granting a summary judgment motion is not a discretionary decision and thus will be independently reviewed by the appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1612-7\"><em>Wong v. Bailey, </em>752 F.2d 619, 620-21 (11th Cir.1985). The decision to <em>deny </em>a summary judgment, however, is discretionary with a trial court, and we will reverse only for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Johnson v. Bryant, </em>671 F.2d 1276, 1279 (11th Cir.1982); <em>see also Marcus v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>651 F.2d 379, 382 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (a district court may, in a proper case, deny \u201charsh remedy\u201d of summary judgment even if the motion is justifiable under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, if the court, in \u201cthe sound exercise of judicial discretion,\u201d decides \u201cto give the parties an opportunity to fully develop the case.\u201d). After carefully reviewing the record with these principles in mind, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying MNB\u2019s first motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"agl-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1612-8\">. The United States also argues that even if \u00a7 6303(a) requires notice to third-parties such as MNB, the failure to give notice does not preclude suit to collect on MNB\u2019s alleged \u00a7 3505 liability. The United States contends that it has an inherent common law right to sue to collect debts which is entirely independent of the assessment process. Appellant, however, ignores the fact that third-party derivative liability of the sort set forth in \u00a7 3505 is a creature of statutory, not common, law. This argument is therefore untenable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
