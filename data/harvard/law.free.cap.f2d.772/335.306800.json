CAMPBELL, Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Gregory Wentz, the plaintiff below, brings this appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Department of Justice. The plaintiff brought this suit under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, seeking to compel the defendant to amend a document maintained in the files of the United States Attorney for the District of North Dakota. The district court held that the general exemption from the disclosure and amendment requirements of the Privacy Act authorized by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2) applied to that system of records and granted judgment for the defendant. Appellant challenges that conclusion on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Wentz was convicted in the United States District Court for North Dakota of two drug-related crimes and subsequently pled guilty to a charge of unlawfully carrying a firearm during the commission of a felony. Pursuant to the terms of his guilty plea, appellant agreed to cooperate with the government by furnishing information relating to drug shipments. On March 13, 1981, Wentz was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment on the three charges. In May of that year, Gary Annear, the Assistant United States Attorney who prosecuted appellant, prepared a Form 792 relating to Wentz. That document is entitled \u201cReport on a Convicted Prisoner by a United States Attorney.\u201d The function of Form 792 is to inform the United States Parole Commission of the prosecutor\u2019s opinion regarding the prisoner and the propriety of granting him parole. The document requests information regarding, <em>inter alia, </em>the details of the prisoner\u2019s crimes and the prisoner\u2019s assistance, if any, with the government. With respect to Wentz\u2019s cooperation with the government, Annear stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-12\">The defendant and co-defendants have refused to cooperate at all in the resolution of this case. In fact they have thrown up obstacle after obstacle in our attempt to find out who the persons involved in this case are, both who they were going to supply and who supplied them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">The Form 792 also has a section entitled \u201cdisclosure instructions\u201d which provides two alternatives:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-14\">_This report may be disclosed to the prisoner prior to his parole hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-16\">_ An additional copy of this report with deletions of exempt material, and a summary of this deleted material, are attached for disclosure to the prisoner. The original is to be shown to the Parole Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-17\">The form filled out by Annear relating to Wentz indicated that full disclosure could be made .to the prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-18\">Copies of the Form 792 are retained in three separate record systems: (1) the United States Attorney\u2019s File (designated JUSTICE/USA-007); (2) the United States Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Central File (designated JUSTICE/BOP-005); and (3) United States Parole Commission\u2019s Inmate and Supervision File (designated JUSTICE/USPC-003). Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2), the Justice Department has promulgated regulations exempting all three of those filing systems from the access requirements of the Privacy Act, <em>see </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 16.81, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>16.85, 16.97. It is uncontroverted that those regulations were properly promulgated in accordance with the procedural requirements of the Privacy Act. Those regulations do provide for limited disclosure, <em>see </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 16.81(c), 16.85(d), 16.97(c); and the Parole Commission is required to provide access to certain documents pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Soon after his incarceration, the Form 792 filled out by Annear was disclosed to Wentz by the Bureau of Prisons. On October 7, 1981 appellant wrote a letter to the prosecutor requesting him to amend his statement regarding the lack of cooperation. Annear declined to do so. On June 16, 1982, the Parole Commission disclosed certain documents to Wentz including the Form 792. He then wrote to the United States Attorney for the District of North Dakota requesting that the document be amended pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(2) to indicate that he had cooperated with the government. Annear responded by writing a letter to the Parole Commission saying that the statement on the Form 792 was accurate and no amendment was appropriate. Wentz then wrote another letter to the United States Attorney requesting amendment of the form but no change was ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Appellant filed his complaint in the District Court on November 3, 1982 seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the Justice Department. Wentz alleged numerous causes of action; however, the only issue before this Court is whether the District Court properly granted summary judgment on the Privacy Act claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The specific remedy appellant seeks on this appeal is the amendment of the Form 792 maintained in the United States Attorney\u2019s record system. He disclaims any interest in amending the corresponding documents in the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 file or the Parole Commission\u2019s file. He contends that if he prevails with respect to the United States Attorney\u2019s copy, that agency will be required, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(4), to notify any other agency to whom it has disclosed the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">While appellant concedes that the Justice Department has promulgated regulations to exempt the JUSTICE/USA-007 system from the requirements of the Privacy Act, he argues that those regulations do not apply to this case. He notes that 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.81(b)(3) only addresses \u201caccess to the records\u201d and therefore, he contends, the regulations only exempted the United States Attorney\u2019s files from disclosure. He further argues that since the Form 792 has already been disclosed to him, the regulations have no relevancy to his right to amend the document pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d)(2). There are numerous flaws in this argument which require its rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">This Court recently discussed the Privacy Act in the context of law enforcement records systems in <em>Shapiro v. Drug Enforcement Agency, </em>721 F.2d 215 (7th Cir.1983). In that opinion, the Court noted that the exemption authorized by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2) is a general exemption which applies to a whole system of records of the agency and therefore the Privacy Act \u201cdoes not require that a regulation\u2019s rationale for exempting a record from disclosure apply in each particular case,\u201d 721 F.2d at 218. Examined in this broader context, the rationale for the exemption of the United States Attorney\u2019s files from the disclosure provisions of the Privacy Act is relevant and valid with respect to the Form 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">The Parole Commission provided Wentz with the Form 792 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b) which requires that the prisoner be provided with \u201creasonable access to a report or other document to be used by the Commission in making its determination,\u201d <em>see e.g. Wilden v. Fields, </em>510 F.Supp. 1295, 1312 (W.D.Wis.1981). However, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c) specifically authorizes the deletion of certain information from the documents disclosed to the prisoner, <em>see Brunnelle v. Kerr, </em>557 F.Supp. 969 (W.D.Wis.1983). As noted previously, the Form 792 provides for the excision of certain information from the copy revealed to the prisoner. Therefore, the regulations exempting the United States Attorney\u2019s files from disclosure are still relevant to the Form 792 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>since, in certain situations, the copy retained in the JUSTICE/USA-007 file would contain information not revealed in the prisoner\u2019s copy. Therefore, the Justice Department is not required to disclose the Form 792. This exemption applies to Wentz as well, even though he had seen the Parole Commission\u2019s copy, since \u201cthe rationale of the exemption need not apply in each particular case,\u201d <em>Shapiro, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Since Wentz is not entitled to have access to the copy of the Form 792 in the United States Attorney\u2019s files, and that is the only copy he wishes to amend, we could uphold the district court\u2019s decision on the rationale that you cannot amend a document if you don\u2019t have access to it, <em>see e.g. Exner v. F.B.I., </em>612 F.2d 1202, 1204 (9th Cir.1980). However, we need not rely only on that simplistic reasoning to uphold the exemption in this case. We also conclude that the Justice Department\u2019s regulations do address the amendment provisions of the Privacy Act and provide valid reasons, consistent with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j), for exempting the United States Attorney\u2019s files from that requirement of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The right to request amendment of agency records and to seek to compel such amendment is provided in subsection (d) of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a. The Justice Department regulations specifically exempt the United States Attorney\u2019s files from that subsection, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.81(b)(3). While the regulation discusses \u201caccess to records,\u201d which might seem to designate only disclosure considerations, that phrase is the title of the entire subsection (d) in the statute. Furthermore, as noted previously, the ability to amend a document presupposes access to it. Therefore, we believe there is no doubt that the exemption was intended to cover both the disclosure and the amendment requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the reasons for the exemption stated in 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.81(b)(3) are not relevant to the amendment of a document previously disclosed, in whole or in part, is not persuasive in light of the remedy he seeks. In his initial brief, he requests that this Court remand the case to the district court \u201cfor a <em>de novo </em>determination of whether Wentz\u2019s Form 792 should be amended in accordance with his request,\u201d Appellant\u2019s br. p. 27. Such relief would require a trial on the factual issue of whether Wentz has cooperated with the government. The appellant relies on the court reporter\u2019s notes from his guilty plea to support his contention that he cooperated. However, that evidence is irrelevant to the issue. Annear did not state on the Form 792 that Wentz did not agree to cooperate; he said that he had not, in fact, cooperated. The fact that a promise has been made is not probative of whether the promise was performed. A determination as to whether appellant cooperated would require evidence of the information appellant provided and the results of the Justice Department\u2019s utilization of it. It is clear from the Form 792 that the government is trying to discover the identity of Wentz\u2019s suppliers and the people he intended to supply. The statement of An-near regarding appellant\u2019s cooperation indicates that Wentz has provided no useful information or that he has provided misinformation. If we were to require the Justice Department to present evidence in support of Annear\u2019s statement, we would force it to reveal details of its investigation. This could cause the defendant to disclose to Wentz \u201cinformation that might enable him to avoid detection, apprehension, or legal obligations,\u201d 28 C.F.R.- \u00a7 16.81(b)(3). For as this Court has previously noted with respect to Wentz and Alfred Shapiro:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">[T]he fact that appellants already have been convicted does not mean that the [Justice Department] is no longer investigating them. <em>Shapiro, supra, </em>721 F.2d at 218.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">More importantly, to the extent the Justice Department is pursuing the other participants in the drug importation scheme, revelation of the progress of its investigation would \u201cpresent a serious impediment to law enforcement,\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.81(b)(3). Therefore, we find no merit to appellant\u2019s argument that the considerations listed in the regulation are not relevant to the amendment provisions of the Privacy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>We recognize that exemptions to the Privacy Act\u2019s access and challenge provisions must be narrowly construed and that the exemption requirements must be strictly satisfied, <em>Hernandez v. Alexander, </em>671 F.2d 402, 407 (10th Cir.1982); <em>Nemetz v. Dept. of Treasury, </em>446 F.Supp. 102, 105 (N.D.Ill.1978). However, our holding does not violate those principles. We have not broadened the scope of the exemption authorized in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2); the Form 792 is indisputably within the category of documents described in that provision. That statute requires that the Justice Department\u2019s regulations state \u201cthe reasons why the system of records is to be exempted <em>from a provision of this section,\u201d </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2). The regulations of the Justice Department satisfy that requirement since they specifically exempt the records from subsection (d) of that statute, <em>see </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.81(b)(3). Furthermore, the reasons provided in the regulation justify the decision to invoke the exemption. Therefore, the requirements of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(j)(2) have been strictly satisfied and, even under a narrow construction, the exemption applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b427-5\">CUDAHY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"av_-dedup-0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The Privacy Act allows government agencies to exempt certain information from disclosure and amendment. The information, at issue here \u2014 the nonsensitive information included on that part of a 792 form that can be shown to a prisoner \u2014 cannot be exempted from disclosure. Nevertheless, the government argues that it can be exempted from amendment. Assuming, as the Act does, that amendment is on balance just and useful, I believe the present result is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">We must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the details of record-keeping. What is at issue here is information, not the location of certain pieces of paper. The law says that the nonsensitive information on a 792 form cannot be kept from a prisoner; indeed, the law requires that it be made available to him. If there is some reason to distinguish amendment from disclosure, so that information that cannot be exempted from disclosure can nonetheless be exempted from amendment, the burden would seem to be on the government to say what that reason is.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Unfortunately the majority has accepted an argument that is based on speculation and would justify shielding nearly all Justice Department records from amendment. The reason for avoiding disclosure of certain information is clear: in the case of criminal investigations, it would be indefensible to require law enforcement agencies to give up information that might undermine ongoing criminal investigations. But why avoid amendment of material that has been disclosed? The government relies <em>not </em>on the dangers of amendment itself \u2014 there aren\u2019t any \u2014 but on the dangers that might accompany the hearing required when the government refuses to amend. For if there were a hearing, according to the government, <em>other </em>information about ongoing investigations might be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">A more speculative argument is hard to imagine. The information relevant to the question of cooperation is information about the behavior of the prisoner, and there is no reason why a hearing could not be limited to such evidence. In allowing the government to win on that argument, the majority is inviting it to insulate from amendment a whole body of information only tangentially related to anything sensitive. Today\u2019s holding would allow agencies to classify information not on the basis of content but on the basis of the sensitivity of information that might be called for in a hearing about amendment. If the courts are anxious to take an agency\u2019s word for what might be disclosed at such a hearing, it is difficult to imagine any information held by a law enforcement agency that will not be exempt from amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">Nothing terrible will happen in the particular case; it seems to me that Wentz is unlikely to be able to prove something so vague as cooperation. But the force of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>statute is further eroded. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
