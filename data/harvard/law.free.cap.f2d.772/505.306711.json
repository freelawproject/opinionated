After a bench trial, the district court found infringement and awarded the plaintiffs $22,-000 as a share of defendants\u2019 profits. Plaintiffs appeal and defendants cross-appeal. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-23\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b597-24\">The original version of <em>Kismet </em>was a dramatic play, written by Edward Knob-lock in 1911. Knoblock copyrighted the play as an unpublished work in that year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>and again as a published work in 1912. Knoblock\u2019s copyright expired in 1967, and the dramatic play <em>Kismet </em>entered the public domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">In 1952, plaintiff Edwin Lester acquired the right to produce a musical stage production of the dramatic play <em>Kismet. </em>Lester hired plaintiffs Luther Davis and Charles Lederer to write the libretto and plaintiffs Robert Wright and George Forrest to write the music and lyrics for the musical adaptation. In 1953 and 1954, Led-erer and Davis copyrighted their dramatico-musical play <em>Kismet, </em>and in 1953, Wright and Forrest assigned to plaintiff Frank Music Corporation the right to copyright all portions of the musical score written for <em>Kismet. </em>Frank Music subsequently obtained copyrights for the entire musical score and for each of the songs in the score.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In 1954, Lederer, Wright, and Forrest entered into a license agreement with Loew\u2019s, Inc., a predecessor of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., (\u201cMGM, Inc.\u201d) granting to it the right to produce a musical motion picture based on plaintiffs\u2019 play. MGM released its motion picture version of <em>Kismet, </em>starring Howard Keel and Ann Blyth, in 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The story presented in the MGM film and in plaintiffs\u2019 dramatico-musical play is essentially the same as that told in Knob-lock\u2019s dramatic play. It is the tale of a day in the life of a poetic beggar named Hajj and his daughter, Marsinah. The story is set in ancient Baghdad, with major scenes in the streets of Baghdad, the Wazir\u2019s palace, an enchanted garden, and the Wazir\u2019s harem.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">On April 26, 1974, defendant MGM Grand Hotel premiered a musical revue entitled <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>in the hotel\u2019s Ziegfield Theatre. The show was staged, produced, and directed by defendant Donn Arden. It featured ten acts of singing, dancing, and variety performances. Of the ten acts, four were labeled as \u201ctributes\u201d to MGM motion pictures of the past, and one was a tribute to the \u201cZiegfield Follies.\u201d The remaining acts were variety numbers, which included performances by a live tiger, a juggler, and the magicians, Siegfried and Roy.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The Ziegfield Theatre, where <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>was performed, is a lavish showplace. Its special features, including huge elevators used to raise or lower portions of the stage and ceiling lifts capable of lowering performers down into the audience during the shows, reportedly provide impressive special effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Act IV of <em>Hallelujah Hollywood, </em>the subject of this lawsuit, was entitled \u201cKismet,\u201d and was billed as a tribute to the MGM movie of that name. Comprised of four scenes, it was approximately eleven and one-half minutes in length. It was set in ancient Baghdad, as was plaintiffs\u2019 play, and the characters were called by the same or similar names to those used in plaintiffs\u2019 play. Five songs were taken in whole or in part from plaintiffs\u2019 play. No dialogue was spoken during the act, and, in all, it contained approximately six minutes of music taken directly from plaintiffs\u2019 play.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">The total running time of <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>was approximately 100 minutes, except on Saturday nights when two acts were deleted, shortening the show to 75 minutes. The show was performed three times on Saturday evenings, twice on the other evenings of the week.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">On November 1,1974, plaintiffs informed MGM Grand that they considered <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>to infringe their rights in <em>Kismet. </em>MGM Grand responded that it believed its use of plaintiffs\u2019 music was covered by its blanket license agreement with the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (\u201cASCAP\u201d). In 1965, plaintiffs had granted to ASCAP the right to license certain rights in the musical score of their play <em>Kismet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">Plaintiffs filed this action, alleging copyright infringement, unfair competition, and breach of contract. MGM Grand continued to present <em>Hallelujah Hollywood, </em>including Act IV \u201cKismet,\u201d until July 16, 1976, when the hotel substituted new music in Act IV. In all, the \u201cKismet\u201d sequence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>used in approximately 1700 performances of the show.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A1k\">A. <em>Scope of the ASCAP License</em></p>\n<p id=\"A4H\">Paragraph one of the ASCAP license gives MGM Grand the right to perform publicly \u201cnon-dramatic renditions of the separate musical compositions\u201d in the ASCAP repertory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Paragraph three excludes from the license \u201cdramatico-musical works, or songs [accompanied by] visual representation of the work from which the music is <em>taken____\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The district court addressed both of these clauses and concluded that Act IV of <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>was nondramatic but contained visual representations of plaintiffs\u2019 play. The court therefore held that Act IV exceeded the scope of the ASCAP license. We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of the agreement because the court interpreted the agreement from the face of the document and as a matter of law. <em>In re Financial Securities Litigation, </em>729 F.2d 628, 631-32 (9th Cir.1984). We apply the clearly erroneous standard to its findings as to the sufficiency of the visual representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">We agree with the result reached by the district court, but not with its approach. We agree that Act IV \u201cKismet\u201d was accompanied by \u201cvisual representation\u201d of plaintiffs\u2019 play. Accordingly, defendants\u2019 use was excluded from the ASCAP license by the express terms of paragraph three. We conclude, however, that there is no reason to consider, as the district court did, whether Act IV was \u201cnon-dramatic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-14\">The district court found the following \u201cvisual representations\u201d: plaintiffs\u2019 songs were performed in <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>by singers identified as characters from plaintiffs\u2019 <em>Kismet, </em>dressed in costumes designed to recreate <em>Kismet, </em>and the performance made use of locale, settings, scenery, props, and dance style music of the type used in plaintiffs\u2019 work.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">The defendants do not challenge the finding that their production contained these visual representations. They argue, instead, that the district court failed to give sufficient consideration to whether the visual representations in Act IV were \u201cof the work from which the music is taken,\u201d i.e., plaintiffs\u2019 <em>Kismet. </em>Defendants suggest that this distinction is important because plaintiffs\u2019 <em>Kismet </em>is a derivative work. They argue that many of the visual representations, (e.g., street scenes in ancient Baghdad, swarming bazaars, and an oriental palace), could be said to be derived from Edward Knoblock\u2019s 1911 dramatic version of <em>Kismet </em>rather than from plaintiffs\u2019 <em>Kismet. </em>Since Knobloek\u2019s play is in the public domain, defendants contend these visual representations are not protectable by plaintiffs\u2019 copyright. Defendants further argue that other elements of the \u201cvisual representations,\u201d such as choreography style and character names, also are not protectable by copyright.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>We find defendants\u2019 arguments unpersuasive for two reasons. First, their suggestion that they might have derived portions of Act IV from Knoblock\u2019s 1911 play is directly contradicted in the record. Arden created Act IV as a tribute to the MGM musical <em>Kismet, </em>which was derived from plaintiffs\u2019 play. While preparing Act IV, he obtained the Broadway score of plaintiffs\u2019 play and screened the MGM motion picture. The record does not show that any of Act IV was based on Knob-lock\u2019s 1911 dramatic version of Kismet.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">More important, defendants\u2019 argument is unpersuasive because it is simply irrelevant. The question we face is not whether the \u201cvisual representations\u201d are copyrightable, but whether the use of a copyrighted work exceeds the scope of an ASCAP license because visual representations accompanied the songs. The license agreement does not refer to \u201ccopyrightable\u201d visual representations. The district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that Act IV \u201cKismet\u201d was accompanied by sufficient<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> visual representations derived from plaintiffs\u2019 play to place the songs\u2019 use beyond the scope of the ASCAP license.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The district court properly concluded that defendants infringed plaintiffs\u2019 copyrights in <em>Kismet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">B. <em>Recovery for Infringement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The Copyright Act of 1909<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provided three forms of recovery to a plaintiff whose copyright had been infringed: actual damages, infringer\u2019s profits, or statutory \u201cin lieu\u201d damages. The Act provided for recovery of \u201csuch damages as the copyright proprietor may have suffered due to the infringement, as well as all the profits which the infringer shall have made from such an infringement____\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(b) (1970). The Act further provided that a court could award \u201cin lieu of actual damages and profits, such damages as to the court shall appear to be just\u201d within certain prescribed minima and maxima. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-14\">A court making an award for copyright infringement must, if possible, determine both the plaintiff\u2019s actual damages and the defendant\u2019s profits derived from the infringement. <em>Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions, Inc. v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>562 F.2d 1157, 1172 (9th Cir.1977) <em>(Krofft I). </em>In this circuit, we have construed section 101(b) of the 1909 Act as allowing recovery of the greater of the plaintiff\u2019s damage or the defendant\u2019s profits. <em>Krofft I, </em>562 F.2d at 1176; <em>Universal Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corp., </em>162 F.2d 354, 376 (9th Cir.1947).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-15\">\n<em>1. Actual Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AED\">\u201cActual damages\u201d are the extent to which the market value of a copyrighted work has been injured or destroyed by an infringement. 3 M. Nimmer, <em>Nimmer on Coyyright </em>\u00a7 14.02, at 14-6 (1985). In this circuit, we have stated the test of market value as \u201cwhat a willing buyer would have been reasonably required to pay to a willing seller for plaintiffs\u2019 work.\u201d <em>Krofft I, </em>562 F.2d at 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The district court declined to award actual damages. The court stated that it was \u201cunconvinced that the market value of-plaintiffs\u2019 work was in any way diminished as a result of defendant\u2019s infringement.\u201d We are obliged to sustain this finding unless we conclude it is clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>see County of Ventura v. Blackburn, </em>362 F.2d 515, 521 (9th Cir.1966); <em>Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. 4636 S. Vermont Ave., Inc., </em>367 F.2d 236, 241 (9th Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Plaintiffs contend the district court\u2019s finding is clearly erroneous<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in light of the evidence they presented concerning the royalties <em>Kismet </em>could have earned in a full Las Vegas production. Plaintiffs did offer evidence of the royalties <em>Kismet </em>had earned in productions around the country. They also introduced opinion testimony, elicited from plaintiff Lester and from Kismet\u2019s leasing agent, that a full production of <em>Kismet </em>could have been licensed in Las Vegas for $7,500 per week. And they introduced other opinion testimony to the effect that <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>had destroyed the Las Vegas market for a production of plaintiffs\u2019 <em>Kismet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">In a copyright action, a trial court is entitled to reject a proffered measure of damages if it is too speculative. <em>See Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Jobella Fabrics, Inc., </em>329 F.2d 194, 196-97 (2d Cir.1964). Although uncertainty as to the amount of damages will not preclude recovery, uncertainty as to the fact of damages may. <em>Unviersal Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corp., </em>162 F.2d at 369; <em>see also </em>3 M. Nimmer, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.02, at 14-8 to -9. It was the <em>fact </em>of damages that concerned the district court. The court found that plaintiffs \u201cfailed to establish <em>any </em>damages attributable to the infringement.\u201d (emphasis in original). This finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Plaintiffs offered no disinterested testimony showing that <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>precluded plaintiffs from presenting <em>Kismet </em>at some other hotel in Las Vegas. It is not implausible to conclude, as the court below apparently did, that a production presenting six minutes of music from <em>Kismet, </em>without telling any of the story of the play, would not significantly impair the prospects for presenting a full production of that play.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>record presented, the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that plaintiffs\u2019 theory of damages was uncertain and speculative.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">\n<em>2. Infringer\u2019s Profits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">As an alternative to actual damages, a prevailing plaintiff in an infringement action is entitled to recover the infringer\u2019s profits to the extent they are attributable to the infringement. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(b); <em>Krofft, </em>562 F.2d at 1172. In establishing the infringer\u2019s profits, the plaintiff is required to prove only the defendant\u2019s sales; the burden then shifts to the defendant to prove the elements of costs to be deducted from sales in arriving at profit. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(b). Any doubt as to the computation of costs or profits is to be resolved in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. Remington Records, Inc., </em>265 F.2d 263 (2d Cir.1959). If the infringing defendant does not meet its burden of proving costs, the gross figure stands as the defendant\u2019s profits. <em>Russell v. Price, </em>612 F.2d 1123, 1130-31 (9th Cir.1979), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>446 U.S. 952, 100 S.Ct. 2919, 64 L.Ed.2d 809 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">The district court, following this approach, found that the gross revenue MGM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Grand earned from the presentation of <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>during the relevant time period was $24,191,690. From that figure, the court deducted direct costs of $18,060,084 and indirect costs (overhead) of $3,641,960, thus arriving at a net profit of $2,489,646.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge these computations on a number of grounds. Several of the objections plaintiffs raise require only brief discussion; we dispose of these in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But three of their objections are more serious, and deserve closer scrutiny. Plaintiffs claim the district court erred in allowing deductions for overhead expenses for two reasons: because the infringement was \u201cconscious and deliberate,\u201d and because defendants failed to show that each item of claimed overhead assisted in the production of the infringement. Plaintiffs also contend the court erred in not including in gross profits some portion of MGM\u2019s earnings on its hotel and gaming operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">A portion of an infringer\u2019s overhead properly may be deducted from gross revenues to arrive at profits, at least where the infringement was not willful, conscious, or deliberate. <em>Kamar International, Inc. v. Russ Berrie &amp; Co., </em>752 F.2d 1326, 1331 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Sammons v. Colonial Press, Inc., </em>126 F.2d 341, 351 (1st Cir.1942); 3 M. Nimmer, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.03[B], at 14-16.1. Plaintiffs argue that the infringement here was conscious and deliberate, but the district court found to the contrary. The court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous. Defendants believed their use of <em>Kismet </em>was protected under MGM Grand\u2019s ASCAP license. Although their contention ultimately proved to be wrong, it was not implausible. Defendants reasonably could have believed that their production was not infringing plaintiffs\u2019 copyrights, and, therefore, the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that their conduct was not willful. <em>See Kamar International, Inc. v. Russ Berrie &amp; Co., </em>752 F.2d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>We find more merit in plaintiffs\u2019 second challenge to the deduction of overhead costs. They argue that defendants failed to show that each item of claimed overhead assisted in the production of the infringement. The evidence defendants introduced at trial segregated overhead expenses into general categories, such as general and administrative costs, sales and advertising, and engineering and maintenance. Defendants then allocated a portion of these costs to the production of <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>based on a ratio of the revenues from that production as compared to MGM Grand\u2019s total revenues. The district court adopted this approach.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">We do not disagree with the district court\u2019s acceptance of the defendants\u2019 method of allocation, based on gross revenues. Because a theoretically perfect allocation is impossible, we require only a \u201creasonably acceptable formula.\u201d <em>Sammons v. Colonial Press, Inc., </em>126 F.2d at 349; <em>see Kamar International, Inc. v. Russ Berrie &amp; Co., </em>752 F.2d at 1333. We find, as did the district court, that defendants\u2019 method of allocation is reasonably acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We disagree with the district court, however, to the extent it concluded the defendants adequately showed that the claimed overhead expenses actually contributed to the production of <em>Hallelujah Hollywood. </em>Recently, in <em>Kamar International, </em>we stated that a deduction for overhead should be allowed \u201conly when the infringer can demonstrate that [the overhead expense] was of actual assistance in the production, distribution or sale of the infringing product.\u201d 752 F.2d at 1332 (citation omitted); <em>accord Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, Co., </em>106 F.2d 45, 54 (2d Cir.1939) <em>(Sheldon I), aff'd, </em>309 U.S. 390, 60 S.Ct. 681, 84 L.Ed. 825 (1940). We do not take this to mean that an infringer must prove his overhead expenses and their relationship to the infringing produc tion in minute detail. <em>See Sheldon I, </em>106 F.2d at 52; <em>Sterns-Roger Manufacturing Co. v. Ruth, </em>87 F.2d 35, 41-42 (10th Cir.1936). Nonetheless, the defendant bears the burden of explaining, at least in general terms, how claimed overhead actually contributed to the production of the infringing work. <em>See Kamar International, Inc. v. Russ Berrie &amp; Co., </em>752 F.2d at 1333; <em>Taylor v. Meirick, </em>712 F.2d 1112, 1121-22 (7th Cir.1983) (\u201cIt is too much to ask a plaintiff who has proved infringement also to do the defendant\u2019s cost accounting.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">We do not doubt that some of defendants\u2019 claimed overhead contributed to the production of <em>Hallelujah Hollywood. </em>The difficulty we have, however, is that defendants offered no evidence of what costs were included in general categories such as \u201cgeneral and administrative expenses,\u201d nor did they offer any evidence concerning how these costs contributed to the production of <em>Hallelujah Hollywood. </em>The defendants contend their burden was met when they introduced evidence of their total overhead costs allocated on a reasonable basis. The district court apparently agreed with this approach. That is not the law of this circuit. Under <em>Kamar International, </em>a defendant additionally must show that the categories of overhead actually contributed to sales of the infringing work. 752 F.2d at 1332. We can find no such showing in the record before us. Therefore, we conclude the district court\u2019s finding that \u201cdefendants have established that these items of general expense [the general categories of claimed overhead] contributed to the production of \u2018Hallelujah Hollywood\u2019 \u201d was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Plaintiffs next challenge the district court\u2019s failure to consider MGM Grand\u2019s earnings on hotel and gaming operations in arriving at the amount of profits attributa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ble to the infringement. The district court received evidence concerning MGM Grand\u2019s total net profit during the relevant time period, totaling approximately $395,000,-000, but its memorandum decision does not mention these indirect profits and computes recovery based solely on the revenues and profits earned on the production of <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>(approximately $24,000,000 and $2,500,000 respectively). We surmise from this that the district court determined plaintiffs were not entitled to recover indirect profits, but we have no hint as to the district court\u2019s reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Whether a copyright proprietor may recover \u201cindirect profits\u201d is one of first impression in this circuit. We conclude that under the 1909 Act indirect profits may be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The 1909 Act provided that a copyright proprietor is entitled to \u201call the profits which the infringer shall have made from such infringement____\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(b). The language of the statute is broad enough to permit recovery of indirect as well as direct profits. <em>See </em>3 M. Nimmer, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.03[A], at 14-15; <em>cf. Nucor Corp. v. Tennessee Forging Steel Service, Inc., </em>513 F.2d 151, 153 (8th Cir.1975) (common law copyright infringement action; issue of whether infringing use of copyrighted architectural plans resulted in lower manufacturing costs to defendants was properly put to jury). At the same time, a court may deny recovery of a defendant\u2019s profits if they are only remotely or speculatively attributable to the infringement. <em>See </em>3 M. Nimmer, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.03[A]; <em>see, e.g., Roy Export Co. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>503 F.Supp. 1137, 1156-57 (S.D.N.Y.1980) (profits from an infringing unsponsored television broadcast could not be ascertained since benefit received by CBS \u201cconsists of unmeasurable good-will with affiliates and increased stature and prestige vis-a-vis competitors.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>672 F.2d 1095 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 826, 103 S.Ct. 60, 74 L.Ed.2d 63 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">The allowance of indirect profits was considered in <em>Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions, Inc. v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>1983 Copyright L.Rep. (CCH) 1125,-572 at 18,381 (C.D.Cal.1983) <em>(Krofft II), on remand from </em>562 F.2d 1157 (9th Cir.1977), a case involving facts analogous to those presented here. The plaintiffs, creators of the \u201cH.R. Pufnstuf\u201d children\u2019s television program, alleged that they were entitled to a portion of the profits McDonald\u2019s earned on its food sales as damages for the \u201cMc-Donaldland\u201d television commercials that infringed plaintiffs\u2019 copyright. The district court rejected as speculative the plaintiffs\u2019 formula for computing profits attributable to the infringement. However, the court\u2019s analysis and award of in lieu damages indicate that it considered indirect profits recoverable. The court stated, in awarding $1,044,000 in statutory damages, that \u201cbecause a significant portion of defendants\u2019 profits made from the infringement are not ascertainable, a higher award of [statutory] in lieu damages is warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18,-384; <em>see also Cream Records Inc. v. Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co., </em>754 F.2d 826, 828-29 (9th Cir.1985) (discussed <em>supra </em>note 7) (awarding profits from the sale of malt liquor for Schlitz\u2019s infringing use of plaintiff\u2019s song in television commercial).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">Like the television commercials in <em>Krofft II, Hallelujah Hollywood </em>had promotional value. Defendants maintain that they endeavor to earn profits on all their operations and that <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>was a profit center. However, that fact does not detract from the promotional purposes of the show \u2014 to draw people to the hotel and the gaming tables. MGM\u2019s 1976 annual report states that \u201c[t]he hotel and gaming operations of the MGM Grand \u2014 Las Vegas continue to be materially enhanced by the popularity of the hotel\u2019s entertainment[, including] \u2018Hallelujah Hollywood\u2019, the spectacularly successful production revue____\u201d Given the promotional nature of <em>Hallelujah Hollywood, </em>we conclude indirect profits from the hotel and gaming operations, as well as direct profits from the show itself, are recoverable if ascertainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">\n<em>3. Apportionment of Profits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">How to apportion profits between the infringers and the plaintiffs is a complex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>issue in this case. Apportionment of direct profits from the production as well as indirect profits from the hotel and casino operations are involved here, although the district court addressed only the former at the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">When an infringer\u2019s profits are attributable to factors in addition to use of plaintiff\u2019s work, an apportionment of profits is proper. <em>Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures, Inc., </em>309 U.S. 390, 405-06, 60 S.Ct. 681, 686-87, 84 L.Ed. 825 (1939) <em>(Sheldon II); Universal Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corp., </em>162 F.2d at 377. The burden of proving apportionment, (i.e., the contribution to profits of elements other than the infringed property), is the defendant\u2019s. <em>Lottie Joplin Thomas Trust v. Crown Publishers, Inc., </em>592 F.2d 651, 657 (2d Cir.1978). We will not reverse a district court\u2019s findings regardmg_^porti.QQment unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>See Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. 4636 S. Vermont Ave., Inc., </em>367 F.2d at 241-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">After finding that the net profit earned by <em>Hallelujah Hollywood-jazz </em>approximately $2,500,000, the-distr-ie-t-eourt-offered the following explanation_of apportionment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">While no precise mathematical formula can be applied, the court concludes in light of the evidence presented at trial approximation of \u00a3ho profits-o\u00a3-Act IV attributable to the infringement is $22,-000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">The disfcw\u00abt-conrt was correct that mathematical exactnesses not required. However, a reasonable and just apportionment of profits is required. <em>Sheldon II, </em>309 U.S. at 408, 60 S.Ct. at 688; <em>Universal Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corp., </em>162 F.2d at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">Arriving at a proper method of apportionment and determining a specific amount to award is largely a factual exercise. Defendants understandably argue that the facts support~tEeUf\u00edsWtet-eourt\u2019s award. They claim that the infringing material, six minutes of music in Act IV, was an unimportant part of the whole show, that the unique features of the Ziegfield Theater contributed_mo_K\u00a7_jx&gt; the show\u2019s success than any other factor. This is proved, they argue, bifTEe\" fact that when the music from <em>Kismet </em>was removed from <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>in 1976, the show suffered no decline in attendance and the hotel received no complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-14\">Other evidence contradicts defendants\u2019 position. For instance, defendant Donn Arden testified that <em>Kismet </em>was \u201ca very_im-portant part of the show\u201d and \u201c[he] hated to see it go.\u201d Moreover, while other acts were deleted from the shortenecLSaturday night versions of the show, Act IV \u201cKismet\u201d never was.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-15\">We reject defendants\u2019 contention that the relative unimportance of the <em>Kismet </em>music was proved by its omission and the show\u2019s continued success thereafter. <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>was a revue, comprised of many different entertainment elements. Each element contributed significantly to the show\u2019s success, but no one element was the sole or overriding reason for that success. Just because efie element could be omitted and the show goes o\u00f1ctoes not prove that the elemeni was noTimportant in the first instance ami did~not contribute to establishing the show\u2019s initial popularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-16\">The difficulty in this case is that the district court has not provided_us with any reasoned explanation of. or formularor its apportionment. We know only the district court\u2019s bottom line: that the plaintiffs are entitled to $22,000. Given the nature of the infringement, the character of the infringed property, the success of defendants\u2019 show, and the magnitude of the defendants\u2019 profits, the amount seems to be grossly inadequate. It amounts to less than one percent of MGM Grand\u2019s profits from the show, or roughly $13 for each of the 1700 infringing performances.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>On remand, the district court should reconsider its apportionment of profits, and should fully explain on the record its reasons and the resulting method of apportionment it uses. Apportionment of indirect profits may be a part of the calculus. If the court finds that a reasonable, nonspecu-lative formula cannot be derived, or that the amount of profits a reasonable formula yields is insufficient to serve the purposes underlying the statute, then the court should award statutory damages. <em>See infra </em>Part II.B.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">\n<em>4. Liability of Joint Infringers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The district court granted judgment of $22,000 \u201cagainst defendants\u201d in the plural. Yet if the district court intended that each of the defendants be jointly and severally liable for the $22,000 award, this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">When a copyright is infringed, all infringers are jointly and severally liable for plaintiffs\u2019 <em>actual damages, </em>but each defendant is severally liable, for his or its own illegal <em>profit', </em>one defendant is not liable for the profit \u2014 made\u2014by\u2014another. <em>MCA, Inc. v. Wilson, </em>677 F.2d 180 186 (2d Cir.1981); 3 M. Nimmer, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.-04[C][3], at 12-50; <em>see Cream Records, Inc. v. Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co., </em>754 F.2d at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The rule of several liability for profits applies, at least, where defendants do not act as partners, or_((pradically \u2014 partners.\u2019 <em>Compare Belford, Clarke &amp; Co. v. Scribner, </em>144 U.S. 488, 507-508, 12 S.Ct. 734, 740, 36 L.Ed. 514 (1892) (printerjield-joint-ly liable for publisher\u2019s pref-its--\u00a9n \u2014 infringing book since they were \u201cpractically partners.\u201d), <em>with Sammons v. Colonial Press, Inc., </em>126 F.2d at 346-47 (court refused to hold printer jointly liable for publisher\u2019s profits since printer was paid a fixed price for work, payable whether or not infringing books made profit). Defendants assert that Arden and MGM Grand are jointly liable since they \u201cworked closely together\u201d in producing the infringing work. This is a fact question for the district court to consider on remand. The court should consider whether Arden was an employee or an independent contractor rather than a partner. Relevant to this determination, among others, are such factors as whether Arden received a fixed salary or a percentage of profits and whether he bore any of the risk of loss on the production.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">Arden mav be liable for profits he earned in connection.wifh the pmdiTFF.Thri of <em>Haltelujah Hollywood, </em>but amounts paid to hini. as- salar-y-am not_taZph considered as profits. <em>See MCA, Inc. v. Wilson, 6</em>77 F.2d at 186. But if Arden did earn profits from the productio\u00f1T~\u00a7uch as royalties, lie j\u00a1sJiableYdr~a proportionate^ amount of these,- -Goncomita]itLy,-defendant MGM Grand-would-be-entitled-ta.,deduct any such royalties as costs in arriving at its own profits. <em>See Smith v. Little, Brown &amp; Co. </em>396 F.2d 150, 151-52 (2d Cir.1968; <em>see Cream Records, Inc. v. Jos Schlitz Brewing Co., </em>754 F.2d at 829 (interpreting the 1976 Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">The court must also determine whether MGM, Inc., MGM Grand\u2019s parent corporation, should be held liable for the infringement. A parent corporation cannot be held liable for the infringing actions of its subsidiary unless there is a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>and continuing connection between the two with respect to the infringing acts. 3 M. Nimmer, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.04[A], at 12-44 to -45.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">If the district court finds a \u201csubstantial and continuing connection\u201d between MGM Grand and MGM, Inc., then MGM, Inc., may also be liable for its profits. But to the extent any such profits are merely passed on from its subsidiary, MGM Grand, the plaintiffs should be given only one recovery, to be satisfied by either MGM, Inc. or MGM Grand.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">\n<em>5. Statutory \u201cIn Lieu\u201d Damages</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>12</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Statutory damages are intended as a substitute for profits or actual damage. When injury is proved but neither the infringer\u2019s profits nor the copyright holder\u2019s actual damages can be ascertained, an award of statutory \u201cin lieu\u201d damages is mandatory. <em>Russell v. Price, </em>612 F.2d at 1131-32; <em>Pye v. Mitchell, </em>574 F.2d 476, 481 (9th Cir.1978); <em>Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions, Inc. v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>562 F.2d 1157, 1178-79 (9th Cir.1977) <em>(Krofft I). </em>But if either profits or actual damages or both can be ascertained, the trial court has discretion to award statutory damages. <em>Krofft I, </em>562 F.2d at 1178. Such an award must be in excess of the amount that would have been awarded as profits or actual damages. <em>Id. </em>We review a district court\u2019s award or refusal to award statutory damages for abuse of discretion. <em>Russell v. Price, </em>612 F.2d at 1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">A determination as to whether to award statutory damages must abide the district court\u2019s reconsideration of whether to award damages based on profits. On remand, the district court should keep in mind the purposes underlying the remedy provisions of the Copyright Act, i.e., to provide adequate compensation to the copyright holder and to discourage wrongful conduct and deter infringements. <em>See F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Contemporary Arts, Inc., </em>344 U.S. 228, 233, 73 S.Ct. 222, 225, 97 L.Ed. 276 (1952); <em>Kamar International, Inc. v. Russ Berrie &amp; Co., </em>752 F.2d at 1332; <em>Russell v. Price, </em>612 F.2d at 1131. Thus, in determining whether to exercise its discretion to award statutory damages, the district court must consider whether the amount of profits that have been proved accomplish the purposes of the statute. If not, it should exercise its discretion to award statutory \u201cin lieu\u201d damages that do effectuate the statutory purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">The $22,000 awarded by the district court obviously is too little to discourage wrongful conduct or to deter infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">\n<em>6. Attorneys\u2019Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">The plaintiffs requested that the district court award attorneys\u2019 fees under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 116 (1970). The court omitted mention of plaintiffs\u2019 request in its memorandum decision, although during the course of the proceedings, it had noted that the issue was before it. On remand, the district court can address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">C. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Other Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">In addition to claims for copyright infringement, plaintiffs pleaded claims for unfair competition and breach of contract. The district court rejected both of these ancillary claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">\n<em>1. Unfair Competition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"adq-dedup-0\">To prevail on a claim of unfair competition, a plaintiff must demonstrate a likelihood of confusion. <em>Walt Disney Productions v. The Air Pirates, </em>581 F.2d 751, 760 (9th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1132, 99 S.Ct. 1054, 59 L.Ed.2d 94 (1979); <em>Alpha Industries, Inc. v. Alpha Steel Tube &amp; Shapes, Inc., </em>616 F.2d 440, 443 (9th Cir.1980). Any findings of fact underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>a determination as to likelihood of confusion are subject to the clearly erroneous test, but determination of whether, based on those facts, a likelihood of confusion exists is a legal conclusion. <em>Alpha Industries, </em>616 F.2d at 443-44; <em>J.B. Williams Co., Inc. v. Le Conte Cosmetics, Inc., </em>523 F.2d 187, 190 (9th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 913, 96 S.Ct. 1110, 47 L.Ed.2d 317 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Plaintiffs attempted to prove unfair competition by showing that the title \u201cKismet\u201d had acquired secondary meaning referring to their play. The only evidence offered by plaintiffs on this issue was the testimony of plaintiff Edwin Lester who claimed that the original 1911 <em>Kismet </em>was a \u201cdead issue.\u201d Defendants introduced evidence that the 1911 <em>Kismet </em>and a silent movie produced from that play in 1912 had been very popular and widely acclaimed. The trial court\u2019s finding that the title \u201cKismet\u201d had not acquired secondary meaning referring to plaintiff\u2019s play, is not clearly erroneous. Moreover, since Act IV \u201cKismet\u201d was only an 11-minute segment of a 100-minute revue, we agree that audiences were not likely to confuse the two versions.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">\n<em>2. Breach of Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Finally, plaintiffs urge that the district court denied them due process in dismissing their breach of contract claim against MGM, Inc. The court indicated at the outset of trial that it would not exercise pendent jurisdiction and would not receive evidence on the contract claim or the unfair competition claim. But at the end of the trial, the court permitted post-trial briefs, specifying that they should include issues relating to plaintiffs\u2019 pendent claims. The court stated it would take additional evidence on those claims if necessary. Since plaintiffs apparently did not offer any additional evidence, the district court did not err in dismissing the contract claim based on the evidence before it. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 due process challenge has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">We affirm the district court\u2019s finding that defendants\u2019 use of plaintiffs\u2019 <em>Kismet </em>exceeded the scope of the ASCAP license. We also affirm the district court\u2019s finding that plaintiffs failed to prove actual damages. We vacate the award of defendants\u2019 profits derived from the infringement and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\">.

Applicable here since the actions complained of all occurred prior to January 1, 1978. <em>See </em>Copyright Revision Act of 1976, Pub.L.

The citations to the Copyright Act contained in this opinion are to the 1909 Act, unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b600-16\">. Other circuits disagree with our interpretation of the 1909 Act and allow recovery of both actual damages and the infringer\u2019s profits. <em>See, e.g., Miller v. Universal City Studios, Inc., </em>650 F.2d 1365, 1376 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Lottie Joplin Thomas Trust v. Crown Publishers, Inc., </em>456 F.Supp. 531 (S.D.N.Y.1977), <em>aff'd, </em>592 F.2d 651 (2d Cir.1978). Under the current Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 (1982), a prevailing plaintiff is entitled to recover both actual damages and the infringer\u2019s profits. <em>See Transgo, Inc. v. Ajac Transmission Parts Corp., </em>768 F.2d 1001, 1023 (9th Cir.1985); 3 M. Nimmer, <em>Nimmer on Copyright </em>\u00a7 14.01[A] (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b601-6\">. Plaintiffs additionally argue that we should review the district court\u2019s findings de novo because, they contend, the court erred in applying the actual damages test set forth in <em>Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions, Inc. v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>562 F.2d 1157 (9th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The district court stated the test as \u201cwhat a willing buyer would have been reasonably <em>willing </em>to pay to a willing seller for plaintiff\u2019s work,\u201d (emphasis added), rather than \u201cwhat a willing buyer would have been <em>reasonably required </em>to pay\u201d for the property, <em>Id. </em>at 1174 (emphasis added). This distinction is important, plaintiffs contend, because when an infringement destroys any potential market for the copyrighted work, it becomes impossible to determine what a willing buyer would have been \"reasonably willing\u201d to pay; there simply is no willing buyer left.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Plaintiffs misconstrue the test stated by the district court and misconceive the nature of the <em>Krofft </em>test itself. The test is not what some buyer <em>was </em>willing to pay, but what a buyer <em>would have </em>been willing to pay for a use of a plaintiff\u2019s work similar to the defendant\u2019s use. In other words, the <em>Krofft </em>test seeks to approximate what a reasonable market price would have been at the time of the infringement, not afterwards. The trial court's statement of the <em>Krofft </em>test takes into account the essence of that test. Any misstatement is trivial, and is not error. Therefore, we review the district court\u2019s findings as to damages under the clearly erroneous test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b601-12\">. Another panel of this court considered a similar problem recently in <em>Cream Records, Inc. v. Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co., </em>754 F.2d 826 (9th Cir.1985) (interpreting the 1976 Act). In <em>Cream Records, </em>the jury found that Schlitz and its advertising agency infringed Cream\u2019s copyright in \"The Theme from Shaft\u201d, by using a ten-note ostinato from the song in a television commercial. The district court awarded $12,000 as actual damages for loss of licensing fees. We concluded that the award was insufficient, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-13\">The only evidence before the court was that unauthorized use of the Shaft theme music in Schlitz\u2019s commercial ended Cream\u2019s opportunity to license the music for this purpose. There was no evidence that Schlitz sought, or Cream was willing to grant, a license for use of less than the entire copyrighted work, that a license limited to the portion used in the commercial would have had less value, or that use limited to this portion would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>had a less devastating effect upon Cream\u2019s opportunity to license to another. Since defendants\u2019 unauthorized use destroyed the value of the copyrighted work for this purpose, plaintiff was entitled to recover that value as damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 827-28 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">In <em>Cream Records, </em>the evidence showed that another advertiser had approached Cream for a license for the song, but withdrew when the Schlitz commercial was aired. \"There was testimony that use of a well-known popular song in a commercial destroys its value to other advertisers for that purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">The evidence concerning the effect of defendants\u2019 infringement is far less convincing in our case. Plaintiffs did introduce testimony that the infringement had destroyed the Las Vegas market for a full production of <em>Kismet, </em>but that testimony came from <em>Kismet's </em>leasing agent, not a disinterested party. We agree with the district court\u2019s characterization of this evidence as \"meager,\" and we cannot conclude that the court clearly erred in discrediting it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\">. Plaintiffs raise several other arguments concerning actual damages, which require only brief discussion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">Plaintiffs argue that the trial court should have accepted their evidence because the defendants did not offer contrary evidence. But a trier of fact may properly reject uncontradicted testimony so long as it does so with good reason. <em>NLRB v. Klaue, </em>523 F.2d 410, 414 (9th Cir.1975). Such evidence properly may be rejected because of its inherent unbelieveability, because a witness's demeanor raises doubt as to his sincerity, or because the testimony is clouded with uncertainty. <em>Woods v. United States, </em>724 F.2d 1444, 1452 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Lewis &amp; Taylor, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>447 F.2d 1074, 1077 (9th Cir.1971).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-12\">Plaintiffs suggest that actual damages to the Las Vegas market should be presumed, that such damages are the \u201cnatural and probable result\u201d of an unauthorized performance. Yet, plaintiffs rely for this conclusion on cases in which trial courts found damages merely as a matter of fact, <em>see, e.g., Metrto-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. v. Showcase Atlanta Cooperative Productions, Inc., </em>479 F.Supp. 351 (N.D.Ga.1979), or presumed irreparable injury for purposes of issuance of preliminary injunctions, <em>see, e.g., Uneeda Doll Co. v. Regent Baby Products Corp., </em>355 F.Supp. 438, 445 (E.D.N.Y.1972). These cases do not suggest, as plaintiffs apparently contend, that a copyright owner is relieved from or aided in proving actual damages by some presumption. <em>See Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. 4636 S. Vermont Ave., Inc., </em>367 F.2d 236, 241 (9th Cir. 1966) (plaintiff in copyright action who failed to produce evidence of damages could not complain when trial court determined that no damages were proved).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-16\">Plaintiffs further argue that the court accorded so little weight to plaintiff Edwin Lester\u2019s testimony concerning the value of <em>Kismet </em>as to be tantamount to excluding it. While <em>Universal Pictures Corp. v. Harold Lloyd Corp., </em>162 F.2d 354, 369 (9th Cir.1947), held that a copyright owner may testify as to the value of his property, that case did not hold that a court may not consider the self-serving nature of such testimony. <em>See Range v. Lee, </em>441 F.2d 579, 582 (9th Cir.) <em>(\"Credible </em>testimony by the owner of literary property regarding its value can provide an adequate evidentiary basis for an award of damages.\u201d (emphasis added)), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 887, 92 S.Ct. 197, 30 L.Ed.2d 169 (1971). The district court was entitled to give Mr. Lester\u2019s testimony slight weight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-17\">Finally, plaintiffs contend the district court improperly excluded as irrelevant evidence of royalties other Broadway shows had earned in Las Vegas productions. The exclusion was not error. <em>See Universal Pictures Corp. v. Harold Lloyd Corp., </em>162 F.2d at 372, 374-75 (action for violation of motion picture copyright; not error to exclude evidence of value of another movie as not relevant to value of movie involved).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b603-5\">. Plaintiffs argue that the trial court should have granted their motion to exclude evidence of costs as a sanction for failure to cooperate in discovery. Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(d). The trial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion on the grounds that both parties had been dilatory in pursuing discovery, and that the plaintiffs could not show that they suffered any prejudice as a result of defendants\u2019 alleged failures. A district court has wide discretion in controlling discovery and its rulings will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>See Reygo Pacific Corp. v. Johnston Pump Co., </em>680 F.2d 647, 649 (9th Cir. 1982). We find no abuse here.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Plaintiffs next argue that the district court should have excluded an exhibit prepared by MGM Grand to show an allocation of costs and expenses to its production of <em>Hallelujah Hollywood. </em>They contend the underlying records from which the summary was prepared were never provided to plaintiffs for inspection, as required by Fed.R.Evid. 1006. But the trial court, after a full hearing on this issue, concluded the underlying records had been made available to plaintiffs. Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated, \"I was satisfied with the financial documents that they made available.\u201d The requirements for Rule 1006 are met when the trial judge ascertains that the underlying documents are made available for inspection, <em>City of Phoenix v. Com/Systems, Inc., </em>706 F.2d 1033, 1038 (9th Cir.1983), and this is so even if opposing counsel fails to avail himself of the opportunity to review the documents. <em>United States v. Denton, </em>556 F.2d 811, 816 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 892, 98 S.Ct. 269, 54 L.Ed.2d 178 (1977). The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting defendants\u2019 exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Plaintiffs also challenge admission of defendants\u2019 summary of costs on the ground that it was \"self-calculated\u201d and \u201cunverified.\u201d Rule 1006 does not contemplate that summaries must be prepared by someone independent of the party offering the summary. Plaintiffs had ample opportunity to cross-examine MGM Grand\u2019s Vice-President of Finance, under whose direction the summary was prepared. Any inaccuracies in the cost estimates could have been brought out on this cross-examination. The district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Frank Horton &amp; Co. v. Cook Electric Co., </em>356 F.2d 485, 492 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 U.S. 952, 86 S.Ct. 1572, 16 L.Ed.2d 548 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Finally, plaintiffs contend that any evidence of MGM Grand\u2019s indirect costs was inadmissible since such evidence was not mentioned in the pretrial conference order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 16. Aside from the fact that it is arguable whether the language of the order omits mention of this evidence, the issue was litigated at trial and thus the pretrial order may be deemed to have been amended by the consent of the parties. <em>See Simpson Timber Co. v. Palmberg Construction Co., </em>377 F.2d 380, 386 (9th Cir.1967); <em>Perfection Cobey Co. v. City Tank Corp., </em>597 F.2d 419, 420 (4th Cir.1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"ag8-dedup-0\">. With one exception, the court accepted the defendant's cost calculations in their entirety. The exception was that defendants had amortized preproduction costs for <em>Hallelujah Hollywood </em>over the first three years of the show\u2019s run, totalling $3,166,000 for the period in question. The district court concluded, instead, that preproduction costs should be amortized over the full six and one-half year run of the show, making the total $1,461,000 for the relevant period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b606-12\">. The apportionment percentages in similar cases are markedly higher. <em>See, e.g., Universal Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corp., </em>162 F.2d at 377 (infringing use of one comedv-sketch in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>motion picture; court affirmed award of 20% of infringing movie\u2019s profits); <em>MCA, Inc. v. Wilson, </em>677 F.2d 180, 181-82 (2d.Cir.1981) (defendants copied substantial portion plaintiffs song, \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Bov\u201d \u2014 substituted \u201cdirty\u2019\u2019 lvrics, and performed the song as a portion of an erotic nude show; court affirmed special master\u2019s award of approximately $244,000 representing 5% of defendants\u2019 total profits from the show); <em>Lottie Joplin Thomas Trust v. Crown Publishers, Inc., </em>592 F.2d at 657 (fttfringing songs filled one side of five-record set; court affirmed award of 50% of profits because inclusion of infringing songs made record set the only \u201ccomplete\u201d collection of Scott Joplin's works); <em>Abkco Music, Inc. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd., </em>508 F.Supp. 798, 800-801 (S.D.N.Y.1981) (infringing song reproduced on one side of single record, \"flip side\u201d contained noninfringing song, court awarded 70% of profits from sales of the single because infringing song was more popular than noninfringing song; similarly, court awarded 50% of profits for reproduction of same song on album containing twenty-one other songs).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\">. Plaintiffs contend that the district court did not impose any award against defendants MGM, Inc. and Donn Arden, and therefore an award of statutory damages is mandatory. We do not resolve this issue because, as we noted above, <em>see supra </em>Part II.B.4, it is not clear which parties the district court intended to be held liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">We note, however, that plaintiffs\u2019 argument presents an unresolved issue: How the <em>Krofft </em>rule applies in the context of multiple infring-ers, when actual damages cannot be proved and profits of some, but not all, infringers can be proved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b609-12\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AWY\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">I concur fully in the majority opinion, except for Section B.l. I would hold that the district court clearly erred in finding that appellants \u201cfailed to establish <em>any </em>damage attributable to the infringement.\u201d It seems evident to me that the inclusion of \u201cKismet\u201d as a part of 1,700 performances of Hallelujah Hollywood served to reduce the market value of appellant\u2019s property in the Las Vegas area. The testimony in the record amply supports this proposition. There is no evidence that would support the opposite conclusion. Under these circumstances, I believe the district court clearly erred in disregarding the testimony offered by appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
