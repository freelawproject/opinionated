The complaint arose out of plaintiff\u2019s suspension for three days due to an altercation he had with a driver, Debbie Oggoian, he had stopped for speeding. Ms. Oggoian had made threatening and abusive anti-Semitic remarks to Hershinow, who is Jewish. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, a decision that a panel of this Court affirmed in an opinion reported at 735 F.2d 264 (1984). In so affirming, we agreed that plaintiff\u2019s suspension did not constitute deprivation of liberty within the compass of the Fourteenth Amendment, or an infringement on plaintiff\u2019s right of free exercise of his religion. He had presented his denial of equal protection claim in so perfunctory a manner that we did not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Although the district court awarded attorney\u2019s fees against plaintiff pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, the timing of the latter decision prevented our being able to consider together plaintiff\u2019s appeals from the merits and the fees award. Consequently we dismissed the latter appeal without prejudice to refiling, while directing the district court to reconsider its decision to award attorney\u2019s fees. The district court, however, determined that an award of fees was appropriate, and it entered judgment against Hershinow in the amount of $2,700. Hershinow has timely appealed that judgment, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">The standard a defendant must meet in order to merit being awarded his attorney\u2019s fees under Section 1988 is a strict one. The Supreme Court extended the standard enunciated in <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, </em>434 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978) to civil rights cases in <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 14,101 S.Ct. 173, 178, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980) (per <em>curiam). </em>The Court had stated in <em>Christiansburg </em>that \u201ca plaintiff should not be assessed his opponent\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees unless a court finds that his claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.\u201d 434 U.S. at 422, 98 S.Ct. at 701. While a defendant need not demonstrate subjective bad faith, <em>id. </em>at 421, 98 S.Ct. at 700, a meritless claim must be one that is \u201cgroundless or without foundation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That the plaintiff has ultimately lost the case is not itself sufficient to justify an award of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">Thus, unlike the usually followed practice of awarding appropriate fees to prevailing plaintiffs, courts may grant attorney\u2019s fees to prevailing defendants only in very circumscribed situations. The concern motivating Congress and the courts is the chilling effect large fee awards would have on plaintiffs, especially with respect to laws like the civil rights laws that depend for their vindication on private plaintiffs\u2019 filing suit. Although Congress allowed fees to be awarded against plaintiffs in order \u201cto protect defendants from burdensome litigation having no legal or factual basis,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 420, 98 S.Ct. at 700, courts must recognize both the substantial risks inhering in most litigation and the danger of post hoc rationalization in agreeing to award attorney\u2019s fees to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">Nonetheless, in reviewing fee awards to defendants, it would be improper to reverse a trial court\u2019s decision absent an abuse of the discretion vested in the trial court. <em>Badillo v. Central Steel &amp; Wire Co., </em>717 F.2d 1160, 1164 (7th Cir.1983); <em>Harrington v. DeVito, </em>656 F.2d 264, 266 (7th Cir.1981), certiorari denied, 455 U.S. 993, 102 S.Ct. 1621, 71 L.Ed.2d 854 (1982); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>Harbulak v. County of Suffolk, </em>654 F.2d 194, 195 (2d Cir.1981). Cf. <em>Christiansburg, </em>434 U.S. at 424, 98 S.Ct. at 701 (district court appropriately exercised its discretion). Regardless of how we would decide the question in the first instance, the substantial familiarity of the trial court with the proceedings requires deference to its exercise of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The case at bar presents a close question. Still it cannot be said that the district court exceeded its discretion in awarding fees against Hershinow. Plaintiff would twist the recognition in our prior opinion that the three-day suspension is a black mark on his record, <em>Hershinow v. Bonamarte, </em>735 F.2d at 266, into a determination that his complaint was not frivolous. This argument is misconceived, for the opinion made very clear that whatever harm Hershinow might have suffered did not rise to the level of a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. It must be remembered that Section 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment are not to serve as a font of tort law. <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 699-01, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1159-61, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976). The injury to reputation that the Supreme Court rejected as implicating a liberty or property right in <em>Paul v. Davis </em>encompassed a claim that the plaintiffs future employment opportunities had been seriously impaired. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 96 S.Ct. at 1158-59. Absent a current loss in employment, or at least the prospect of damage much greater than the potential impediment implicated in the case at bar, plaintiff has stated no claim cognizable under the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Even if plaintiff had been able to state a recognizable liberty interest, he received adequate due process protection. After Ms. Oggoian filed her citizen\u2019s complaint against Hershinow, he was interviewed by the department to give his side of the dispute. After consideration of both parties\u2019 narratives of what had happened, the department decided to suspend Hershinow for three days. He protested this suspension to the chief of police, who refused to rescind the suspension. Thereafter, plaintiff filed a grievance with the personnel director of Highland Park, but this request to rescind the suspension was also denied. Finally, plaintiff appealed to the city manager, who scheduled a hearing on the matter. Plaintiff elected not to attend this meeting, stating in a letter to the city manager that the addressee had \u201call the facts needed to make a judgment on this issue\u201d and that Hershinow did not believe that \u201cthere is much I could add at a meeting.\u201d He did inform the city manager that if Ms. Oggoian was at the meeting he wanted to be there too. Nonetheless, his letter makes clear that, as long as the city manager was not going to interview Ms. Oggoi-an, Hershinow did not feel that his presence was required to vindicate his rights. After the hearing, the city manager refused plaintiff\u2019s request to rescind the suspension. Consequently, plaintiff was able to appeal his suspension to three different levels of the city hierarchy. More was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Plaintiff argues that the Illinois Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wagner v. Kramer, </em>125 Ill.App.3d 12, 80 Ill.Dec. 435, 465 N.E.2d 547 (2d Dist.1984), establishes that he was entitled to a hearing before the Civil Service Commission of Highland Park, so that his complaint was not frivolous. <em>Wagner, </em>however, will not support this argument. <em>Wagner </em>reviewed the statute authorizing the police department to discipline its employees for less than thirty days, 1983 Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 24, 1110-1-18-1, and the leading Illinois Supreme Court decision interpreting that statute, <em>Kropel v. Conlisk, </em>60 Ill.2d 17, 322 N.E.2d 793 (1975).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the appellate court held that suspensions of five days or less must be reviewed, 125 Ill.App.3d at 21, 322 N.E.2d 793, it did not require review by the sheriff's merit commission. <em>Id. </em>at 20, 322 N.E.2d 793. While some review was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>quired, the method afforded need not be the same as that afforded those who receive suspensions of longer than five days. Thus Hershinow cannot claim a deprivation of procedural due process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The extensive review Hershinow received, including a hearing he elected not to attend, precludes his now arguing that the district court in assessing attorney\u2019s fees against him underestimated the merit of his claim. The liberty interest infringed was not of the magnitude encompassed by the case law on the issue, and the plaintiff received substantial procedural protections. Consequently, his filing a lawsuit based on such claims was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Also unwarranted was Hershinow\u2019s supposed First Amendment claim. His complaint alleged that his being disciplined for his conduct toward a citizen who made derogatory, anti-Semitic remarks infringed his right of free exercise of religion. A policeman, however, must be able to act professionally regardless of remarks made to inflame him. Hershinow has not contended that his superiors used the complaint as a pretext to punish him for being Jewish. The fallacy in Hershinow\u2019s argument is that he was disciplined not for being Jewish or for adhering to Jewish beliefs, but for the way he handled Ms. Oggoian\u2019s abusive comments. Whether the comments concerned Hershinow\u2019s religion, or whether they referred to some other personal characteristic independent of his religion, was irrelevant to the decision to impose sanctions. Consequently, not only was the district court quite right to dismiss these allegations, but its assessment of attorney\u2019s fees against plaintiff cannot be seen as an abuse of discretion. Plaintiff \u2014 or at least his lawyers \u2014 must have realized that any limitation on his free exercise of religion came solely from a private citizen, against whom a Section 1983 claim, which requires acts under color of state law, see <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 152, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1605-1606, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970), cannot be made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s assertion of constitutional torts was groundless, so that the district court\u2019s fee decision was permissible. The October 25, 1984, order awarding attorney\u2019s fees to defendants is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\">. Hershinow was suspended pursuant to 1983 Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 24, f 10-1-18, not <em>id. </em>10-1-18.-1, but the two statutes are virtually identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b485-23\">. Nor does <em>Wagner </em>lend credence to Hershi-now's equal protection claim, because the decision explicitly authorizes municipalities to treat those who receive suspensions of five days or less differently from those suspended for longer periods of time. Equal protection concerns are not implicated because of the lesser significance of brief suspensions. What would be impermissible would be to treat Hershinow differently from others who are similarly situated, but this was not done. Hershinow was treated similarly to those in similar circumstances, and he also received quite extensive review of the disciplinary decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b485-25\">. We note that plaintiff was represented throughout by counsel, so that the special consideration that must be afforded <em>pro se </em>applicants is unwarranted. See <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. at 15, 101 S.Ct. at 178-79.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
