Attorney Richard S. Harman represented debtors in ten Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings. In each proceeding he filed a request for attorney\u2019s fees which was challenged as unreasonable and excessive by bankruptcy trustee David R. Levin. The bankruptcy court in each instance agreed with Levin that the requested fees were excessive and awarded amounts equalling approximately sixty percent of Harman\u2019s requests. Harman appealed to the district court, which found that the bankruptcy court had properly evaluated the fee in each case according to the twelve factors set out in <em>Barber v. Kimbrell\u2019s, Inc., </em>577 F.2d 216 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 934, 99 S.Ct. 329, 58 L.Ed.2d 330 (1978), and that the bankruptcy court was not clearly erroneous in its fee determinations. Because we hold that the <em>Barber </em>factors are properly employed in the determination of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 330 (Supp. II 1984) and that the bankruptcy court committed no error in applying them in this case, the judgments of the district court are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-21\">The ten Chapter 13 petitions were each jointly filed by a husband and wife. The bankruptcy court found them all to be routine cases devoid of any unusual factors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>In each case, Harman filed with the bankruptcy court a request for compensation under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 330, and trustee Levin filed an \u201cObjection to Attorney\u2019s Fee\u201d in the bankruptcy court challenging each request on the ground that \u201c[t]he said fee is not reasonable, and is excessive.\u201d The bankruptcy court conducted a hearing in each case and fixed the fees in amounts substantially below those requested by Harman. In an opinion dealing with two of the cases, the bankruptcy court addressed each of the twelve factors set out in <em>Barber v. Kimbrell\u2019s, Inc., </em>577 F.2d 216 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 934, 99 S.Ct. 329, 58 L.Ed.2d 330 (1978),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and made factual findings bearing on the criteria. The court referred to the findings and conclusions of that opinion in a second opinion dealing with the remaining eight cases at issue. The awarded fee in each of the ten cases was, on average, approximately forty percent less than Harman\u2019s request.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">Harman contends on appeal that the bankruptcy court erred both in its fact-finding and in its application of the twelve <em>Barber </em>factors. He asserts that the fees awarded him fail to reflect the fees for comparable services in nonbankruptcy cases. He stresses that the fees in a Chapter 13 case are always contingent because the success of the debtors\u2019 Chapter 13 plans is not assured. He also argues that additional compensation is appropriate in joint cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">Section 330 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that the bankruptcy court \u201cmay award ... to the debtor\u2019s attorney ... reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services ... based on the nature, the extent, and the value of such services, the time spent on such services and the cost of comparable services other than in a case under this title____\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 330(a)(1) (Supp. II 1984). The twelve factors analyzed in <em>Barber </em>are a parallel but more detailed approach to addressing the important considerations involved in setting attorney\u2019s fees, and we agree with the courts of appeals in the eighth and fifth circuits that the twelve-factor analysis of <em>Barber </em>is appropriate to determine attorney\u2019s fee awards in bankruptcy. <em>In re McCombs, </em>751 F.2d 286, 288 (8th Cir.1984) (fee award under \u00a7 330); <em>In re U.S. Golf Corp., </em>639 F.2d 1197, 1201 (5th Cir.1981) (fee award under Bankruptcy Act of 1898). <em>Accord In re Watson Seafood &amp; Poultry Co., Inc., </em>40 B.R. 436, 438-39 (Bankr.E.D.N.C.1984) (\u00a7 330); <em>In re Harman Supermarket, Inc., </em>44 B.R. 918, 920 (Bankr.W.D.Va.1984) (\u00a7 560). <em>See also </em>2 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00a7 330.05, at 330-18 (15th ed. 1983) (\u201cthe original <em>Johnson [v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc.] </em>factors ... remain applicable to the determination of the reasonableness of fees awarded under the Code\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-12\">We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact as to the <em>Barber </em>factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>under the clearly erroneous standard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under that standard, findings of fact will be affirmed unless our review of the entire record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). Nothing in this record raises any doubt concerning the correctness of the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings. It explored some of the factors in more detail than others, but there is sufficient evidence to support each finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-4\">Finally, in setting a reasonable fee on the basis of its findings, the bankruptcy court committed no abuse of its discretion. <em>See Tousley v. North American Van Lines, Inc., </em>752 F.2d 96, 105 (4th Cir.1985). It considered each <em>Barber </em>factor as well as \u201cother considerations\u201d in fixing the fees. One of the \u201cother considerations\u201d was Harman\u2019s claim that the fees in a bankruptcy case should be treated as contingent because of the possibility that the plan will fail and the fees will not be paid. Moreover, the bankruptcy judge presided over all of the proceedings in the ten cases at issue and was aware of both the nature and quality of the efforts expended by Harman and was in a better position than a reviewing court to gauge the value of his services. Although the bankruptcy court did not arrive at the fee award by a simple time/hourly rate calculation, its method was in accord with the general rationale of <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases often involve a number of relatively routine questions with which regular practitioners quickly become familiar, so they represent the type of cases where a court may well utilize factors in addition to the time reasonably expended and a reasonable hourly rate. <em>See Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 434 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. at 1940 n. 9; <em>Arnold v. Burger King Corp., </em>719 F.2d 63, 67 (4th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 108, 83 L.Ed.2d 51 (1984); <em>cf. Ballard v. Schweiker, </em>724 F.2d 1094, 1096-97 (4th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>Blankenship v. Schweiker, </em>676 F.2d 116, 118 (4th Cir.1982)) (appropriate to consider all factors in, rather than apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>strict time/hourly rate analysis to, \u201crepetitive\u201d black lung and social security disability benefit cases). Despite Harman\u2019s other objections to the fee awards, we cannot say that under all the facts and circumstances the awards were clearly wrong. <em>Barber, </em>577 F.2d at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the district court appealed from herein are</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">. Under <em>Barber </em>a court fixing a fee award must consider the following twelve factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1240-6\">(I) the time and labor expended; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions raised; (3) the skill required to properly perform the legal services rendered; (4) the attorney\u2019s opportunity costs in pressing the instant litigation; (5) the customary fee for like work; (6) the attorney\u2019s expectations at the outset of the litigation; (7) the time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances; (8) the amount in controversy and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation and ability of the attorney; (10) the undesirability of the case within the legal community in which the suit arose; (II) the nature and length of the professional relationship between attorney and client; and (12) attorneys\u2019 fees awards in similar cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">577 F.2d at 226 n. 28 (relying on <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974)). Although the Supreme Court noted in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 434 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1940 n. 9, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), that many of these factors may be duplicative if the court first determines the hours expended by the attorney and a reasonable hourly rate for his services, independent consideration of each factor is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Ibid.; Arnold v. Burger King Corp., </em>719 F.2d 63, 67 &amp; n. 4 (4th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 108, 83 L.Ed.2d 51 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1240-14\">.

Bankruptcy Rule 8013, promulgated by the Supreme Court under the Bankruptcy Code, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1241-10\">On an appeal the district court or bankruptcy appellate panel may affirm, modify, or reverse a bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment, order, or decree or remand with instructions for further proceedings.

In <em>1616 Reminc Limited Partnership v. Atchison &amp; Keller Co. (In re 1616 Reminic Limited Partnership), </em>704 F.2d 1313 (4th Cir.1983), we held that the materially identical predecessor to this rule, Rule 810 under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, \"unconstitutionally vested the non-Article III bankruptcy referee with too great a measure of the judicial power of the United States.\u201d 704 F.2d at 1318. We characterized that ruling as a \u201cnarrow\u201d one, restricting only the authority of an Article I court to determine \"\u2018a \"traditional\u201d state common-law action, not made subject to a federal rule of decision, and related only peripherally to an adjudication of bankruptcy under federal law.\u2019 \u201d 704 F.2d at 1318 (quoting <em>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipeline Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, 92, 102 S.Ct. 2858, 2882, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982) (Burger, C.J., dissenting)). The constitutional limitation identified in <em>Reminc </em>does not apply, therefore, when the bankruptcy court determines a matter closely related to an adjudication of bankruptcy under federal law. To the contrary, the \"application of the clearly erroneous standard has been 'routinely upheld\u2019 in proceedings within the core area of the federal bankruptcy power.\u201d <em>In re Reid, </em>757 F.2d 230, 234 n. 5 (10th Cir.1985) (citing <em>In re Osborne, </em>42 B.R. 988, 994 n. 1 (W.D.Wis.1984)). As <em>Reid </em>indicates, 757 F.2d at 234 n. 5, this distinction between core and non-core matters is reflected in the appellate review provisions of the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, \u00a7 104(a), Pub.L. No. 98-353, 98 Stat. 333 (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157(c)(1), 158(c)). Under that statute findings of fact rendered in \u201ccore proceedings\u201d receive clearly erroneous deference, <em>In re Reid, </em>757 F.2d at 234 n. 5; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c), while findings in non-core proceedings must be reviewed <em>de novo. In re Reid, </em>757 F.2d at 234 n. 5; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-13\">Awards of compensation for services rendered to the estate pursuant to section 330, including the attorney\u2019s fees involved in the instant case, are incidents of the administration of the estate and are closely tied to the exercise of the federal bankruptcy power. As such they are core proceedings and a bankruptcy court\u2019s fact-findings relating to them are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
