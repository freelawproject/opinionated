Hansen, appeals from his conviction for making false statements in matters within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (1982), based on omissions in financial disclosure statements he filed under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-521, 92 Stat. 1824 (codified as amended in scattered sections of Titles 2, 5,18, 26, and 28 U.S.C. (1982)) (\u201cEIGA\u201d). The primary issues on appeal are whether violations of the EIGA are subject to the criminal penalties of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, whether the omissions from Hansen\u2019s forms were material, and whether Hansen\u2019s trial started within the time limits established by the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161-74 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-19\">Title I of the EIGA, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-09, requires Members of Congress to file annual financial disclosure reports detailing, with certain exceptions, their income, gifts, assets, financial obligations, and business transactions. Hansen was indicted on four counts for failing to disclose, respectively, a $50,000 bank loan to his wife, cosigned by Nelson Bunker Hunt, on his form for 1978, an $87,475 silver commodities profit on his form for 1979, a $61,503.42 loan from Nelson Bunker Hunt on his form for 1980, and $135,000 in loans from private individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>on his form for 1981. He was not indicted, however, under any provision of the EIGA, but rather under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, which forbids the willful filing of false statements in any matter within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\">Before trial, Hansen moved to dismiss the indictment on grounds that \u00a7 1001 was not applicable to EIGA violations, that he was singled out for prosecution in violation of the fifth amendment to the Constitution, and that the filing of financial disclosure reports under the EIGA constituted \u201clegislative activity\u201d protected by the Speech and Debate Clause of the Constitution, U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 6, cl. 1. The District Court denied the motion. <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>566 F.Supp. 162 (D.D.C.1983). This court affirmed the order of the District Court with respect to the Speech and Debate Clause issue and found that the other two issues did not involve an appealable \u201cfinal decision\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>No. 83-1689 (D.C.Cir. Aug. 1,1983) (unpublished Order), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 709, 79 L.Ed.2d 173 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">At trial, Hansen relied principally on an advice-of-counsel defense, contending that two of his attorneys had advised him that the transactions in question were not reportable. The jury rejected this defense and found the accused guilty on all four counts. Hansen appeals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. He and amici<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> urge reversal on numerous grounds, only three of which warrant discussion beyond that contained in the District Court\u2019s opinions and rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">The most significant issue presented is whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 has any application to EIGA violations. The language of the statute reads, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-10\">Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully ... makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">Section 1001 is a statute of general applicability, designed to protect a \u201cmyriad [of] governmental activities.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodgers, </em>466 U.S. 475, 104 S.Ct. 1942, 1946, 80 L.Ed.2d 492 (1984). Its \u201csweeping ... language,\u201d <em>id., </em>clearly embraces the omissions on Hansen\u2019s EIGA forms. The House Committee with which the forms were filed is a \u201cdepartment\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1001, since that term \u201cwas meant to describe the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the Government.\u201d <em>United States v. Bramblett, </em>348 U.S. 503, 509, 75 S.Ct. 504, 508, 99 L.Ed. 594 (1955). <em>See United States v. Diggs, </em>613 F.2d 988, 999 (D.C.Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 982, 100 S.Ct. 2961, 64 L.Ed.2d 838 (1980) (false statements submitted to House of Representatives Office of Finance covered by \u00a7 1001). The subject of the forms is also a \u201cmatter within the jurisdiction\u201d of that department, since the Supreme Court has held that phrase \u201cshould not be given a narrow or technical meaning,\u201d <em>Bryson v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 64, 70, 90 S.Ct. 355, 359, 24 L.Ed.2d 264 (1969), but applies whenever there is \u201c \u2018statutory basis for an agency\u2019s request for information,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rodgers, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1947 (quoting <em>Bryson, </em>396 U.S. at 71, 90 S.Ct. at 359). The \u201crequest\u201d here is made by the statute itself, which requires the forms to be filed with the Clerk of the House for transmission to the Committee, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 703, 705. The fact that the Committee can take no dispositive action with regard to matters disclosed on the forms, but can only investigate and make recommendations to the full House, <em>see </em>House Rule X, cl. 4(e)(1)(B), is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>inconsequential, since the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d embraces the authority to conduct an official inquiry, <em>see United States v. Rodgers, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1947 &amp; n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">In light of the plain applicability of \u00a7 1001, Hansen misperceives the issue before us when he urges, to quote the caption of the first section of argument in his principal brief, that \u201cCongress prescribed only a civil remedy and did not authorize criminal punishment for the submission of a false EIGA statement.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 27. It was not necessary for the Congress that enacted the EIGA to authorize criminal punishment, for that authorization had been conferred by an earlier Congress, and remained on the statute books. The precise issue is whether the Congress that enacted the EIGA <em>precluded </em>the criminal sanctions that would otherwise attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">In approaching that issue, we give appellant the benefit of the doubt on a preliminary epistemological point: We will assume (without deciding) that an erroneous congressional belief, expressed in the statute or evident in its legislative history, that \u00a7 1001 did not by its terms apply, would be fully equivalent to an explicit decision to preclude its application, so that the result would be an inadvertent <em>pro tanto </em>repeal of \u00a7 1001 rather than the enactment of an obligation inadvertently subject to criminal penalties. On the other ' hand, we have no choice but to make appellant\u2019s task more difficult on another preliminary point: It is a venerable rule, frequently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, that \u201c \u2018repeals by implication are not favored,\u2019 \u201d <em>Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 189, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2299, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978) (quoting <em>Morton v. Mancari, </em>417 U.S. 535, 549, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 2482, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974), quoting <em>Posadas v. National City Bank, </em>296 U.S. 497, 503, 56 S.Ct. 349, 352, 80 L.Ed. 351 (1936)); <em>see generally </em>1A Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 23.10 (C. Sands 4th ed. 1972 &amp; 1985 Supp.), and will not be found unless an intent to repeal is \u201c \u2018clear and manifest.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Borden Co., </em>308 U.S. 188, 198, 60 S.Ct. 182, 188, 84 L.Ed. 181 (1939) (quoting <em>Red Rock v. Henry, </em>16 Otto 596, 602, 106 U.S. 596, 602, 1 S.Ct. 434, 439, 27 L.Ed. 251 (1883)). It will not do to give this principle of statutory interpretation mere lip service and vacillating practical application. A steady adherence to it is important, primarily to facilitate not the task of judging but the task of legislating. It is one of the fundamental ground rules under which laws are framed. Without it, determining the effect of a bill upon the body of preexisting law would be inordinately difficult, and the legislative process would become distorted by a sort of blind gamesmanship, in which Members of Congress vote for or against a particular measure according to their varying estimations of whether its implications will be held to suspend the effects of an earlier law that they favor or oppose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">Hansen argues that the presumption against implied repeal is inapplicable to this case, since no repeal is involved. He reasons that since there was no obligation for Members of Congress to make financial disclosures before adoption of the EIGA in 1978, there was no preexisting criminal liability to repeal. We cannot accept this resourceful characterization of the issue, which would render statutes such as \u00a7 1001 the most feeble of enactments, virtually requiring for their application to new obligations (as appellant\u2019s brief at times urges) an affirmative intent, in the legislation creating the new obligations, that they should apply. The fallacy in appellant\u2019s analysis is that it takes the presumption against implied repeal to be a rule based exclusively upon assumed substantive inertia rather than \u2014 what in our view it is \u2014 a rule based primarily upon assumed legislative practice. The major rationale of the presumption, in modern times at least, is not that Congress is unlikely to change the law \u2014 so that in the present case, where there was no preexisting criminal liability for this particular filing, the presumption would be inapplicable; but rather, that Congress \u201clegislate^] with knowledge of former related statutes,\u201d <em>Continental In</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number><em>surance Co. v. Simpson, </em>8 F.2d 439, 442 (4th Cir.1925), and will expressly designate the provisions whose application it wishes to suspend, rather than leave that consequence to the uncertainties of implication compounded by the vagaries of judicial construction. The application of that rationale to the present case is clear: The terms of \u00a7 1001 cover falsification of EIGA financial disclosure forms; if Congress wished to exclude that coverage it would normally have said so; we will not readily conclude that it did so by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">With these principles in mind, then, we proceed to consider whether the EIGA repeals the application of \u00a7 1001 to its disclosure provisions. It does not do so expressly \u2014 even though it does take pain to exclude application of \u201cany <em>State or local law </em>with respect to financial disclosure by reason of holding the office of Member or candidacy for Federal office.\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 708 (emphasis added). (We note in passing that, if repeal was in fact intended, this absence of express exclusion is even more strange than it would normally be since, as we shall discuss in more detail below, the threatened application of \u00a7 1001 was explicitly brought to the attention of a House committee that reported one version of the bill both by the Department of Justice and by the Clerk of the House, and to the attention of the full House, in floor debate, by two of its Members.) We look then, for some indication of implicit repeal strong enough to overcome the contrary presumption. Hansen points to 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-6\">The Attorney General may bring a civil action in any appropriate United States district court against any individual who knowingly and willfully falsifies or who knowingly and willfully fails to file or report any information that such individ- \u2022 ual is required to report pursuant to section 702 of this title. The court in which such action is brought may assess against such individual a civil penalty in any amount not to exceed $5,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">He argues that this provision \u201cappears, on its face, to contain the complete sanction that Congress has prescribed for any knowing and willful falsification.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 29. It does indeed represent the complete sanction that the 1978 Congress provided, but the question remains whether it clearly suggests a repeal of the sanction provided by earlier legislators. We think not. There is no difficulty in applying both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. Indeed, the two sections combine to produce a natural progression in penalties: those who intentionally fail to file EIGA forms are subject only to the civil sanction of \u00a7 706, while those who lie on their forms are additionally subject to the criminal penalty of \u00a7 1001. If this does not represent evident harmony, it at least does not begin to approach the \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d that the Supreme Court has instructed us to require as textual evidence of an implicit repeal. <em>Red Rock v. Henry, </em>106 U.S. at 601, 1 S.Ct. 438. <em>See, e.g., Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., </em>456 U.S. 461, 468, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 1890, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982). Surely the attachment of this civil sanction is less suggestive of an intent to displace \u00a7 1001 than the attachment of a criminal sanction would be. Yet even in this <em>a fortiori </em>situation, the courts have uniformly rejected displacement claims. For example, in <em>United States v. Burnett, </em>505 F.2d 815 (9th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Lyon v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 966, 95 S.Ct. 1361, 43 L.Ed.2d 445 (1975), defendants argued that they should have been charged under a specific misdemeanor statute forbidding false statements to obtain unemployment benefits rather than under the felony provisions of \u00a7 1001. The Ninth Circuit disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-9\">To assume ... that the mere passage of a specific statute covering an area of conduct also regulated by a more general statute limits enforcement of the general statute by carving out an exception to it ... is, in effect, to accomplish partial repeal of the general statute. Repeals by implication are not favored; effect should be given to overlapping statutes if possible____ In the present case the Government had the option of proceeding under either statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>505 F.2d at 816 (citation omitted). <em>See also, e.g., United States v. Fern, </em>696 F.2d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.1983) (false statements made to an IRS auditor could be prosecuted under either \u00a7 1001 or a specific provision in the Internal Revenue Code); <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>548 F.2d 743, 745 (8th Cir.1977) (false statements to obtain medicare payments could be prosecuted under either \u00a7 1001 or a more specific criminal statute); <em>United States v. Radetsky, </em>535 F.2d 556, 567-68 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 820, 97 S.Ct. 68, 50 L.Ed.2d 81 (1976) (same); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>526 F.2d 1276, 1278 (5th Cir. 1976) (false statements in connection with Small Business Administration loan applications could be prosecuted under either \u00a7 1001 or a specific criminal provision governing the loan applications).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Hansen also discerns implied repeal in a difference between 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 706 and 704. The latter section, entitled \u201cAccessibility of reports,\u201d deals generally with the manner in which the public obtains access to EIGA disclosure forms. Subsection 704(e) prohibits use of the forms for certain purposes (including commercial purposes, the determination of credit ratings and the solicitation of money) and authorizes a civil action by the Attorney General, similar to that in \u00a7 706, for violation of that prohibition. Unlike \u00a7 706, however, it contains the following stipulation: \u201cSuch remedy shall be in addition to any other remedy available under statutory or common law.\u201d Hansen argues that the absence of a similar provision in \u00a7 706 shows that Congress meant <em>that </em>civil remedy to be exclusive. We think not. The two statutory sections are simply not so parallel that equivalent language in this respect would be expected. Of course 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 would in any event have no application to violations of \u00a7 704, so it is surely not the continuing effect of that criminal provision that was being explicitly preserved. But more importantly, \u00a7 704, unlike \u00a7 706, addresses an area where \u2014 without the specific disclaimer \u2014 it might be thought that private civil actions were precluded, notably, state actions for defamation of credit or invasion of privacy. The language of the disclaimer seems specifically directed to civil actions, since criminal sanctions are rarely described as \u201cremedies.\u201d In sum, we agree with the District Court that the reason for spelling out the absence of preclusion or repeal in \u00a7 704 was the possibility that otherwise its provision of a civil remedy might be held to preclude private civil actions; and that \u201c[a]s there is no parallel private right with respect to the requirement in section 702 to file correct reports, there is no proper analogy between section 706 (which enforces section 702) and section 704.\u201d 566 F.Supp. at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">Appellant and <em>amici </em>point out that many statutes imposing new reporting requirements explicitly provide that the criminal penalties of \u00a7 1001 will be applicable. <em>See, e.g., </em>the Federal Pesticide Act of 1978, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136h(g)(3) (1982). They infer from this a constant congressional belief that \u00a7 1001 does not apply to new reporting statutes in the absence of express provision, so that that absence here is determinative. The argument is flawed as a technical matter, because it deprives \u00a7 1001 of its plainly intended self-operative effect, reducing it, insofar as subsequently enacted reporting obligations are concerned, to no more than a shorthand code to which Congress can conveniently refer when it wishes to enact criminal penalties. And it is flawed as a plausible estimation of congressional belief, since it posits that Congress has both consistently misunderstood one of the basic rules of legislation \u2014 under which \u00a7 1001 would apply to new reporting statutes absent express provision to the contrary, <em>see supra </em>pages 944-45 and consistently ignored numerous decisions holding \u00a7 1001 applicable to reporting statutes silent on the point, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Burnett, supra. </em>A much more likely explanation is that Congress included the references to \u00a7 1001 as a means of reminding those subject to the new laws of the self-operative, previously enacted sanctions, or as a means of clarifying for its own Members who voted upon the new laws the consequences of their action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>Even if one thinks the references were included for their operative effect, they necessarily establish no more than that Congress chose in some cases to make assurance doubly sure, but did not do so here. One might surmise \u2014 though it would be only a surmise \u2014 that the failure to include such redundancy in the EIGA was not mere happenstance, but was rather attributable to the belief that some Members of Congress, and perhaps even a number providing the crucial margin for passage of the bill, would have objected to the inclusion. But even if true this falls far short of establishing a belief on the part of Congress as a whole that \u00a7 1001 was not independently applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">There is one other arguable textual indication of repeal, not raised by appellant or <em>amici, </em>but worthy of attention: 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(b), which provides for advisory opinions interpreting the EIGA to be issued by the designated committees of the House and Senate, prescribes that any individual \u201cwho, after the issuance of the advisory opinion, acts in good faith in accordance with the provisions and findings of such advisory opinion shall not, as a result of such act, be subject to any sanction provided <em>in this chapter.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Since it can hardly be thought that Congress meant the advisory opinion to be a protection against the civil sanctions of the EIGA but not against the criminal penalties of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, the italicized limitation arguably indicates a belief that \u00a7 1001 is not applicable. The point would have great force if, by reason of the limitation of the provision to sanctions \u201cin this chapter,\u201d an advisory opinion would in fact not immunize against \u00a7 1001 criminal prosecution. But that is obviously not so. Good faith reliance upon advice of counsel would establish a defense against \u00a7 1001, <em>see United States v. Smith, </em>523 F.2d 771, 778 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 59, 50 L.Ed.2d 76 (1976); reliance upon a specifically authorized pronouncement of one of the designated committees would <em>a fortiori </em>do so. The limitation of the immunization to sanctions \u201cin this chapter\u201d thus creates no legislative absurdity, and is at most weak evidence of a belief that \u00a7 1001 does not apply. It may have been included simply because that is the routine formulation (so routine that it did not attract the attention of appellant and <em>amici </em>here); or because it was thought necessary to establish this defense against the new civil sanctions, but superfluous to do so against the criminal penalty of \u00a7 1001, with its well-established requirements of <em>mens rea, see, e.g., United States v. Mekjian, </em>505 F.2d 1320, 1324 (5th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">Finally, Hansen relies upon certain portions of the legislative history of the EIGA. We will not review them at length, since they are set forth and discussed fully in the opinion of the District Court. As the District Court found, while there is categorical indication in the legislative history that some Members of Congress believed \u00a7 1001 would apply by its terms to an EIGA violation, there is no <em>unequivocal </em>indication that <em>any </em>Member of Congress thought the contrary. Fairly read, however, several statements suggest the latter belief. But even if they are fully credited, they do not establish that as the belief of Congress by the \u201cclear and manifest\u201d evidence the Supreme Court has instructed us to require. Reading the legislative history in the light most favorable to Hansen, it reveals that both the Clerk of the House and the Department of Justice \u2014 the latter speaking to one proposed version of the EIGA that did not contain its own criminal penalty, and three proposed versions that did (which, as observed earlier, would even more strongly suggest preclusion of \u00a7 1001) \u2014 expressed to the relevant House committee the view that \u00a7 1001 would apply; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the criminal sanction provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>included in earlier House and Senate versions of the EIGA were dropped from the final bill, with the explanation by one of the bill\u2019s proponents in the House that it was done \u201cto get the bill through the House,\u201d 124 Cong.Rec. 30,457 (1978) (remarks of Rep, Bauman); and that in the House debate several Members expressed views indicating a belief that \u00a7 1001 would not apply to EIGA violations, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>at 30,414 (remarks of Rep. Danielson), 30,415 (remarks of Rep. Moorhead), while two Members (one an opponent and one a supporter of the bill) stated explicitly their belief that it would, <em>see id. </em>at 30,429 (remarks of Rep. Wiggins), 30,444 (remarks of Rep. Thompson). We simply cannot see in this a \u201cclear and manifest\u201d indication of congressional belief that \u00a7 1001 was excluded. To the contrary, the pattern is entirely consistent with the sort of legislative gamesmanship we described earlier, in which some Members of Congress were gambling on the expectation that \u00a7 1001 would be precluded, and others (who favored criminal penalties) were gambling on the opposite. The weakness of indication of legislative intent is highlighted when one realizes that all the expressions of views described in the foregoing legislative history pertain only to the House. We have no indication beyond the text of the statute what members of the Senate thought on this issue. For all we know, they may have receded from the criminal penalties adopted in the Senate version of the bill, <em>see </em>S. 555, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1978, p. 4216, <em>reprinted in </em>123 Cong. Rec. 21,017 (1977), only because they thought it certain or likely that \u00a7 1001 applied anyway. Precisely that explanation is suggested by the curious failure of the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference to mention the elimination of criminal penalties, <em>see </em>H.R. Rep. No. 1756, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 65-69 (1978), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 4381, and by the curious description of the conference outcome reported to the House floor by one of the conferees: \u201cAs in the House version, <em>specific reference </em>to criminal penalties was removed from this legislation.\u201d 124 Cong.Rec. 36,467 (1978) (remarks of Rep. Moorhead) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">The District Court reached \u201c[t]he inescapable conclusion ... that Congress simply did not intend to render section 1001 inapplicable to the intentional falsification of EIGA financial disclosure reports.\u201d 566 F.Supp. at 168-69. <em>Accord, United States v. Claiborne, </em>No. CR-R-83-57-WEH (D.Nev. unpublished transcript of Mar. 13, 1984 proceedings). We need not go that far. It suffices that there is not remotely \u2014 neither in the textual indications we have considered, nor in the various episodes of legislative history, nor in all of them combined \u2014 a <em>clear and manifest </em>indication of an intent to repeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">Hansen appeals to the so-called rule of lenity: \u201c \u2018ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971) (quoting <em>Rewis v. United States, </em>401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 1059, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971)). It is, quite frankly, difficult to assess the scope of this accepted principle. One can recite, as ap-pellee has, the Supreme Court\u2019s advice that it \u201conly serves as an aid for resolving an ambiguity; it is not to be used to beget one.\u201d <em>Callanan v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 587, 596, 81 S.Ct. 321, 326, 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961) (footnote omitted). But in truth that provides little more than atmospherics, since it leaves open the crucial question\u2014 almost invariably present \u2014 of how much ambiguousness constitutes an ambiguity. In the present case, however, we think the answer is plain. When faced with questions of interpretation relating to \u00a7 1001, pertaining to matters at least as \u201cambiguous\u201d as the alleged repealer here, and not even involving the presumption against implied repeal, the Supreme Court has found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>the rule of lenity inapplicable. <em>See United States v. Yermian, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2936, 2940 n. 7, 82 L.Ed.2d 53 (1984); <em>United States v. Rodgers, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1948-49. Moreover, to the extent the rule is based upon solicitude for the individual defendant who violates the law before its meaning is clarified, rather than upon some more general notion that in case of doubt Congress should not be deemed to have unsheathed the sword of criminal penalty, it has no valid application here. Hansen has not only not been surprised by a novel or unexpected interpretation of the law, <em>of. United States v. Mallas, </em>762 F.2d 361, 363 (4th Cir.1985), but was in fact warned of its application with a specificity that a prospective lawbreaker rarely enjoys. The forms that Hansen signed all contained a warning, immediately above or below the signature line, that \u201c[a]ny individual who knowingly and willfully falsifies, or who knowingly and willfully fails to file this report may be subject to civil and criminal sanctions. See 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">Hansen contends that even if \u00a7 1001 applies to his EIGA filings, he has not violated that statute because the omissions from his forms were not \u201cmaterial.\u201d The portion of \u00a7 1001 under which Hansen was charged, <em>see supra </em>page 942, does not explicitly require a showing of materiality, but we have held that requirement to be implicit, <em>see Freidus v. United States, </em>223 F.2d 598, 601 (D.C.Cir.1955). As we have described the requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-9\">The test of materiality is whether the statement \u201chas a natural tendency to influence, or was capable of influencing, the decision of the tribunal in making a [particular] determination.\u201d Proof of actual reliance on the statement is not required; the Government need only make a reasonable showing of its potential effects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\"><em>United States v. Diggs, </em>613 F.2d at 999 (quoting <em>Weinstock v. United States, </em>231 F.2d 699, 701-02 (D.C.Cir.1956)) (footnote omitted). Hansen argues that his omissions could not have been material because no federal agency or department \u201cwas conducting any inquiry or investigation, or making any determination whatever, that would have been affected in the slightest if Congressman Hansen had, in 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982 put on his EIGA forms the debts and transactions which the indictment alleges he should have reported.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 53. This argument misunderstands the nature of the materiality requirement: A lie influencing the possibility that an investigation might commence stands in no better posture under \u00a7 1001 than a lie distorting an investigation already in progress. <em>See United States v. McIntosh, </em>655 F.2d 80, 83 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 948, 102 S.Ct. 1450, 71 L.Ed.2d 662 (1982) (false statement material because \u201cdisclosure of the truth could have provoked the agency to action\u201d). And it is beyond doubt that information contained on (or omitted from) EIGA forms could in some cases influence the possibility of an authorized investigation by a federal department. As noted earlier, House committees are federal departments for the purposes of \u00a7 1001. As required by 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 703(d)(1), the reports filed by Hansen with the Clerk of the House were forwarded by him to the \u201cdesignated committee\u201d of the House, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. That is the committee charged by the House with the duty, among others, \u201cto investigate ... any alleged violation, by a Member, officer, or employee of the House, of the Code of Official Conduct or of any law, rule, regulation, or other standard of conduct ... and after notice and hearing, to recommend to the House, by resolution or otherwise, such action as the committee may deem appropriate ____\u201d House Rule X, cl. 4(e)(1)(B). House Rules restrict in some respects the receipt by Members of money in the form of gifts or income (Rules XLIII, cl. 3; XLI-II, cl. 4; XLVII) and require Members to behave in a fashion which \u201cshall reflect creditably on the House of Representatives\u201d (Rule XLIII, cl. 1). The Standards Committee\u2019s rules require its staff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>\u201cpresent to it any evidence available to the staff reasonably indicating that any Member ... may have committed a violation\u201d of these House Rules, and provide that the Committee shall conduct an investigation if it determines that that evidence merits further inquiry. Committee Rule XIII. Thus, the statute and the House and Committee Rules combine to authorize examination of EIGA forms and consequent investigation to detect violations of House ethical standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Further addressing the \u201cmateriality\u201d point, Hansen asserts that there was no indication that his omissions had, in the words of <em>Diggs, supra, </em>a \u201cnatural tendency to influence\u201d any investigation, whether ongoing or potential. There is no doubt that specific disclosure of the actual transactions in question would have had such a tendency: after they came to light, the Committee undertook an investigation and concluded that the transactions violated House Rules. <em>See In the Matter of Representative George V. Hansen, </em>H.R.Rep. No. 891, Vol. 1, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 2, 325-26, 388, 425 (1984). Hansen\u2019s point, however, is that because of the nature of the EIGA forms the required disclosure would have been too general to have influenced any investigation or action. With respect to one of the omitted transactions, a bank loan to his wife cosigned by Nelson Bunker Hunt, he notes that the only effect of including the omitted material would have been to add one more line to his form for 1978: \u201cFirst National Bank of Dallas III\u201d (\u201cHI\u201d indicates indebtedness from $15,000 to $50,000). This, he argues, would not remotely have disclosed that aspect of the transaction which presumably violated House Rules (the fact that Hunt was guarantor of the loan) and thus would have had no \u201cnatural tendency\u201d to provoke Committee investigation or action. Assuming that this correctly describes the reporting requirement (which is by no means clear),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hansen has selected, of course, the exam-pie best suited to his case; the other required disclosures would have been much more informative. We are of the view, however, that even a falsification of this sort comes within \u00a7 1001. The materiality requirement that we have found implicit in that provision excludes a matter unrelated to the subject of the agency\u2019s or department\u2019s responsibility \u2014 for example, misrepresenting the occupation of a corporate director where that is irrelevant to the determination at hand, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Talkington, </em>589 F.2d 415, 417 (9th Cir.1978). But where, as here, the falsification pertains specifically to the area the department is charged to investigate (a filing Member\u2019s financial transactions), and tends to conceal in any degree \u2014 even beyond the point where further concealment might be thought superfluous \u2014 material that would prompt or affect an investigation, we will look no further. Application of \u00a7 1001 does not require judges to function as amateur sleuths, inquiring whether information specifically requested and unquestionably relevant to the department\u2019s or agency\u2019s charge would really be enough to alert a reasonably clever investigator that wrongdoing was afoot. Here the falsifications related to financial transactions within the Committee\u2019s charge, and tended to conceal information that would have prompted investigation or action; no more is needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">Hansen further argues that the District Court improperly withheld this materiality question from the jury. We have previously held, however, that materiality under \u00a7 1001 is a matter of law to be determined by the court. <em>See Weinstock v. United States, </em>231 F.2d at 703. A majority of the circuits has reached the same conclusion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lopez, </em>728 F.2d 1359, 1362 n. 4 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 112, 83 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984); <em>but see, e.g., United States v. Irwin, </em>654 F.2d 671, 677 n. 8 (10th Cir.1981), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1016, 102 S.Ct. 1709, 72 L.Ed.2d 133 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">Hansen alleges that his trial did not commence within the time limits of the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161-74 (1982). The seventy-day time period specified in the Act was due to expire on February 24, 1984. On January 26, Hansen agreed to a trial date of March 19, 1984, thereby waiving his right to have the trial start sooner. The trial did not commence until March 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">Virtually all of the time from January 26 to March 19, however, was excludable for purposes of the Speedy Trial Act\u2019s seventy-day time calculation. The Act provides in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F) that periods of delay \u201cresulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion\u201d may be excluded from the seventy-day period. During almost the entire period from January 26 to March 19, numerous pretrial motions filed by the government and Hansen were under consideration by the court. Likewise during this period, the Clerk of the House of Representatives filed a motion to quash a subpoena in the case, which the court considered for several weeks. Hansen asserts that delays arising from such motions had already been envisioned in the court\u2019s fixing, and the defendant\u2019s acceptance, of the March 19 date, so that that date had to be regarded as subject to no further extensions permitted by the Speedy Trial Act. Although the trial judge\u2019s order setting the trial date of March 19 did state that the extension would \u201callow the filing or revival of anticipated motions which might well require substantial responses by the parties,\u201d <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>Crim. No. 83-00075, slip op. at 2 (D.D.C. Jan. 27, 1984), it seems to us most unlikely that the experienced trial judge here meant to imply that the extension was final and absolute. That would have displayed a foolhardy confidence in her ability precisely to calculate the time needed to dispose of yet-unforeseen pretrial matters \u2014 such as the defendant\u2019s last-minute motion for change of venue because of prejudicial publicity, which induced the trial court to require a sequestered jury, arrangements for which caused delay of the trial from March 19 to March 20. Assuming, however, that that was what the extension to March 19 meant, the consequence of the failure to comply with it would simply be retraction of the defendant\u2019s waiver of speedy trial rights that was the <em>quid pro quo. </em>The District Court would have no authority to create a mini-Speedy Trial Act by judicial fiat, binding itself to dismissing the prosecution in advance of the time the Speedy Trial Act would allow, and even against its own judgment of what justice required. At most, then, Hansen reacquired his previously waived Speedy Trial Act rights on March 20. Since those rights would still not have entitled him to dismissal, because of the tolling of the seventy-day period described above, commencement of the trial on March 20 was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">We have carefully considered all of Hansen\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit, substantially for the reasons given by the District Court in its rulings and opinions below. We affirm the conviction on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">.
