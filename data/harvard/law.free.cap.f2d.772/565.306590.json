WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b654-24\">This consolidated admiralty appeal requires us to determine the qualifications for trustee status under the Ship Mortgage Act (\u201cAct\u201d), 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 911-984. Initially, we must decide whether we have jurisdiction over the appeal brought by Pacific Fishermen, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-25\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b654-26\">Appellants Ballard Oil Company, Inc. (\u201cBallard\u201d), the Boatyard, Inc. (\u201cBoatyard\u201d), Lunde Electric Company, Inc. (\u201cLunde\u201d), and Pacific Fishermen, Inc. (\u201cPacific\u201d) are Washington corporations that furnished fuel, parts and other supplies to the BLUE OCEAN in 1980 and 1981. The BLUE OCEAN is a fishing and fish processing vessel owned by the Blue-water Partnership of Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>In 1980, the BLUE OCEAN was refurbished in the Karmsund Verft &amp; Mek. Versted A/S shipyard (\u201cKarmsund\u201d) in Norway. On May 13 and July 16, 1980, Bluewater executed two series of 10 promissory notes in favor of Karmsund. Two Norwegian agencies, Garantie Instituttet for Exportkredit (\u201cGIEK\u201d) and Exportfi-nans, refinanced or guaranteed the loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Bluewater executed two ship mortgages of the BLUE OCEAN as security. Seattle-First National Bank (\u201cSea-First\u201d) became the trustee. It had been approved by the Department of Commerce, Maritime Administration, to act as ship mortgage trustee for 1980-1894. Both mortgages were recorded with the Coast Guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The notes were endorsed to Bergen Bank A/S by Harry B. McLachlin, Esq., counsel for Sea-First. In April and July 1980, Bergen Bank of Norway (\u201cBergen\u201d), in trust for Exportfinans, and Sea-First executed Ship Mortgage Trust Agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The vessel remained under Bluewater\u2019s ownership and control. The ship mortgage trust agreements provided that: 1) the beneficiary Bergen had no legal title in the mortgages and no right to foreclose or otherwise enforce the mortgages, and 2) upon default, if consistent with its legal duties as trustee, Sea-First would enforce the lien of the mortgages by an admiralty proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Bluewater defaulted on the notes due to a poor 1980 fishing season. Late in December 1982, Sea-First filed a complaint in admiralty to foreclose the ship mortgages and to obtain <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over the BLUE OCEAN. Maritime lien claimants, including appellants, intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">In February 1983, a Marshal seized the vessel. In April, the court entered a default judgment against Bluewater. It did not appeal the judgment, which exceeded $5.6 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">The vessel was sold at a Marshal\u2019s sale in Seattle on August 31, 1983 for $560,000. Transpacific International Industries, Inc. (\u201cTranspacific\u201d) was the only bidder. Before the sale, Sea-First, GIEK and Transpacific had entered into a written agreement (referred to as the \u201cside agreement\u201d) which provided that if Transpacific\u2019s bid was less than $2,175 million, it would pay to GIEK and Sea-First the difference between $2,175 million and the amount paid the Marshal.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">On October 14, 1983, the court ordered disbursement of the sale proceeds from the court\u2019s registry upon Sea-First\u2019s filing a $560,000 indemnity bond to cover remaining unresolved maritime lien claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">On May 2, 1984, the court granted Sea-First\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment against Pacific and other lien claimants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It issued a brief order that Sea-First\u2019s preferred ship mortgage lien is prior and superior to the defendants\u2019 liens. Without giving his reasons, Judge Voo-rhees dismissed with prejudice defendants\u2019 <em>in rem </em>claims against the vessel and the sale proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-16\">Pacific moved for reconsideration on May 11. It joined Ballard, the Boatyard, and Lunde in a trial brief filed the same day. It participated in the pretrial order filed May 14 and in the trial held May 14 and 15. The court ruled for Sea-First in an oral decision announced May 15 and by memorandum decision filed May 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-17\">The court reasoned that Sea-First met \u201cthe five [statutory] requirements imposed by Congress upon any entity seeking to act as a trustee.\u201d Memorandum Decision filed May 17, 1984, at 3. Judge Voorhees found that those were the only requirements of a ship mortgage trustee. He ruled that Sea-First held valid preferred ship mortgages which had priority over defendants\u2019 maritime liens under 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 953(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-18\">On May 31, Pacific filed a notice of appeal from the court\u2019s May 2 partial summary judgment order. It assumed, however, that the order was not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>In mid-June, Sea-First and appellants moved for entry of judgment. The differences in the proposed judgments involved exoneration of the bond and a statement of the court\u2019s reasoning. Appellants desired to set forth the court\u2019s reasoning as to both partial summary judgment and final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">On July 18, 1984, Judge Voorhees entered judgment in the form proposed by defendants. Paragraph seven makes clear that \u201cthe court\u2019s ruling on partial summary judgment against these defendants is identical to that set forth in the court\u2019s Memorandum Decision of May 17, 1984.\u201d The court then confirmed the earlier ruling and denied Pacific\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">On July 26, Ballard, the Boatyard, and Lunde filed a notice of appeal from judgment entered July 18. Pacific did not appeal from the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). The issue of Sea-First's trustee duties under the Ship Mortgage Act involves the application of legal principles \u201cin the mix of fact and law\u201d and is reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195, 1202 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">I. <em>Jurisdiction Over Pacific\u2019s Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">The central issue of this case, the validity of the trust relationship between Sea-First and Bergen, was resolved by partial summary judgment as to some defendants and by trial on the merits as to appellants. Pacific straddled the fence. Its claims were dismissed by partial summary judgment, but it continued to participate in the proceedings which followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">We agree with Sea-First\u2019s assertion that this court lacks jurisdiction over Pacific\u2019s appeal because the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(3) are not met.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-15\">Section 1292(a)(3) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-16\">\u00a7 1292. Interlocutory decisions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-17\">(a) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-18\">* * :}: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-19\">(3) Interlocutory decrees of such district courts or the judges thereof determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-20\">The primary purpose of this provision is well-settled. Professor Moore states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-21\">It was a common practice for the admiralty court to determine first the issue of liability and, if it found liability, to refer the parties to a commissioner for the determination of damages. The purpose of \u00a7 1292(a)(3) was to permit a party found liable to take an immediate appeal from that finding and thereby possibly avoid an oftentimes costly and protracted trial of the damages issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-22\">9 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>H 110.19[3], at 209-210 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-23\">The section permits appeals only when the order appealed from determines the rights and liabilities of the parties. <em>Astarte Shipping Co. v. Allied Steel &amp; Export Co., </em>767 F.2d. 86, 88 (5th Cir.1985). <em>See also Patton-Tully Transportation Co. v. Ratliff, </em>715 F.2d 219, 222 (5th Cir.1983) (no interlocutory appeal from order determining plaintiff is a Jones Act seaman because it permitted the claim to proceed against defendant); <em>Gave Shipping Co., </em>S.A. <em>v. Parcel Tankers, Inc., </em>634 F.2d 1156, 1157 (9th Cir.1980) (no appellate jurisdiction because order granting motion to stay arbitration does not finally determine rights and liabilities of the parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-24\">Section 1292(a)(3) is an exception to the final judgment rule and, therefore, is construed narrowly. <em>See Hollywood Marine, Inc. v. M/V ARTIE JAMES, </em>755 F.2d 414, 416 (5th Cir.1985). <em>But see </em>16 Wright, Miller, Cooper &amp; Gressman, <em>Federal Prac</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>tice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3927, at 113 (1977) (some expansion has crept into the section\u2019s application).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Rule 54(b) certification is not a prerequisite to appellate jurisdiction under \u00a7 1292(a)(3). <em>Gulf Towing Co., Inc. v. S/T AMOCO NEW YORK, </em>648 F.2d 242, 244 (5th Cir.1981) (per curiam). We would have jurisdiction over Pacific\u2019s appeal if the May 2 order finally determined its claims as to Sea-First. <em>See Walter E. Heller &amp; Co. v. O/S SONNY V., </em>595 F.2d 968, 971 (5th Cir.1979) (\u00a7 1292(a)(3) jurisdiction from partial summary judgment order). It does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Pacific continued to litigate its claims after the May 2 order. It was not until entry of final judgment against appellants on July 18 that Pacific\u2019s claims finally were determined. Pacific should have appealed from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Pacific\u2019s reliance on the rule that subsequent events may cure premature notices of appeal is misplaced. <em>See Anderson v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>630 F.2d 677, 680-81 (9th Cir.1980) (subsequent events can validate prematurely filed appeal); <em>Ruby v. Secretary of the U.S. Navy, </em>365 F.2d 385, 389 (9th Cir.1966) (en banc) (premature notice of appeal will be directed to subsequently-entered final decision dismissing action), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U.S. 1011, 87 S.Ct. 1358, 18 L.Ed.2d 442 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">We find no reported admiralty case invoking the rule, probably because it clashes with \u00a7 1292(a)(3). Nor has the rule been applied where, as here, a defendant appeals an interlocutory dismissal, remains in the case for trial to see whether it can secure a favorable ruling, then fails to appeal entry of final judgment against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">A timely notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Director, Department of Corrections of Illinois, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 560, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); <em>Bordallo v. Reyes, et al., </em>763 F.2d 1098, 1101 (9th Cir.1985). After participating in the trial, Pacific should have joined the other appellants in their appeal from final judgment. Its appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">II. <em>Ship Mortgage Trustee Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">Ballard, Boatyard and Lunde (referred to as appellants) challenge the court\u2019s rulings that Sea-First\u2019s two ship mortgages are entitled to preferred status under the Ship Mortgage Act. They assert that Congress intended that a true trust relationship be maintained for preferred ship mortgage status.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">Before the Act\u2019s passage, it was impossible to foreclose on a ship mortgage in admiralty. <em>Bogart v. The John Jay, </em>58 U.S. (17 How.) 399, 401-02, 15 L.Ed. 95 (1854). \u201cThis inferior status provided the mortgage holder with little security, a fact which adversely affected investor interest.\u201d <em>Merchants National Bank of Mobile v. Ward Rig No. 7, </em>634 F.2d 952, 955 (5th Cir.1981). <em>See </em>G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black, Jr., <em>The Law of Admiralty </em>689 (2d ed. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">The Act was passed to stimulate private investment in U.S. shipping and to protect the United States as the principal source of credit. <em>Ward Rig, </em>634 F.2d at 955; G. Gilmore, <em>supra </em>at 691. <em>See generally </em>Gyory, <em>Security at Sea: A Review of the Preferred Ship Mortgage, </em>31 Fordham L.Rev. 231 (1962). Legislative history reflects the Act\u2019s dual purposes \u201cof encouraging low-interest private financing for the construction and reconstruction of American-flag ships, while at the same time limiting the possibility of foreign control of such ships.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1116, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 2, <em>reprinted in </em>1965 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4231, 4232.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">The Act grants preferred status to a mortgage lien on American-flag vessels owned by U.S. citizens. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922, 953. Only U.S. citizens may be ship mortgagees. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 922(a)(5). Mortgagee \u201cin the case of a mortgage involving a trust deed and a bond issue thereunder, means the trustee designated in such deed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 911(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Ship mortgages will not lose their preferred status where minor discrepancies exist. Substantial compliance with the Act\u2019s requirements is sufficient. <em>See Ward Rig, </em>634 F.2d at 957 (four-day discrepancy on maturity dates between mortgages and payment schedules not fatal to mortgages\u2019 validity); <em>Suburban Trust Co. v. O/S Teddy Bear, </em>1975 A.M.C. 1668, 1671 (M.D.Fla.1975) (discrepancies between date on mortgage and execution date had no adverse effect on defendants and would not affect validity of mortgage).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Thus, the Act permits foreign investment in U.S. vessels provided the financing technique involves a U.S. citizen as trustee. <em>See State Street Bank and Trust Co. v. F/V Seafreeze Atlantic, </em>1981 A.M.C. 2001, 2002-03 (E.D.Va.1979); <em>Moon Engineering Co. v. A/S VALIANT POWER, </em>214 F.Supp. 555, 559 (E.D.Va.1963) (trustee\u2019s citizenship is the Act\u2019s primary consideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The parties differ over the trustee\u2019s required duties and the effect of Congress\u2019 reaction to <em>Chemical Bank New York Trust Co. v. S/S Westhampton, </em>358 F.2d 574 (4th Cir.1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 921, 87 S.Ct. 228, 17 L.Ed.2d 145 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\"><em>Westhampton </em>involved a mortgage on an American-flag ship given to a U.S. citizen trustee to secure a bond held by a foreign bank. In denying preferred status, the Fourth Circuit held that the bond was an \u201cinterest\u201d in the ship and that \u201cthe transfer of the bond to an alien, illegal because made without Maritime Administration approval, infect[ed] the mortgage under which it was issued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Professors Gilmore and Black describe the aftermath of this decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhR\">The Westhampton evidently sent a thrill of horror through the financial community. Congress was speedily prevailed upon to enact \u2018clarifying legislation\u2019, since \u2018the Westhampton decision, if not clarified immediately, could east a cloud over all outstanding and future bond issues.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">G. Gilmore, <em>supra </em>at 697-98 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">Congress responded quickly with Pub.L. 89-346. The relevant provision, as amended in 1981, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-11\">No bond, note or other indebtedness which is secured by a mortgage of a vessel to a trustee may be issued, transferred, or assigned to a person not a citizen of the United States, without the approval of the Secretary of Transportation, unless the trustee or substitute trustee of such mortgage is approved by the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary of Transportation shall grant his approval if such trustee or substitute trustee is a bank or trust company which (1) is organized as a corporation, and is doing business, under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, (2) is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, (3) is a citizen of the United States, (4) is subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority, and (5) has a combined capital and surplus (as set forth in its most recent published report of condition) of at least $3,000,000____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">46 U.S.C. \u00a7 961(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">By this amendment, \u201cthe fiction that American-flag shipping will not be allowed to come under foreign control was elegantly maintained without being allowed to interfere with the realities of the marketplace.\u201d G. Gilmore, <em>supra </em>at 698. We find that Congress chose the broad terms \u201cbond, note, or other evidence of indebtedness\u201d to protect other prevalent types of vessel financing other than the bond issue used in the <em>Westhampton </em>ease. <em>See </em>1965 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4231-36; 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 961(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">The crux of this case is appellants\u2019 attack on Sea-First\u2019s trustee status. Sea-First admits that it did not negotiate the loans, hold the notes, collect the payments due under the notes, or negotiate with the borrower after default.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Judge Voorhees held, however, that Sea-First met the only requirements imposed by Congress upon a ship mortgage trustee. He wrote: \u201cCongress did not require that the trustee have or exercise all the powers that any trustee can exercise.\u201d Memorandum Decision at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Because nothing in the Act or its legislative history directly addresses the role of a ship mortgage trustee, appellants urge us to consult state law to fill a gap in the statute. We decline to do so because we find no gap to fill.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">As Judge Voorhees observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">Trustees can have as many different duties as there are reasons for the creation of a trust. The party who creates a trust can specify the duties of the trustee. In the present case the duties of the trustee were largely custodial pri- or to default.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Memorandum Decision at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Besides any duties defined in the trust agreement itself, we agree with Judge Voorhees that Congress did not intend additional requirements beyond those set forth in 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 961(e). To be a trustee, an entity must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">1) be organized as a corporation, doing business under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-11\">2) be authorized by federal or state law to exercise corporate trust powers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-12\">3) be a United States citizen;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-13\">4) be subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-14\">5) have a combined capital surplus of at least $3 million.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-15\"><em>See </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 961(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-16\">The Act\u2019s legislative history describes the U.S. trustee\u2019s requirements as \u201ccertain minimum standards.\u201d 1965 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 4235. Section 961(e) directs that once the requirements are met, \u201c[t]he Secretary of Transportation <em>shall </em>grant his approval\u201d (emphasis added). Moreover, the Maritime Administration\u2019s regulations state that \u201c[ajpplicants meeting the standards for trustees specified in Pub.L. 89-346 <em>will </em>be eligible for approval as trustees.\u201d 46 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.25(a) (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-18\">The court\u2019s findings that Sea-First satisfied its statutory duties under \u00a7 961(e) and its contractual duties under the Ship Mortgage Trust Agreements are not clearly erroneous. Nor is the finding that the side agreement before the marshal\u2019s sale did not affect the validity and priority of Sea-First\u2019s mortgages clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"aby-dedup-0\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b659-19\">The court\u2019s judgment for Sea-First against Ballard, Boatyard and Lunde is affirmed. Pacific\u2019s appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-10\">.
