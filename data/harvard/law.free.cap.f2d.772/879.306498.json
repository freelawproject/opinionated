The employee asks outright reversal and award of fees. We agree with the Board, vacate its fee decision and remand to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-14\">Petitioner Thomson, a ship\u2019s tank tester in the Philadelphia Navy Yard, was removed from his position for three times threatening his supervisors and for sleeping on duty. On his appeal to the MSPB, the presiding official determined, on conflicting evidence, that the Navy did not prove that Thomson had threatened the supervisors but found that he had slept on his job. That official therefore reversed the removal and imposed a penalty of five days\u2019 suspension (the maximum sanction for a first offense of sleeping on duty). The petitioner and the agency both sought review by the full Board. In an opinion and order, the MSPB declined any review. Review of the agency\u2019s petition was denied because Navy materials said to show petitioner had lied at the hearing (as to sleeping) were presented much too late and the presiding official\u2019s determinations of credibility (as to the alleged threats against the supervisors) should not be disturbed. Neither party sought review in this court of the Board\u2019s decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">Thomson then applied to the Board for attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(g)(1). The same presiding official held that petitioner was the prevailing party and that the requested attorney fees had been incurred, but denied those fees as not warranted in the interest of justice. The full MSPB declined review in a form order. After Thomson appealed the fee denial to this court, the MSPB moved to have the fee case remanded to it for further consider\u00e1<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Navy intervened and opposed remand; petitioner also opposed. This court\u2019s motions panel summarily denied remand. On the arguments before this merits panel the MSPB, both in brief and oral argument, has again asked for remand and the Navy has opposed (requesting affirmance). Petitioner continues to seek outright reversal and allowance of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">In her fee decision, the presiding official committed two cardinal legal errors in deciding that the interest-of-justiee element of \u00a7 7701(g)(1) did not warrant award of any fees. First, she contented herself with determining, on the basis solely of the evidence before the Navy, that the Navy\u2019s initial action was not clearly without merit or wholly unfounded and that Thomson was not substantially innocent \u2014 even though petitioner also definitely placed his fee request on the assertion that he was substantially innocent of the threatening charges on the basis of the evidence adduced at the MSPB hearing and reflected in that decision. Our subsequent <em>Yorkshire </em>decision (not yet issued at the time of the presiding official\u2019s fee decision) has made it clear that category 2 of the MSPB fee scheme (announced in <em>Allen v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>2 MSPB 582, 2 M.S.P.R. 420 (1980)) \u2014 as distinguished from category 5 \u2014 \u201crefers to the result of the case in the Board, not to the evidence and information available prior to the hearing.\u201d 746 F.2d at 1457. The factors bearing on the reasonableness of the agency\u2019s action at the agency stage are \u201cirrelevant under the category 2 standard of substantial innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen dealing with the \u2018substantially innocent\u2019 standard for award of attorney\u2019s fees, the question of the agency\u2019s original fault [or lack of fault] need never arise.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>For that reason, the presiding official in the current case erred in resting her determination of substantial innocence (of the charge of threatening supervisors) wholly on the evidence before the agency and its action in considering removal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">Second, the presiding official was wrong in laying down the <em>per se </em>rules \u201cthat cases decided primarily on the basis of credibility do not warrant fee awards,\u201d \u201cand that the interests of justice are not served by a fee award in factually close cases.\u201d There is no warrant in the Civil Service Reform Act or its legislative history or this court\u2019s decisions for such dogmatic <em>per se </em>pronouncements. <em>Yorkshire </em>itself concerned judgments of credibility made by the presiding official who had heard the testimony. 746 F.2d 1459. There is simply no general rule against fee awards where the case turns on credibility. As for \u201cfactually close\u201d cases, we do not say that the closeness of the evidence cannot ever be considered, as one factor, in determining whether the employee was <em>substantially </em>innocent of the charges. We hold, however, that all \u201cfactually close\u201d cases do not automatically fall into the class in which fees are not available in the interest of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-13\">Because of the presiding official\u2019s legal errors \u2014 each of which was significant in the determination of substantial innocence \u2014 we cannot merely affirm the Board\u2019s refusal to award fees. <em>Keely v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>760 F.2d 246, 248 (Fed.Cir.1985). It is indisputable that the presiding official did not at all base her fee-rejection on the prior upholding of the minor charge of sleeping on duty \u2014 and the record does not require, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>permit, us to uphold the fee-denial at this time on that subordinate part of the ease (though that part may well be considered, along with the other facts and circumstances, on the remand we order).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Nor can we simply reverse and order the allowance of fees. As we have held, Congress left great discretion in the award of fees to the MSPB. <em>Sterner v. Department of the Army, </em>711 F.2d 1563, 1568-69 (Fed.Cir.1983). On the present record this is certainly not a case in which we can say that the Board was necessarily <em>compelled </em>to grant fees for the whole case while the case was in the MSPB. Petitioner urges bad faith on the part of the Navy, but there is as yet no such finding and, in view of the nature and content of the presiding official\u2019s findings in her original decision, we cannot ourselves say that bad faith must have existed (on the agency\u2019s part) or that this case is necessarily within category 5. Moreover, it may be \u2014 we do not hold or suggest, one way or the other \u2014 that in its discretion the Board could award fees only for the agency\u2019s petition for review by the full MSPB. <em>See Keely v. Merit Systems Protection Board, supra, </em>760 F.2d at 249. There also are other factors and nuances which remain to be assessed and weighed. The short of it is that the Board should have the opportunity initially to determine whether full fees, no fees, or partial fees should be allowed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">To that end, we vacate the Board\u2019s denial of fees and remand the case to the MSPB for its further evaluation, consistent with this opinion. The earlier denial by the motions panel of the MSPB\u2019s prior motion to remand does not bar us from taking this course. That order was the decision of a single judge, and did not at all explain the reasons for the denial. It may well be that the whole issue of remand was left to the full merits panel which would consider the case as a whole, after briefs (which had not all been filed at the time of the order) and oral argument.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because (1) the prior denial of the remand motion was the order of a single judge, (2) that order gave no reason for its denial of the remand motion, and (3) the Board has continued to press the issue before us, we hold that that order is not binding on us as law of the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b968-11\">. The MSPB docket number of the fee decision is PH07528110588ADD.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b969-6\">. That motion followed this court\u2019s decision in <em>Yorkshire v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>746 F.2d 1454 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b969-7\">. <em>Yorkshire </em>also expressly pointed out that, in that case, the presiding official who passed on the fee question erred because he \"considered evidence accumulated prior to the [MSPB] hearing as support for his conclusion that petitioner [Yorkshire] was not substantially innocent.\u201d 746 F.2d at 1458.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b969-15\">. The Board\u2019s memorandum submitted to this panel expressly concedes that the presiding official\u2019s analysis of the \u201cthreatening\u201d charges was contrary to <em>Yorkshire.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b970-6\">. Fed.R.App.P. 27(c) states that a single judge \"may not dismiss or otherwise determine an appeal or other proceeding.\u201d Rule 27(c) also provides that \"the action of a single judge may be reviewed by the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b970-18\">. We note, too, that the <em>Keely </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>was promulgated (April 30, 1985) after the denial of remand in this case on March 5, 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
