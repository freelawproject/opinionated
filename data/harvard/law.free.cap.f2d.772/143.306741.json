Appellants, black residents of the Parish, alleged that the plan violated their rights under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and did not meet the standards required by the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973, as amended in 1982. The district court determined that it had not been shown that the School Board\u2019s plan violated appellants\u2019 rights under the Constitution, or failed to meet Voting Rights Act standards, and that accordingly the decision of the School Board, as the proper legislative body to promulgate the reapportionment plan, was entitled to deference and should be sustained. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"AC\">Vernon Parish (the \u201cParish\u201d) is a rural parish in western Louisiana, with a total population of 38,897, excluding Fort Polk military personnel. The population is 85 percent white, 12.4 percent black, and 2.6 percent other races. The majority of the black population is concentrated in a relatively small geographic region in and around the town of Leesville near the center of the Parish. Prior to the bringing of this suit, no black had been elected to the School Board under the existing twelve-member scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">Each Louisiana parish school board is authorized by state law to reapportion itself, as long as each board member as nearly as possible represents the same number of persons. La.-R.S. WUl.l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In so doing, the board \u201cmay create such special school board election districts as it deems desirable\u201d and these districts \u201cneed not be coterminous with the wards that may be created by any governing authority....\u201d La.-R.S. 17:71.3 (1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The districts may be single-member or multi-mem-ber. <em>Id. </em>Reapportionment may occur every decennial year. La.-R.S. 17:71.5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">Pursuant to this authority, the Vernon Parish School Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>March 1982 determined to reapportion itself.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board hired Tri-S Associates, Inc., of Ruston, Louisiana (\u201cTri-S\u201d), to act as consultants and to draw the proposed Board plan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following preliminary work by Tri-S and discussions of the prospective reapportionment at several open meetings of the Board, which were attended by at least some of the appellants, on April 12, 1984, the Board adopted a plan calling for thirteen members from seven electoral districts. Four districts were single member; the remaining three were multi-member districts. One single-member district in the northwest Leesville area, denominated district 1-D, had a 90 percent black population. This plan replaced the existing twelve-member \u201cmixed\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>some single-member and some multi-member districts) plan. The new plan was forwarded to the Justice Department for preclearance as required by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c. On October 5, 1982, the Justice Department informed the Board by letter that it would not object to the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Elections for Board members under the new plan were set for March 26, 1983 (primary election) and April 30, 1983 (general election). The candidate qualifying period was set for January 24-28, 1983. Shortly before the qualifying period was to begin, appellants, all black residents of Vernon Parish, at least some of whom are members of the local Political Action League (\u201cPAL\u201d), brought suit seeking an injunction to prohibit the qualifying of candidates and the holding of an election, alleging that their rights under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution had been violated by the adopted plan. Appellants also alleged that the plan failed to meet the standards set out in the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973 <em>et seq., </em>as amended in 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">On January 13, 1983, the district court entered a <em>rule nisi </em>enjoining the. Board from holding the elections as scheduled, and ordering appellees to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue. On January 19, 1983, by consent of the parties, the court held a hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Kenneth Selle, president of Tri-S, who worked on the plan for the Board, testified as an expert at the hearing. Selle testified that he received somewhat cursory instructions indicating the Board\u2019s concern that reapportionment was necessary because of population shifts within the district. He was instructed to take into account the requirements of the Constitution, the Voting Rights Act, and the Justice Department\u2019s current preclearance screening requirements, and to draw an acceptable plan. In accord with Selle\u2019s experience, he recommended that the new plan should as closely as possible track the basic apportionment geography of the existing scheme,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> while also satisfying current state and federal voting law requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">Using detailed 1980 census data, Selle determined the total population of the Parish to be 38,897, excluding the military personnel stationed at Fort Polk. For a thirteen-member Board, and in consideration of the one-man-one-vote requirement of <em>Reynolds v. Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964), Selle determined the normative per-member population to be 2,997. He determined that draw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ing a legally acceptable plan would require, if possible, the creation of a black seat on the Board. With these criteria in mind, Selle carved out a substantially black district (1-D) in the northwestern portion of Leesville, having a total population of 3,132, which was 90 percent black (2,823). The evidence does not reflect in meaningful detail how the black population was spread over district 1-D, although it does indicate some concentration of blacks and whites in the south-central portion of the district. Surrounding this \u201csafe\u201d black district was a predominantly white four-member district (districts 1-A, -B, -C, &amp; -E; hereinafter \u201cdistrict 1\u201d), encompassing the remainder of Leesville and a substantial rural area surrounding the town.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This four-member district had a total population of 12,226, of whom 1,067 were black, the 1067 being relatively evenly dispersed throughout that district.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The other districts in the new plan were geographically similar to the existing, districts in the prior twelve-member plan, with moderate relocations of some district boundaries to compensate for the ten-year population shifts and to include the necessary normative population within each district. The final result was a plan consisting of four single-member districts (including 1-D, the \u201csafe\u201d black district), one four-member district, one three-member district, and on\u00e9 two-member district, for a total of thirteen Board members.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">Selle admitted on cross-examination that a twelve single-member district plan was possible, as was also evidenced by the existing Parish Police Jury plan. He added that it was impossible, however, to carve out either a second \u201csafe\u201d black district or a second district in which blacks would have a sizable, if nonmajority, proportion of the vote. According to Selle, this result obtained because, notwithstanding the concentration of black population in the Lees-ville district 1-D area, the remainder of the black population within the parish was geographically scattered.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The presence of this \u201csafe\u201d black district ensured that a black member would be elected to the School Board for the first time.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">Shortly thereafter, on February 2, 1983, the district court enjoined the scheduled elections until further orders, pending its decision on the merits. On October 13, 1983, while the district court still had the suit under advisement, registered voters in (old) ward 1 of the Parish (covering an area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>similar to new districts 1 and 1-D) sought to intervene. This motion was denied the same day, but the court allowed the petition of intervention and its attachments, including an alternative plan of reapportionment drawn by the Vernon Parish Police Jury (the \u201cPolice Jury plan\u201d), to be filed by these individuals as an <em>amicus </em>brief.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The Police Jury plan consisted of twelve single-member districts. It, too, provided for one single-member district in substantially black northwest Leesville, including some rural portions of the old ward 1 area surrounding that Leesville district, an arrangement which would also virtually guarantee that a black be elected to the Board. The district court found the Police Jury plan superior in several respects to the Board\u2019s plan. In particular, the court expressly determined that: (1) the Police Jury plan was superior with respect to the <em>Reynolds v. Sims </em>one-man-one-vote requirement; (2) it was superior also because it did not increase the Board size from twelve to thirteen members, thereby diluting numerically the voting power of the potential black Board member; and (3) it was superior because it consisted entirely of single-member districts. The Police Jury plan had a maximum deviation factor from the normative per-member population of only 6.3 percent, where the Board\u2019s plan showed a maximum deviation of 8.94 percent (district 1-D versus district 2).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The district court found as a matter of fact that, given the present geographical distribution of the minority populations within the Parish, no additional majority black district was possible. It determined that, although the proposed thirteen-member Board plan would numerically dilute the voting strength of individual members of the Board, including that of the prospective black member from the \u201csafe\u201d black district created by the plan, such dilution was not unconstitutional or otherwise illegal. It found that, because of population shifts, the then current plan (that replaced by the \u201cnew\u201d plan here at issue) was unconstitutional, and that the evidence established that the new plan, specifically its thirteen-member feature (as contrasted to the twelve members of the former plan and of the Police Jury plan), \u201cwas prompted by motives other than racial motives.\u201d It noted also that there was no evidence that the right of any individual minority voter in the Parish was \u201cimpeded, threatened or denied,\u201d and concluded that the evidence, taken as a whole, established that the Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>plan as adopted was neither unconstitutional nor a violation of Voting Rights Act standards. The court recognized that, absent a showing of illegality or unconstitutionality, it owed the Board plan deference as an exercise of legislative policy choice, and that, consequently, it was not free to substitute its own preferences, or plans that might be otherwise \u201cbetter\u201d than the Board\u2019s plan. Thus, although the court had determined the Police Jury plan to be objectively \u201csuperior\u201d in several aspects, it declined to order the substitution of the Police Jury plan in favor of the properly enacted School Board plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Accordingly, the district court approved the adoption of the Board plan, and set elections for April 7, 1984 (primaries) and May 5,1984 (general election), with a three-day qualification period for candidates commencing March 8, 1984. Appellants then brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The record indicates that appellants\u2019 primary concern in the district court was twofold: First, the increase in Board size from twelve to thirteen members allegedly constituted an impermissible dilution of minority voting power by reducing the voting power of the potential black Board member from one-twelfth to one-thirteenth of the total Board votes. Second, appellants alleged that an only 65 percent black voting majority within district 1-D was sufficient to ensure its \u201csafety\u201d as a black seat on the Board<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>; the \u201cexcess\u201d 25 percent of the black population within that district could thus have been put into a second, albeit not \u201csafe,\u201d district, giving the black voters of the Parish more leverage in School Board elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The issues of law raised in this appeal are controlled by the recent decision in <em>Jones v. City of Lubbock, </em>727 F.2d 364, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>730 F.2d 233 (5th Cir.1984). In <em>Jones, </em>this Court summarized the history of voting rights cases and voting rights law before <em>City of Mobile v. Bolden, </em>446 U.S. 55, 100 S.Ct. 1490, 64 L.Ed.2d 47 (1980), through <em>Rogers v. Lodge, </em>458 U.S. 613, 102 S.Ct. 3272, 73 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1982), and through congressional action amending the Voting Rights Act in such a way that <em>pre-Bolden </em>law was largely codified. 727 F.2d at 376-80. Under the 1982 amendment to section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973 <em>et seq., </em>and under this Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Jones, </em>the appropriate standard to employ in determining whether a legislative plan violates the Voting Rights Act is to require that there have been a showing sufficient to justify the conclusion that the proposed scheme results in a <em>discriminatory </em>dilution of minority voting power, whether or not the implementing or maintaining governmental body actually intends a discriminatory result.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">In <em>Jones v. City of Lubbock, </em>this Court listed those factors specifically enumerated in the legislative history of the 1982 amendment to section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as \u201ctypically\u201d relevant in determining whether a given reapportionment plan or an existing scheme is illegal under that Act. Those factors include: (1) the extent of any history of official discrimination affecting the right of minority group members to register, vote or otherwise participate in the democratic process; (2) the extent to which voting has been racially polarized; (3) the extent to which the political subdivision has employed unusually large election districts, majority vote requirements, anti-single shot provisions or other voting practices that enhanced the opportunity for discrimination; (4) if candidate slating processes were used, whether the members of a minority group have been denied access to that process; (5) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>extent to which minority citizens bear the effects of discrimination in diverse areas such as education, employment, and health that hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process; (6) whether past political campaigns have been characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals; and (7) the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the past. 727 F.2d at 379. Additional factors \u201cthat might have limited relevance\u201d are (a) whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness to minority needs by local officials, and (b) whether the policy underlying the political subdivisions\u2019 use of voting qualification prerequisites is tenuously based. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Considering the relevant factors, a determination is to be made on the basis of the totality of the circumstances. <em>McCarty v. Henson, </em>749 F.2d 1134, 1137 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">By contrast, to establish the <em>unconstitutionality </em>of a voting scheme, a complainant must show by direct or indirect evidence that there exists a purposeful intent to discriminate on the part of the enacting legislative body. <em>Bolden, </em>446 U.S. at 62, 66, 100 S.Ct. at 1497, 1499; <em>Whitcomb v. Chavis, </em>403 U.S. 124, 149, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 1872, 29 L.Ed.2d 363 (1971); <em>McCarty v. Henson, </em>749 F.2d at 1136; <em>Jones, </em>727 F.2d at 377-78. That intent may take the form of the introduction of an intentionally discriminatory practice, or the mere adherence to existing practices with the intent to maintain a discriminatory system. <em>Bolden, </em>446 U.S. at 62, 100 S.Ct. at 1497; <em>Lodge v. Buxton, </em>639 F.2d 1358, 1363 (5th Cir.1981). A direct showing of subjective intent is not necessary; objective indicia may be used to show the existence of a discriminatory purpose. <em>Rogers v. Lodge, </em>458 U.S. 613, 622-27, 102 S.Ct. 3272, 3278-81, 73 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1982); <em>McCarty v. Henson, </em>749 F.2d at 1136; <em>Jones, </em>727 F.2d at 376-378.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">At-large plans are not <em>per se </em>illegal. <em>Bolden, </em>446 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 1499; <em>White v. Regester, </em>412 U.S. 755, 765, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 2339, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973); <em>Whitcomb v. Chavis, </em>403 U.S. at 156-60, 91 S.Ct. at 1875-78; <em>McCarty v. Henson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">We note also that, in legislative apportionment plans, maximum district population deviations from normative values that are less than ten percent generally qualify a plan as <em>prima facie </em>constitutional, a rule of thumb of which the district court was aware. <em>See, e.g., Connor v. Finch, </em>431 U.S. 407, 417-18, 97 S.Ct. 1828, 1835-36, 52 L.Ed.2d 465 (1977) (variations of 16.5 percent and 19.3 percent violate equal protection; under ten percent variation establishes <em>prima facie </em>constitutional validity \u201conly in the context of legislatively enacted apportionments\u201d); <em>Gaffney v. Cummings, </em>412 U.S. 735, 739-41, 93 S.Ct. 2321, 2324-25, 37 L.Ed.2d 298 (1973) (7.83 percent in legislative plan); <em>White v. Regester, </em>412 U.S. at 764, 93 S.Ct. at 2338 (9.9 percent in legislative plan); <em>cf. Wyche v. Madison Parish Police Jury, </em>635 F.2d 1151, 1156, 1159 (5th Cir.1981) (4.11 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>deviation in court-ordered plan sufficiently <em>de minimus).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">JUDICIAL DEFERENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">It is the legislature\u2019s function to make decisions of basic political policy. Thus, even where a legislative choice of policy is perceived to have been unwise, or simply not the optimum choice, absent a choice that is either unconstitutional or otherwise illegal under federal law, federal courts must defer to that legislative judgment. <em>Upham v. Seamon, </em>456 U.S. 37, 40, 102 S.Ct. 1518, 1520, 71 L.Ed.2d 725 (1982); <em>Jones, </em>727 F.2d at 374; <em>see also McCulloch v. Maryland, </em>17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 341, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819); <em>McDaniel v. Sanchez, </em>452 U.S. 130, 139-40, 101 S.Ct. 2224, 2230-31, 68 L.Ed.2d 724 (1981); <em>Wise v. Lipscomb, </em>437 U.S. 535, 98 S.Ct. 2493, 57 L.Ed.2d 411 (1978), <em>Burns v. Richardson, </em>384 U.S. 73, 85, 86 S.Ct. 1286, 1293, 16 L.Ed.2d 376 (1966); <em>Reynolds v. Sims, </em>377 U.S. at 586, 84 S.Ct. at 1394. In <em>Upham, </em>the Supreme Court again reiterated this standard of judicial deference to constitutionally permissible determinations of policy and reapportionment by the states. The Court stated expressly that \u201cin the absence of any finding of a constitutional or statutory violation ... a court must defer to the legislative judgment the plan[ ] reflects],\u201d and that, where the Justice Department has offered no objections following a preclearance submission under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a federal court is not free to substitute its reapportionment preferences for those of the state. <em>Id., </em>456 U.S. at 40-41, 102 S.Ct. at 1520-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">This is not a case involving a court-ordered plan, where equitable considerations demand a close scrutiny and mandate the fashioning of a near-optimal apportionment plan. <em>See, e.g., Bolden, </em>446 U.S. at 66 n. 12, 100 S.Ct. at 1499 n. 12; <em>Connor v. Finch, </em>431 U.S. at 415, 97 S.Ct. at 1834; <em>Chapman v. Meier, </em>420 U.S. 1, 26-27, 95 S.Ct. 751, 765-66, 42 L.Ed.2d 766 (1975). Instead, the district court was asked to find unconstitutional or otherwise illegal a plan drawn by the body duly authorized by state law to effect a reapportionment. Under the <em>Wise v. Lipscomb </em>standard, the federal district court is precluded from substituting even what it considers to be an objectively superior plan for an otherwise constitutionally and legally valid plan that has been proposed and enacted by the appropriate state governmental unit. \u201cThe only limits on judicial deference to state apportionment policy ... [are] the substantive constitutional and statutory standards to which such state plans are subject.\u201d <em>Upham, </em>456 U.S. at 42, 102 S.Ct. at 1521 (citing <em>White v. Wiser, </em>412 U.S. 783, 794-95, 93 S.Ct. 2348, 2354-55, 37 L.Ed.2d 335 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">NO SECOND \u201cSAFE\u201d OR MORE BLACK-ORIENTED DISTRICT</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Rogers v. Lodge, </em>458 U.S. at 622-23, 102 S.Ct. at 3278-79; <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982); <em>Jones v. City of Lubbock, </em>727 F.2d at 371; Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). In particular, we conclude that the district court\u2019s findings that the School Board was not actuated by a racially discriminatory motive and that no plan could be drawn that would include more than one \u201csafe\u201d majority black district are amply supported by evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">Selle\u2019s testimony was to the effect that it would be impossible to draw district boundary lines in such a way that either a second \u201csafe\u201d black district) or a second district with a significant black population, could be created. He was questioned at length concerning both the method of his determination of the plan boundaries ultimately proposed to the Board, and of the constraints and imperatives under which he felt he was operating. His testimony reflected a thorough knowledge of local demographics and of the legal constraints applicable to the task. He was questioned extensively concerning possible alternatives that might enhance black voting power in the Parish, beyond those inherent in the plan as proposed. His unshakable opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>ion was that significant enhancement was impossible, given the rather homogeneous distribution of the remainder of the Parish black population outside the \u201csafe\u201d district included in the Board\u2019s plan. He did indicate that it might have been possible to draw the boundaries in such a way as to produce two adjacent districts with substantial but <em>nonmajority </em>black populations, a result that would have sacrificed a certain black position on the Board for an uncertain black influence in two members\u2019 election. Selle felt that a \u201csafe\u201d black district was preferable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We see no occasion to disagree, particularly as appellants do not contend that a plan without any \u201csafe\u201d black district, but having two (or more) districts with substantial black minorities, is preferable to the plan approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Appellants\u2019 cross-examination of Selle provided no basis for doubting his referenced conclusions. He indicated that, in discussions with the Board, \u201cthey preferred to maintain pretty much, as much as possible, the [geographical] format they had.\u201d He indicated that his preliminary research had revealed that no black had been elected to the Board at least since the 1920\u2019s. Aware of the need, therefore, to include a black member on the Board,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and, given the constraints of a thirteen-member composition preferred by the incumbent Board, he drew the plan at issue as the best representation of the results desired with the constraints imposed. Selle did admit that he essentially carved out the safe district as a new (thirteenth) Board member\u2019s place, and readjusted other existing boundary lines so as to make up the required normative district populations around that safe district. There was no evidence that any other approach could have produced a thirteen-member plan more favorable to black voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Appellants offered no testimony of their own, by expert or lay witnesses, to discredit or cast doubt on Selle\u2019s account or opinions. They offered no evidence indicating that a second \u201csafe\u201d or even \u201cinfluential\u201d black district could be drawn.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> To be sure, appellants did offer into evidence a plan of their own; but it was, as we have already indicated, wholly inadequate because of the lack of racial and other detailed demographic data with which the court might assess its viability and/or superiority as compared to the Board\u2019s plan. The record affords no basis for concluding that appellants\u2019 plan would likely provide either two \u201csafe\u201d black districts or one \u201csafe\u201d black district, plus other districts where blacks, though in a minority position, would on the whole be more influential than in the white majority districts of the Board\u2019s plan. And, as we have also noted, the appellants\u2019 plan showed an unacceptably large percentile departure from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the per-member normative population required for each district. In sum, there simply was nothing in the record, either introduced as documentary evidence, established by testimony at the hearing by appellants, ,or elicited during the extensive cross-examination of Selle, that would form even a remote objective basis to conclude other than that what Selle represented to be true was in fact true. The district court\u2019s conclusion that no second \u201csafe\u201d black district could be drawn was, therefore, not clearly erroneous, and must stand. Further, there is no sufficient evidence to support the claim that more of the white majority districts might reasonably be drawn to have more influential black minorities than under the Board\u2019s plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">THE SCHOOL BOARD REAPPORTIONMENT PLAN</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Appellants also complain that the Board\u2019s decision to add a thirteenth member to the then existing twelve-member Board diluted the power of any potential minority member on the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">A. A \u201cBetter\u201d Plan?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The district court found that, notwithstanding its perception of the superiority on general grounds of the alternative plan adopted by the Police Jury, the Board\u2019s plan was \u201cnot impermissible and not unconstitutional.\u201d Nor was it the product of any racially discriminatory motive. Consequently, the district court approved the Board\u2019s plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">The language of the Voting Rights Act itself provides expressly that, although the Act is intended to discourage discrimination against minority groups with respect to their opportunity for <em>participation </em>in the electoral process, it does not purport to guarantee or to compel minority representation in publicly elected bodies that is proportional to the racial makeup of the political unit: \u201cNothing in this section establishes a right to have the members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973(b) (West Supp.1982). Nor has any equal protection analysis ever imposed such a guarantee of electoral success.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">Appellants\u2019 conclusory assertions that a better plan might have been drawn do not meet the burden of proof of illegality outlined by Congress and applied by this Court in <em>Jones. </em>Selle\u2019s testimony, amply supported by objective statistical data, established, first, that a second \u201csafe\u201d black district was impossible because of the widespread and homogeneous geographical distribution of the remaining black population in the Parish; and, second, that it was impossible to compose a second district having a substantial black influence, even by utilizing some of district 1-D\u2019s \u201cexcess\u201d black population. These points were unrebutted by any testimony or documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">Testimony by appellant Seastrunk did indicate that a few of the <em>Zimmer </em>Voting Rights Act factors were present: That the Parish had a history of overt discrimination could be inferred from the historical absence of any black Board member; in fact, no black had ever held office of any sort in the Parish. The existence of a primary system may have worked to the detriment of blacks achieving success in being elected to public office. But there was no evidence to indicate the presence of any other of the relevant factors. In particular, there was no evidence that any black had recently been prevented from voting or otherwise participating in the electoral processes of the Parish. There was no evidence of candidate slating from which blacks were excluded, nor of polarized voting patterns, majority voting requirements, exceptionally large election districts, or any other such contrivances to dilute or degrade the voting power of Parish blacks. There was no indication that recent discrimination was practiced in areas such as education, employment or health, which might have reduced the ability of blacks to participate effectively in the electoral processes of the Parish. Nor were there indications that recent elections had been at all characterized by overt or subtle racial overtones, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>that local officials had been unresponsive to local black needs. There was no evidence that any unusual voting qualification prerequisites were imposed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The district court found expressly that there was no evidence that the voting rights of any black resident of the Parish were in any way \u201cimpeded, threatened or denied\u201d; a result which, on this record and under a totality of the circumstances test, is sound. The record here reveals no impermissible deficiency in the boundaries of the Board plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">B. The Dilution Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Appellant Seastrunk\u2019s testimony establishes that the major, if not sole, ground for appellants\u2019 objections to the Board plan were that an unspecified \u201cbetter\u201d plan could have been drawn and that appellants preferred a plan different than that adopted by the School Board. Though there was no admission directly by the parties, appellants made the strong suggestion, and both parties explored the question, whether the School Board chose to go from a twelve-member to a thirteen-member Board in order to avoid any of the incumbents necessarily having to lose their seat in the upcoming election. While this may not reflect a very laudable or altruistic motive on the part of incumbent Board members, it is not facially or <em>per se </em>a discriminatory one.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Appellants simply have made no sufficient testimonial or documentary showing that would justify an inference that the Board acted with discriminatory intent when it chose to adopt a thirteen-member apportionment plan. The district court properly found there was no such intent. Nor were there any facts in the record to show that the Board plan in any way denied any black member of the Parish voting population <em>access </em>to the political processes of the Parish school government. The district court properly found there was no such denial. Appellants\u2019 unsupported complaint was only that a differently drawn plan <em>might </em>result in the Parish blacks achieving a yet greater success in electing members to the Board than was afforded by the single \u201csafe\u201d black district.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">As we have previously noted, however, neither the Constitution nor the Voting Rights Act purport to guarantee minority <em>success </em>at the polls. The Voting Rights Act requires that \u201cthe political processes leading to nomination or election\u201d be <em>\u201cequally open to participation\u201d </em>by minorities and that minorities not have \u201cless <em>opportunity </em>than other[s] ... to participate in the political processes and to elect representatives of their choice.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973(b) (emphasis added). But it does not grant the right to proportional minority elected representation as such, though the extent of minority electoral success is \u201cone circumstance that may be considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To be sure, an \u201copportunity\u201d may be rendered meaningless except in form, where the voting scheme is effectively arranged in such a way that otherwise normally available possibilities for realistic minority success at the polls are precluded. But we are not here faced with such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Considering the relative proportion of the black population in comparison to the whole, the blacks of the Parish would be entitled to only 12.4 percent of the seats on any Board. For a twelve- or thirteen-member Board, this is only one seat. To be entitled to two seats, the black population would need to be at least 16% percent (twelve-member Board) or 15.4 percent (thirteen-member Board). With the present proportion of black population in the Parish, the Board would need to be at least of sixteen-member size to afford a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>black seat.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The test is not for the superiority of an alternative plan, but whether the legislative choice passes muster. Thus, even the existence of the objectively superi- or Police Jury plan, standing alone, is insufficient as a basis to find that the Board plan was not constitutionally or legally permissible. This is true whether the legislative plan fails to reflect the preferences of the minorities or of the court. The requirement that courts show deference to legislative policy decisions means that a federal court is precluded from substituting a plan that is perceived only to be \u201cbetter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Here, the extent of effective dilution <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> of member voting power relevant to the prospective black seat is sufficiently minimal that, without more, it will not justify \u2014 let alone compel \u2014 a finding that the Board plan violates the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act. Absent a showing that a qualitatively<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> superior choice of districts was practicable \u2014 that is, in this context, that there was any realistic possibility of a second black member\u2019s being elected to the Board or of overall significantly greater black influence in white majority districts under a different choice of district boundaries<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u2014 or that the increase in Board size was effected with the purposeful intent to reduce minority voting strength on the Board, we view this small numerical dilution of Board member voting power as <em>de minimus. </em>Nothing in the evidence or in common experience suggests that a single black representative on a thirteen-person board is <em>any </em>less effective than a single black representative on a twelve-person board. We conclude, therefore, as did the district court, that the Board plan as drawn did not impermissibly dilute the voting power of blacks in the Parish.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">In <em>Cook v. Luckett, </em>735 F.2d 912 (5th Cir.1984), this Court considered the reapportionment scheme proposed by the Madison County, Mississippi county supervisors, which involved district lines that \u201cwere more than just odd\u201d and \u201cresponded] poorly to commonly understood policies that govern apportionment planning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 920. Recognizing that the county plan had a population variance among the districts that was satisfactory to the Constitution, and that the plan had been precleared under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, this Court approved it and noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">\u201c[w]hile the maps depicting its result may seem odd, Madison County\u2019s political process involved just the sort of give- and-take between citizens and their elected officials that federal courts are unable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>to achieve. Unless a showing is made to render that give-and-take somehow suspect, we must acknowledge that process as the proper means toward the essentially political end of reapportionment.\u201d 735 F.2d at 918-19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">We also held that a federal court may reject a properly proposed legislative scheme only to the extent necessary to correct specific deficiencies found to exist, and that questions of policy were reserved for legislative resolution. Certainly the contrived plan proposed by Madison County officials in <em>Cook </em>constitutes an even more extreme example of what might arguably be termed a self-interested legislative reapportionment than does the Vernon Parish School Board\u2019s instant thirteen-member plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Appellants complain that a better reapportionment plan might be available, although they proposed no such plan. They alleged no facts and offered no proof that the School Board plan violates the one-man-one-vote requirement, or that it results in the denial to any black voter of access to School Board political processes or of equal opportunity to elect representatives. The effect of the dilution of Board member voting power by the increase in size of the Board is <em>de minimus </em>and without practical significance. There was no showing that the Board adopted the plan with any intent to discriminate. The bare assertion that a more suitable plan was possible is insufficient to establish such an intent or effect. The evidence in this record is simply insufficient to justify \u2014 much less compel \u2014 a conclusion that the Board\u2019s plan is unconstitutional or that it violates the Voting Rights Act. Absent such facts, federal courts are without authority to overturn a validly drawn legislative apportionment plan, regardless of its general wisdom or desirability. Consequently, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The new plan, with a normative per-member population of 2,997, showed the following ethnic and racial population breakdowns:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">% Norma-Total tive District Population White Black Other 95-White 95-Black 95-Other Deviation</p>\n<p id=\"ASg\">1 (4)<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> 12226 (3056.5) <footnotemark>b</footnotemark> 10426 1067 733 85 9 6 1.99</p>\n<p id=\"AOZ\">1-D 3132 309 2823 0 10 90 0 4.50</p>\n<p id=\"AU0\">2 (2)<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> 5728 (2864) <footnotemark>b</footnotemark> 5538 120 70 97 2 1 (4.44)</p>\n<p id=\"ayu-dedup-0\">3 3010 2888 103 19 96 3 1 0.43</p>\n<p id=\"AQU\">4 3082 2307 579 196 75 19 6 2.84</p>\n<p id=\"ANq\">5,6,8 <footnotemark>c</footnotemark> (3)<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> 8599 (2866.3) b 8506 65 28 99 1 0 (4.36)</p>\n<p id=\"ATI\">7 3120 3006 48 66 96 1.5 2.5 4.10</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-6\">.

The reapportionment was necessitated, as the district court found, by substantial shifts in the population distribution in the Parish.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\">. Tri-S had extensive reapportionment experience, having worked with over 120 governmental units since about 1968. This included the drawing of reapportionment plans for other parish school boards, various cities and parishes, the taking of special census data, functioning as an expert witness, and work as a court-appointed special master in federal reapportionment cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b234-12\">. It had been Selle\u2019s experience, which he communicated to the Board in initial consultations, that less confusion and voter apathy would result if the new plan recapitulated as nearly as possible the geographical pattern and confines of the existing plan. He asserted that drastic changes from an established format often resulted in substantially reduced voter registration figures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b235-5\">. In the prior existing plan, this ward 1 area had formed one four-member district. It includes Leesville, and a far larger, rural area surrounding that city.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\">. Of these 1,067 blacks, about 325 lived in Lees-ville (some 192 in an area of town southeast of, but not adjoining, district 1-D, this area being of about the same size as 1-D and also having 910 whites); some 328 were in the \"Newllano\u201d area southeast of Leesville; approximately 199 were in \"ED 568D\u201d southwest of Leesville; some 113 were apparently in the part of \"ED 562\u201d outside and south of Leesville; and some 100 were in \"ED 568T\u201d (the location of which is not clear from the record).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\">. The racial and ethnic breakdown of the School Board plan is specified in Appendix A. These are all total population, rather than voting age or registered voter, figures. The record does not reflect voting age or registered voter figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">There is no evidence of the socio-economic or political characteristics of the \"other\u201d (nonwhite, nonblack) group. Census figures (which apparently include military personnel stationed at Fort Polk) seem to indicate that this group\u2019s distribution is in general very roughly similar to that of blacks. The \u201cother\u201d group includes Spanish origin (47 percent), \"other\u201d (30 percent), Asian (18 percent), American Indian (5 percent) (percentages are based on totals including military personnel). No point was made below, nor has any been made on this appeal, as to the actual or potential effect of the \"other\u201d group in any respect; nor is there sufficient evidence of record to meaningfully assess such effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b235-14\">. Only 1,982 blacks (3,094 minority of all races) populate the Parish districts other than district 1-D. Of these 1,982, by far the largest portion (1,067) is generally distributed over district 1 (see note 8, supra); the only other relatively sizable \"concentration\u201d of blacks is in district 4, a largely rural district south of district 1 (and Leesville), which has only 579 blacks, apparently relatively evenly distributed within that district.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b235-15\">. One of the appellants, Regionald Seastrunk, was in fact subsequently elected to a position on the Vernon Parish School Board from this district.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b236-5\">. The PAL plaintiffs offered into evidence an alternative twelve-member \"mixed\u201d plan (this had a five-member district, including Leesville and surrounding areas and appearing in most respects to be generally similar to old ward 1, a two-member district, and five single-member districts). Evidence describing it consisted only of a copy of the Board\u2019s plan, with superimposed (and slightly differing) district lines drawn in red ink, but without any labeling sufficient to resolve ambiguities in line location; a copy of pertinent census demographic data sheets, but without any further analysis or explanation (the census lines not matching the proposed district lines); and a single typewritten sheet listing the proposed alternative districts and their <em>total </em>populations, but without any racial or ethnic breakdowns within district or subdistrict geographical areas (nor were such breakdowns ascertainable from other information on the plan or otherwise in evidence). There was, therefore, insufficient demographic data or analysis submitted to allow the district court to ascertain the merits of this plan, or to assess its viability or possible superiority to the Board's plan. No testimony was offered in support or explanation of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">We note also that this plan reflected a maximum per-member deviation from the normative value for a twelve-member Board by some 28.9 percent (the PAL \"ward 5\" had a total population of only 2,308), and on this basis alone, was less desirable in terms of the <em>Reynolds v. Sims </em>one-man-one-vote requirement than either the Board or Police Jury plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">There are no indications in the record that the appellants advocated adoption of the Police Jury plan in lieu of the Board plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b236-11\">. The district court found this maximum deviation to be only 8.4 percent; we cannot ascertain the derivation of this particular value. In this context, we note an arithmetic error in the per-member population of district 2 (2,964 instead of 2,864) in the appropriate document in the record. But this error cannot be the source of the discrepancy: with this \"favorable\u201d error, the proper comparison would then have been between district 1-D and \"district 5-6-8,\u201d yielding an 8.86 percent maximum deviation for the plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b237-11\">. The evidence indicated that 65 percent black was the approximate minimum black population percentage which the Justice Department would accept as providing a black district for Voting Rights Act clearance purposes. This was thought to normally produce a \"Fifty-Fifty voter registration\u201d figure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b237-12\">. Of course, a showing of intent is relevant to establish discriminatory effect. <em>See McMillan v. Escambia County, Florida, </em>748 F.2d 1037, 1046-47 (5th Cir.1984). Likewise, discriminatory intent of itself will normally render a plan illegal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b238-5\">.

Our discussion of the contentions respecting maximizing black concentration in one or more white majority districts is not intended to imply a right on the part of black voters to have districts \"gerrymandered\u201d in such a fashion as to enhance black political strength <em>beyond </em>the level required by the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act. That black political power under one set of political arrangements is less than it might be under another does not, of itself, necessarily establish that the former arrangements violate the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act. We doubt, for example, that where blacks are forty percent of the relevant population, they would necessarily be entitled to a configuration of districts that would likely give them sixty percent of the elected representatives, even if this were feasible by careful gerrymandering.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"a\">\n<p id=\"b245-10\"> Number of Board members representing multi-member district.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"b\">\n<p id=\"A5U\"> Average per-member population.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"c\">\n<p id=\"b245-11\"> Large rural district covering eastern half of Parish and including Fort Polk military reservation lands, with Board Member residence requirement: one Board member from each of districts 5, 6, and 8, each elected by vote of all districts 5, 6, and 8 voters.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
