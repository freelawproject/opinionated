The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania found that Sun had grounds to refuse to renew the franchise relationship, but nevertheless allowed Rodgers to submit a proposed franchise agreement, which Sun refused to consider. Characterizing Sun\u2019s refusal to consider Rodger\u2019s proposal \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cthe very type of circumstance that the [PMPA] is intended to protect a franchisee against,\u201d the district court extended the term of the original franchise agreement for an additional three years. Because the district court misconstrued the PMPA, we will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-14\">Since 1970, Rodgers and a partner operated a service station in Malvern, Pennsylvania, as Sun franchisees. In September 1981, the partnership dissolved, and Rodgers and Sun negotiated a franchise agreement for the same station. Before entering into the present franchise agreement, however, Sun contacted Rodgers regarding fuel outages<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that occurred during the pri- or franchise agreement. Approximately two months before Rodgers took over the station from his partner, Sun wrote Rodgers, warning him to \u201csee to it that you do not run out of gasoline for sale to the public or else we will have to pursue courses of action afforded to us by applicable law.\u201d On November 10, 1981, Rodgers and Sun entered into a three-year franchise agreement under which the parties agreed that the leased premises were to be used as a \u201cretail gasoline service station\u201d and that the resale of Sun\u2019s branded motor fuels was the essence of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-15\">Between November 17, 1981 and January 10, 1984, Rodgers\u2019s cash flow problems caused him to run out of one or more gasoline products at least twenty times.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a letter dated May 10, 1983, Sun offered to assist Rodgers in improving his cash flow by: releasing $10,000 from his \u201ccollateral deposit account\u201d (a security account held by Sun); permitting Rodgers to deduct from the price of a load of gasoline an amount equal to the value of gasoline purchased by credit card customers whose re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>ceipts had not yet been validated;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and reducing the surcharge deposited into the collateral deposit account from one cent to one-half cent per gallon of gasoline purchased. In the same letter, Sun warned Rodgers that two additional fuel outages in any ninety day period would be deemed to exceed the minimum standard of fuel availability \u201cat the heart\u201d of the franchise relationship.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Rodgers ran out of the super, plus, and regular grades of unleaded gasoline on January 5 and 10, 1984, and continued to experience fuel outages until the commencement of trial on November 2, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">On March 1, 1984, Sun advised Rodgers that the franchise would be terminated June 4, 1984. Rodgers filed a complaint and motion for a preliminary injunction on May 18, 1984, alleging that Sun\u2019s termination of the franchise violated the PMPA. By stipulation approved by the court and entered on May 31,1984, the parties agreed to consolidate the preliminary injunction hearing with the trial on the merits, and to maintain the status quo with respect to the franchise agreement pending a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">On November 14, 1984, the district court delivered its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court characterized the dispute as a failure to renew the franchise relationship and determined that the evidence supported Sun\u2019s refusal to renew. Despite this finding, the district court allowed Rodgers two weeks to offer Sun a proposal concerning the continuation of the franchise relationship. The district court\u2019s order dated November 19, 1984, denying injunctive relief, stated that the franchise agreement had expired on November 9, 1984, thereby making the issue of Sun\u2019s attempted termination moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-12\">Although Rodgers submitted a proposed franchise agreement in time, Sun refused to consider or comment upon the proposal. On December 12, 1984, Rodgers amended his complaint to add a count seeking an injunction against Sun\u2019s \u201cunreasonable non-renewal of his franchise.\u201d In its memorandum and final order dated January 23, 1985, 603 P.Supp. 140, the court found that Sun failed to meet its burden under the PMPA of going forward with evidence indicating that Rodgers would fail to comply with the proposed agreement. Consequently, the court enjoined Sun from disturbing the franchise relationship in any way for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-15\">Sun raises four issues on appeal. First, Sun alleges that after the court found that the outages were Rodger\u2019s fault, were events relevant to the franchise agreement, and reasonable grounds for Sun to terminate or refuse renewal, the district court erred in not allowing Sun to terminate under PMPA \u00a7 2802(b)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, Sun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>claims that because the parties extended the franchise agreement until final judgment, the district court erred in holding that the franchise agreement expired and in requiring the parties to treat the case as one of failure to renew rather than termination. Third, Sun believes that the district court abused its discretion in allowing Rodgers an opportunity to submit a proposal concerning the continuation of the franchise relationship after the court found that \u201c[t]he evidence supports ... [Sun\u2019s] refusal to renew the franchise relationship.\u201d Finally, Sun also believes that the court abused its discretion by extending the terms of the original franchise agreement for an additional three years. We will not address each claim, as we find our resolution of the first issue dispositive of the remaining three.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-4\">Sun claims that PMPA \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(A), which permits termination or nonrenewal for failure to comply with a reasonable and material provision of the franchise, allows it to terminate Rodgers\u2019s franchise. Because the franchise agreement states that \u201cthe resale by Dealer of Company\u2019s branded motor fuels is the essence of this Agreement,\u201d Sun maintains that Rodgers\u2019s repeated gasoline outages violated the essence of the franchise agreement. Rodgers responds that \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(A) does not apply because he did not violate any specific provision of the franchise agreement. Indeed, the district court expressed serious doubt as to whether or not Rodgers\u2019s fuel outages could provide the basis for franchise termination \u201cin view of Sun\u2019s knowledge of [Rodgers\u2019s past fuel outages] <em>before </em>entering into the franchise and an election in the face of such knowledge not to include a running out of fuel provision ... [in] the franchise contract.\u201d This finding clearly prohibits Rodgers\u2019s termination under PMPA \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(A) or (B), because both sections require the franchisee to violate some provision of the franchise agreement. We cannot say that this finding is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-9\">Even if this finding is correct, we conclude that Sun is still entitled to terminate under PMPA \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C). This section provides for termination or nonrenewal after the \u201coccurrance of an event ... relevant to the franchise relationship\u201d if, as a result of the event, termination or non-renewal is reasonable. The court found both these elements present when it ruled on November 14th that Rodgers\u2019s inability to maintain adequate fuel supplies an event \u201crelevant to the relationship\u201d and a reasonable ground, on the record, to refuse renewal. Because the district court established that the legal standard for termination or non-renewal under \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C) is satisfied, we conclude that Sun\u2019s termination of Rodgers\u2019s franchise is justified.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">Because we find Sun entitled to terminate Rodgers\u2019s franchise, we need not decide whether the district court abused its discretion in allowing Rodgers to submit a proposed franchise agreement and in extending the original franchise agreement for three years. We take notice, however, that the district court\u2019s power to grant equitable relief pursuant to PMPA \u00a7 2805(b)(1)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> applies only where the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>finds that the franchiser failed to comply with PMPA \u00a7 2802 or \u00a7 2803. When the district court gave appellee two weeks to submit a proposed franchise agreement to Sun, it had not yet found that Sun violated any PMPA requirements. The district court therefore did not have the power to grant any equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">Congress passed the PMPA in 1978 in recognition of \u201cthe disparity of bargaining power which exists between the franchisor and the franchisee\u201d in the gasoline industry. <em>Sun Refining and Marketing Co. v. Rago, </em>741 F.2d 670, 672 (3d Cir.1984). Although the Act\u2019s primary goal is to provide protection to franchisees, it also provides for \u201cthe legitimate needs of a franchisor to be able to terminate a franchise ... based upon certain actions of the franchisee, including certain failures to comply with contractual obligations____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673. Where the district court finds, as it did here, that the franchisor had adequate grounds under the PMPA to terminate or refuse to renew the franchise, it must permit the franchisor to exercise its business judgment. Only in those circumstances prescribed by the Act may the court intervene to restore the equities of the bargaining relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">Accordingly, we will reverse the district court's order and direct the entry of judgment for appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">. All of Sun's service stations offer four types of unleaded gasoline for sale: \"super,\u201d 91.5 octane; \"plus,\" 89 octane; \"regular,\u201d 87 octane; and \"economy,\u201d 86 octane; along with \"regular\u201d leaded gasoline. The super and economy unleaded gases are blended together in the \"custom blending\u201d gasoline pumps at the service stations to make the \"plus\" and \"regular\" unleaded products. Consequently, if there are outages of either super or economy gas, three of the four unleaded products are unavailable for sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1243-16\">. Rodgers\u2019s outages were due to his own financial difficulties. He allowed the remaining fuel levels to drop to extremely low levels because he needed the cash received from the sale of the gasoline to pay for the next shipment. (Sun required that gasoline be purchased in shipments of 8500 gallons only, ordered at least 48 hours in advance.) Consequently, he often ran out of some or all types of fuel before the next shipment arrived, even after repeated warnings from Sun that these outages were unacceptable and would not be tolerated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">. Because Rodgers had used receipts from his own personal credit card to make up the required balance, Sun had placed Rodgers on \"restricted credit card status.\u201d A dealer on restricted credit card status cannot deduct credit card receipts from gas deliveries until Sun validates the receipts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">. Sun\u2019s letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-8\">We are both aware of the severe adverse effects of being out of product. The availability and sale of its Sunoco branded products is at the heart of the Sunoco franchise and franchise relationship with its dealers. For the reasons stated, as well as numerous other reasons, outages of product must be kept to a minimum. In a situation such as yours, where recurring outages have occurred in the recent past, two additional outages in any 90 day period would be considered as to have exceeded this minimum standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">Joint Appendix at 468.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1244-16\">. Section 2802(b)(2) of the PMPA provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-17\">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the following are grounds for termination of a franchise or nonrenewal of a franchise relationship:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-18\">(A) A failure by the franchisee to comply with any provision of the franchise, which provision is both reasonable and of material significance to the franchise relationship____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-20\">(B) A failure by the franchisee to exert good faith efforts to carry out the provisions of the franchise____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-22\">(C) The occurrence of an event which is relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which termination of the franchise or nonrenewal of the franchise relationship is reasonable____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-24\">PMPA \u00a7 2801(13) defines \u201cfailure\u201d to exclude failures \u201cunimportant to the franchise\u201d and failures \"for a cause beyond the reasonable control of the franchisee.\u201d These exclusions are simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>legislated excuses for nonperformance, <em>see Brack v. Amoco Oil Co., </em>677 F.2d 1213, 1224 n. 16 (7th Cir.1982), indicating that nonperformance must be both relevant to the franchise relationship and the result of circumstances within the franchisee\u2019s control. Because the trial court found that the outages caused by Rodgers\u2019s fiscal problems were \"matters within his control,\" and Rodgers does not contest this finding, our discussion assumes fault within the meaning of the PMPA. The relevance of the outages to the franchise is discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1245-6\"><em>. </em>In the stipulation entered May 31, 1984, the parties agreed to maintain the status quo with respect to the franchise agreement pending the district court\u2019s final order. The district court disregarded this agreement when it treated the case as a failure to renew. Although we disagree with the lower court\u2019s finding that the termination issue was mooted, the question of characterization is irrelevant because PMPA \u00a7 2802(b)(2)(C) applies to both nonrenewals and terminations. <em>See id., supra </em>note 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1245-12\">.
