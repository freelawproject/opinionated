EUGENE DAVIS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b191-15\">Treating the suggestions for rehearing en banc as petitions for panel rehearing, it is ordered that the petitions for panel rehearing are DENIED. No member of the panel nor Judge in regular active service of this Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc (Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and Local Rule 35), the suggestions for Rehearing En Banc are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-16\">The panel opinion issued July 1, 1985, is withdrawn and the following opinion is issued in its place.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-17\">Alan Louis Chavis and Lambert Daniel Slisz attack their convictions for mail fraud, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Chavis and Slisz assert numerous grounds of error; finding that such error as may have occurred below was harmless, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-18\">Chavis and Slisz\u2019 legal problems stem from the activities of a number of companies owned by Chavis. Each of these companies conducted its operations in essentially the same fashion, with minor factual variations not relevant to this appeal. Typical of their modus operandi was that of Chavis\u2019 original company, American Association of Home Income Programs (AAHIP). Through classified advertisements and circulars, AAHIP represented that the company sought individuals to perform work in. their homes. For example, the AAHIP materials stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-19\">You would make $58.90 tomorrow and $353.88 next week if you had your AAH-IP membership package in your hands right now. (We also need homeworkers to process envelopes. We pay you $41 per 100 envelopes. Details in box at bottom of page).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-20\">The box at bottom of page read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-21\">AAHIP needs dependable homeworkers to work for us in our circular mailing program immediately. The home office will pay you $41 for every 100 envelopes you mail according to instructions, 41 cents per envelope. We pay for all postage and shipping expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-22\">Individuals desiring to join the \u201chome income program\u201d were required to send a \u201cmembership fee\u201d of $20 (other companies\u2019 fees ranged from $10 to $20), which was represented to be \u201cthe only money that you will ever have to pay to AAHIP.\u201d The company\u2019s materials promised a refund if the homeworker did not earn the promised amounts. On paying the membership fee, the worker received additional materials from the company which informed them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>that their duties would not be processing envelopes, but would instead involve placing at their own expense classified ads like those to which they had responded. The promised \u201csalary\u201d was actually a payment for each response received from these ads and forwarded to the company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Any homeworker requesting a refund was sent a letter admonishing them not to request a refund until they had given the \u201cplan\u201d an \u201chonest try,\u201d as they had \u201cpromised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">All of the companies named in the indictment were owned by Chavis, but several of the companies were in large part operated by Slisz. Slisz received mail, including complaints, performed various banking duties, distributed materials describing the various programs, and performed miscellaneous other functions on behalf of the companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Chavis was originally indicted on twenty counts of mail fraud; Slisz was indicted for seven. After a joint trial, Chavis was convicted on nineteen counts, Slisz on seven. In this appeal, Chavis and Slisz jointly protest the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">(1) The district judge\u2019s failure to recuse himself;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">(2) A number of evidentiary rulings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">(3) The form of various jury instructions and the failure to give various other instructions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">(4) Submission of the text of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 to the jury after the jury had been instructed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">(5) The district judge\u2019s refusal to allow post-verdict polling of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">Slisz individually challenges the following: (1) The joinder of his trial with that of Chavis; (2) failure to sever his trial from that of Chavis;- (3) sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction; (4) sufficiency of the indictment under which he was charged; and (5) the district judge\u2019s failure to compel discovery of an anonymous informant\u2019s call to a postal inspector. Finally, Chavis challenges the district judge\u2019s refusal to allow him to submit a portion of his income tax return showing a sizeable donation to a church.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-17\">I. RECUSAL</p>\n<p id=\"b192-18\">Chavis and Slisz\u2019 motion for recusal was based solely on Judge Suttle\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction against them in a separate civil action brought by the post office. Thus, Chavis and Slisz argue that the judge\u2019s partiality may be questioned, largely because he \u201cmade findings of fact concerning ultimate issues.\u201d This need not detain us long. \u201c[FJamiliarity with defendants and/or the facts of the case that arises from earlier participation in judicial proceedings is not sufficient to disqualify a judge from presiding at a later trial.\u201d <em>In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation, </em>614 F.2d 958, 965 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, Mead Corp. v. Adams Extract Co., </em>449 U.S. 888, 101 S.Ct. 244, 66 L.Ed.2d 114 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-19\">II. EVIDENTIARY RULINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b192-20\">A. Better Business Bureau Records and Brochures</p>\n<p id=\"b192-21\">Chavis and Slisz\u2019 primary defense was \u201cgood faith\u201d or lack of intent, based primarily on the companies\u2019 refund policies. To support this defense, Chavis and two of his employees testified that dissatisfied customers always received refunds, and no attempts were made to discourage those seeking refunds. In rebuttal, the government called the operations manager of the San Antonio Better Business Bureau, who testified about the BBB\u2019s methods of handling complaints against area businesses. Essentially, when the BBB received complaints, they were forwarded to the business and a record was kept of the complaint, the business\u2019 response, and the ultimate disposition of the claim. These records were summarized in \u201ccomplaint logs.\u201d Letters complaining that Chavis\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>companies discouraged or refused refunds and the BBB\u2019s complaint logs concerning these complaints were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Chavis and Slisz contend that these records and complaints were admitted to prove the truth of the matters contained in them, and are therefore hearsay. They note that the primary defense in the trial was that of good faith, a major component of which was the contention that the companies promptly made refunds when requested. Based on two isolated and vague comments in the government\u2019s closing argument and one question posed to the BBB representative, Chavis arid Slisz contend that the BBB records were used directly to rebut their evidence that refunds were always made on request. We disagree. The government did not use these letters and related records complaining of appellants\u2019 failure to make refunds for the truth of the individual complaints but rather to show that defendants were notified of the complaints. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(c); <em>United States v. Middlebrooks, </em>431 F.2d 299, 301 (5th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 1009, 91 S.Ct. 569, 27 L.Ed.2d 622 (1971). The jury was instructed that this evidence could be considered only for that limited purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The government also used a BBB-compiled brochure concerning \u201cenvelope stuffing schemes\u201d in its examination of Chavis.. This brochure was originally admitted, over objection, in the government\u2019s cross-examination of a defense expert. Chavis complains that this brochure was hearsay. Since this brochure does not appear to have been properly authenticated, its admission into evidence may have been erroneous. Given the volume of evidence introduced at trial and the relatively minor role this brochure played, however, any error in its admission was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">B. Texas Attorney General\u2019s Files</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Chavis and Slisz produced the testimony of Barbara Dupont, one of Chavis\u2019 employees, who authenticated various letters from satisfied customers of Chavis\u2019 companies. These letters indicated that Chavis\u2019 companies would, on request, prepay advertising expenses incurred by homeworkers. Du-pont and Chavis both had testified that the companies offered to prepay advertising expenses if necessary. The government was allowed in cross-examining Dupont to inquire into and introduce into evidence portions of complaint files maintained by the Texas Attorney General\u2019s office. The materials admitted were one complaint form from a Mr. Grogman, and two brochures or letters from Chavis\u2019 companies to other complaining parties. A letter from the Texas Attorney General\u2019s office and Chavis\u2019 handwritten reply were introduced along with the Grogman complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">The defendants contend that the materials were used substantively to prove the truth of the matter asserted \u2014 that advertising expenses were not paid in advance by the companies. Further, they contend that these documents were not authenticated properly. The government, on the other hand, again contends that the complaint was admitted to rebut Chavis and Slisz\u2019 assertions of good faith refund policy by proving that they had notice of the complaint that a refund was not made. The brochures or letters, it asserts, were introduced to rebut Chavis\u2019 assertions that the company\u2019s materials had been amended to reflect that homeworkers would be required to pay certain expenses. We agree with the government that the complaint was not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted in it, but rather as proof of notice. <em>See United States v. Middlebrooks, </em>431 F.2d at 301. The company materials likewise were not introduced to prove any of the statements in them, but rather to show that modifications had not, as Chavis contended, been made. Again, a limiting instruction was given. With regard to the second prong of the defendants\u2019 argument, the requirement of authentication is satisfied \u201cby evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 901(a). All of the materials from the Attorney General\u2019s files which were introduced were identified and ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>quately authenticated by the testimony of Dupont.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">C. False Representation Orders</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Several of Chavis\u2019 companies became the subjects of False Representation Orders (FROs), which terminate the delivery of mail to a postal customer. These orders are issued by the United States Postal Service after an administrative hearing, if it is determined that a postal customer is engaged in obtaining money or property through the mails by means of false representations. Three postal inspectors testified for the government concerning False Representation Order hearings on four of Chavis\u2019 companies. One inspector testified concerning the significance of an FRO and the procedure used for obtaining an FRO. All of the inspectors testified that FRO hearings were held concerning the activities of four Chavis companies, that various witnesses testified in these proceedings, and that FROs were ultimately issued against the four companies. The government also used the administrative findings of fact and conclusions of law in cross-examining Chavis. Finally, the government introduced a letter from a postal inspector to one of Chavis\u2019 companies advising the company that the postal service considered its activities to be illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The defendants contend that the probative value of this testimony was far outweighed by its prejudicial impact, and further that it was hearsay. We again must agree with the government\u2019s assertion that part of this evidence was introduced not for its truth but rather to rebut defendants\u2019 assertions that they believed their business to be legitimate, and they were unaware of any wrongdoing. The portion of this evidence introduced in the government\u2019s case in chief was also not offered to prove the truth or falsity of any administrative findings, but rather as relevant to the intent issue, to show that the defendants were on notice of complaints. <em>See United States v. Middlebrooks, </em>431 F.2d at 301. The jury was instructed immediately following the admission of this evidence and in the final charge that this evidence could be considered only as it related to defendants\u2019 intent. Finally, the district judge acted well within his discretion in finding that the probative value of this evidence was not outweighed by its prejudicial potential.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">D. North Dakota Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">In 1982, a North Dakota state district court enjoined one of Chavis\u2019 companies, AMFICO, from doing business in the state. Under the North Dakota Consumer Fraud Law, the consumer fraud division of the state attorney general\u2019s office may send inquiries to a business for the purpose of determining whether the business is operating in violation of state law. If the inquiry is not answered, the attorney general may seek an injunction. AMFICO failed to answer the attorney general\u2019s queries, and thus an injunction issued. The government introduced records from the Attorney General\u2019s office which documented the steps which led to the injunction. These records included letters to AMFICO explaining that an injunction would be obtained, a copy of the petition for an injunction, and a copy of the injunction itself. The file also contained receipts signed by Slisz for copies of these materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">The defendants make a three-point attack on the admission of this evidence: First, that it is proof of an extrinsic offense not relevant to the one charged; second, its prejudicial potential outweighs its probative value; and third, it is hearsay. We disagree with each of these. The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence to show that the defendants were aware that North Dakota authorities considered their business operation illegal, enjoined defendants\u2019 companies from operating in the state, and defendants continued to do business in spite of this knowledge. The district court gave a limiting instruction to this effect. A representative of the North Dakota Attorney General\u2019s office properly authenticated the records, and the district court was within its discretion in finding that their probative value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>was not outweighed by their prejudicial potential.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">E. Expert\u2019s Testimony Concerning Mental State</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Marvin Hodges testified on behalf of the defense that the materials and representations used by Chavis\u2019 companies were not misleading or unethical. Following Mr. Hodges\u2019 testimony, Dr. Birdwell, an advertising expert, testified on behalf of the government that the materials were misleading. At one point, on redirect examination, a hypothetical question about defendants\u2019 good faith was posed to Dr. Birdwell in which he was asked to assume that an individual had made false representations and had been put on notice that customers were dissatisfied, the authorities expressed their concern about the matter, yet the individual continued to make the same representations. Dr. Birdwell responded \u201c[I]t would seem to me that there wasn\u2019t any good faith. It was obviously an intended misrepresentation.\u201d The defendants contend that this testimony was outside Dr. Birdwell\u2019s area of expertise, and therefore inadmissible under Fed.R. of Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">We agree that in the ordinary circumstance testimony concerning a defendant\u2019s state of mind or intent must be avoided. <em>United States v. Ruppel, </em>666 F.2d 261, 270 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>458 U.S. 1107, 102 S.Ct. 3487, 73 L.Ed.2d 1369 (1982); <em>United States v. Webb, </em>625 F.2d 709, 711 (5th Cir.1980). In this case, however, the government\u2019s questioning was preceded by the following questions by Chavis\u2019 counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">Q. I am asking you, can you acknowledge that that could happen, that a person in good faith could make a representation that is false?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">Q. All right. And that\u2019s not fraud, is it, sir? It\u2019s not an intent to deceive?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Thus, Chavis \u201copened the door\u201d to this testimony. We disagree with Chavis\u2019 contention that the government first elicited testimony concerning whether the misrepresentations were intentional in its initial direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">F. Envelopes Marked \u201cRefused\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">In connection with the testimony of two witnesses who had sent certified letters to Chavis\u2019 companies requesting refunds, and testified that delivery of these letters was refused, the government introduced two envelopes <em>(not </em>the contents of the envelopes) marked \u201cRefused.\u201d The government also introduced a letter from Slisz to the postmaster at New Braunfels, Texas, which stated in part: \u201cI have been instructed by my employer not to sign for any mail and not to pay for any postage due mail.\u201d The defendants object that all of these materials are hearsay. With regard to the envelopes which were marked refused, even if these notations do constitute hearsay, the error is certainly harmless. The individuals who sent these letters testified to the facts surrounding the mailing and return of these letters. Introduction of the envelopes did nothing more than corroborate this testimony, which the defendants have not attacked. The letter to the New Braunfels postmaster from Slisz is not hearsay and therefore admissible. ' Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">G. Refusal to Admit Evidence of Charitable Contributions</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">The district court refused to allow Chavis to submit to the jury a portion of his personal income tax return which reflected a large contribution to a church. Chavis argues that this refusal was erroneous because this evidence was necessary to allow him to rebut the government\u2019s argument that the money he received from his companies went for planes, cars and other accoutrements of high living. We disagree, because Chavis has pointed to only a single question in the thirty-odd volumes of this record which could conceivably be interpreted to indicate that the government attempted to establish that Chavis\u2019 receipts went for such things. Any evidence of charitable contribution was therefore irrelevant, and this evidence was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>H. Declinations of Prosecution</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The district judge instructed Chavis\u2019 counsel at the close of evidence not to refer in argument to Chavis\u2019 reliance on past declinations of prosecution by the United States. The district judge also refused to give a defensive instruction that these declinations of prosecution could be considered on the issue of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The conduct of trial and the framing of the issues to be presented to the jury are in the sound discretion of the district court. <em>See Stick v. United States, </em>730 F.2d 115, 117 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 294, 83 L.Ed.2d 229 (1984); <em>Bryan v. Cargill, Inc., </em>723 F.2d 1202, 1203 (5th Cir.1984). The evidence of declinations of prosecution had very little probative value on the issue of intent. <em>See United States v. Lichenstein, </em>610 F.2d 1272, 1277-78 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 907, 100 S.Ct. 2991, 64 L.Ed.2d 856 (1980). It was within the district court\u2019s discretion to restrict counsel\u2019s argument on this question and avoid undue emphasis on an issue that could lead the jury away from the central issues in the case. Even if the district court did abuse its discretion, the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendants\u2019 intent adduced by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">III. JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Chavis complains that the judge refused to instruct the jury that ignorance of the law could be considered on the issue whether Chavis had the specific intent required for the crime of mail fraud. Ignorance of the law is relevant to the issue of specific intent, and generally a defendant is entitled to have the jury so instructed. <em>See United States v. Schilleci, </em>545 F.2d 519 (5th Cir.1977). The jury charge must, however, be considered as a whole, and in the full context of the trial. <em>See United States v. Grissom, </em>645 F.2d 461, 464 (5th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Fooladi, </em>746 F.2d 1027, 1030-31 (5th Cir.1984), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1362, 84 L.Ed.2d 382 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">In determining whether the failure to instruct the jury that ignorance of the law may be considered on the issue of specific intent constitutes reversible error, our cases fall into two categories. In one, exemplified by <em>United States v. Schilleci, </em>the jury is specifically instructed that ignorance of the law may not be considered. This is an improper instruction. In the other, exemplified by <em>United States v. Bush, </em>599 F.2d 72, 76-78 (5th Cir.1979), the jury is not specifically instructed that ignorance of the law is no excuse, and the specific intent instruction given, in the context of the case, is sufficient to allow the jury to consider the defendants\u2019 ignorance of the law. This case is controlled by <em>United States v. Bush. </em>In the instant case, the jury was correctly instructed that \u201cspecific intent, as the term implies, means more than the general intent to commit an act. To establish specific intent, <em>the government must prove that a defendant knowingly did an act which the law forbids, purposely intending to violate the law.\u201d </em>In addition, a defensive instruction on good faith reliance on the advice of counsel was given. Taken as a whole, the jury instructions were sufficient to allow the jury to consider ignorance of the law on the issue of specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">The defendants also argue that the district judge erred in instructing the jury that evidence of refunds could be considered only on the issue of intent to defraud, and not on the issue whether there was a scheme or artifice to defraud. The defendants contend that intent to defraud and the existence of a scheme or artifice are inseparable, and that this artificial distinction could therefore have misled the jury. The jury was, however, amply instructed that intent to defraud was a necessary element of the government\u2019s case, and could not have convicted the defendants had it not found specific intent to defraud. Thus, even if, as the defendants contend is possible, the jury concluded that a scheme or artifice existed simply because misrepresentations were made, it still could not have convicted absent a finding of intent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Whatever technical appeal the defendants\u2019 contentions may have, the jury instructions given here were adequate. We also find no merit to the defendants\u2019 contentions that the jury should have been instructed that the existence of a refund policy in itself might negate intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The jury began its deliberation the afternoon of February 16, 1984. After resuming deliberation the following morning, the jury requested a copy of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. The defendants contend that the district court erred in submitting to the jury the text of the statute without also repeating other explanations and definitions in the original charge, particularly defensive instructions and those regarding intent. The only authority cited by the defendants which arguably supports this contention is <em>Bland v. United States, </em>299 F.2d 105 (5th Cir.1962). The defendants in <em>Bland </em>were charged with bringing aliens into this country in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1). The district court initially properly charged the jury that guilty knowledge was a necessary element of a violation of section 1324(a)(1). In response to jury request some four hours later for the text of section 1324(a)(1), however, the district court read an excerpted version of the statute stating \u201cin essence, that any person who brings into the United States or lands in the United States an alien not duly admitted by an Immigration Officer or not lawfully entitled to enter or reside within the United States under the terms of this chapter or any other law relating to the immigration or expulsion of aliens, <em>shall be guilty.\u201d </em>299 F.2d at 108 (emphasis added). We held that this abridged version, which failed to mention guilty knowledge, might have misled the jury: \u201cThe jury could take literally the phrase \u2018shall be guilty\u2019 found at the end of the statute and the danger is great that they were misled and gave no further thought or consideration to the proposition that violation without knowledge or intent would not constitute the offense charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also noted that four hours had passed since the original instructions which made it highly likely that the jury had forgotten the intent requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 109. The defendants contend that since specific intent to defraud is an implicit element of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, <em>see United States v. Kent, </em>608 F.2d 542, 545 n. 3 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 936, 100 S.Ct. 2153, 64 L.Ed.2d 788 (1980), the district court\u2019s failure to reinstruct the jury concerning intent and their good faith defense requires reversal under <em>Bland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Here, the following version of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 was given to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">ALL 19 COUNTS OF THE INDICTMENT-COUNTS 1-7 \u2022 AND 9-20 CHARGE ONE OR BOTH OF THE DEFENDANTS WITH VIOLATING SECTION 1341 OF TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE, WHICH READS IN ITS RELEVANT PART AS FOLLOWS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av0\">WHOEVER, HAVING DEVISED OR INTENDING TO DEVISE ANY SCHEME OR ARTIFICE TO DEFRAUD, OR FOR OBTAINING MONEY ...

A statement or representation may also be \u2018false\u2019 or \u2018fraudulent\u2019 when it constitutes a half truth, or effectively conceals a material fact, with intent to defraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In addition, the jury was amply instructed that specific intent was a necessary element of a violation of section 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">This case is distinct from <em>Bland </em>in that all of the relevant language of the statute, including the language requiring a \u201cscheme or artifice to <em>defraud </em>\u201d or \u201cobtain money or property by means of <em>false or fraudulent pretenses </em>...\u201d was given to the jury. This language, taken in conjunction with the earlier instructions which repeatedly informed the jury that intent was a necessary element of the government\u2019s case, adequately signalled the intent requirement to the jury. In these circumstances, the district court was not absolutely required to re-instruet the jury on defensive matters outside the statute. <em>Bland </em>was based on the principle that \u201cwhen the jury requests further instructions on points which are favorable to the Government, the trial judge should repeat instructions favorable to the defense where the requested instructions taken alone might leave an erroneous impression in the minds of the jury.\u201d 299 F.2d at 108. The necessity of intent was so emphasized in the initial charge, and we believe, so signalled by the language of section 1341, that it is extremely unlikely that an erroneous impression was left in the minds of the jury here. Particularly given the length of time which elapsed between the original charge and the submission of the statute, the better practice would have been to reinstruct the jury on the basic defensive theories. Nonetheless, \u201cgenerally speaking, \u2018the necessity, extent, and character of any supplemental instructions to the jury are matters within the discretion of the district court.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Andrew, </em>666 F.2d 915, 922 (5th Cir.1982). We find no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">IV. OTHER MATTERS</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">During the course of the trial, one juror returned home to find attached to his doorknob a note referring to an unrelated case and generally defamatory of the presiding judge. A juror brought this note to the attention of the rest of the jury, then to the attention of the United States Marshal, who then brought it to the attention of the court. The judge individually interviewed each of the jurors to determine whether this note had created any bias, ultimately finding that it did not. The defendants argue, however, that they are entitled to reversal based on the district judge\u2019s subsequent refusal to allow them to conduct post-verdict interviews of the jurors. This argument is patently without merit. In order to justify the extraordinary step of examining the jury concerning its verdict, a defendant must make a preliminary showing of misconduct on the part of the jury, or that the jury based its verdict on matters outside the record. <em>United States v. Davila, </em>704 F.2d 749, 754 (5th Cir.1988). Here, no such showing has been made, and post-verdict interviews could only serve as a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Chavis and Slisz also challenge the indictment as insufficient. An indictment is to be read practically and in light of its purpose \u2014 to fairly inform the defendants of the charge against him and protect him from further prosecution for the same offense. <em>United States v. Mouton, </em>657 F.2d 736, 739 (5th Cir.1981). It is clear that this indictment served its purpose. Slisz also contends, apparently on due process grounds, that the government\u2019s delay in seeking the indictment requires reversal. In order to justify a reversal on this ground as an initial matter some prejudice must be shown. <em>United States v. Townley, </em>665 F.2d 579, 581-82 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 1010, 102 S.Ct. 2305, 73 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1982). The district court conducted a hearing on this issue and determined that Slisz had not been prejudiced, a finding which Slisz does not chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>lenge as clearly erroneous. This issue is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Slisz\u2019 contention that the district court erred in refusing to compel the government to disclose the contents of a memorandum summarizing an anonymous tipster\u2019s phone call to a postal inspector is also without merit. This material was not exculpatory, was not used by the government in its case, and contrary to Slisz\u2019 assertions, would not have established bias or other motivation on the part of the government\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Slisz also argues that because he was not connected with all of Chavis\u2019 companies, and was charged with only seven counts of mail fraud as compared to Chavis\u2019 twenty, initial joinder for indictment under Fed.R.Crim.Pro. 8(b) was improper. He further contends that he was irreparably prejudiced at trial, and his motion to sever under Fed.R.Crim.Pro. 14 was therefore improperly denied, because of the disparity in the amount of evidence introduced against him and that introduced against Chavis. With regard to the first of these contentions, Fed.R.Crim.Pro. 8(b) provides that joinder is proper if two or more defendants \u201care alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction or in the same series of acts or transactions ____\u201d Clearly this was the case here. Whether joinder for indictment under Rule 8(b) was proper is determined from the face of the indictment. <em>United States v. Grassi, </em>616 F.2d 1295, 1302 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 956, 101 S.Ct. 363, 66 L.Ed.2d 220 (1980). The critical inquiry is whether a \u201csubstantial identity of facts and participants\u201d exists. <em>United States v. Levine, </em>546 F.2d 658, 665 (5th Cir.1977). Here the indictment alleges a single scheme to defraud, carried out through the operations of the various Chavis companies, and clearly demonstrates the substantial identity of facts and participants required. The government need not charge all defendants in the same count or charge that each defendant participated in the same act. <em>United States v. Dennis, </em>645 F.2d 517, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1034, 102 S.Ct. 573, 70 L.Ed.2d 478 (1981). Further Rule 8(b) itself provides that \u201call of the defendants need not be charged in each count.\u201d We find no reason to conclude that joinder was improper. With regard to the second contention, denial of a motion to sever is overturned only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. DeVeau, </em>734 F.2d 1023, 1027 (5th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 906, 83 L.Ed.2d 921 (1985). To establish an abuse of discretion, the defendant must show \u201cthat he received an unfair trial and suffered, compelling prejudice against which the trial court was unable to afford protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Simple disparity in the quantum of evidence introduced against co-defendants does not justify severance in the absence of this showing of prejudice. <em>United States v. Hogan, </em>763 F.2d 697, 705 (5th Cir.1985). No such showing has been made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">Finally, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict, and deferring to the jury\u2019s credibility determinations, we find that the evidence was entirely sufficient to allow a reasonable trier of fact to find that Slisz\u2019 guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Barrilleaux, </em>746 F.2d 254, 256 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-12\">.
