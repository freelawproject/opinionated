We do not have such jurisdiction and accordingly transfer this matter to the Third Circuit which does.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Petitioner Ralph W. Bernardo (\u201cBernardo\u201d or \u201cPetitioner\u201d) was a coal miner from 1928 to 1946 only having mined coal in Pennsylvania. He now lives in California where he has filed for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 904 <em>et seq. </em>claiming compensable disability due to pneumoconiosis (black lung disease). An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) considered Petitioner\u2019s claim and ruled that he was not entitled to such benefits. Bernardo appealed the ruling to the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d) which affirmed. Bernardo has now filed a Petition for Review seeking to have the BRB decision overturned because of the application of an incorrect legal standard. As this court is without jurisdiction to consider the matter, we do not reach the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">The Black Lung Benefits Act provides at 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a) that the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq. (\u201cLHWCA\u201d) governs appeals from decisions of the BRB. The LHWCA provides in pertinent part, \u201cAny person aggrieved by a final order of the [Benefit Review] Board may obtain a review of that order in the United States Court of Appeals for <em>the circuit in which the injury occurred </em>...\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) (\u201c\u00a7 921(c)\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-16\">The question presented here is \u201cIn what circuit did Petitioner Bernardo\u2019s injury occur?\u201d Respondent argues that it occurred in the territorial jurisdiction of the Third Circuit where Bernardo was exposed to coal dust. Petitioner disagrees, arguing that the injury occurred in the territorial jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit where, he alleges, the disease manifested itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-17\">This is not a case of first impression, the Eleventh Circuit having already addressed this \u201cexposure\u201d v. \u201cmanifestation of disease\u201d jurisdictional controversy in <em>Slatick v. Director, OWCP, </em>698 F.2d 433 (11th Cir.1983). The Petitioner in <em>Slatick </em>was exposed to coal dust in the Third Circuit (Pennsylvania) and, subsequently, moved to the Eleventh Circuit (Florida) where he learned he might be suffering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>from black lung disease. His claim for benefits was denied, the denial was affirmed by the BRB, and he appealed to the Eleventh Circuit. Faced with the same question we face here, the Eleventh Circuit ruled it did not have jurisdiction, holding that for jurisdictional purposes under \u00a7 921(c) the injury in black lung cases occurs where an individual is exposed to coal dust, not where the disease manifests itself. The <em>Slatick </em>case was transferred to the Third Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">We hereby adopt the sensible rule of the <em>Slatick </em>court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As Petitioner Bernardo\u2019s exposure was in Pennsylvania, this matter should be before the Third Circuit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reject Petitioner\u2019s proposed \u201cmanifestation of disease\u201d jurisdictional rule. It could create factual disputes as to where the disease manifested itself. This concern is not merely theoretical, there being a dispute in this case as to whether Bernardo\u2019s disease manifested itself in Michigan where he filed his first black lung claim or in California where he filed his second. Such factual disputes about jurisdiction are not consistent with a bright line rule that will guide future litigants and lead to a swift resolution of black lung cases on the merits. Finally, we note that there is no reason for this circuit to adopt a jurisdictional rule different from that adopted by other circuits. To do so could create a number of jurisdiction related problems that are incompatible with fairness and common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">\u201c[T]he circuit in which the injury occurred\u201d for jurisdictional purposes under \u00a7 921(c) is the circuit where exposure to coal dust occurred. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">Whenever ... a petition for review of an administrative action, is noticed for or filed with [an appellate] court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Accordingly, Bernardo\u2019s Petition for Review is hereby transferred to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals for all further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-12\">. This section has \"consistently been held to be a jurisdictional provision.\" <em>Hon v. Director, OWCP, 699 </em>F.2d <em>441, 443 n. 1 (8th </em>Cir.1983) <em>citing Dantes v. Western Foundation Corp. Ass\u2019n., </em>614 F.2d 299 (1st Cir.1980); <em>Bassett v. Massman Construction Co., </em>120 F.2d 230 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>314 U.S. 648, 62 S.Ct. 92, 86 L.Ed. 520 (1941).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b666-6\">. Two other circuits have ruled on a related jurisdictional question under \u00a7 921(c) \u2014 whether more than one circuit has jurisdiction to consider a Petition for Review when a claimant is exposed to coal dust in more than one circuit. <em>Hon v. Director, OWCP, </em>699 F.2d 441 (8th Cir.1983); <em>Consolidation Coal Co. v. Chubb, </em>741 F.2d 968 (7th Cir.1984). This question is not presented here and we expressly do not rule on it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b666-18\">. Our ruling in this case concerning \u00a7 921 is in no way inconsistent with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Black, </em>717 F.2d 1280 (9th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1910, 80 L.Ed.2d 459 (1984) which defined \"time of injury\u201d as used in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910. That case implicated different concerns and required a determination of congressional intent on policies not at issue in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
