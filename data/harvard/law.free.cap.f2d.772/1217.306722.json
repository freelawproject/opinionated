Bean Corporation (Bean) for physical damages and economic losses that occurred shortly after a dredge owned and operated by Bean ruptured a Texaco natural gas pipeline. The Texaco pipeline supplied Consolidated\u2019s aluminum processing plant with natural gas. The resulting interruption in the supply of gas to Consolidated\u2019s plant caused extensive damage to the physical equipment'at the plant that Consolidated employed for processing aluminum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-17\">The district court granted Bean\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Consolidated\u2019s claim of negligence for damages to the plant\u2019s equipment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court held that, under <em>Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. v. Flint, </em>275 U.S. 308, 48 S.Ct. 134, 72 L.Ed. 290 (1927), no cause of action exists in tort for negligent interference with contract, even where a plaintiff has sustained physical damages arising out of the interference with contract. This Court has interpreted <em>Robins Dry Dock </em>to hold that recovery is barred to a plaintiff who asserts a claim for economic loss unaccompanied by physical damage to property in which the plaintiff has a proprietary interest. <em>Louisiana ex rel. Guste v. M/V TESTBANK, </em>752 F.2d 1019 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>53 U.S.L.W. 3839 (May 28, 1985). After careful consideration of the stipulated facts of this appeal and this Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Robins Dry Dock </em>in <em>TESTBANK, </em>we hold that the \u201cbright line\u201d rule of <em>Robins </em>and <em>TEST-BANK </em>does not reach the instant case and that a plaintiff\u2019s claim of'negligence for physical damages to equipment in which the plaintiff has a proprietary interest should be analyzed under tort principles applied by this Court in admiralty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the summary judgment in favor of Bean on Consolidated\u2019s negligence claim is reversed and the case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-18\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-19\">A. <em>Stipulated Facts on this Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1306-20\">For the district court\u2019s use in ruling upon Bean\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Bean, its insurers,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Consolidated en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>tered into a stipulation of facts. These stipulated facts will be summarized here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">Consolidated owned and operated an aluminum reduction plant near Lake Charles, Louisiana. This plant contained the following facilities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-6\">a. An electrically operated aluminum reduction pot line containing 71 operating smelting pots wherein alumina and bath materials are heated and melted in an electrolytic process by which molten aluminum is produced. Each pot utilizes 24 carbon anodes weighing in excess of 1000 pounds each which are suspended above the pots and project downward into the molten bath. The bottom of each pot consists of cathode blocks on which the aluminum is produced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-7\">b. A gas fired coke calciner approximately 180 feet in length which is lined with refractory brick and refractory material. In this calciner green coke is subject to temperatures, which in portions of the calciner exceed 2500 degrees Fahrenheit, and the green coke is thereby refined into calcined coke.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-8\">c. A power plant which utilizes natural gas to produce electric energy for plant operations. The power plant consists of three gas fired jet turbines, three steam boilers and two steam turbines, as well as associated electric generators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">Record at 3.39-40. To supply the power plant with gas necessary for the power plant\u2019s operation, Consolidated had entered into a Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement with Texaco. Other than Consolidated\u2019s contractual interest, Consolidated had no ownership interest in the Texaco pipeline. Bean had no knowledge of this contract between Consolidated and Texaco prior to the accident in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-10\">On April 5, 1980, Bean was conducting maintenance dredging operations in the Calcasieu River Ship Channel under a contract with the United States Army Corps of Engineers. This contract between Bean and the Corps of Engineers specifically warned Bean of the presence and location of the Texaco pipeline:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-11\">1-10. WORKING IN THE VICINITY OF STRUCTURES AND UTILITY CROSSINGS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-12\">1-10.1 The Contractor [Bean] shall exercise caution when working in the vicinity of structures and utilities crossing or adjacent to the channel____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-13\">1-10.3 The following structures or utilities are located within the limits of the work____ It will be the responsibility of the Contractor to verify these locations and clearances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-16\">UTILITY OR STRUCTURE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ait-dedup-1\">OWNER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-18\">STATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"av0-dedup-0\">ELEVATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGQ\">ADDRESS OF OWNER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-20\">12\" gas pipeline</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-21\">Texaco, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkyU\">1683+90</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"azy-dedup-1\">\u201450.0 MLG</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-22\">P.O. Box 60252, N.O., La. 70160</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-23\">Record at 3.232-33.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1307-24\">During the performance of Bean\u2019s work, the cutterhead of one of the dredges owned and operated by Bean struck and ruptured the Texaco pipeline. Within minutes, the rupture of the Texaco pipeline caused a reduction in gas pressure and supply to Consolidated\u2019s power plant, located approximately six miles from the pipeline rupture in the Calcasieu River.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a result of this loss of supply, the amount of natural gas flowing to Consolidated\u2019s plant fell below the minimum required to operate Consolidated\u2019s plant powerhouse. Because of the reduction in gas pressure and supply, Consolidated sustained heavy physical damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>a. Freezing (solidifying) of the liquid bath materials and liquid aluminum in the reduction pots;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-4\">b. Cracking and air burning of anodes in the reduction pots;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-5\">c. Cracking of cathode blocks in the reduction pots;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-6\">d. Air burning of sidewall blocks in the reduction pots;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-7\">e. Burning of breaker bars in the reduction pots;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-8\">f. Loss of useful life of the reduction pots; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-9\">g. Loss and cracking of calciner refractory materials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1308-10\">Record at 3.42-43. Indeed, the resulting physical damage was so heavy that the parties stipulated the physical damages to Consolidated\u2019s plant at a value of $2.3 million. Consolidated contends that it suffered total physical and economic damages amounting to approximately $4.6 million. Full natural gas supply was not restored to Consolidated until ten days later on April 15, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-11\">B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-12\">Consolidated filed its complaint against C.F. Bean Corporation, Bean Dredging Corporation, their insurers, and Texaco to claim damages for physical and economic losses resulting from the interruption of gas services at Consolidated\u2019s plant. Consolidated\u2019s complaint alleged three grounds of recovery: (1) an action against Bean and Texaco on grounds of negligent or intentional acts or omissions leading to the injury; (2) an action against Bean on the grounds that Consolidated could recover as a third-party beneficiary under the Bean-Army Corps of Engineers contract; and (3) an action in contract against Texaco based on the Texaco-Consolidated Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Texaco, in turn, im-pleaded the United States through the Department of the Army and its Corps of Engineers, claiming that the United States was also responsible for the negligent dredging which caused the rupture of the Texaco natural gas pipeline. Jurisdiction was based on the Admiralty Extension Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 740, and on diversity, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-18\">At the time set for trial, the United States raised the issue of <em>Robins Dry Dock </em>concerning the claims by Consolidated, through Texaco, against the United States. After consideration of the issue, the district court then permitted Bean to reopen a prior summary judgment motion by Bean based on the same grounds. As noted above, Consolidated and Bean entered into a stipulation of facts for the district court\u2019s use in considering Bean\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1308-19\">In its opinion, the district court held that Consolidated\u2019s action for negligent dredging against Bean was barred by <em>Robins Dry Dock </em>and its progeny in this Court. The district court\u2019s opinion, however, also contained statements which could be construed as stating that the district court also held that Consolidated was an unforeseeable plaintiff when its cause of action was considered in light of common law tort principles. <em>See </em>Record at 3.247 (\u201cConsolidated\u2019s extensive physical and economic damages were too remote and not foreseeable as a result of Bean\u2019s negligence\u201d). Concerned about a possible ambiguity in the district court\u2019s opinion, Consolidated filed a motion urging the district court to clarify its holding so that the matter would be more clearly presented to this Court on appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consolidated\u2019s motion noted, \u201cHad the issue of foreseeability been before the [District] Court, Consolidated would have presented a substantial volume of evidence showing that harm to customers served by the pipeline was a foreseeable consequence of the pipeline rupture.\u201d Record at 3.251. The motion in subpara-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>graphs 3(b)-(e) then pointed out several issues of fact which bore on the question of foreseeability and which had been referred to in the district court\u2019s opinion but which were not contained in the stipulation of facts. In response to Consolidated\u2019s motion, the district court supplemented its original opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-4\">The Court has granted summary judgment in favor of Bean and against Consolidated on Consolidated\u2019s cause of action for negligence against Bean, on the basis of the Court\u2019s holding, as a matter of law, that no cause of action exists for negligent interference with contract, even where the plaintiff has sustained physical damages arising out of the interference with contract. The Court has made no findings of fact with respect to the issue of foreseeability or the other issues listed in paragraph 3(b)-(e) of Consolidated\u2019s motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1309-5\">Record at 3.257-58.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">II. THE MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">The district court granted summary judgment in Bean\u2019s favor on Consolidated\u2019s claim of Bean\u2019s negligence in its dredging operations. Summary judgment is appropriate only if the full record discloses \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Ped.R. Civ.P. 56(c). In considering whether to grant a motion for summary judgment, the district court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party resisting the motion. The standard of review on appeal is the same. <em>Simon v. United States, </em>711 F.2d 740 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-8\">Since Consolidated\u2019s contractual right to receive natural gas from Texaco was interrupted by Bean\u2019s negligent rupture of the Texaco pipeline, the district court characterized Consolidated\u2019s action against Bean for negligence as an action for negligent interference with contract. Record at 3.240, 3.244. While Consolidated recognizes that purely economic losses flowing from negligent interference with contract are not recoverable as a matter of law, <em>see, e.g., TESTBANK, </em>Consolidated argues that the presence of physical damages to property in which Consolidated has a proprietary interest (i.e., physical damages to its own plant) requires that this case be considered under tort principles of foreseeability. Consolidated asserts that it will present evidence on foreseeability if Consolidated is allowed to proceed to trial. Record at 3.251. Bean, on the other hand, argues that the distinction of physical damages in the instant case is of no significance and that this case is governed by cases in this Court holding that no cause of action exists for economic damages resulting from negligent interference with a contractual right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-10\">In arguing that the district court\u2019s summary judgment should be sustained, Bean relies heavily on <em>Robins. </em>In <em>Robins, </em>a ship had been delivered to the defendant for repairs. Under the terms of a contract between the ship\u2019s owner and the time charterers, the time charterers were not obliged to pay rent while the ship was being repaired. The defendant, who had contracted with the owner of the ship for the repair work, negligently damaged the ship\u2019s propeller. During the additional delay caused by repairs to the propeller, the time charterers lost expected profits from the use of the ship. The time charterers sued the defendant for these economic losses. The Supreme Court rejected the claim. The only item physically damaged was the propeller, and \u201c[t]he injury to the propeller was no wrong to the [time charterers] but only to those to whom it belonged.\u201d <em>Robins, </em>275 U.S. at 308, 48 S.Ct. at 135. The Court went on to note that the time charterers had lost only the benefit of their contract for hire and that \u201ca tort to the person or property of one man does not make the tort-feasor liable to another merely because the injured person was under a contract with that other, unknown to the doer of the wrong. The law does not spread its protection so far.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308-09, 48 S.Ct. at 135 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-11\">Taken by itself, <em>Robins, </em>however, is of somewhat limited applicability in that it holds \u201conly that if a defendant\u2019s negligence injures party <em>A, </em>and the plaintiff suffers loss of expected income or profits because it had a contract with <em>A, </em>then the plaintiff has no cause of action based on the defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>TESTBANK, </em>752 F.2d at 1040 (Wisdom, J., dissenting). In the instant case, the plaintiff Consolidated sues not solely for any lost income or other <em>economic </em>loss from the interruption of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>supply of natural gas (e.g., due to being forced to pay higher prices for an alternative supply) but instead for <em>physical </em>losses, as well as attendant economic damages, to its own property which occurred as a result of the interruption of Consolidated\u2019s supply of gas \u201cwithin minutes\u201d of the pipeline\u2019s rupture. Thus, unlike the time charterers in <em>Robins, </em>Consolidated\u2019s suit centers on the physical damages it sustained resulting from the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">Thus, if a rule based on <em>Robins </em>which bars Consolidated\u2019s claim per se is to be found, it must lie in the interpretation that this Court and other jurists have given to <em>Robins. </em>Recently, this Court, sitting en banc, conducted an exhaustive study of <em>Robins </em>and its progeny. In <em>TESTBANK, </em>this Court reviewed a summary judgment entered against a host of plaintiffs who claimed purely economic losses arising out of a spill of a toxic chemical in the Mississippi River Gulf outlet. Reviewing this Court\u2019s interpretation of Robins<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the cases cited by Justice Holmes in his opinion in <em>Robins, </em>the Court determined that <em>Robins </em>is not based on whether a plaintiff\u2019s harm is \u201cforeseeable\u201d or \u201cremote\u201d in a factual sense but instead on \u201cthe character of the interest harmed\u201d for which a plaintiff seeks relief. <em>TESTBANK, </em>752 F.2d at 1022-24 (quoting <em>Dick Meyers Towing Service, Inc. v. United States, </em>577 F.2d 1023, 1025 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 908, 99 S.Ct. 1215, 59 L.Ed.2d 455 (1979)). The \u201ccharacter of the interest harmed\u201d for which the plaintiffs sought relief in <em>TEST-BANK </em>was solely economic. <em>Id. </em>at 1021. Given this character of the interest harmed, the Court reaffirmed the holding of this Court that \u201cphysical damage to a proprietary interest [is] a prerequisite to recovery for economic loss in cases of unintentional maritime tort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1020, The Court emphasized that to abandon the physical injury requirement would impose a \u201climitless type of liability,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1025 (quoting <em>General Foods Corp. v. United States, </em>448 F.Supp. 111 (D.Md.1978)), and the result would be \u201cwave upon wave of successive economic consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1028. The Court also noted the corresponding difficulty to courts in managing such economic claims on a discrete basis under traditional tort principles. <em>Id. </em>at 1028. Thus, where the character of the interest harmed was solely economic, the Court held that no recovery could be allowed under <em>Robins </em>as a \u201cpragmatic limitation upon the tort doctrine of foreseeability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-8\">In the instant case, this \u201cpragmatic limitation upon the tort doctrine of foreseeability\u201d does not apply. Rather, Consolidated plainly suffered physical harm to property in which it has a proprietary interest \u2014 i.e., its own equipment for deriving aluminum. Thus, <em>TESTBANK </em>does not apply. <em>See Domar Ocean Transportation, Ltd. v. M/V ANDREW MARTIN, </em>754 F.2d 616 (5th Cir.1985) (\u201cmaritime tort damages for economic loss can be awarded only when the plaintiff has suffered physical damage to a proprietary interest\u201d). Further, Bean\u2019s characterization of the physical harm in this case as a \u201cnegligent interference with contract\u201d tends to obscure more than to illuminate. Unlike the claimant in <em>Robins, </em>Consolidated does not seek recovery solely for the loss of a contractual expectancy. While Bean\u2019s alleged negligence certainly interfered with Consolidated\u2019s contractual arrangement with Texaco, it cannot be gainsaid that, under the stipulated facts on this appeal, Bean\u2019s negligence also led to Consolidated\u2019s physical damages. While the presence of the Consolidated-Texaco contract <em>is relevant </em>to the question of foreseeability, its presence in the causal chain does not bar recovery.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>The Court\u2019s result in the instant ease is consistent with the opinions of other courts and commentators. In accord with this Court\u2019s rule in <em>TESTBANK, </em>the Restatement (Second) of Torts, for example, notes that there has been no general recognition of liability for a negligent interference with contract absent physical injury to a plaintiff\u2019s proprietary interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The authors explain that courts generally have been reluctant to allow claims for such economic losses because of the difficulty in limiting a defendant\u2019s liability. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766C, Comment a. Where plaintiffs have suffered physical harm to their own property, however, these authorities recognize that the rationale for applying the rule foreclosing relief for economic harm does not apply. While the number of plaintiffs suffering only economic harm from a negligent act is indeterminate and perhaps infinite, the number of potential plaintiffs suffering physical harm is generally neither as indeterminate nor as possibly infinite. <em>See </em>Comment, <em>Foreseeability of Third-Party Economic Injuries </em>\u2014 A <em>Problem in Analysis, </em>20 U.Chi.L.Rev. 283, 298 (1953); Pearlman, <em>Interference with, Contract and Other Economic Expectancies: A Clash of Tort and Contract Doctrine, </em>49 U.Chi.L.Rev. 61, 71-72 (1982). Thus, commentators have stated that a plaintiff is not barred from recovery where the plaintiff has suffered physical harm to his own person or property. The Restatement authors explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1311-16\">b. Physical harm to the other. The rule stated in this Section [766C] applies when the plaintiff suffers only pecuniary loss, such as the loss of the financial benefits of a contract or of prospective trade or financial loss through being put to additional expense. If there is physical harm to the person or land or chattels of the plaintiff, the rule stated in this Section does not apply and there may be recovery for negligence that results in physical harm because of the nonperformance of a contract with the plaintiff. This recovery is of course subject to the usual rules governing liability for negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1311-18\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766C, Comment b (citations omitted).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Likewise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>Professors Prosser and Keeton distinguish instances in which a plaintiff recovers for physical damages from the rule denying relief for economic losses resulting from negligent interference with contract. W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, <em>Prosser and Keeton on the. Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 129, at 1000 n. 27 (Lawyers\u2019 ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">We therefore conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Bean. The \u201cpragmatic limitation upon the tort doctrine of foreseeability,\u201d derived from <em>Robins </em>and <em>TEST-BANK, </em>does not apply to the instant case. While defendant Bean urges this Court to determine \u201c[ujnder a traditional tort analysis [that] Consolidated\u2019s harm [is] ... too remote,\u201d Bean\u2019s Brief at 12, we leave the determination of the foreseeability of Consolidated\u2019s injury for the trial court to determine on remand. Likewise, application of other tort law principles applied in admiralty are left for the trial court on remand as questions calling for the determination of such principles are not presented on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1306-13\">. The district court entered a final judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54 and stayed all further proceedings in the case pending appeal to this Court. Record at 3.259-60.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1306-14\">. The limited nature of this appeal deserves special emphasis. As noted in more detail later in this opinion, <em>see infra </em>at 1220-1221, the district court explicitly declared that it was resting its opinion on a theory of negligent interference with contract and that no findings were made as to whether Consolidated\u2019s claim of negligence would withstand scrutiny under a foreseeability test. Accordingly, those questions are not reached on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1306-21\">. Consolidated sued both C.F. Bean Corporation, Bean Dredging Corporation, and their insurers. The stipulation of the parties recognized that C.F. Bean Corporation and Bean Dredging Corporation should be collectively referred to as \"Bean\u201d for the purposes of considering the motion for summary judgment and the appeal from the district court's ruling thereon. Record at 3.39. Following the parties' stipulation, we also refer to both companies and their insurers as \u201cBean.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1307-25\">. As noted above, however, Bean did not specifically know that the Texaco pipeline served Consolidated\u2019s plant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1307-26\">. The parties dispute in their briefs whether the harm to Consolidated\u2019s plant occurred immediately or whether the harm occurred only after Texaco shut down a main gas line to repair the rupture. Given the procedural posture of the instant case, this Court has not attempted to resolve this factual dispute and has assumed, for purposes of this appeal, that the rupture caused a reduction in gas supply \"within minutes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1308-13\">. As noted above, <em>see supra </em>at 1218 n. 1, all further proceedings in the district court were stayed pending appeal on the district court\u2019s granting of summary judgment in favor of Bean on Consolidated\u2019s tort action against Bean. Any questions arising from Consolidated\u2019s other alleged causes of action are not presented to this Court on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1308-14\">. The stipulation also noted that Texaco had invoked as a defense the force majeure provision in Consolidated\u2019s action in contract against Texaco based on the Consolidated-Texaco Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1308-20\">. We commend the practice of the parties in stipulating the facts clearly and in clearing up any possible ambiguity in the district court's opinion. Although the district court's holding, when read as a whole, is remarkably precise, the action by Consolidated relieved this Court of any doubt in the matter. The parties are also commended for their thorough presentation of the issue presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">. Perhaps most notably, the <em>TESTBANK </em>Court observed that in <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. v. Marshland Dredging Co., </em>455 F.2d 957 (5th Cir.1972) (per curiam), the plaintiff lost gas supplies when the defendant dredging company broke a gas pipeline owned by Sugar Bowl Gas Company. Kaiser sought only economic losses for shutdown expenses and production losses. The Court held that because such economic losses were only negligently inflicted, recovery was precluded as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">. Indeed, the Court in <em>TESTBANK </em>noted that a contractual relationship can make the plaintiffs harm <em>more </em>foreseeable. In discussing <em>Byrd v. English, </em>117 Ga. 191, 192, 43 S.E. 419 (1903), a case involving a printer's recovery for lost profits resulting from the defendant\u2019s negligent interruption of the plaintiff's electrical power, the Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1310-10\">That the printing company had a contract with the power company did not make more remote the relationship between its loss of profits and the tortious acts. To the contrary, the contract reduced this remoteness by defining an orbit of predictable injury smaller than if there were no contract between the power company and the printer. When the loss is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>economic rather than physical, that the loss caused a breach of contract or denied an expectancy is of no moment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">752 F.2d at 1023-24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">. Section 766C states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1311-8\">Negligent Interference with Contract or Prospective Contractual Relation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1311-9\">One is not liable to another for pecuniary harm not deriving from physical harm to the other, if that harm results from the actor\u2019s negligently</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1311-10\">(a) causing a third person not to perform a contract with the other, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1311-11\">(b) interfering with the other\u2019s performance of his contract or making the performance more expensive or burdensome, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1311-12\">(c) interfering with the other\u2019s acquiring a contractual relation with a third person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1311-13\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1311-14\">. The distinction that this Court has drawn (as exhibited in TESTBANK) between physical and economic damages has also been drawn by other courts. <em>See, e.g., Barber Lines A/S v. M/V DONAU MARU, </em>764 F.2d 50 (1st Cir.1985). Likewise, state courts have made a similar distinction. In <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos. v. Fisher, </em>387 Mass. 889, 444 N.E.2d 368 (1983), the plaintiff sought damages for loss of business revenues allegedly caused by the defendant\u2019s negligent collision with a drawbridge. Although the plaintiff had no proprietary interest in the drawbridge, the plaintiff alleged that it suffered economic losses due to the loss of potential customers who could not cross the drawbridge and reach the plaintiff\u2019s store. The court distinguished an earlier Massachusetts case, <em>Newlin v. New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>316 Mass. 234, 54 N.E.2d 929 (1944), on the basis that <em>Newiin </em>involved physical harm to the plaintiff\u2019s own property caused by the interruption of plaintiff's supply of electricity from the power company. On an appeal from the trial court\u2019s sustaining of a demurrer, the court in <em>Newiin </em>allowed recovery for the loss of plaintiff\u2019s mushrooms which resulted when the defendant\u2019s telephone pole fell and severed an electrical power line supplying plaintiff\u2019s electrical apparatus for controlling temperature. Similarly, courts generally have recognized, albeit in dicta, that a distinction exists between cases in which a plaintiff sustains physical damages and those in which only economic damages are claimed. <em>See, e.g., Akron Corp. v. M/T CANTIGNY, </em>706 F.2d 151, 153 (5th Cir.1983) (per curiam); <em>Louisville &amp; N. R.R. v. M/V BAYOU LACOMBE, </em>597 F.2d 469, 473-74 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Nebraska Innkeepers, Inc. v. Pittsburgh-Des Moines Corp., </em>345 N.W.2d 124, 126 (Iowa 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-20\">Moreover, to the extent that Louisiana law is relevant to the instant case, it is consistent with this writing. In <em>PPG Industries, Inc. v. Bean Dredging Corp., </em>447 So.2d 1058 (La.1984), the court was confronted with PPG's claims for economic losses only arising out of the same dredg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>ing accident as that which occurred in the instant case. The court did not apply a rule of per se exclusion, as that contained in <em>Robins, </em>but instead held that PPG\u2019s claim for economic losses was not recoverable under a duty risk analysis. The court emphasized that its holding turned largely on the economic character of PPG\u2019s loss. 447 So.2d at 1061.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b1312-7\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING WITH SUGGESTION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<author id=\"b1312-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1312-9\">The petition for panel rehearing is DENIED. In view of the petition\u2019s suggestion that the panel opinion inadvertently creates \u201ca brand new theory of recovery for negligent interference with a contract where physical damage occurs solely from the loss of anticipated contract benefits,\u201d we take this opportunity to reemphasize the limited nature of the appeal and the narrowness of our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-11\">Our discussion of the Robins Dry Dock/TESTBANK line of cases showed that the \u201cpragmatic limitation upon the tort doctrine of foreseeability,\u201d State of Louisiana, ex rel. Guste v. m/v TESTBANK, 752 F.2d 1019, at 1023 (5th Cir.1985), established by these cases, is inapplicable to the instant case because the plaintiff Consolidated unquestionably suffered physical harm to its own property. We further conclude that the mere existence of a contract between Texaco (whose property suffered the most immediate harm from the defendant\u2019s dredging) and Consolidated does not create a legal bar to Consolidated\u2019s claim against Bean for negligent dredging. We in no way intimated that Consolidated could recover for \u201cnegligent jinterference with contract.\u201d Nor did we hold that summary judgment for the defendant would necessarily be improper on the facts of the instant case. Rather, we remanded because the district court expressly omitted to review the issue of foreseeability with regard to negligent dredging. We expressly declined to reach the question of \u201cwhether Consolidated\u2019s claim of negligence would withstand scrutiny under a foreseeability test,\u201d 772 F.2d at 1218 n. 2, and left the application of traditional tort principles, including foreseeability and the related concept of legal duty, for the trial court to determine on remand, at 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-12\">Thus, the petition for rehearing is DENIED, and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc (Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and Local Rule 35), the suggestion for rehearing en banc is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
