Walker, appeals from his conviction in a jury trial of various offenses relating to the importation, possession, and distribution of marihuana, and of wire fraud. On appeal, he argues, <em>inter </em>alia, that the district court erred in denying his motion to reopen the evidence to permit him to testify in his own defense. We find that the district court exceeded its discretion and reverse and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"A7D\">Defendant-appellant, Roy E. Walker, a former New Orleans restaurateur and honorary reserve captain in the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office, was convicted in a jury trial of two counts of conspiracy to import marihuana into the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960(a)(1), 963; one count of importation of marihuana into the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; four counts of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute marihuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846; four counts of possession with the intent to distribute marihuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; and one count of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. He was sentenced to nine years\u2019 imprisonment, consisting of concurrent four-year terms on all counts except the importation and wire fraud charges, a consecutive three-year term on the importation charge, and a consecutive two-year term on the wire fraud count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-12\">Evidence at trial reflected that while in Las Vegas in October 1980, Walker was introduced to Leroy Buras, the head of a massive drug smuggling operation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by their mutual friend and attorney, A.J. Graf-fagnino. Contemporaneous with this meeting, Buras was told of Walker\u2019s position in the reserve force and that Walker was a brother-in-law of Harry Lee, the sheriff of Jefferson Parish. Shortly after their initial meeting, Buras asked Walker to obtain for him a copy of a police report which discussed the November 1980 seizure of five trucks and a shrimp boat, \u201cWill\u2019s Folly,\u201d which had been caught transporting approximately twenty-one tons of marihuana. Buras had been involved in the smuggling of the marihuana that had been aboard the seized boat and trucks. Walker agreed and obtained a copy of the report, for which he supposedly was paid $5,000. Walker conceded that he had obtained a copy of the report, but denied that he was paid for his assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-13\">There was evidence that Buras subsequently asked Walker to become part of his drug smuggling organization, and that Walker, prompted by his serious financial condition, accepted the offer in February 1981. According to immunized testimony by members of the Buras organization, Walker\u2019s role was to monitor local police activity when drug shipments arrived into port by boat. The first such operation took place in March 1981 when a shrimp boat, the \u201cLil Thomas,\u201d arrived in a Lafitte, Louisiana port with approximately 20,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>pounds of marihuana on board. According to the smugglers\u2019 testimony, Walker provided a list of radio frequencies and call signs used by local law enforcement officers to enable the smugglers to keep track of local police activity by monitoring radio communications while the drug cargo was being offloaded and hidden in the marshes. There was also evidence that Walker supplied Buras\u2019 men with a police walkie-talkie radio from which the smugglers could determine the frequency at which the local police walkie-talkies were tuned. Testimony also indicated that while the boat was being offloaded, Walker cruised in a police car with a deputy of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office and kept Buras informed of local police activity, and that the deputy was paid $25,000 for his role.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">There was also evidence that Walker subsequently helped distribute the marihuana that had arrived aboard the \u201cLil Thomas.\u201d Buras left several bales of marihuana in a grey truck outside appellant\u2019s restaurant on three separate occasions, and an additional load of marihuana at the home of one of appellant\u2019s associates. Walker, under this arrangement, took the bales, sold them, and retained a portion of the sales proceeds in partial payment for his help in providing surveillance when the shipment arrived in port.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">The government also presented evidence that Walker took part in the smuggling of a second shipment of 40,000 pounds of marihuana which arrived in New Orleans aboard the vessel \u201cShady Lady\u201d in May 1981. Walker took part in negotiations for warehouse space to store the cargo once it arrived. He also again took part in surveillance of police activity the night the vessel arrived. There was evidence that for his participation in both the \u201cLil Thomas\u201d and \u201cShady Lady\u201d ventures, Walker earned approximately $220,000 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-10\">In July 1981, Buras, along with several of his co-conspirators, fled to Costa Rica after receiving a tip from his attorney, Graffagnino, that he was about to be indicted. One of Buras\u2019 accomplices, Frank Smith, subsequently was arrested on February 25,1982, when he made a return visit to the United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly after Smith was arrested, Walker and Buras had a telephone conversation during which, according to Buras\u2019 testimony, Walker stated that he could get a magistrate to reduce Smith\u2019s $350,000 bond in exchange for a bribe of $10,000 and use of a stud horse for breeding purposes. Buras testified at trial that his attorney, Graffagnino, gave the bribe money to Walker. Smith\u2019s bond subsequently was reduced to $150,000,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which he met. Smith subsequently was convicted of four counts of importing marihuana and was sentenced to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-11\">Smith\u2019s conviction and twenty-year sentence prompted Buras to contact the government and attempt to arrange lighter sentences for himself and his associates, including Smith, in exchange for cooperation in drug cases. Buras and his associates began providing information to the government; in exchange, Smith\u2019s sentence was reduced to five years, and Buras and certain smugglers received relatively light sentences.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>Information provided by Buras and the members of his organization led to an investigation into Walker\u2019s possible involvement in drug smuggling activity. In November 1983, Walker was charged under a superceding indictment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> with eleven counts of conspiracy to import, importation, conspiracy to possess, and possession of marihuana, and one count of wire fraud in connection with his alleged telephone conversation with Buras and receipt of bribe money from Graffagnino. The case, which was tried to a jury, commenced on Monday, May 14, 1984. The prosecution completed its case-in-chief the following Thursday, May 17, after calling twenty-six witnesses, including Buras, Smith, and six other smugglers testifying under government immunity. The court adjourned for the day at 4:00 p.m., May 17. The defense began its case Friday morning, May 18. In his opening statement that morning, counsel for defense told the jury, \u201c[W]e intend to put Mr. Walker on the stand so Mr. Walker can tell you what \u2014 how he came to know Leroy Buras, how he came to know all these other people, and what his business dealings were with them. We intend to go at great length with Mr. Walker into all the allegations that are made by the Government witnesses.\u201d The same day, at approximately 3:00 p.m., Walker\u2019s attorney requested a brief recess so he could talk to appellant \u201cabout possibly testifying in his own behalf.\u201d Walker\u2019s attorney added that the speed with which the government presented its case-in-chief \u201ccaught [him] with [his] ... pants down.\u201d The district court granted a recess so that Walker and his attorney could confer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Before the jury was brought back into the courtroom, defense counsel informed the court that he was \u201cabsent a couple of witnesses\u201d and that the defense would be unable to present them that day. At this point, the district court asked whether the defense had available any other witnesses it planned to call to the stand, and asked whether Walker was going to testify. The following dialogue ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-7\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROY E. WALKER: I\u2019d like very much to have the opportunity to say something, Judge, because I\u2019m the person here and my life is at the stake. And I think that I have been \u2014 excuse me, Judge. I am very emotional. I am very upset. I have put some very personal friends of mine through some experiences that I don\u2019t \u2014 that I wouldn\u2019t want to put anybody through. I have been exposed to this thing. I have been ruled off the race track. I have had so much pressure____ I don\u2019t have any money. I was in [my attorney\u2019s] ... office until 10:30 last night going over this stuff with just him and I____ [My attorney] ... and I did not find ourselves compatible and still don\u2019t. I think [he\u2019s] ... done a magnificent job with the circumstances as it is. I have so much pressure on me, Your Honor, that if I have to testify, if I\u2019m forced to get on the stand right now, I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m not going to force anybody to do anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-13\">\u201cDEFENDANT ROY WALKER: I\u2019m not saying that. I would love to testify. I would love to testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1263-14\">The district court explored the possibility of issuing an instanter subpoena and having one of the two missing witnesses brought into court to testify that afternoon; Walker\u2019s attorney tentatively agreed. Defense counsel then informed the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>\u201cI just \u2014 insofar as making a decision on ... [whether Walker will testify], he doesn\u2019t know. His position, as I understand it, is he doesn\u2019t feel like he is emotionally prepared or is documentarily prepared that he can take the stand and present the documentation he needs to verify where he was on certain dates and he just doesn\u2019t feel like he could \u2014 you know, it would be a good idea to take the stand today, is essentially what he has told me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">Defense counsel subsequently withdrew his request to have a subpoena issue for the missing witness. After discussing stipulations on what the two missing defense witnesses would have testified to, the jury was brought in. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: ... Would the defense call its next witness, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-6\">\u201c[WALKER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Judge, we don\u2019t have any other witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: In other words, the defense rests?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-8\">\u201c[WALKER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: We\u2019ll rest, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1264-10\">The government called two rebuttal witnesses and then closed that afternoon, Friday, May 18. No proceedings were held on the weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-11\">The following Monday morning, May 21, Walker informed his attorney for the first time that he wished to testify after all. At this point, the jury had not been charged, nor had the parties made their summations. Walker\u2019s counsel moved the court to reopen the evidence \u201csolely for the purpose\u201d of allowing appellant to testify and expressed concern that the jury would speculate on why Walker had not testified since the defense had earlier represented that he would take the stand. The- district court denied the motion. Following the closing arguments and charge, the jury returned a verdict finding appellant guilty on all twelve counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-15\">Counsel for defense filed a motion for a new trial and judgment of acquittal. The district court, before ruling on this motion, sentenced Walker to nine years\u2019 imprisonment<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and a parole term of two years. Walker appealed his conviction. Thereafter, new counsel was appointed to represent Walker. Walker\u2019s new attorney filed a memorandum supplementing the motion for new trial and for judgment of acquittal. Therein, appellant argued that the district court erred by refusing to grant a weekend trial recess in midafternoon on Friday, May 18, and by failing to reopen the case on the next trial day to permit appellant to testify. The district court did not permit the defense to supplement the record with the memo or supporting documents. The court denied the defense motion for a new trial and judgment of acquittal. Notice of appeal was filed. Appellant\u2019s motion to consolidate the two appeals was subsequently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-17\">On appeal, Walker argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant a weekend recess to allow appellant time to compose himself and possibly take the stand, by failing to reopen the evidence the following Monday to permit him to testify, and by failing to grant a new trial based on these alleged errors. Finding that the district court\u2019s failure to reopen the evidence on Monday, May 21, constituted an abuse of discretion,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>\u201cGenerally, the reopening of a criminal case after the close of evidence lies within the sound discretion of the [district] court.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>608 F.2d 1261, 1267 (9th Cir.1979); <em>see also Turner v. United States, </em>441 F.2d 736, 739 (5th Cir.1971) (per curiam) (\u201cIt appears well settled that the reopening of a case to receive additional evidence is within the Trial Court\u2019s discretion.\u201d); <em>Maggard v. Wainwright, </em>432 F.2d 941, 942 (5th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 946, 91 S.Ct. 1639, 29 L.Ed.2d 116 (1971) (\u201cConsiderable latitude in discretion is vested in the trial court\u201d in determining whether to reopen the evidence.); <em>United States v. Molinares, </em>700 F.2d 647, 652 (11th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>Maggard). </em>The district court\u2019s decision whether or not to reopen the evidence will be overturned on appeal only upon a showing that it abused its discretion. <em>United States v. Thetford, </em>676 F.2d 170, 182 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1148, 103 S.Ct. 790, 74 L.Ed.2d 996 (1983). In <em>Thetford, </em>we outlined factors which the district court \u201cmust\u201d consider in exercising its discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-4\">\u201cIn exercising its discretion, the court must consider the timeliness of the motion, the character of the testimony, and the effect of the granting of the motion. The party moving to reopen should provide a reasonable explanation for failure to present the evidence in its case-in-chief. The evidence proffered should be relevant, admissible, technically adequate, and helpful to the jury in ascertaining the guilt or innocence of the accused. The belated receipt of such testimony should not \u2018imbue the evidence with distorted importance, prejudice the opposing party\u2019s case, or preclude an adversary from having an adequate opportunity to meet the additional evidence offered.\u2019 \u201d 676 F.2d at 182 (quoting <em>United States v. Larson, </em>596 F.2d 759, 778 (8th Cir.1979)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\"><em>See also Larson, </em>596 F.2d at 778 (\u201cIn passing on the motion a court should consider a number of pertinent factors: the timeliness of the motion; the character of the additional testimony; and the effect of granting the motion. The party moving to reopen must provide a reasonable explanation for its failure to present the additional evidence during its case-in-chief.\u201d). We analyze the instant case in light of the factors set out in <em>Thetford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-9\">\n<em>Timeliness of the Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-10\">Among the factors the district court must consider is \u201cthe timeliness of the motion\u201d to reopen. <em>Thetford, </em>676 F.2d at 182; <em>see also Larson, </em>596 F.2d at 778; <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>575 F.2d 1265, 1267 (9th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 863, 100 S.Ct. 131, 62 L.Ed.2d 85 (1979). After the government presented its rebuttal witnesses on Friday, May 18, the government rested its case. At that time, appellant made no definite indication that he wished to testify and no request was made of the district court to reopen the evidence. At the commencement of the very next day of the trial, however, the defense made its motion to reopen the case in order for Walker to take the stand. While we believe that the delay in making the motion to reopen weighs against appellant\u2019s position on appeal, we consider the delay to be minor under all the circumstances. If Walker had elected to take the stand on Friday, as he should have, and the government thereafter was permitted to present additional rebuttal witnesses to counter his testimony, the testimony very likely would have carried over into Monday morning anyway. Except for the loss of a small part of one afternoon, the timing of the defense motion to reopen amounted to little more delay than would have been caused by Walker taking the stand on Friday, May 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-11\">In <em>Larson, </em>which this Court quoted with approval in the <em>Thetford </em>decision, a panel of the Eighth Circuit, with Judge Ingraham of this Court sitting by designation, found that the district court had abused its discretion by refusing to reopen the evidence to permit a defense witness to testify. As in the instant case, the defense had rested its case on a Friday afternoon and had sought to reopen the evidence the following Mon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>day morning. The Eighth Circuit noted that \u201c[a]t the time of the motion to reopen, appellants were prepared to tender ... [the new witness] as a witness \u2014 she appeared at the courthouse on Monday morning____\u201d 596 F.2d at 779. By finding that the district court had abused its discretion in refusing to allow the new witness to testify, the Eighth Circuit apparently did not consider the untimeliness of the motion to reopen a significant factor. Nor, in the present setting, do we. As in <em>Larson, </em>Walker moved to reopen at the beginning of the very next business day following the close of the defense\u2019s case. Also as in <em>Larson, </em>the defense indicated at the time the motion to reopen was being considered that Walker was prepared to testify immediately; Walker told the court, \u201cI\u2019m ready to testify right now____\u201d Although there was a slight delay during which the defense should have presented the motion, we do not consider it such a significant factor as to govern disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-10\">\n<em>Character of the Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ay-\">In <em>Thetford, </em>we stated that the district court must also consider the \u201ccharacter of the testimony\u201d that the movant wishes to present upon reopening the evidence. 676 F.2d at 182; <em>see also Larson, </em>596 F.2d at 778. Counsel for Walker, after moving to reopen, stated, \u201cJudge, my only motion at this time would not be to bring in any other witnesses, it would be to reopen the case solely for the purpose of allowing Mr. Walker to testify.\u201d The nature of the evidence the defense wished to present, therefore, was the testimony of the defendant, who had not previously taken the stand, in his own criminal trial and addressed to his own alleged activities that were the subject of the prosecution. As a factor in determining whether the district court abused its discretion, the character of the testimony offered by the defense weighs very heavily in favor of Walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-11\">Without regard to whether there is a constitutional right to testify and the extent to which it might apply,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>Walker\u2019s testimony in his own defense is of such inherent significance that the district court, as a matter of fairness, should have permitted him to testify. Walker had not testified at all, and his testimony would be of particular interest to the fact finder because he would be testifying as the alleged active participant in the activities which were the focus of the trial. Where the very point of a trial is to determine whether an individual was involved in criminal activity, the testimony of the individual himself must be considered of prime importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">While no formal proffer of the content of Walker\u2019s testimony was timely made,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and in other circumstances this might count heavily against him, we do not regard it as of any real significance here. Neither the court below nor government counsel even obliquely raised any question in this regard, and indeed it was evident that the government would oppose, and the court would deny, the request to reopen regardless of any proffer concerning the content of Walker\u2019s proposed testimony. Moreover, it was obvious what Walker (who had not already testified) would testify about\u2014 namely, his version of his own conduct and statements as portrayed by the government\u2019s witnesses and asserted by the prosecution as constituting the offenses charged. These were matters that were, in the vast majority of instances, not covered by the testimony of any of the defense witnesses. It is and was unmistakable, undisputed, and obvious that Walker\u2019s testimony would have been highly relevant and significant and in no meaningful sense cumulative. Plainly, Walker\u2019s testimony had \u201cexculpatory potential\u201d and \u201cwould have enhanced appellant\u2019s defense.\u201d <em>Larson, </em>596 F.2d at 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-9\">Apart from what appellant would have testified to, his presence on the stand would have afforded him the opportunity to have the jury observe his demeanor and judge his veracity firsthand. As one Circuit Judge has noted, \u201cThe facial expressions of a witness may convey much more to the trier of facts than do the spoken words.\u201d <em>United States v. Irvin, </em>450 F.2d 968, 971 (9th Cir.1971) (Kilkenny, J., dissenting). We conclude that the character of this \u201ceyeball testimony,\u201d as a matter to be weighed in determining whether the district court should have permitted Walker to testify on Monday, is also a factor falling on the side of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-10\">\n<em>Effect of Granting the Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-11\">A third factor which the district court must consider is \u201cthe effect of the granting of the motion\u201d to reopen the evidence. <em>Thetford, </em>676 F.2d at 182; <em>see also Larson, </em>596 F.2d at 778. Here, there is no indication that the effect of granting the motion to reopen would have prejudiced the government\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-12\">When Walker\u2019s attorney made the motion to reopen, the jury had not yet been charged and closing arguments had not yet begun. In this respect, the instant case is similar to the facts addressed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>Eighth Circuit in <em>Larson, supra, </em>in which the Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-4\">\u201cThe ... testimony [sought to be admitted through the motion to reopen] would not have carried a distorted importance merely by being introduced after a reopening. First of all, <em>since neither closing arguments nor jury instructions had yet been delivered, </em>the ... testimony would have been heard in the orderly flow, with perhaps an intervening continuance, of the defense testimony. But even assuming that the testimony might have derived undue emphasis from its appearance subsequent to all parties resting, a cautionary instruction by the trial judge might have remedied that potential problem.\u201d 596 F.2d at 779 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">Similarly, the fact that the motion to reopen here came at the commencement of proceedings the Monday morning following the Friday close of the testimony, and the evidence as a whole, indicates that the reopening would not have disrupted \u201cthe orderly flow\u201d of the testimony. Except for the loss of a small portion of Friday, there was no greater setback in time than would have occurred had Walker initially taken the stand on Friday and carried over into Monday. <em>Larson, </em>596 F.2d at 778-79 (holding that the district court should have reopened evidence on the Monday immediately following the Friday close of the defense\u2019s case and the evidence to allow a defense witness to testify).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">Moreover, the government does not appear to have been prejudiced respecting any potential rebuttal to appellant\u2019s testimony. There is no suggestion in the record, the trial court did not find, and the government did not urge below and does not argue now, that the government let any potential rebuttal witnesses go, on the assumption that the evidence was closed and that appellant would not testify, or that any such witnesses had for any reason become unavailable since the defense rested on Friday. Again, this fact parallels the situation in <em>Larson </em>in which the Court stated that \u201c[s]o far as [it could] ... ascertain from the record,\u201d the prosecution would have no difficulty in assembling its \u201cwitnesses ... in rebuttal to the\u201d newly offered testimony. 596 F.2d at 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-9\">Of perhaps greater potential concern to the government here was the fact that the prosecution, between the time the defense rested and the evidence closed on Friday, presented two rebuttal witnesses. When appellant moved to reopen the evidence the following Monday, the government protested that it was at an \u201cextreme disadvantage\u201d because appellant had had an opportunity to review the evidence that the government put on in rebuttal before deciding to take the stand. We perceive two potential bases for prejudice to the prosecution which might arise if a defendant were permitted to testify following the presentation of the government\u2019s rebuttal. First, the government could be prejudiced because the defendant would be able to hear what the rebuttal witnesses had to say and to work his testimony around theirs. Second, the government could be prejudiced because the defendant would be able to learn what the rebuttal witnesses did <em>not </em>know or did not testify to, and to decide as a strategic matter that it would be safe for him to take the stand and testify to certain matters. While these concerns might justify a refusal to reopen under another set of facts, our review of the record convinces us that here the government would not have been prejudiced as a consequence of Walker\u2019s having had the opportunity to hear the testimony of its rebuttal witnesses.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>With respect to the first consideration, whether Walker would have been able to meld his testimony around testimony brought out during the government\u2019s rebuttal, to the prejudice of the government, we conclude that he did not learn any important portion of the government\u2019s case during its rebuttal evidence. No signifi-. cant information was brought forth that Walker had not already learned during the government\u2019s case-in-chief. The first rebuttal witness, a loan officer of Commercial Bank and Trust Company, testified that appellant had taken out six loans, both business-related and personal, with his bank, and that he believed that the bank had to sue Walker on some of the underlying notes. The second and final rebuttal witness, an Assistant United States Attorney in the civil division of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office and chief of the collections unit of that office, explained that his office handles seizures of property through a writ of <em>fiera facias. </em>This second rebuttal witness did not testify on any matter other than general background concerning that writ. These two comparatively insignificant witnesses formed the entire government rebuttal. Neither witness\u2019 testimony reasonably could have affected appellant\u2019s decision to testify or revealed significant information that would aid him in formulating his own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-8\">Likewise, the prejudice that might potentially arise from appellant\u2019s learning what the government\u2019s rebuttal did <em>not </em>cover does not pose a potential problem in the present case. First, it is unlikely that Walker refrained from testifying during the defense\u2019s case-in-chief out of fear of what evidence the government was holding back for rebuttal. The substantial evidence brought against him by the eight witnesses who were testifying under government immunity constituted direct, eyewitness testimony concerning his involvement in the charged criminal activity. Under these facts, it is doubtful that appellant held back from testifying because he feared whatever damaging evidence the government had <em>reserved </em>for its rebuttal. Second, and more important, the nature of the defense\u2019s case-in-chief was such that appellant would have anticipated very little in the way of rebuttal by the government. The defense presented ten witnesses; of these, five were essentially character witnesses. None of the defense witnesses presented strong testimony to counter the government\u2019s case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consequently, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>was very little evidence presented by the defense for the prosecution to rebut. It is highly unlikely that Walker refrained from testifying during his case-in-chief because he was uncertain of what testimony the government would present in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-4\">We also reject the suggestion that reopening the evidence would have created a conflict in the district court\u2019s handling of its docket. The district court noted that it had several trials on its docket, but did not indicate that it was facing a scheduling conflict as a consequence of Walker\u2019s attempt to reopen the evidence. Moreover, the facts suggest that this could not have been the situation. As noted, had Walker taken the stand on Friday when the district court asked the defense to present its next witness, his testimony and cross-examination could, and likely would, have carried over into Monday. The government, in turn, might have produced additional rebuttal witnesses, besides the two it did produce, to counter appellant\u2019s testimony. After that, of course, the jury would be charged and counsel would make their closing arguments. As late as the late afternoon of Friday, May 18, therefore, the district court could not have already scheduled other trials that would pose any less risk of conflict if appellant were to reopen the evidence than would have been the case if appellant had taken the stand on Friday. We find no indication in the record that the district court was concerned that reopening the evidence would cause a scheduling conflict. Nor do we find the possibility of a conflict any greater had the court reopened the evidence than would have been the case if appellant had taken the stand on Friday.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Also as was the case in <em>Larson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>\u201cwe are not here concerned with the testimony of many additional witnesses, but of one more defense witness.\u201d 596 F.2d at 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">In assessing the effect of granting the motion to reopen, we also consider another respect in which denial of the motion would likely prejudice the defendant. As discussed above, defense counsel told the jury during his opening statement that Walker would testify and address \u201call the allegations that are made by the Government witnesses.\u201d Walker\u2019s attorney argued in connection with his motion to reopen that Walker\u2019s failure to take the stand after this earlier representation might have the effect of prejudicing the jury against him. Counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-6\">\u201cAnd in that opening statement, if you recall, I told the jury that he would testify, so I don\u2019t know what effect that\u2019s had on the jury at this point. If he doesn\u2019t testify, they\u2019re wondering, \u2018Well, did something go wrong?\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018Were we deluded into believing he would testify when, in fact, he didn\u2019t?\u2019 I\u2019m wondering if they\u2019re not sitting up there questioning why he hasn\u2019t taken the stand \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa-\">This Court has previously noted the injurious effect that a defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand may have on the jury\u2019s consideration of his case. <em>DeLuna v. United States, </em>308 F.2d 140, 152 (5th Cir.1962). It is true that the defense created its own trap by representing that appellant would take the stand and then closing without having offered his testimony.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, the government made no comment concerning appellant\u2019s failure to testify and the district court instructed the jury that his failure to take the stand could not be held against him. Nevertheless, we note that the effect of granting appellant\u2019s motion to reopen would be to further minimize the risk of prejudice against appellant for failing to take the stand. This consideration, as well as the other factors concerning the \u201ceffect of granting the motion\u201d to reopen, militates at least to some extent in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-11\">\n<em>Reasonableness of Excuse for Request to Reopen</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-12\">In <em>Thetford, </em>we indicated that the district court, in deciding whether to reopen the evidence, also should consider the reasonableness of the excuse offered by the movant for failing to present the evidence in his case-in-chief. 676 F.2d at 182; <em>see also Larson, </em>596 F.2d at 778. This factor mildly favors Walker\u2019s position, or at least does not point in the other direction. On Friday, May 18, Walker told the district court that he \u201cwould love to testify.\u201d However, he also told the court, \u201cI am very emotional. I am very upset____ I have so much pressure on me, Your Honor, that if I have to testify, if I\u2019m forced to get on the stand <em>right now, </em>I \u2014 \u201d; at this point, the court interrupted him by saying that it would not force appellant to take the stand. (Emphasis added.) Walker\u2019s attorney clarified for the district court that Walker\u2019s position was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-15\">\u201che doesn\u2019t feel like he is emotionally prepared or is documentarily prepared that he can take the stand and present the documentation he needs to verify where he was on certain dates and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>just doesn\u2019t feel like he could \u2014 you know, it would be a good idea to take the stand <em>today, </em>is essentially what he has told me.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">The following Monday, after moving to reopen the evidence, Walker and his attorney again explained that Walker had been emotionally unable to take the stand the previous Friday. In response to the district court's comment that it had asked \u201cMr. Walker if he wanted to take the stand\u201d on Friday, Walker stated, \u201cAt that time, Your Honor, <em>I couldn\u2019t.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">We find that the defense presented an apparently bona fide and not significantly unreasonable excuse for Walker's failure to testify the previous Friday. Moreover, we find no evidence or logic to suggest that Walker moved to reopen the evidence on Monday simply to delay the proceedings, to gain a strategic advantage over the government,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or to have the last word in surre-buttal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In fact, the government, addressing the motion to reopen on Monday, May 21, appeared to concede that the reason appellant had not testified on Friday was because of his nervous condition. We acknowledge and agree with the government\u2019s argument that it would be difficult to conceive of many defendants who would not feel some nervousness at the prospect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>of testifying at their own criminal trials, although the record indicates that Walker\u2019s situation went somewhat beyond this commonplace. Moreover, we by no means rest our decision that the district court abused its discretion on the character of appellant\u2019s excuse, which at least in most instances would not alone suffice to carry the day. Weighing his excuse together with the seriousness of the crimes with which appellant was charged, the nature and potential scope of his testimony, the fact that he had not testified at all, the absence of any prejudice to the government or hardship to the court if reopening were allowed, and the timing of the motion, we find that the district court, on balance, clearly should have allowed the defense to put Walker on the stand on Monday, May 21, and exceeded its discretion in refusing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">We emphasize our commitment to the settled principle that decisions on motion to reopen rest in the sound and broad discretion of the district court, and that this extends to motions to reopen to allow a defendant to testify in a criminal case. We fully appreciate that we are generally not in anywhere near as good a position as the trial court to judge of these matters, that we cannot have the \u201cfeel\u201d for the case that the trial judge has, and that in any event the efficient administration of justice requires that trial courts have flexibility of decision in managing the mechanics of trial and their dockets. That does not mean, however, that such decisions are always beyond any review. The confluence of all factors in this particular case strongly convinces us that the trial court clearly erred in denying Walker\u2019s motion to reopen. Upon examining the relevant considerations, we can \u201cfind no valid reason to justify a denial of the defense motion to reopen,\u201d <em>Larson, </em>596 F.2d at 779-80, and cogent reasons to grant the motion. Therefore, we reluctantly reverse and remand for a new trial. <em>See Id., </em>596 F.2d at 780 (concluding that district court had abused its discretion, appellate court orders new trial \u201cin the interests of justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1261-10\">. Since we reverse on this issue, we do not reach appellant's other assignments of error. They present no matter likely to recur on another trial. There is no question of the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1261-14\">. Between 1978 and 1981, Buras\u2019 network imported thirteen shipments of marihuana, total-ling approximately 550,000 pounds, into the United States.

The government did not contend, nor do we find any evidence suggesting, that the bond was reduced because the magistrate in question was bribed. The extent of the government's allegation was that Walker defrauded Buras by accepting the money under the guise that appellant would bribe the magistrate, even though he knew full well that the magistrate \"never asked, demanded, exacted, solicited, sought, accepted, received or agreed to receive from\u201d Walker anything of value in return for reducing Smith\u2019s bond.

While it is perhaps superfluous, we nevertheless note that \" \u2018[a]buse of discretion\u2019 is a phrase which sounds worse than it really is. All it need mean is that, when judicial action is taken in a discretionary matter, such action cannot be set aside by a reviewing court unless it has a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.\" <em>In re Josephson, </em>218 F.2d 174, 182 (1st Cir.1954). The term \"does not imply intentional wrong or bad faith, or misconduct, nor any reflection on the judge.\" <em>Black's Law Dictionary </em>(5th ed. 1979) at 10. The capable district judge fairly and competently tried this difficult and doubtless often vexing case. Upon a weighing of the relevant factors, we simply have the definite and firm conviction that, in this one particular, she clearly erred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1266-8\">. The Supreme Court, in <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 645, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971), wrote that \"[e]very criminal defendant is <em>privileged </em>to testify in his own defense, or to refuse to do so.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Court subsequently wrote that \u201d[w]hether the defendant is to testify is an important tactical decision as well as a matter of constitutional <em>right.\" Brooks v. Tennessee, </em>406 U.S. 605, 92 S.Ct. 1891, 1895, 32 L.Ed.2d 358 (1972) (emphasis added). The <em>Brooks </em>court made its comment, however, in the context of its consideration of a Tennessee statute which required that a criminal defendant who desired to testify had to do so before any other testimony for the defense was presented. Since the statute served to influence the defendant\u2019s decision <em>whether </em>to testify or not, the Court held that it violated his right of due process by restricting the accused\u2019s defense and depriving him \u201cof the \u2018guiding hand of counsel.\u2019\u201d 92 S.Ct. at 1895 (quoting <em>Powell v.

During his sentencing hearing, Walker stated what some of his testimony would have been. Walker indicated that he would have substantiated that he received money from Buras, but that the money was in payment of an outstanding gambling debt rather than for the discussed purpose of bribing a magistrate. Walker specifically denied that he ever implied to Buras or any other person that he would bribe the magistrate. Walker also indicated that he would have substantiated that he gave a copy of a police report to Buras, but that he was unaware that Buras was involved in illicit activity; he said that he supplied the report, which he contended was readily available to the public, at the request of Buras and his mutual attorney, Graffag-nino. Walker stated that he supplied the report as a favor to Graffagnino, who had done legal work for Walker and his wife, and had assumed that a legal purpose underlay the request. Appellant further indicated that his testimony would have shown that his financial condition was not as bad as the government had suggested, rebutting the government's position that Walker resorted to crime in order to extricate himself from his financial trouble. Finally, Walker would have testified that he had never been involved in the drug business in any form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">. The district court made no finding of prejudice in this respect. Although it did refer to the fact that the government had put on its rebuttal, it did not find that therefore the government would likely be actually prejudiced by allowing Walker to reopen. Rather, it seems to have been of the view that the mere fact that <em>any </em>rebuttal had been put on lessened or eliminated the court\u2019s discretion to allow reopening. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-11\">\"I know of nothing that <em>permits </em>me to <em>let </em>Mr. Walker testify at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-12\">\"Mr. Ashley, the procedures generally are that once the defense rests its case, it may reopen, <em>except discretionary </em>with the Court, of course, <em>except when we have the Government </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number><em>having already putting on its rebuttal </em>and then rested its rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-5\">\"Now, I certainly want to afford the Defendant every right, but <em>unless you can point to some law that says I have a right to reopen </em>for the specific purpose of putting Mr. Walker on the stand to testify, but then I would have to reopen the case also for the Government for additional rebuttal.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">. The defense presented Roland Bruno, an assistant horse trainer, who testified that Walker on one occasion had lectured him because he believed that Bruno was a friend of certain men who had been seen smoking marihuana at the racetrack where Walker kept his horses. When asked during direct examination, \"Did Mr. Walker ever discuss with you importing marijuana into this country?,\" Bruno responded, \"Are you kidding me? He would never even have nothing like that around the barn.\u201d Robert Vaucresson, Leon Salloum, and Frank Heav-ey testified or were presented for the purpose of testifying to Walker's reputation for truth and veracity. Appellant\u2019s mother, Nancy Walker, also took the stand for the defense and testified that she did not believe Walker was smuggling marihuana into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-10\">None of the witnesses for the defense presented significant evidence to counter the government\u2019s case. In addition to his character testimony, Bruno testified that Walker and he were at a Kentucky racetrack during May and June 1981. Bruno, however, was unable to remember whether Walker ever traveled back to New Orleans during that time period, nor was he able to recall the exact dates they arrived in or departed from Kentucky. Moreover, Bruno testified that he saw Walker only \"an hour or two during the day\u201d when they were in Kentucky. A second defense witness, Robert Padilla, testified that Walker never flashed a large amount of money in his presence nor discussed marihuana. Padilla also testified that he saw the trailer from which Buras allegedly kept radio contact with Walker when the \"Lil Thomas\u201d and \"Shady Lady\u201d loads arrived, and that it did not contain radio equipment. Padilla, however, admitted that he did not know whether the trailer had held radio equipment prior to the one occasion (at an unspecified time in 1981) when he had been inside it, inspecting it with Walker for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>possible purchase from him. Daniel Dettwiller, Jr., testified that Walker never displayed a large amount of money in his presence and that appellant had been slow in paying his bills for keeping his horses on Dettwiller\u2019s farm. Robert Vaucresson testified only to Walker\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity. Charles Touzet testified that Walker never discussed importation of marihuana with him nor flashed large amounts of cash in front of him. Touzet also testified that Walker still owed him more than one thousand dollars on racehorse equipment. Leon Salloum testified that a horse he and Walker co-owned had raced on March 8, 1981, and on one previous occasion, but was unable to remember whether the horse had raced on any other date in March 1981. He also acknowledged that there were no night races during this period. When asked his opinion of Walker's reputation for truth and veracity in the community, Salloum testified, \"Well, I imagine he has friends and I imagine he has enemies, but I\u2019m sure his friends think a lot of him and I think his enemies don\u2019t think much of him, but that's with everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">Walker\u2019s former wife, Lorraine Lee, also took the stand for the defense. She testified that Walker never mentioned marihuana. She also testified that she had been with Walker on March 3, 1981, Mardi Gras day, and also had seen him at a party a few days earlier. She testified that she and Walker were separated at the time, though, and was unable to account for his activities on any other evening during early March. An eighth defense witness, Frank Heav-ey, testified that Walker did not have sufficient funds to purchase a restaurant he was interested in acquiring. Heavey testified that he did not know people in the community who knew Walker, and consequently was prevented from speculating on Walker's reputation for truth and veracity. Shing Fan, an employee at one of Walker\u2019s restaurants, testified that he had been on vacation throughout March and had seen Walker only once during that time. He testified that he was unaware of any large amounts of cash or marihuana passing through the restaurant, but added that as a cook he was not conscious of activity outside the kitchen area. The government did not cross-examine Fan. Walker's mother, Nancy Walker, testified that appellant had been away from New Orleans from April through October. When asked whether appellant ever came back to New Orleans during that time, Mrs. Walker responded, \"If he did, I didn\u2019t see him.\" She also expressed her disbelief that her son was involved in smuggling or that he possessed the money Buras supposedly had paid him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1270-9\">. The instant case is distinguishable from the hypothetical situation posed by the First Circuit in <em>Blaikie v.

No such mention is made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-9\">We also note that shortly before the trial recessed for the day at 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, the district court announced its intention to have the case go over into the following week if the evidence was not completed by about 3:00 p.m. on Friday, but that if the defense completed its evidence by noon on Friday and the government had no rebuttal, then the court might have the case go to the jury late Friday afternoon.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1271-17\">.

Walker, on Monday, gave an additional excuse to the district court which we find less justifiable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-7\">\u201cJudge, the reason that I didn't want to testify Friday was because I was \u2014 I had never even contacted the people that were suppose[d] to testify in my defense. I had never even asked anybody to come up here. I had given [my attorney] ... a list of people, but we were not speaking of these people to have to come up here for another week or two weeks and I didn\u2019t know when they were supposed to be here, Your Honor, and at the last minute when they said it was time to call witnesses, that night and that evening I was calling the witnesses to try to get them in the next day and most of these witnesses, Your Honor \u2014 my right hand to God \u2014 they could testify to that. I called them that night and never spoke to them about testifying before that, Your Honor.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">The district court noted that this excuse was unreasonable since Walker had been indicted seven months earlier and had had all that time to contact his witnesses. <em>See </em>note 6, <em>supra. </em>We agree. <em>See United States v. Aiken, </em>373 F.2d 294, 300 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 833, 88 S.Ct. 32, 19 L.Ed.2d 93 (1967) (\u201cAlthough [the defendant\u2019s] ... counsel stated that the witness could not be located 'on the eve of the defense,\u2019 he did not adequately account for his failure to locate her during the five weeks which elapsed between ... direct testimony relating to [the defendant] ... and the closing of the proofs. The denial of the motion to reopen was thus not an abuse of discretion.\").</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">Although Walker advanced this excuse for his own failure to testify, it appears that he presented the explanation as an excuse for why the defense wished to present <em>other </em>new witnesses. Walker appeared to be under the misapprehension that the defense motion to reopen the evidence would permit him to present new witnesses to support his case. Walker told the court on Monday that he had a witness standing in the hallway who would testify to certain matters, which he proceeded to outline for the court. At that point, Walker\u2019s counsel intervened, \"Judge, my only motion at this time would not be to bring in any other witnesses, it would be to reopen the case solely for the purpose of allowing Mr. Walker to testify.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1272-12\">. <em>See </em>text, <em>supra, </em>discussion concerning the effect of granting the motion to reopen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1272-13\">. This case is distinguishable from the facts of <em>Turner v. United States, </em>441 F.2d 736 (5th Cir.1971) (per curiam), and <em>United States v. Greene, </em>497 F.2d 1068 (7th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 909, 95 S.Ct. 829, 42 L.Ed.2d 839 (1975), in which the defendants already testified during their cases-in-chief and desired only to get a <em>second </em>chance to testify in surrebuttal. In <em>Greene, </em>the Seventh Circuit sustained the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-14\">\u201cWhen the point of completion of a trial has been reached, which was the situation here, the trial judge should be vested with substantial discretionary powers to bring the eviden-tiary phase to a close, or to put it another way, to curb the natural tendency of vigorous counsel to get in the final word.\u201d 497 F.2d at 1083.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1272-15\">We similarly noted in <em>Turner </em>that if the defendant were to retake the stand, he only would have reiterated what he and others had testified previously. 441 F.2d at 739. In the instant case, on the other hand, appellant wished to reopen the evidence so that he could testify for the <em>first time. </em>His purpose was not merely to get in \"the final word,\u201d as in <em>Greene, </em>or to rehash earlier testimony, as in <em>Turner, </em>but to provide his original testimony concerning the charges he was facing. Moreover, in <em>Turner </em>and <em>Greene, </em>the defense was not burdened with the ill effects of the defendant's not having taken the stand in his own defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
