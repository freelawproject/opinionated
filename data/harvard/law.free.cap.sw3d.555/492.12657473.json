He contends the circuit court's judgment was not final because the court failed to dispose of all of the marital property. Upon review of the briefs and the record, we find no error and affirm the judgment. We have provided the parties with a Memorandum explaining the reasons for our decision, because a published opinion would have no precedential value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   AFFIRMED.
