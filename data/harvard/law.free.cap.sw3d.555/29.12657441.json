Based on Sebastian Cotton &amp; Grain Ltd.'s representation that it owned grain inventory stored on its property, Willacy County Appraisal District (WCAD) listed Sebastian as the owner of the grain on the 2009 appraisal roll. After receiving the tax bill, Sebastian requested a correction to the appraisal roll and produced to WCAD documents showing it had sold the grain to DeBruce Grain. Agreeing to Sebastian's request, WCAD corrected the appraisal roll to reflect DeBruce as the property owner. DeBruce then protested, asserting it was not the owner because the grain was not in its possession on the assessment date. WCAD ultimately changed the 2009 appraisal roll back to again reflecting Sebastian as the grain's owner. Sebastian protested, asserting that WCAD lacked authority to make that change to the appraisal roll.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We must decide three legal issues: (1) whether Property Tax Code section 25.25(b) authorizes an appraisal district to correct ownership on an appraisal roll when such a correction necessarily alters the taxing units' expectation of who is liable for payment of property taxes; (2) whether an agreement under Property Tax Code section 1.111(e) may be voided if it was induced by fraud; and (3) whether a purported owner challenging ownership on the appraisal roll is entitled to recover attorney's fees under Property Tax Code section 42.29. We hold that when, as here, an ownership correction to the appraisal roll does not increase the amount of property taxes owed for subject property in the year of the correction, an appraisal district's\n   chief appraiser has statutory authority under section 25.25(b) to make such a correction. We further hold that a section 1.111(e) agreement may be rendered voidable if fraud is proven. Finally, we hold that Sebastian is not entitled to attorney's fees under section 42.29. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In May 2009, Jerry Jurica, Sebastian's property-tax agent, filed a Rendition of Taxable Personal Property with WCAD on behalf of Sebastian.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. TAX CODE \u00a7 22.01(a) (requiring a property owner to declare, or \"render,\" to the appraisal district \"all tangible personal property used for the production of income that the person owns ... on January 1\" so that the property may be taxed). In its rendition, Sebastian represented to WCAD that it owned all of the grain in its possession as of January 1, 2009. At the same time, Sebastian filed an application for exemption of the grain inventory under section 11.251 of the Property Tax Code, the \"Freeport\" exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, the property was not eligible for the Freeport exemption, so WCAD denied Sebastian's exemption application. Based on the grain inventory values contained in Sebastian's rendition, WCAD appraised Sebastian's inventory at $2,315,894, and the 2009 appraisal roll reflected that value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 22.01(a) (requiring an owner to identify, describe, give the location of, and estimate the value of the tangible personal property it owns), 25.01(a) (requiring the chief appraiser to prepare the district's appraisal records based on rendition information and \"listing all property that is taxable in the district and stating the appraised value of each\"), 25.22(a) (stating that appraisal records are submitted to the appraisal review board (ARB) for review and determination of protests), 25.24 (stating that once corrected, if necessary, and approved by the appraisal review board, the appraisal records constitute the appraisal roll for the district). Property taxes were assessed and levied accordingly.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 26.01 (requiring appraisal rolls to be submitted to the local taxing units so that taxes may be assessed accordingly).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon receiving the tax bill, Sebastian called on Jurica to assist in getting ownership changed on the appraisal roll. Jurica emailed WCAD and asserted that only 14% of the grain rendered was actually owned by Sebastian. In his email, Jurica told WCAD that Sebastian \"mistakenly thought the Freeport exemption exempted all the taxes which is why they did not distinguish ownership on the rendition.\" Sebastian's controller, who was responsible for coordinating the rendition of Sebastian's grain inventory, stated in affidavit evidence admitted at trial that it was her practice to render all grain in Sebastian's possession, even if Sebastian did not believe it was the actual owner of the grain. On Sebastian's behalf, Jurica filed a motion to correct ownership pursuant to section 25.25(c) of the Property Tax Code, asserting that 86% of the grain Sebastian had rendered was actually sold to DeBruce in 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25.25(c)(4) (allowing an ARB, on motion of the chief appraiser or a property owner, to direct changes in the appraisal roll to correct an error in which property is shown as owned by a person\n   who did not own the property on January 1 of that tax year). In support of the motion, Jurica produced four purchase contracts indicating that Sebastian had sold the grain at issue, a total of 1,340,000 bushels, to DeBruce prior to January 1, 2009. Each contract was titled \"Purchase Contract Confirmation,\" and each was dated 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   All four contracts provided the shipment period to be during the year 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After filing the section 25.25(c) motion, Jurica called WCAD's chief appraiser to ask if he had received the motion and to inquire as to his position or response. The chief appraiser told Jurica that he had received the motion and that he would make the requested change. Jurica stated in his affidavit, \"At that point, it was clear we had reached an agreement on the Section 25.25 Motion to Correct Ownership that I had filed.\" Because the dispute had been resolved, a hearing before the Willacy County Appraisal Review Board (WCARB) was never scheduled or conducted on the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25.25(e) (providing that a party bringing a section 25.25(c) motion is entitled to request a hearing and a determination by the ARB if the chief appraiser and property owner do not agree to the correction before the 15th day after the motion is filed). Based on this phone call, Sebastian asserts that, with Jurica acting as its agent, it entered into a binding agreement with the chief appraiser under section 1.111(e) of the Property Tax Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.111(e). Under that section, \"[a]n agreement between a property owner or the owner's agent and the chief appraiser is final if the agreement relates to a matter ... which may be corrected under Section 25.25 or on which a motion for correction under that section has been filed but not determined by the board.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The chief appraiser changed the appraisal roll to reflect DeBruce as the grain owner, and Sebastian received a tax refund as a result of this correction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DeBruce then protested the corrected appraisal roll and resulting tax assessment, also asserting non-ownership of much of the disputed grain. It argued that legal title and ownership of the grain were tied to shipment; thus, it owned only the portion of the grain that had been shipped as of January 1, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support, DeBruce relied on the purchase contracts produced by Sebastian, which indicate the parties' agreement to follow the National Grain and Feed Association Rules (NGFA Rules) in the event of a dispute. Rule 6 of the NGFA Rules provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Title, as well as risk of loss and/or damage, passes to the Buyer as follows: (A) On f.o.b. origin or f.o.b. basing point contracts, at the time and place of shipment. The time of shipment is the moment that the carrier accepts the appropriate shipping document.... (B) On delivered contracts: ... By truck, upon arrival at the Buyer's final destination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   NAT'L GRAIN &amp; FEED ASS'N, NGFA GRAIN TRADE RULES , Rule 6 (2017). Three of the four contracts are designated f.o.b. contracts, so under Rule 6, title would pass upon shipping. The fourth is a delivered contract-designated DEL-so under the same rule, title would pass upon arrival at the final destination. DeBruce produced evidence that, notwithstanding the shipping dates listed on the contracts (which indicated that the grain was to be shipped\n   in 2008), the grain was actually shipped to DeBruce for resale on various dates in January 2009, the first being January 5. Additionally, grain under two of the contracts-totaling 808,797 bushels-was never delivered and those orders were canceled. WCAD concluded that DeBruce did not own the grain on January 1, 2009, and the chief appraiser corrected the appraisal roll pursuant to Property Tax Code section 25.25(b) to again reflect Sebastian as the owner of the grain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. TAX CODE \u00a7 25.25(b) (allowing the chief appraiser to change the appraisal roll to correct a determination of ownership under certain circumstances).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sebastian protested the chief appraiser's correction, arguing that WCAD exceeded its authority under section 25.25(b). The statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The chief appraiser may change the appraisal roll at any time to correct a name or address, a\n   <em>\n    determination of ownership\n   </em>\n   , a description of property, multiple appraisals of a property, an erroneous denial or cancellation of any exemption authorized by Section 11.13 if the applicant or recipient is disabled or is 65 or older or an exemption authorized by Section 11.13(q), 11.131, or 11.22, or a clerical error or other inaccuracy as prescribed by board rule\n   <em>\n    that does not increase the amount of tax liability\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Sebastian argued before the WCARB that the statute does not allow WCAD to change a determination of ownership if doing so would increase the tax liability of an individual property owner-here, Sebastian. The record in this case does not contain a record of the WCARB hearing; however WCAD alleges that at the hearing, DeBruce presented evidence that it did not own the grain on January 1, 2009, but Sebastian did not provide any evidence of non-ownership. The WCARB determined that DeBruce's representation of non-ownership was correct and upheld the chief appraiser's authority to correct ownership under section 25.25(b). It issued orders allocating the value of the disputed grain between Sebastian and DeBruce based on their respective ownership on January 1, as determined by the shipping dates. Thus, under the WCARB's order, Sebastian owned 69.794% of the disputed grain, valued at $1,390,064, and DeBruce owned 30.206%, valued at $601,605.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sebastian appealed to the district court, reasserting its argument that WCAD lacked authority under section 25.25(b) to change the ownership on the appraisal roll because such a change increased Sebastian's tax liability.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 42.01 (outlining a property owner's right to appeal an order of the ARB to district court). Sebastian also argued that when WCAD agreed over the phone with Jurica to change the appraisal roll to reflect DeBruce as the owner of the grain, WCAD entered into a binding agreement under section 1.111(e) that was final and precluded both any subsequent determinations as to ownership by the chief appraiser or WCARB and judicial review of the matter. WCAD did not deny that there was such an agreement, but it asserted as an affirmative defense that the agreement resulted from Sebastian's fraudulent misrepresentations that it did not own the property, and that Sebastian should not benefit from that agreement. Specifically, WCAD asserted that Sebastian's section 25.25(c) motion to correct ownership of the grain was false, misleading, and/or fraudulent because Sebastian knew or should have known with the exercise of due diligence that it owned the grain as of January 1, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While Sebastian's appeal of the WCARB decision was pending in the district court, WCAD sought discovery from Sebastian related to the question of ownership of the\n   grain at issue here. The discovery issue was ultimately presented to the court of appeals, which granted mandamus relief.\n   <em>\n    In re Willacy Cty.

The parties argue about both the application and the meaning of the restrictive clause-\"that does not increase the amount of tax liability.\" Sebastian argues that the restriction attaches to each correction permitted under the statute, and that the plain language of the provision prohibits the chief appraiser from making any of the listed corrections if doing so would increase\n   <em>\n    an individual's\n   </em>\n   tax liability.

WCAD argues that the restrictive language attaches only to the phrase immediately preceding it, meaning that only a correction of a \"clerical error or other inaccuracy as prescribed by board rule\" is subject to the restriction. Moreover, WCAD asserts that the disputed language properly refers to\n   <em>\n    net\n   </em>\n   tax liability-that is, the taxes assessed against a specific piece of property.

Application of the Restrictive Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The parties rely on different canons of statutory construction recognized by this Court to advance their respective positions as to the restrictive clause's application. Sebastian relies on the series-qualifier canon, which provides that \"when there\n   is a straightforward, parallel construction that involves all nouns or verbs in a series, a prepositive or postpositive modifier normally applies to the entire series.\"\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v.

Thus, a property owner should make sure that the appraisal district records accurately reflect the owner's name, address, and property. In the case of tangible personal property, when a property owner files its rendition, the owner ensures that the appraisal district has its name, address, and opinion of the property's value on file.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315425\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/363/276/#p285\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 22.01(a) (requiring a rendition of \"all tangible personal property used for the production of income that the person owns,\" which must include the name and address of the property owner). When a property owner does not ensure that the appraisal district records correctly lists its name, address, and property, inaccuracies on the appraisal roll and tax roll may result. Such inaccuracies do not relieve the property owner of its tax liability; rather, under the Property Tax Code, the property owner is liable for the taxes on property it owns, even if it does not receive a tax bill or if the tax bill goes to another who is incorrectly listed as the owner. In other words, ownership gives rise to tax liability, and the appraisal roll and tax roll merely reflect such ownership-they do not establish ownership or create tax liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Turning our attention back to section 25.25 and the Property Tax Code's provisions allowing corrections of appraisal rolls to reflect ownership, of course we do not read the restrictive language in section 25.25(b) as having no meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TIC Energy &amp; Chem., Inc. v.

However, we disagree with Sebastian's contention that \"does not increase the amount of tax liability\" means \"does not increase the amount of anyone's tax bill.\" Under the Property Tax Code, the actual property owner bears personal responsibility for paying taxes on property it owns, and tax liability exists even if an error in the appraisal roll or tax roll results in the property owner not receiving a tax bill. Consistent with our analysis of the Property Tax Code, we read the restriction against increasing \"the amount of tax liability\" as\n   referring to an increase in the appraised value of that property that would increase the corresponding tax liability attached to the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A correction under section 25.25 as to the appraisal roll's reflection of property ownership will certainly affect the taxing units' expectation of who will pay the tax bill, but it does not increase, or even affect, the tax liability for that property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. TAX CODE \u00a7\u00a7 25.02, 31.01, 31.02, 32.07.

Property taxes are tied to property, and property-tax liability arises out of actual property ownership, not the appraisal roll and tax roll reflection of ownership, which may be inaccurate when a property owner has not ensured that the appraisal district records accurately list its name and address. Simply put, tax liability exists independently of the appraisal roll or tax bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In this case, WCAD ultimately determined that Sebastian, not DeBruce, was the owner of the personal property at issue based on the NGFA rules incorporated into the sales contracts. Both the WCARB and the district court agreed. The chief appraiser's correction under section 25.25(b) did not change the value of the grain; it merely attributed ownership of that same-valued grain back to Sebastian. That correction, of course, resulted in the taxing units' expectation that Sebastian, and not DeBruce, would pay the taxes due on the grain. And it likely meant that DeBruce was entitled to a refund of the property taxes it paid under protest, pending resolution of its challenge to the section 25.25(c) ownership change.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. TAX CODE \u00a7 31.071 (providing for conditional payment before delinquency date for property taxes under protest or challenge, and for refund of taxes not owed at the conclusion of protest). But under the Property Tax Code, WCAD's correction had no effect on tax liability-if Sebastian was indeed the owner on January 1, Sebastian was liable for property taxes regardless of whose name appeared on the appraisal roll or the tax bill. Therefore, we hold that WCAD acted within its authority to correct the ownership of grain under section 25.25(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reverse the court of appeals' holding on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This, of course, implicates the issue of who actually owned the property on January 1, 2009 and is liable for the property taxes on the grain. Sebastian argues that DeBruce owned the grain and is therefore liable for the taxes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Its primary\n   argument on this issue is that DeBruce paid storage fees on the grain and would not have done so if it did not own the grain. DeBruce, who is not a party to this proceeding, indicated to WCAD that the NGFA rules, incorporated into the sales contracts, dictate that title did not pass until shipment, meaning that Sebastian had title on January 1, the date for determining tax liability. The district court based its factual finding that Sebastian owned the grain on those rules. Sebastian counters that title is not the same as ownership, and even if DeBruce did not hold legal title to the grain, it held equitable title. Generally, equitable title has been considered sufficient to establish ownership for property tax purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AHF-Arbors at Huntsville I, LLC v. Walker Cty.

Therefore, although we find it curious that the Legislature would afford oral, unverifiable agreements such finality, we are inclined to agree with the courts of appeals that have held that these agreements need not be in writing. Here, Sebastian alleges-and WCAD does not dispute-that a section 1.111(e) agreement arose out of the phone conversation between Jurica and the chief appraiser. Jurica testified in his affidavit, \"At that point, it was clear we had reached an agreement on the Section 25.25 Motion to Correct Ownership that I had filed.\" Accordingly, the oral agreement between the parties in this case may be sufficient to establish a section 1.111(e) agreement, assuming\n   the agreement was made by a proper party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   With that said, the plain language of section 1.111(e) requires that agreements afforded finality under the statute must be between a property owner and the chief appraiser. We note that if the Legislature had intended to accord such finality to agreements between the chief appraiser and the person or entity listed as the owner on the appraisal roll, or some other person, it could have so provided, but the Legislature chose instead to limit such agreements to the \"property owner.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   TEX. TAX CODE \u00a7\u00a7 26.1125(b) (referring to \"the person in whose name the property is listed on the tax roll\"), 33.04(a) (referring to \"each person whose name appears on the current delinquent tax roll\"), 41.44(d) (identifying \"a person claiming an ownership interest in the property even if that person is not listed on the appraisal records as an owner of the property\"). It should go without saying that if Sebastian was not the property owner, then it, by definition, lacked the authority to make an agreement under section 1.111(e). To be clear, nothing in the statute or our public policy prevents a non-owner of property from agreeing with the chief appraiser to change the appraisal rolls to reflect that the non-owner in fact does not own the property. However, such an agreement would not arise under section 1.111(e), and therefore would be subject to review by the ARB or a judicial body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Even if Sebastian were the owner of the grain at issue, a question the court of appeals must consider on remand, the situation is nuanced under these facts-the very nature of the agreement was to establish that Sebastian was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the owner of the grain. In other words, Sebastian purports to be the property owner for purposes of authority to enter into a section 1.111(e) agreement, while at the same time claiming it does not own the property for purposes of the substance of that agreement and for purposes of tax liability. This raises the question of whether estoppel or quasi-estoppel may preclude Sebastian from entering into an agreement under section 1.111(e) based on its representations that it was not the property owner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Quasi-estoppel precludes a party from asserting, to another's disadvantage, a right inconsistent with a position previously taken. The doctrine applies when it would be unconscionable to allow a person to maintain a position inconsistent with one to which he acquiesced, or from which he accepted a benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    Samson Expl., LLC v.

In determining whether the agreement in this case constitutes an agreement under section 1.111(e), the court of appeals on remand should consider whether Sebastian-if it in fact owned the grain at issue and therefore was a proper party to enter a section 1.111(e) agreement-is estopped from entering into a section 1.111(e) agreement based on its assertion that it was not the owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To the extent that there was an otherwise valid agreement under section 1.111(e), we look then to the substance of the agreement. Section 1.111(e) agreements are limited in scope to those relating to matters:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (1) which may be protested to the appraisal review board or on which a protest has been filed but not determined by the board; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (2) which may be corrected under Section 25.25 or on which a motion for correction under that section has been filed but not determined by the board.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   TEX. TAX CODE \u00a7 1.111(e). Only the second provision is at issue here. If there was an agreement under section 1.111(e), it was to resolve Sebastian's motion to correct ownership brought under section 25.25(c), which asserted, \"The purchase contract confirmations clearly establish that on January 1, 2009, 86% or the grain inventory was owned by De[B]ruce and 14% of the inventory was owned by Sebastian Cotton and Grain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We have already determined that a property owner's tax liability exists independently of the appraisal roll or tax bill and arises out of actual ownership. As an appointed administrator, the chief appraiser lacks authority to establish ownership as a legal matter.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385950\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/521/766/#p778\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6.05(c) (\"The chief appraiser is the chief administrator of the appraisal office.

To the extent that the parties argue otherwise in this case, we hold that the agreement at issue did not resolve whether Sebastian or DeBruce actually owned the grain. Rather, the substance of the agreement was that Sebastian's section 25.25(c) motion would be resolved by the chief appraiser's correction of the appraisal roll to reflect DeBruce as the owner based on Sebastian's representation, thus avoiding an evidentiary hearing before the WCARB. While this correction did not determine actual ownership as a legal matter, it did alter the taxing unit's expectation of who was liable for payment, resulting in Sebastian receiving a refund for taxes paid under protest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Supposing there was a valid agreement under section 1.111(e) by which Sebastian and the chief appraiser agreed to an appraisal-roll correction reflecting that Sebastian was not the owner of the grain on January 1, 2009, we also consider whether such an agreement may be overcome by fraud. As a preliminary matter, Sebastian contests whether the issue of fraud was properly before the district court. Specifically, Sebastian argues that WCAD's allegation of fraud was waived because it did not raise it before the WCARB and because it did not avail itself\n   of the Property Tax Code's procedures for pursuing a fraud claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

The court of appeals' analysis on this issue is correct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Sebastian is hybridizing the problems of issue preservation (i.e., that an appealing party must bring an argument to the attention of the trial court in order for an appellate court to later consider it) and exhaustion of administrative remedies (i.e., a party must file and go through an administrative determination on their claim before filing suit in district court).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787024\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/492/824/#p835\">\n    492 S.W.3d at 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to preservation, WCAD's allegation of fraud is not waived by its failure to raise it before the WCARB. An appeal of an ARB determination to the district court is a trial de novo, and the district court \"shall try all issues of fact and law raised by the pleadings in the manner applicable to civil suits generally.\" TEX. TAX CODE \u00a7 42.23(a).

Generally, an affirmative defense is waived if not raised in a defendant's responsive pleading.\n   <em>\n    Shoemake v.

R. CIV. P. 94 ). WCAD raised the affirmative defense, however, by pleading fraud in its answer to Sebastian's petition for review before the district court. As an affirmative defense to the section 1.111(e) agreement, WCAD had no obligation to raise fraud prior to Sebastian raising the finality of the section 1.111(e) agreement; therefore, it did not waive the issue of fraud by failing to raise it sooner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Sebastian argues that WCAD failed to exhaust its administrative remedies by not pursuing a fraud claim under section 25.21 or section 22.29 of the Property Tax Code. We disagree. Section 25.21 allows the chief appraiser to appraise and levy taxes on property that was omitted from an appraisal roll. TEX. TAX CODE \u00a7 25.21. This section \"provides a remedy for an erroneous appraisal based on property that escaped taxation because of a void assessment arising from taxpayer fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Beck &amp; Masten Pontiac-GMC, Inc. v.

App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, writ denied). However, here the property was not omitted from the tax rolls; it was simply listed with a potentially wrong owner. This provision is thus inapplicable where the error can be corrected under section 25.25(b). Section 22.29 is similarly inapplicable. This section provides a remedy for taxpayer fraud under which a chief appraiser may impose a penalty if it is determined by a court that \"the person filed a false statement or report with the intent to commit fraud or to evade the tax.\" TEX. TAX CODE \u00a7 22.29(a)(1). However,\n   it does not provide a mechanism for correcting the inaccuracies that result from the fraud. Here, WCAD has not sought to pursue a penalty under section 22.29.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   And given that fraud was raised only as an affirmative defense and not as a cause of action, there was no need for WCAD to pursue a remedy under section 22.29 when it could simply correct the appraisal roll under section 25.25(b). Therefore, WCAD did not fail to exhaust its administrative remedies with regards to fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Having determined that fraud was properly before the district court, we turn to the implications of that court's factual findings of fraud.
