INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this dual-office-holding case, Appellants City of Forest Hill and Brigette Mathis appeal a final declaratory judgment with permanent injunction and attorney's fees in favor of Appellee Michielle Benson,\n   in her official capacity and individually. The parties primarily dispute which of two election-code provisions applied after the Attorney General opined that Benson's dual roles were incompatible- election code section 141.033, in which case Benson would retain the office that she applied for first (Forest Hill City Council, Place 3), or election code section 201.025, in which case Benson would retain the office that she was sworn into second (Forest Hill Library Board of Trustees, Place 5).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20141.033\">\n    Tex.

The trial court sided with Benson and applied section 141.033.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellants argue that the trial court erred by premising its declaratory relief on section 141.033 because the validity of Benson's applications became moot once she was elected and because section 201.025 applies. We conclude and hold that Appellants' mootness argument is based on an inapposite statute and that section 201.025 has no application on these facts. Because Appellants' remaining two issues challenging the injunctive relief and attorney's fees are contingent upon a favorable outcome on their first issue, we will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The City is a duly-organized municipality governed by a seven-member city council that is elected at-large. Governed by a board of trustees, the City's public library is a library district established pursuant to an election under chapter 326 of the local government code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 22, 2016, Benson signed an application for a place on the May 7, 2016 ballot for Place 3 of the Forest Hill City Council and an application for a place on the same ballot for Place 5 of the Forest Hill Library Board of Trustees. The City Secretary signed that she received both applications on February 17, 2016. Benson filed the city-council application before she filed the library-board application. The City did not prohibit Benson from running for both offices, her name subsequently appeared on the ballot as a candidate for both offices, and she was elected to both offices. On May 17, 2016, Benson took the oath of office for both positions; she was sworn in first as a city-council member and second as a library-board trustee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At its meeting on June 7, 2016, the city council expressed concern whether Benson could legally serve in both offices at the same time. On Benson's motion, the city council decided to seek an opinion from the Attorney General on the propriety of Benson's serving in both offices simultaneously.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 3, 2017, the Attorney General issued an opinion in which he concluded that given the potential for conflict between the City and the library district over each entity's presumed effort to maximize its share of the statutorily-limited 2% sales and use tax, the offices of city-council member and library-district trustee are incompatible under the common-law doctrine of conflicting-loyalties incompatibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Att'y Gen. Op. No. KP-0125 (2017). Regarding Benson's status, the Attorney General noted that \"qualification for and acceptance of a second incompatible office operates as an automatic resignation from the first\" and, therefore, that \"in qualifying for the second office of library district trustee, [Benson had] effectively resigned from the office of city council.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20141.033\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The opinion mentioned neither election code section 141.033 nor section 201.025.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After receiving the Attorney General's opinion, the city council noticed a special meeting for January 6, 2017, to address the opinion. Benson requested that the meeting be postponed until she returned to town, but it proceeded in her absence, and the city council voted to accept Benson's deemed resignation from the city council and to appoint Appellant Brigette Mathis to fill the vacancy created by the resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to a claim for a violation of the Texas Open Meetings Act and a request for injunctive relief, Benson sued Appellants for a declaration that the City's purported acceptance of her \"effective resignation\" was null and void, that she had never resigned, and that she is the \"legally elected and qualified incumbent in the office of City Council, Place 3, City of Forest Hill Texas.\" The trial court temporarily enjoined the City from giving effect to the city council's actions at the meeting on January 6, 2017, and after a bench trial, it signed a first amended final judgment ordering the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1. The action by the City Council of the Defendant City of Forest Hill, Texas on January 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2017, declaring that Plaintiff Benson \"effectively resigned\" from the City was and is null and void, ab initio;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2. The action by the City Council and Defendant City of Forest Hill on January 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2017 in appointing Defendant Brigette Mathis as successor to Plaintiff Benson's Council Position, Place 3, was and is null and void, ab initio[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court also permanently enjoined the City from interfering with Benson's occupation of Place 3 of the city council, awarded Benson attorney's fees, and issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, which included the following conclusions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1. Texas Election Code Section 141.033 titled\n   <em>\n    Filing Applications for More than One Office Prohibited\n   </em>\n   . Specifically it states, \"(a) A candidate may not file applications for a place on the ballot [for two or more offices] that are not permitted by law to be held by the same person. (b) If a person files more than one application for a place on a ballot in violation of [this] section, each application filed subsequent to the first one is invalid.\" V.T.C.A. Election Code Section 141.033 (a) and (b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   2. The undisputed evidence is that Dr. Benson filed the application for City Council first. Therefore, the Office of City Council, Place 3, was the only office for which Dr. Benson properly filed, elected, and took an oath to serve.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   3. Under that section, her application for election to the Library Board, her second filing, was invalid, and she was never properly elected to the Library Board[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   4. Dr. Benson never filed a proper application for a place on the ballot for the Library Board, so she does not hold, never has properly held, that position. Incompatibility of office does not exist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   5. Defendants\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   '\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   reliance on Election Code Section 201.025... is unavailing....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   6. Neither the Attorney General's Opinion nor Defendants' argument based on Section 201.025 address the validity of Benson's application for the Library Board, her second application. Section 141.033 must be considered before the issue of the post-election oath of office should be considered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   7. The action by the City Council ... on January 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 201[7] declaring that Plaintiff Benson had \"effectively resigned\" from the City Council was and is null and void, ab initio.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   8. The Action by the City Council of Defendant City on January 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2017 in appointing Defendant Brigette Mathis as successor to Plaintiff Benson's Council position, Place 3, was and is null and void, ab initio.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Appellants then perfected this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DECLARATORY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Appellants argue in their first issue that the trial court misinterpreted the election code by declaring, consistent with election code section 141.033, that Benson's second-filed application for library-board trustee was invalid because under election code section 141.034, the validity of Benson's application for that position could have only been questioned before the election. Because no such question was timely raised until after Benson had assumed the position, Appellants posit that any argument relating to the validity of her application is moot. Appellants further contend that because Benson was elected and sworn into both offices, the trial court should have applied election code section 201.025 and the common-law doctrine of incompatibility to conclude that Benson effectively resigned her city-council position once she was sworn into the trustee position. Benson responds that neither section 141.034 nor section 201.025 have any application under the facts here. Guided by our well-established rules of statutory construction, we agree with Benson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act generally permits a person who is interested under a deed or other contract, or whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute or contract, to obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2037.004\">\n    Tex.

There are several reasons why section 141.034 is inapposite and did not render the validity of Benson's library-board application moot once the election took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, the statute speaks to application challenges, but this cause involves no challenge to an application. Instead, it involves Benson's challenge to the city council's actions on January 6, 2017, and the trial court's decision to apply section 141.033 as a remedy in light of the Attorney General's uncontested incompatibility determination. The trial court's decision to apply section 141.033 did not somehow transform this cause into an application challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, the time limitation contained in section 141.034(a) covers application challenges involving form, content, and procedure, but this cause has nothing to do with the form, content, or procedure of Benson's\n   library-board application, nor do Appellants even so argue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Third, section 141.033 speaks to a very specific factual situation that section 141.034 simply does not. Issues of form, content, and procedure can be resolved easily, and expediently, by cross-referencing election code section 141.031(a), which sets out in detail the form, content, and procedure required for an application.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20141.033\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 141.031(a) (West Supp. 2017). By contrast, section 141.033 addresses the invalidity of an application that a person submits for a place on the ballot for an office that the person is \"not permitted by law\" to hold-a potentially challenging and intricate inquiry that, in all likelihood, will often require more than simply referencing a statutory checklist, as this case aptly demonstrates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20141.033\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 141.033(b). The legislature's decision to include a time limitation in section 141.034(a), but not in section 141.033, implicitly recognizes this reality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Appellants argue that section 141.034(a)\"ensures that there is finality in the election process,\" and while we agree, we cannot ignore that the statute ensures finality for only three specific types of application defects, none of which are implicated here. We also cannot ignore that in the very same statute, the legislature expressly\n   <em>\n    excluded\n   </em>\n   issues involving a candidate's eligibility from section 141.034(a) 's time bar, indicating an intent to implement time constraints for some, but not all, application-related matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Unlike the facts in this case, the caselaw that Appellants direct us to involved a city secretary's rejection of an application and petition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Crenshaw\n   </em>\n   , No. 05-17-00330-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201292013\">\n    2017 WL 1292013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Tex.

Response to the dissent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The dissent opines that section 141.033 is no more applicable on these facts than section 141.034 is because no \"law\"-as that term is used in section 141.033(a)(1) -prohibited Benson from simultaneously holding both the city-council and library-district-trustee positions when she filed her ballot applications. This argument is nowhere to be found in the City's briefing, a reality that the dissent expressly acknowledges in its footnote 3-\"I recognize that the City did not argue the inapplicability of section 141.033 on this basis.\" Nor can we agree that a de novo standard of review compels us to review unassigned error. The dissent laments that our responsive analysis leaves an \"analytical hole explaining why section\n   <em>\n    141.033\n   </em>\n   applies,\" but the City presumably does not share the same concern, judging by its conspicuous decision to hinge its analysis on the applicability of section 141.034, rather than on the inapplicability of section 141.033(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The dissent's argument also suffers from an unrealistic expectation of specificity. It cites Texas constitution article XVI, section 40 as an example of a \"law\" that precludes someone from holding two given offices (\"No person shall hold or exercise at the same time, more than one civil office of emolument....\" Tex. Const. art. XVI, section 40 (a) ), but it then departs from the relatively low level of specificity with which the provision is understandably drafted and concludes that in this case, no\n   \"law\" prohibited Benson from simultaneously holding the specific positions of city-council member and library-district trustee. By construing the term \"law\" so narrowly, and with such a high degree of specificity, the dissent effectively guarantees the outcome that it seeks to reach, impliedly placing upon the legislature the heavy burden of crafting an extensive list of positions that are prohibited from being held simultaneously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In any event, the plain and ordinary meaning of the undefined term \"law,\" as it is used in section 141.033(a)(1), is certainly broad enough to encompass not only \"some statute, constitutional provision, rule, ordinance, or regulation,\" as the dissent construes the term, but also the Texas common law, which generally remains a viable source of authority absent express statutory abrogation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cash Am. Int'l, Inc. v. Bennett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11075640\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/35/12/#p16\">\n    35 S.W.3d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16 (Tex. 2000). Impliedly recognizing this-and likely explaining why the City chose not to focus its first issue on section 141.033(a)(1) 's term \"law\"-neither side contests that the common law prohibited Benson from simultaneously holding both positions; instead, they dispute the remedy to be applied under the unique facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As for our section 201.025 analysis, the dissent reasons that \"[n]either the statute nor the common law suggests that one must have been in office for some minimum time period before the effective-resignation principle comes into play,\" but we can reasonably conclude that both do. We showed above that the dispositive caselaw applying the common-law doctrine of conflicting-loyalties incompatibility has calculated the timeframe between when an officer qualifies for the first office and when she qualifies for the second office in increments of no less than a day-not also in hours, minutes, or seconds.

The City processed her applications that day and in that sequence, and her name appeared on the May 7, 2016 ballot for each position. She won both\n   races and on May 17 took oaths of office for both positions in the same sequence-that is, she was first sworn in as a city-council member and then as a library-board trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To decide which position Benson actually held, the majority relies on section 141.033 of the Texas Election Code and concludes that the chronological order in which Benson submitted her applications controls over that in which she took her oaths of office and that she is thus rightly a city-council member. But to me, applying section 141.033 makes little sense in this situation; more logical is to use the common-law principles of incompatibility and effective resignation from which election code section 201.025 was derived. That was how the Texas Attorney General looked at it when-after Benson had been sworn in and had ascended to both offices-he was asked to opine on whether she could simultaneously sit on the city council and the library board and, if not, which position she could properly hold. Under the A.G.'s analysis, that position was library-board trustee. Tex. Att'y Gen. Op. No. KP-0125 (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    Why section 141.033 doesn't work here.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Section 141.033 is designed to prevent a candidate from applying for more than one place on a single ballot if the multiple offices the candidate wishes to seek \"are not permitted\n   <em>\n    by law\n   </em>\n   to be held by the same person.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20141.033\">\n    Tex.

Although the code does not explain what \"not permitted by law\" means, I take the phrase in its commonplace sense: that some statute, constitutional provision, rule, ordinance, or regulation precludes someone from holding two given offices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A basic example of this can be found in the Texas Constitution, which has an entire section within article 16 that is titled \"Holding more than one office; exceptions; right to vote.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Const. art. XVI, \u00a7 40. There, we see that the \"law\"-in the form of the constitution-provides that \"[n]o person shall hold or exercise at the same time, more than one civil office of emolument,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   with certain exceptions following.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20141.033\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As the City's request-sent through the Tarrant County District Attorney's office-for an Attorney General opinion correctly stated, neither the council nor the board position is \"one of emolument,\" and the city charter does not expressly prohibit holding a council position and a board position simultaneously. Indeed, the very fact that the City sought an opinion about\n   whether Benson's two offices conflicted under the common-law doctrine of incompatibility shows that no \"law\" prohibited her from holding them both when she presented her ballot applications in February 2016. The request's summary makes this clear:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   It seems\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   in the current situation that the duties of the two offices\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   address overlapping issues. For example: water and sanitary sewer service to the library; acquisition of land for the library; regulation by the city of land owned by the library; and, as previously stated, contracting for election services. Are the two positions incompatible?

As the A.G. concluded, the result was that she impliedly resigned from the city council.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Att'y Gen. Op. KP-0125 (2017). The majority believes that applying section 201.025 or the common law from which it was derived would lead to absurd results because Benson took both oaths on the same day, saying that \"it cannot be presumed that Benson intended to resign her city-council position on the very same day that she took the oath of office for that position.\" The same could be said, of course, if Benson had qualified for the library-board position the next day, or the next week, or the next month, for we can safely say from the parties' pleadings and positions that Benson\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   intended to resign from the city council; it was clearly the position she preferred to hold once the A.G. opined that she could not hold both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Neither the statute nor the common law suggests that one must have been in office for some minimum time period before the effective-resignation principle comes into play. We know from at least one case that 24 hours was long enough for someone to have been an officer before qualifying for another office the next day and thus effectively resigning from the previous day's office.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Kingsbury v. Brinkerhoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2202550\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tex/66/45/#p46\">\n    66 Tex. 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20S.W.%20109\">\n    17 S.W. 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110 (1886) (holding that city secretary had effectively resigned that office by taking the oath for the office of recorder the day after qualifying as city secretary). I think it would be more absurd to read into the statute (or into the common-law principle) a requirement that one must have been an officeholder for at least a day, or half a day, or more than 83.7 minutes, before triggering its application when there seems no logical or textual reason to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   We live in a linear world where events necessarily occur sequentially. The legislature, and the supreme court before it, have decided that taking the oath for an incompatible office works a resignation from the first-held office without requiring that a given time elapse between the two events, and I would abide by that principle even when the second oath comes right on the heels of the first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment below and remand the attorney's-fee issue to the trial court; because the majority has affirmed the judgment, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    There is no indication in the record whether the interval between the oaths was seconds, minutes, or hours.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The city attorney forwarded the letter to the Tarrant County District Attorney, who forwarded it to the Attorney General.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    In its amended final judgment, the trial court stated that it agreed with the Attorney General's opinion that a conflict existed between Benson's two offices. Benson opines similarly in her brief, acknowledging that the Attorney General's opinion \"is correct as to incompatibility.\" But the judgment also states that \"the City Council position was the only office for which [Benson] was properly filed and elected to serve. With Plaintiff only being properly elected to one office, there is no conflict and no incompatibility.\" Conclusion of law number 4 states the same in substantially similar terms, including that \"[i]ncompatibility of office does not exist.\" The statements are seemingly contradictory but, we think, also reconcilable. Benson and the trial court appear to have two different things in mind when they generally allude to incompatibility. There is no dispute that a conflict existed when Benson held the two offices. However, the trial court determined, and Benson contends on appeal, that she never properly held the trustee position because she never filed a valid application for that office. Under that scenario, so goes the reasoning, there is no incompatibility. Whatever the case, Appellants raise no complaint about the statements.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Appellants do not expressly challenge any of the trial court's conclusions of law, but judging by their arguments, we assume that they challenge conclusions 2-8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    There is no question that the election for both offices occurred on the same day.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    For a discourse on the difference between\n    <em>\n     the law\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     a law\n    </em>\n    , and how the former is generally used to refer to the body of jurisprudence that interprets but does not make \"law,\"\n    <em>\n     see Law\n    </em>\n    , Garner's Dictionary of Legal Usage (3d ed. 2011). Because neither party argues that some binding judicial precedent resolved the \"which-office\" conundrum, it is not necessary to parse and prioritize the various sources of law generally; suffice it to say that not even the trial court's holding would constitute \"law\" as the word is used in section 141.033(a)(1), because trial-court decisions \"have no precedential effect.\"\n    <em>\n     In re McReynolds\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12180199\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/502/884/#p888\">\n     502 S.W.3d 884\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 888 (Tex.

The City instead focused its argument on the deadline for challenging ballot applications that is found in section 141.034 and contended that the trial court essentially allowed a post-election challenge to a ballot application when section 141.034 's time limits made such a challenge moot. That section is obviously designed to ensure a degree of certainty that ballots are accurate and do not have candidates erroneously appearing on or left off them.
