Yeary, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n </summary>\n <opinion id=\"p-8\">\n  Terroristic Threat is usually a Class B misdemeanor, but the offense is Class A misdemeanor \"if the offense is committed against a public servant.\" Scott Niles, a firefighter, was charged by information with two counts of the Class A version for threatening his fellow firefighters. He was arraigned, tried, convicted, and sentenced on the two Class A counts. But the jury charges had tracked the Class B misdemeanor version of the crime; the jury was not asked if the terroristic threats were against public servants. Niles raised an \"illegal sentence\" claim on direct appeal. The State conceded that the jury charges only authorized convictions for Class B Terroristic Threat. The court of appeals reformed the judgments to convictions for Class B misdemeanors and remanded for re-sentencing in the Class B range.\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  The question here is whether the court of appeals erred in doing so. We hold that it did. The failure to include a jury instruction on an element of an offense included within the charging instrument amounts to jury charge error subject to a harm analysis. We remand the case to the court of appeals to determine whether Appellant suffered any harm.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  <strong>\n   Facts\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  Appellant was a Houston firefighter assigned to Fire Station 64. The firefighters were required to have an unexpired driver's license-a regular one to drive the ambulance, or \"a class B CDL\" to drive the \"heavy apparatus, the ladder trucks and the pumpers.\" They were assigned to drive an ambulance on a rotating basis, an assignment that paid extra. On April 29, 2014, Appellant was assigned to drive. But a fellow firefighter overheard him say that he did not have a driver's license and reported that to Captain Bradley Maddin. Appellant was summoned to meet with Maddin and Senior Captain Andrew Haygood. They asked for his license, and Appellant showed them his concealed handgun license, something that looks \"very similar to a Texas driver's license\" and \"said that the concealed handgun license was enough.\" But it wasn't, and Haygood ordered Appellant to assume the role of patient care for the day; he would not be driving the ambulance. He was ordered to get the appropriate driver's license before his next shift. Appellant did not take it well. Later that morning, firefighters Robert Gordon and Mark Keelen approached Appellant. Gordon said that Appellant was \"mumbling something inaudible and Firefighter Keelen asked him what's the matter. To that he responded, I'm going to start shooting people, I just need to figure out who I'm going to take out first.\"\n  <footnotemark>\n   2\n  </footnotemark>\n  Keelen elaborated.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    Niles v.

Appellant's next shift was on May 5, 2014. Once again, he talked about shooting up the station-this time to firefighter Samuel Feris.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q All right. And you were sitting there, you were reading you said, and what happened next?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A Scott came up and he was talking, but I was kind of trying to ignore him.

Haygood was concerned about his personal safety, as well as that of his firefighters.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q And why is that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A Because I know that-I know what type of firearms Firefighter Niles has. I know that he has military experience. And I know that he is-I believe he is definitely irritated with me. So I was definitely-I was definitely concerned for myself, also my other-my crew members. I was concerned for everybody.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q What specifically were you afraid he would do?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A Shoot me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q And what specifically were you afraid he would do to the other crew members?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A Shoot them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The next day Haygood called Chief Robert Gutierrez for advice, and two days later, on May 7, 2014, Haygood called Chief Casey. \"Chief Casey told me over the phone to tell Firefighter Niles to report [immediately] to his office.\" Appellant was also ordered to see Dr. Sam J. Buser, the clinical staff psychologist for the Houston Fire Department. While Appellant was absent from the station, investigators took statements from the firefighters regarding Appellant's comments. Appellant was later told not to come back to the station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Appellant was charged by information with two offenses of terroristic threat-one against firefighter Mark Keelen, and one against Capt. Haygood. The informations alleged that both were public servants, Houston Fire Department Firefighters, which made the offenses Class A misdemeanors. During voir dire, both the trial judge and the State discussed the \"public servant\" element. The prosecutor stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   I have to prove that the threat was against our complainants who are public servants. Now public servants can be firefighters, police officers, judges, etc. And you've already heard in this case our complainants are Houston Fire Department\n   firefighters. So I have to prove that they're firefighters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   During the trial, it was never an issue that Keelen and Haygood were \"public servants.\" Instead, Appellant's defense was that this was \"not a crime but a human relations issue.\" There was no imminent threat; \"When you go up the chain of command, you're talking about H.R. When you are scared for your life, you call the police.\" In response to Appellant's motion for directed verdict on the cases, the trial judge said of the \"public servant\" element, \"The Houston Department firefighter, they got that.\" The judge ultimately denied the motion for directed verdict on the cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Unfortunately, the jury charges did not ask the jury to determine whether Keelen and Haygood were public servants. Though there were separate written charges for each count, the judge read the two as a combined charge out loud. Neither the accusation nor the application paragraph included the public servant element. And the words \"public servant\" do not appear anywhere in the middle of the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In closing arguments both sides made numerous references to firefighters, but not \"public servants.\" The prosecution specifically went over the three listed elements of Class B, Terroristic Threat, with the jury, and made no mention of a public servant element. The defense did tie the job of firefighter to the serving of the public:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   And to send him back to work for two more-two-and-a-half more solid days to mingle and to be in a position to have to save members of the public. Imminent threat of serious bodily injury? No, it's not. It's not even close.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The jury convicted Appellant. Sentencing was by the judge and the sentencing hearing was very informal. The prosecution did not ask for a specific penalty other than probation with a condition of \"at least thirty days in the Harris County Jail.\" In sentencing Appellant, the judge mentioned the context of the crime and the importance of public servants.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   And I don't think you grasp how significant it is for this many people from your station where you worked to come in and testify against you. That's significant. If firefighters are anything like police officers, they stand together, and they don't turn on one another. At least I've never seen it happen. But what you were saying and doing was so disturbing, and these guys did, they turned on you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   And I hope that you are able to find employment somewhere, because we need guys who know what they are doing out there helping people. And if you want to do your community service with a volunteer fire department, that's fine by me, because I can't think of a better service to the community than being a firefighter or an emergency medical technician. I hope you haven't ruined your chances of doing that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The judge sentenced Appellant in each case to one year in jail, probated for two. These were over the Class B misdemeanor range (a term not to exceed 180 days), but within the Class A range (a term not to exceed one year). TEX. PEN. CODE \u00a7\u00a7 12.21, 12.22. The judgments also reflected that Appellant had been convicted of two counts of Class A terroristic threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On direct appeal, Appellant argued that there was\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   error in the case. \"Because the 'fact' that the complainants were public servants could raise Niles' punishment range, it had to be found by\n   the jury.\" Appellant's Br. 44 (citing\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v. New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p476\">\n    530 U.S. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 476,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p476\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p476\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) ). And because it wasn't, \"Niles is guilty only of Class B offense[s]\" and \"both sentences are illegal\" because they are outside the maximum punishment for a Class B offense. The State conceded\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   error and made the same recommendation that Appellant did, that the appellate court reform the judgments to Class B, reverse the sentences in both cause numbers, and remand for new punishment hearing. State's Br. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Not surprisingly, the court of appeals did just that. The court noted that \"the jury charges track the language of the statute for the offense of terroristic threat, a Class B misdemeanor, but fail to include any instruction on the public servant element of the offense as a Class A misdemeanor.\"\n   <em>\n    Niles,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207108248\">\n    2016 WL 7108248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10. It found that the \"the trial court erred in rendering judgments against appellant for terroristic threat as Class A misdemeanors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207108248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finding that the one year (probated for two years) sentences imposed were void and illegal, the court reformed the judgments to reflect Class B degree offenses, and reversed for a new punishment hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The State Prosecuting Attorney filed a motion for rehearing. In the motion, the State argued that \"Appellant's 'illegal sentence' claims should have been reviewed for harmless charge error as instructed by the United States Supreme Court and our Court of Criminal Appeals.\" State's Mot. 1. After asking for and receiving a response from Appellant, the motion was denied. We granted review on our own motion, to decide whether the court of appeals erred in reforming the judgments to reflect convictions for the lesser included, Class B misdemeanors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural Default\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Appellant argues that the State forfeited the claim that this case involves charge error subject to a harm analysis. Appellant points out that the State failed to object to the charge in the trial court, and did not raise the issue in the court of appeals. Instead, the State conceded that Appellant's sentence was illegal. According to Appellant, this prevents the the State Prosecuting Attorney from raising the issue for the first time in its motion for rehearing to the court of appeals or in its petition for discretionary review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   It is true that, in a case in which the State is the party appealing, the basic principle of appellate jurisprudence that points not argued at trial are deemed to be waived applies equally to the State and the defense.\n   <em>\n    McClintock v.

App. 2014). But the State was not the appealing party in this case; the trial court entered judgments for Class A misdemeanors and sentenced Appellant in the Class A range. Appellant was the appealing party in the court of appeals. Under these circumstances, we have held that the State, as the prevailing party at trial, need not raise a particular argument in favor of the trial court's ruling in a reply brief or even in a motion for rehearing (as it did here) as a predicate to later raising it in a discretionary review context.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905719\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/444/15/#p20\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

But, as discussed above, this is not an illegal sentence case. The error in this case is like that in\n   <em>\n    Neder\n   </em>\n   .

This provided Appellant with notice of the charged offenses and the ability to prepare a defense, as required by our state and federal constitutions. Like Neder, Appellant was tried before an impartial judge, under the correct standard of proof and with the assistance of counsel; a fairly selected, impartial jury was instructed to consider all of the evidence. The element of Keelen and Haygood's status as public servants was not submitted to the jury, violating Appellant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, but that error did not render Appellant's trial \"fundamentally unfair.\" That failure did not vitiate all the jury's findings, or produce consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate. The failure went unnoticed-by the parties and the judge-until Appellant brought it to the attention of the appellate court. Because that failure is subject to a harm analysis, the court of appeals erred to reform the judgments to Class B offenses without first analyzing whether the jury charge error resulted in harm. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case to the court of appeals for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Yeary, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Under Section 22.07(a)(2) of the Texas Penal Code, \"[a] person commits an offense if he threatens to commit any offense involving violence to any person or property with intent to ... place any person in fear of imminent serious bodily injury[.]\" TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 22.07(a)(2). This offense is a Class B misdemeanor. TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 22.07(c). However, the offense becomes a Class A misdemeanor if it \"is committed against a public servant.\" TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 22.07(c)(2). Although the charging instruments in these two cases alleged that the persons whom Appellant threatened were public servants, the jury charges made no mention whatsoever of that particular element, much less did they authorize the jury to make a finding in that respect. Indeed, the jury charges perfectly presented the jury with the Class B misdemeanor offenses. The jury's verdict in each of these cases reflected: \"We, the Jury, find the defendant 'Guilty.' \" The jury did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   specifically find Appellant to be guilty of the offenses as alleged in the charging instruments. By all appearances, Appellant was thus found guilty of the Class B-\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the Class A-misdemeanor offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Under these circumstances, it is not at all surprising that Appellant should argue on direct appeal that, because he was only convicted of the Class B misdemeanor, the one-year sentence imposed in the trial court's written judgment was illegal. After all, a trial court is required to enter judgment \"immediately\" upon receiving a verdict of conviction, TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 37.12, and the jury's verdicts found Appellant guilty only of-indeed,\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have found him guilty\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   of-the Class B misdemeanor offenses. The Harris County District Attorney's Office conceded this error in its reply brief on direct appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the court of appeals reformed the judgment accordingly, and remanded the cause to the trial court for re-assessment of punishment within the Class B misdemeanor range.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In a motion for rehearing in the court of appeals, the State Prosecuting Attorney [SPA] intervened for the first time to argue that the court of appeals mis-characterized the error on original submission. According to the SPA, the true nature of the error in the case was not an illegal sentence; it was a defect in the jury charge. The charge was defective in that it omitted an essential element of the Class A misdemeanor, the \"public servant\" element. Moreover, the SPA asserted, the error in the case-as so reformulated-was subject to an analysis for harm, under settled federal constitutional precedents of the United States Supreme Court, and of this Court;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it was harmless, to boot. When the court of appeals denied the motion for rehearing\n   <em>\n    sans\n   </em>\n   comment, the SPA renewed the claim in a petition for discretionary review in this Court. We refashioned the SPA's ground for review somewhat, but essentially granted discretionary review to examine the SPA's contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Now the Court accepts the SPA's argument that the issue in this case is one of jury charge error, and it remands the cause to the court of appeals \"for proceedings consistent with\" its opinion-presumably\n   to conduct a harm analysis of the federal constitutional error in the jury charge. I dissent to this reformulation of Appellant's appellate complaint on several grounds. First, I believe the federal cases upon which the SPA depends are materially distinguishable from this case. Second, the State did not preserve any objection to the jury charge-and it should be the State's obligation to object on the facts presented here, not Appellant's. And finally, even if it is appropriate to convert Appellant's point of error on appeal into a jury charge issue rather than an illegal sentence issue, Appellant should be given the latitude on remand to argue that the error was structural as a matter of state, if not federal, constitutional law. I will develop each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Neder v.

It is a question of whether Appellant may be sentenced beyond the range of punishment justified by the\n   <em>\n    only fact-findings that have been made\n   </em>\n   -by\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   entity, properly or not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   short, Appellant appropriately presented his point of error on appeal in the form of an illegal sentence claim. Such a claim may be raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have no occasion to reformulate Appellant's point of error for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that it is somehow acceptable to transform Appellant's claim into something it was not, it is unclear to me that the State is in any position to urge that transformation now. The State made no objection to the lack of the elevating element in the jury charge. The Appellant cannot reasonably have been expected to level such an objection-for all he knew, the State's failure to object manifested a deliberate abandonment of the greater offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Court observes, during his closing argument, the prosecutor did not even mention the necessity of finding the \"public servant\" element. Majority Opinion at 567. That the State later conceded that Appellant was punished beyond the statutorily authorized range is consistent with the inference of abandonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   To illustrate the anomaly of allowing the State at this late date to unilaterally alter the character of\n   <em>\n    Appellant's\n   </em>\n   point of error on appeal, consider the following thought experiment: Suppose that, following the jury's verdict in this case, the trial court took note of the fact that the charge it gave to the jury failed to authorize a finding on the \"public servant\" element, but that the verdict otherwise wholly supported a conviction for the Class B misdemeanor offense. Suppose that, in accordance with Article 37.12, the trial court therefore entered a judgment of guilt for that lesser offense. Suppose further that, unhappy with some perceived trial error in the case, Appellant appealed the conviction, and that the State, pursuant to Article 44.01(c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, then filed a cross-appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Suppose that, in that cross-appeal, the State argued that the trial court erred to enter judgment for the lesser, Class B misdemeanor offense. An appellate court would be justified, under this scenario, to reject the State's argument on the ground of procedural default-that the State failed to object to the jury charge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that case, the\n   State's attempt to convert the appellant's conviction for the lesser offense into something greater would surely fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   It seems anomalous to me, then, that we should allow the State to convert Appellant's true point of error on appeal into a claim of jury charge error\n   <em>\n    that the State did nothing within its power at trial to prevent\n   </em>\n   . It is the classic straw man-the State takes an argument it should lose and (belatedly) transforms it into an argument it thinks it can win. I would not tolerate such a transformation, at least in the absence of a trial objection from the State that the jury charge was inadequate to justify a conviction for the greater offense it sought. And I would therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   But now that the Court has (belatedly) accepted the SPA's invitation to reformulate the issue, the Appellant should at least be permitted to argue, on remand, that the jury charge did not simply violate the federal constitution-it violated the Texas Constitution as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, he should even be allowed to claim, in supplemental briefing, that this charge error should not be regarded as subject to a harmless error analysis\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   , under principles of our own constitution. Unlike the Sixth Amendment, Article I, Section 15, of the Texas Constitution proclaims that \"[t]he right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is ample room for argument that the failure of the jury to render a verdict that passed on every element necessary to constitute the offense that is reflected in the judgment is \"structural\" error for state constitutional purposes, and not subject to a harm analysis at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the right to a jury trial is a \"waiver-only\" right,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Appellant did nothing to waive his right to have the jury pass on every element necessary to constitute the offense reflected in the judgment. The court of appeals may well conclude that Appellant's state constitutional right to a jury trial was denied him; that this error was not subject to a harm analysis; and that he is entitled to an entirely new trial, not just a new punishment proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   But this assumes that the Court is correct to reformulate the issue at all. Because I would simply affirm the court of appeals' judgment, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Appellant later turned over at least eleven guns, among them a TEC-9 with a barrel extension (SE 36); a Marlin lever action rifle, caliber 2520 (SE 33); a Mauser Action hunting rifle (SE 34); a Smith and Wesson AR-15 (SE 44); two 12-gauge shotguns (SE 46 &amp; 56); two Marlin 22-caliber semi-automatic rifles (SE 48 &amp; 50); a vintage Japanese military bolt action rifle (SE 58); a Jennings semi-automatic pistol (SE 52); and, a Rossi revolver, 38 Special (SE 54).
