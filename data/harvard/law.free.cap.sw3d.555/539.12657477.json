In February 2012, the home was destroyed by fire. Using insurance proceeds, Amanda paid off the mortgage, sold the property, and bought a new home for the family in June 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   That summer, Barney, then 34, began sexually abusing Amanda's 13-year-old daughter, S.S. Barney was accused of requiring S.S. to perform various sex acts with him for more than a year, often daily, sometimes weekly, stopping for a while, then resuming. Barney had also sexually abused A.G., then 15, who knew he was abusing S.S. When K.M., then 16 or 17, told A.G. that Barney had abused her, A.G. said that she and S.S. had both had \"sexual problems\" with Barney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In August 2013, S.S., A.G., and K.M. were visiting their aunt for a few days when they began to talk with each other about their shared nightmare. \"[I]n the midst of great angst and emotion\", with the girls \"crying hysterically,\" A.G. told the aunt, \"[Bradshaw has] been messing with us, and we can't take anymore, and [S.S.] has been getting\n   the brunt of it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[We want] 'this to stop.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The aunt called the police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Barney was charged with continuous sexual abuse of a young child, S.S., who was at the time of the offense younger than 14 years old.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 3 girls all testified at the trial, as well as a friend of theirs, B.P., whom Barney had also sexually assaulted. All the abuse occurred in the Bradshaw home, the yard, the bathroom, and Barney's bedroom. Barney was convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison without parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Meanwhile, Amanda had filed for divorce. At the hearing, she testified only very briefly, and Barney, in jail awaiting trial, was not allowed to testify. The court awarded Amanda all of the community estate\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the home as her separate property. The court of appeals reversed, holding that the evidence did not support either the award of all the community property to Amanda or the characterization of the home as her separate property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On remand, Amanda presented additional evidence. She testified that Barney had physically abused her on multiple occasions, and S.S. and A.G. testified that Barney had sexually abused them repeatedly. Barney testified by telephone from prison. He claimed an interest in the fire insurance proceeds and in the home, asserting that he had made extensive repairs to it. He denied all the allegations of abuse, contending that they had been concocted to deprive him of an interest in the home. While the case was pending in the trial court, Barney's conviction was affirmed on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Between the divorce case and the criminal case, 5 different women testified under oath to Barney's physical and sexual abuse. For some, the abuse continued for more than a year. Nearly all of the abuse occurred at the Bradshaw home during Barney and Amanda's 3-year marriage. The trial court found that the home was community property and awarded 80% of it to Amanda and 20% to Barney, based on \"fault in the breakup of the marriage\". The court awarded the rest of the community property to the party in possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Amanda appealed, arguing that she should have been awarded 100% of the home and that anything less was not \"just and right\". The court of appeals affirmed the property division, noting that \"although fault may be considered in making a disproportionate distribution of community property, '[t]he division should not be a punishment for the spouse at fault.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We granted Amanda's petition for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The division of a community estate in divorce must be \"just and right, having due regard for the rights of each party and any children of the marriage.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Just\" and \"right\" are broad terms.\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   defines \"just\" as \"[l]egally right; lawful; equitable\",\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"right\" as \"[t]hat which is proper under law, morality, or ethics\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   And \"due regard\" simply means the \"[a]ttention, care, or consideration\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   that is \"[j]ust, proper, regular, and reasonable\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   A trial court should consider many factors, including \"the spouses' capacities and abilities ... and the nature of the property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court may consider the \"fault in breaking up the marriage\", though the community-property division \"should not be a punishment for the spouse at fault.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the end, \"the court is to do complete equity as between the husband and wife and the children, having due regard to all obligations of the spouses and to the probable future necessities of all concerned.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because the standards for dividing a community estate involve the exercise of sound judgment, a trial court must be accorded much discretion in its decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   The division \"should be corrected on appeal only where an abuse of discretion is shown in that the disposition made of some property is manifestly unjust and unfair.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   The appellate court cannot merely reweigh the evidence. Rather, \"[a] determination of whether the property division decreed in a divorce constitutes an abuse of discretion presents a legal rather than a factual question for appellate review.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in deciding that legal question, the trial court is entitled to no deference. \"[A] trial court has no discretion in determining what the law is or applying the law to the facts, even when the law is unsettled.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus, the issue before us is this: In the circumstances presented, can it be just and right, as a matter of law, in dividing a community estate in divorce, to award an interest in the family home to a spouse convicted of using the home to sexually abuse his stepdaughter? The issue is not whether Barney's conviction for sexual abuse of his stepdaughter contributed to the breakup of his marriage and for that reason could be considered in dividing the community estate. The trial court appears to have done just that. Nor is the issue whether awarding Amanda 100% of the home \"could operate to punish Barney for his fault in the dissolution of the marriage,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   as the court of appeals worried.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   It can certainly be argued that Barney's punishment was his 60-year prison sentence, not the unequal division of the home (though as JUSTICE BOYD observes, \"[a] sixty-year prison sentence hardly seems sufficient\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wholly apart from whether Barney's crime contributed to the breakup of the marriage, the question is whether it can be just and right to award him an interest in the home he repeatedly used to sexually abuse multiple victims, including his stepdaughters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We have little difficulty answering no. As broad as the terms \"just\" and \"right\" are, they are not meaningless. They express values fundamental to our society, values we hold precious. Our society is diverse, and perceptions of what is \"just\" and \"right\" can differ with perspective. But we think it virtually beyond argument that awarding Barney an interest in the very home he used to sexually abuse his stepdaughter, for which he was convicted, and others is unjust and wrong, not as a matter of fact, but as a matter of law. Such an award was thus an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Barney argues that the award is justified because Amanda took $5,000 from his disability benefits account after filing for divorce, he worked on the home and helped furnish it, Amanda offered no evidence that his criminal conviction affected her financially, and awarding her 100% of the home could be considered punitive. These arguments might be relevant to whether this is an appropriate uneven distribution for fault in the breakup of the marriage. But they miss the point: Barney should not be awarded an interest in the home he was convicted of using to sexually assault his stepdaughter. Barney insists that the allegations against him are untrue, and that the award of 20% of the home was \"a hedge against any residual doubt\" the trial court may have had that he is guilty as charged. But the evidence against him in the criminal trial was overwhelming, the sentence was severe, and his conviction has been affirmed on appeal. Barney argues that awarding Amanda 100% of the home would be unjust because she was given other community property in her possession that was his. But the case is being remanded for reconsideration of the division of the community estate, and those arguments are best addressed on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For JUSTICE BOYD , \"Barney's cruelty and the harm he inflicted on Amanda and her daughters are indisputably abhorrent and intolerable in any civilized society\",\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   but he argues that the Court has \"found an abuse of discretion only when the trial court ignores a governing legal standard.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   JUSTICE BOYD contends that while he \"might\"-not\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   , but\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   -personally agree that Barney should have no interest in the home, that cannot override the trial court's exercise of discretion. If awarding Barney an interest in the home could be just and right, we would agree. But it cannot be-as a matter of law. JUSTICE BOYD opines that \"this Court's view of what is 'just and right' is irrelevant to the issue before us.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   In finally interpreting a statute, this Court's view is all that is relevant. \"Maybe\", JUSTICE BOYD muses, \"Texas law should require those who abuse their spouses or children or step-children to forfeit all interests in any property they use to commit those crimes. But\n   the State's right, in the exercise of its police power, to 'declare a forfeiture of the property of private individuals' involves policy decisions best exercised by the Legislature, not by this Court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the circumstances of this case, we disagree. The Legislature has already made the policy decision: a division of a community estate must be just and right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   As JUSTICE BOYD notes, \"we must 'take statutes as we find them.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a matter of law, the trial court's division of the home in this case is neither just nor right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   JUSTICE BOYD states that \"when a statute authorizes the trial court to make a discretionary determination by applying equitable standards like 'just and right,' appellate courts cannot restrict that discretion by declaring that a particular application is or is not just and right.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that is precisely what appellate courts do, as we have done, for example, in holding that using a community division to punish a spouse for fault in the breakup of the marriage is not just and right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   JUSTICE BOYD argues that even if we spoke for the Court, our decision would not be retroactive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rarely are our decisions\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   retroactive, and JUSTICE BOYD does not argue why a legal interpretation of \"just and right\" would be an exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To be clear, we limit our opinion today to narrow circumstances where the behavior involves the use of community property, is as egregious as Barney's, and results in a criminal conviction. Family violence is, deplorably, all too common. We do not hold that its occurrence alone deprives the guilty spouse of an interest in all or even a specific part of the community estate. The elements that compel our decision are that Barney sexually abused his stepdaughters and others repeatedly over a protracted period, that he used the family home to commit the abuse, and that he was convicted and severely sentenced for the continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14. One can hypothesize a harder case than this one-a single incident, weak evidence, an enormous home, no criminal conviction. A division of community property can be just and right despite violence directed against the family. The award of an interest in the home to Barney cannot be. JUSTICE BOYD complains that this is \"unworkable as a legal principle.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   We fail to see why it is more unworkable than reasonableness, a standard that pervades the law.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex.

The record reflects that Amanda's insurance company settled her claim by paying approximately $166,000 for the house, $60,000 for its contents, and another $13,000 for the family's additional living expenses following the loss. About $40,000 of the settlement was used to pay off the mortgage company's lien, and Amanda sold the property after that. Amanda used\n    $125,000 of the insurance settlement to buy the Florey Lake property outright. The sale closed in June 2012, about nineteen months after the marriage. Amanda took title to the property solely in her name. The rest of the insurance money was used to furnish the new home and pay other expenses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Barney claims to have a community interest in both the insurance proceeds and the Florey Lake property. He testified about contributing a mattress, some furniture he did not identify, and a remarkable five televisions to the house that burned. Moreover, Amanda testified that during the marriage she paid the home's mortgage of $450 a month from her earnings. The couple lived in the house for about a year and so approximately $5400 of community funds were expended on the mortgage during this period. During the marriage, Barney received social security disability payments, but did not testify about any other earnings. He did, however, testify about making plumbing repairs to Amanda's first house and to providing assistance with the construction of an addition to the Florey Lake property. It was also undisputed that the insurance-settlement check was made payable to Amanda and Barney even though the insured home was Amanda's separate property.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The last known value of the Florey Lake property was its sales price of $125,000. Barney's awarded interest in the property is thus worth perhaps $25,000. Assuming the addition to the Florey Lake property added to the home's value, Barney's interest is worth even more. Given the community contribution, this seems to be an exceedingly generous award to Barney even before considering his fault or other factors supporting a disproportionate award.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    When Barney's fault is factored into the analysis of a just-and-right division, what seems at first blush to be a generous valuation of Barney's community interest becomes even more untenable. In\n    <em>\n     Young\n    </em>\n    , we noted a concern that the trial court not delve into every \"bicker, nag, and pout\" between the parties when examining fault as a relevant consideration.\n    <em>\n     Young\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9949440\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/609/758/#p762\">\n     609 S.W.2d at 762\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In retrospect, Amanda and her daughters would, in all probability, have considered it a blessing had Barney merely abandoned the family. Instead, he stayed, causing his family and others unspeakable physical and emotional harm. It is difficult to imagine a situation where considering fault in the division would be more appropriate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Apart from Barney's fault, other relevant factors such as the nature of the property and the parties' relative needs support a disproportionate award to Amanda.\n    <em>\n     Murff\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9977869\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/615/696/#p699\">\n     615 S.W.2d at 699\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Ironically, Barney has been awarded an interest in the very asset that facilitated his criminal activity. Moreover, the parties' financial obligations and, hence, their needs, are vastly different. Amanda has two daughters to shelter and support and needs the home. Barney, on the other hand, is incarcerated for sixty years; the state has made arrangements for his room, board, and other necessities for his foreseeable future.\n    <em>\n     Bradshaw v.

Although the trial court held four hearings over the course of the proceedings below, only the middle two included any evidence about the parties' property interests. And even then, those hearings primarily concerned tracing insurance proceeds from the destruction of Amanda's separate property into the Florey Lake property to determine its proper characterization. The parties here have fought over the Florey Lake property's characterization and the community's interest therein to the exclusion of other assets. Along the way, the parties have alluded to other community assets, such as vehicles, tools, televisions, accounts, and furnishings, without ever providing an inventory. Apparently, Florey\n    Lake is the parties' primary asset but the community's interest is not developed in the record. The circumstances are reminiscent of those in\n    <em>\n     Marriage of Brown\n    </em>\n    wherein the court of appeals held the trial court did not have adequate information on which to divide the estate and thus no reasonable basis for its award.\n    <em>\n     In re Marriage of Brown\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8428378\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/187/143/#p148\">\n     187 S.W.3d at 148\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

I respectfully disagree. Amanda submits in her briefing that sufficiency of the evidence is not an independent ground of reversible error. Instead, she claims it is a factor relevant to assessing whether the trial court abused its discretion, that is, whether the trial court had sufficient evidence on which to exercise its discretion. JUSTICE BOYD further exclaims that it \"is simply not true\" to suggest that Amanda's argument includes a no-evidence complaint because \"she never argues that 'no evidence supports' the award of some interest to Barney.\"\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    at 556. Again I disagree. Amanda expressly argues that \"the record is totally silent as to any rationale\" for awarding Barney any interest in the Florey Lake property. Moreover, JUSTICE BOYD reads Amanda's statement that the record \"contains sufficient evidence upon which the trial court could determine the division of property\" out of context to suggest an inconsistency with her abuse-of-discretion contention.\n    <em>\n     Post\n    </em>\n    at 555. In context, Amanda's statement about the evidence refers to the testimony of her daughters, herself, and Barney regarding Barney's fault, which Amanda interprets as an overriding factor, sufficient by itself to sustain an award of the entire Florey Lake property to her. While I disagree that this factor is controlling to the exclusion of all others, I likewise disagree with JUSTICE BOYD 's characterization of the statement as Amanda abandoning the evidentiary concerns that are otherwise apparent in her abuse-of-discretion complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    A just-and-right division of community property does not have to be equal, but it does have to be informed.

The court of appeals nevertheless affirmed the trial court's division, assuming that the division was equitable rather than arbitrary and assuming further that a more disproportionate award could have amounted to a penalty.

But that does not foreclose the possibility that a highly unequal division can be \"just and right.\" Rather,\n    <em>\n     Young\n    </em>\n    simply forecloses the trial court from considering retribution or punition in determining what is just and right. Our law recognizes numerous other, valid factors that might, in extraordinary cases such as this one, support an award of eighty percent or more to a single spouse.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Such disparity does not de facto or presumptively constitute punishment, though it may fairly raise suspicions; it is permissible to the extent supported by valid legal considerations.

By declaring as a matter of law that \"the trial court's division of the home in this case is neither just nor right,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    at 545 ( HECHT , C.J., plurality op.), the plurality is impermissibly \"substituting [its] determination of 'just and right' for the trial court's determination,\" and thus \"infringing upon the trial court's discretion.\"\n    <em>\n     McKnight\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9955093\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/543/863/#p866\">\n     543 S.W.2d at 866\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Second, the plurality's new \"law\" is manifestly unworkable as a legal principle. As if enacting a statute, the plurality would declare that it is not \"just and right, as a matter of law, in dividing a community\n    estate in divorce, to award an interest in the family home to a spouse convicted of using the home to sexually abuse his stepdaughter.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 543 ( HECHT , C.J., plurality op.). But it would limit the new law \"to narrow circumstances where the behavior involves the use of community property, is as egregious as Barney's, and results in a criminal conviction.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 545 ( HECHT , C.J., plurality op.). And the spouse who is precluded from receiving any interest must have \"abused his stepdaughters and others repeatedly over a protracted period, [must have] used the family home to commit all of the abuse, and [must have been] convicted and severely sentenced for the continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 545 ( HECHT , C.J., plurality op.). But does this new law apply only if the abuse involves a home, or can it involve a vehicle or some other community property? And must it involve sexual abuse, or would egregious physical or emotional abuse suffice? Must the abuse involve a child or step-child, or would the new law apply to abuse against the spouse? And what if the abuser has not yet been convicted at the time of the divorce, or the conviction remains on appeal or subject to habeas relief? The plurality announces not a legal principle but the result of its own application of the equitable \"just and right\" standard to the facts of this particular case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Third, even if the Court adopted the plurality's view as a new generally applicable legal principle, it would not apply retroactively to render the trial court's decision an abuse of discretion in this case. A \"lower court ordinarily should not be said to have abused its discretion in following existing law, even if that law is no longer valid or should be significantly changed.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Smith Barney, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11697681\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/975/593/#p599\">\n     975 S.W.2d 593\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 599 (Tex. 1998).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Finally, and most importantly, the plurality's pronouncement is not the law even after today's decision. The plurality asserts that its position is \"virtually beyond argument,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    at 544 ( HECHT , C.J., plurality op.), but six Justices disagree. Failing to carry the Court's majority, the new principle the plurality announces is not the law, so the trial court could not have abused its discretion by ignoring or failing to apply what was not, and is still not, the law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    All of this is not to say that we agree with the trial court's decision. To be sure, Barney's cruelty and the harm he inflicted on Amanda and her daughters are indisputably abhorrent and intolerable in any civilized society.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    A sixty-year prison sentence hardly seems sufficient. But unlike this Court, the\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n    trial court in a divorce case has the opportunity to observe the parties on the witness stand, determine their credibility, evaluate their needs and potentials, both social and economic. As the trier of fact, the court is empowered to use its legal knowledge and its human understanding and experience. Although many divorce cases have similarities, no two of them are exactly alike. Mathematical precision in dividing property in a divorce is usually not possible. Wide latitude and discretion rests in these trial courts and that discretion should only be disturbed in the case of clear abuse.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    <em>\n     Murff\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9977869\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/615/696/#p699\">\n     615 S.W.2d at 700\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

FAM. CODE \u00a7 6.002 (authorizing fault-based divorce when one spouse \"is guilty of cruel treatment toward the complaining spouse of a nature that renders further living together insupportable\"). Although Amanda and Barney each owned a fifty-percent interest in the Florey Lake house, the court disproportionately awarded eighty percent of the interest to Amanda and twenty percent to Barney. Having observed the testimony and considered all the evidence, the court expressly found that this uneven division reflected \"due regard for the rights of each party.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9977869\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/615/696/#p699\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 7.001.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Regardless of how we might have awarded the interests, the trial court did not act arbitrarily or ignore guiding rules or principles, which is the only legitimate basis on which we could find it abused its discretion.

As we explained in\n    <em>\n     Young\n    </em>\n    , the Code permits a trial court to consider a party's fault when deciding how to divide the marital property, but this \"does not mean that fault must be considered in all cases where a divorce is granted on fault grounds.\"\n    <em>\n     Young\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9949440\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/609/758/#p762\">\n     609 S.W.2d at 762\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

His conclusion will be a huge surprise to the courts below, but no one will be as shocked as Amanda, who repeatedly and consistently asserted the opposite.

The trial court held four separate hearings before entering the judgment Amanda now challenges on appeal. Amanda testified at all of them, Barney testified at three, and Amanda's two daughters each testified at one. The testimony focused on the Florey Lake house, the parties' personal property, and Barney's fault in causing the marriage to fail. At three of the four hearings, the trial court personally asked Amanda or Barney for additional information about their personal property and the house on Florey Lake.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Much of the evidence was undisputed. Amanda and Barney were married for about three years, and no children were born or adopted during the marriage. Before they married, Amanda owned a different house, solely in her own name, which she had acquired in a prior divorce. They lived in that first house together for about a year, during which she paid the monthly $450 mortgage payments using income from her job. A fire destroyed that house, and the insurance company paid benefits of about $167,000 for the house, about $60,000 for the contents, and about $13,000 for additional living expenses. The insurance company paid these benefits by check made payable to both Amanda and Barney, which Amanda agreed to \"because [they] were married.\" They used $40,000 of the insurance payment to pay off the mortgage on the first house and then sold that property \"to some friends really cheap.\" They then used $120,000 to buy the Florey Lake house, \"cash outright.\" The title to the new house was in Amanda's name only, but they relied on Barney's social security disability status to reduce the property taxes. They used the rest of the insurance money to maintain and improve the house and to buy furnishings and other property\n    including \"two Harleys,\" furniture, equipment, and a trailer.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Barney testified that he brought a lot of personal property to the marriage, including a vehicle, multiple TVs, DVD players, furniture, mattresses, and dishes, because Amanda's ex-husband had \"cleaned her out.\" Amanda disagreed, testifying that the only thing Barney brought to the marriage was a \"raggedy\" truck, some clothes, some tools, and a car and other items that belonged to Barney or his brother. And despite his conviction, Barney denied Amanda's and her daughters' testimony detailing how he repeatedly abused each of them. Regarding the property, Barney claimed that, after they married, he contributed work to repair the plumbing and water damage at the first house and to maintain and build an addition on and improvements to the Florey Lake house. Amanda did not dispute this, but could not remember if it was true. Nor did she dispute Barney's \"best estimate\" that the combined value of the house and all personal property at the time of the divorce was \"[b]etter than $200,000.\" And Amanda did not dispute Barney's testimony that she took $5,000 of his social security payments from his account after they separated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The concurrence mentions several reasons why it believes this evidence is insufficient to support the trial court's division, but none of them have merit. It observes, for example, that the division \"seems to be an exceedingly generous award to Barney even before consideration of fault,\" and \"even more untenable\" when fault is considered.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 548 ( DEVINE , J., concurring). But this point complains of the\n    <em>\n     effect\n    </em>\n    of evidence, not the\n    <em>\n     lack\n    </em>\n    of evidence. We have made it clear that trial courts can wholly refuse to consider fault, even \"where a divorce is granted on fault grounds.\"\n    <em>\n     Young\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9949440\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/609/758/#p762\">\n     609 S.W.2d at 762\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And if the trial court decides to consider it, \"[f]ault and disparity in the parties' incomes are only two of the many factors the trial court should consider when dividing a marital estate.\"\n    <em>\n     Stafford v. Stafford\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9959296\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/726/14/#p16\">\n     726 S.W.2d 14\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 16 (Tex. 1987). The concurrence's view that the award was \"exceedingly generous\" or \"untenable\" does not support its conclusion that the evidence was insufficient. To the contrary, if the evidence is sufficient to allow the concurring opinion to reach that conclusion, it was sufficient to enable the trial court to divide the property as well.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The concurrence also rejects Barney's testimony regarding \"the substantial work he put into repairing and improving both houses,\" concluding that his argument \"is in the nature of a reimbursement claim but the record contains no evidence of the values involved.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 549 ( DEVINE , J., concurring). But Barney's argument is not in the nature of a reimbursement claim. Reimbursement claims involve a request for payments between the community property and one spouse's separate property or between the two spouses' separate-property estates. TEX. FAM. CODE \u00a7 3.402(a) ;\n    <em>\n     Vallone\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9940381\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/644/455/#p460\">\n     644 S.W.2d at 459\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"A right of reimbursement arises when the funds or assets of one estate are used to benefit and enhance another estate without itself receiving some benefit.\") (citing\n    <em>\n     Dakan v.

Here, Amanda no longer disputes that the Florey Lake house is community property, so we must accept that it\n    is. Even if evidence of specific values is required to justify transferring one spouse's separate property to the community estate or community property to one spouse's separate estate, no authority requires more to support the trial court's equitable division of community property in which each spouse otherwise owns an equal interest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    The concurrence also complains that the parties failed to submit an inventory providing the value of the parties' various personal property.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at ---- ( DEVINE , J., concurring). But no law requires an inventory.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TEX. FAM. CODE \u00a7 6.502(a)(1) (providing that trial court \"may\" order one or both parties to submit an inventory \"of the real and personal property owned or claimed by the parties\"). And as Amanda herself agrees, the trial court awarded\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    of that property to her, and the division of the community interest in the Florey Lake house is the\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    issue in this appeal. The record contains evidence that the house is worth at least $120,000, and the house and personal property combined are worth \"better than $200,000.\" So-to use the concurring opinion's own standards-the evidence provided the trial court with \"some understanding of the extent and value of the community estate,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    at 546 ( DEVINE , J., concurring), including \"evidence of the extent of the community estate or its value,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    at 550 ( DEVINE , J., concurring), and \"sufficient information [for the trial court] to make a rational decision,\"\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    at 546 ( DEVINE , J., concurring).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The concurring Justices disagree with the trial court's division, but that provides no valid basis to reverse it. To the contrary, because the abuse-of-discretion standard governs, we\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    affirm \"if there is\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    basis in the record to support its decision.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    at 546 ( DEVINE , J., concurring) (emphasis added) (citing\n    <em>\n     Rosemond v.

The trial court conducted four separate hearings and repeatedly personally questioned Amanda and Barney to learn more about their marital estate, and particularly about the Florey Lake house. Yet the concurrence would hold that the trial court acted\n    <em>\n     arbitrarily\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     abused\n    </em>\n    its discretion because it lacked sufficient information.
