RODRIGUEZ, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal involves the sufficiency of a threshold expert report in a medical malpractice case. Plaintiff Carmen Munoz filed a healthcare liability claim against Dr. Pacheco-Serrant,\n   (\"Pacheco\") claiming that he was responsible for injuries allegedly caused by his negligent performance of a back surgery in January of 2013. Dr. Pacheco moved to dismiss the lawsuit, contending that Munoz's expert report failed to meet the requirements of the Texas Medical Liability Act (TMLA). The trial court sustained Dr. Pacheco's objections to the expert report and gave Munoz thirty days to file and serve a curative expert report on Dr. Pacheco. Munoz timely filed a \"supplemental\" expert report, and Dr. Pacheco filed objections to that report, as well as a motion to dismiss, contending that the supplemental report was also deficient. The trial court denied the motion, and Dr. Pacheco filed this interlocutory appeal. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Original Petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 15, 2015, Carmen Munoz alleged in her original petition that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 16, 2013, Defendant Helson Pacheco-Serrant M.D. performed L4-L5 decompression, posterolateral fusion, Aspen instrumentation, revision of fusion instrumentation L5-S1, and decompression L5-S1, according to the operative report. As a result of the surgery, Plaintiff developed complications, including urinary problems.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Liability of Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Helson Pacheco-Serrant M.D. negligently performed the surgery which was a proximate cause of Plaintiff's injuries and damages including urinary problems, pain and suffering, mental anguish, and medical expenses, in the past and in reasonable probability into the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    The First Expert Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As required by the TMLA, on May 20, 2015, Munoz timely filed and served an expert report authored by J. Martin Barrash, M.D., a physician board-certified in neurological surgery with over 45 years of experience in the field of neurosurgery. The pertinent section is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Helson Pacheco-Serrant, M.D.'s 4/30/2012 history and physical record shows Carmen Munoz, 50 years old, complained of back pain, radiating down to the left lower extremity to the ankle region for approximately one year. Conservative management was unsuccessful. Her pain was constant and exacerbated by prolonged sitting, lying, walking and bending. There is no evidence of bowel or bladder problems. His diagnosis was low back pain, lumbar disc herniation with radiation to the left lower extremity. On 4/30/2012, Helson Pacheco-Serrant, M.D. performed a L5-S1 posterior lateral fusion with Aspen instrumentation. The ODG criteria were not met by Dr. Pacheco-Serrant for a fusion and therefore did not meet the standard of care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   On 8/23/2012, the patient returned to Dr. Pacheco-Serrant complaining of bilateral lower extremity numbness. Dr. Pacheco-Serrant ordered an MRI and requested that the patient return in two weeks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   On 09/06/2012, the patient returned to see Dr. Pacheco-Serrant. The patient complained of heaviness in her lower extremities. There were no complaints of back pain nor weakness. The MRI of the lumbar spine showed no stenosis, no adjacent disc disease nor nerve impingement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   On 01/16/2013, Dr. Pacheco-Serrant performed the following procedures: L4-L5 decompression, posterolateral fusion, Aspen instrumentation, revision of fusion instrumentation L5-S1, and decompression\n   L5-S1. There was no indication for the surgery at L4-L5 or a reoperation at L5-S1. The standard of care again was not met.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Post surgically the patient began experiencing loss of bladder control. Were the unindicated surgeries not performed, the loss of bladder control would not have occurred. It is my opinion that the patient's urinary bladder dysfunction following the 1/16/2013 spine surgery was caused by the surgery and damage during the L5-S1 fusion and L4-L5 surgery and fusion. The standard of care of [sic] requires protection of the nerves during the fusion, since injury to nerve affects urinary evacuation. This breach of the standard of care was the proximate cause of the urinary problem. My opinions are based on reasonable medical probability. I reserve the right to amend and supplement my opinions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Dr. Pacheco's Objections to the First Expert Report and Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dr. Pacheco filed timely objections contending that Dr. Barrash's report was conclusory as to the standard of care, breach, and causation, and was therefore inadequate to meet the requirements of the TMLA. Dr. Pacheco's objections addressed Dr. Barrash's opinion regarding whether the January 2013 surgery was negligently performed, as pleaded in Munoz's petition; his objections did not address Dr. Barrash's opinion the January 2013 surgery was not medically indicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dr. Pacheco objected the expert report failed to identify the standard of care that Dr. Pacheco violated; Dr. Pacheco complained Dr. Barrash failed to identify the nerve or nerves that Dr. Pacheco was required\n   to protect during the surgery, and further failed to describe what steps Dr. Pacheco should have taken to protect those nerves. Further, Dr. Pacheco argued the report did not adequately address the issue of causation, contending Dr. Barrash did not adequately identify or explain which nerves were damaged during the surgery, how they were damaged, and/or how the damage caused Munoz's alleged loss of bladder control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Munoz did not file a response to the objections and/or the motion to dismiss, and by written order dated September 21, 2015, the trial court sustained Dr. Pacheco's objections, giving Munoz 30 days to file and serve a curative report on Dr. Pacheco, as permitted by the TMLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    The Supplemental Curative Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 21, 2015, Munoz timely filed and served a supplemental report which was authored by Dr. Barrash. The pertinent sections of the supplemental report are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   As previously explained, the standard of care requires that the 1/16/2013 surgical procedures on L4-L5 and L5-S1 be recommended and performed only when medically indicated for Carmen Munoz. It would have been medically indicated only if this was a re-do laminectomy, or if there was severe degenerative disc disease or spinal instability. Since these conditions were not present, the procedures were not medically indicated. In other words, the evidence-based data shows that for Mrs. Munoz, the procedure would not be effective in treating her condition. Therefore, the recommendation and performance of the procedures were a breach of the standard of care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The spinal nerves that provide bladder control are located in the 1/16/2013 surgical site. At the sacral level the \"cord\" has actually become the cauda equina. Partial or full damage to the nerves that control the bladder (S1-4) can result in incomplete emptying of the bladder. In this case, the instrumentation of the procedure more likely than not damaged the nerves that control the bladder. Thus, the unindicated surgery and breach of the standard of care were a substantial cause of Mrs. Munoz' loss of bladder control. Had the procedure not been performed, Mrs. Munoz would not have developed loss of bladder control. My opinions are based on reasonable medical probability. I reserve the right to supplement and amend my opinions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The second page of the expert report is a letter from Dr. Barrash in which he attached the ODG criteria stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The ODG criteria for doing a fusion will be enclosed but basically it is re-do lumbar laminectomy, [for] severe degenerative disease and spinal instability. Fortunately, Carmen Munoz had none of those problems and therefore, Dr. Helson Pacheco-Serrant did not follow the ODG criteria and deviated from therefore from the standard of care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The fusions that were done were unnecessary procedures performed by Dr. Pacheco-Serrant. The patient was left with devastating residual loss of bladder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The ODG criteria included by Dr. Barrash states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    ODG for the Low Back Regarding: Spinal Fusion\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Not recommended for patients who have less than six months of failed recommended conservative care unless there is objectively demonstrated severe structural instability and/or acute or progressive neurologic dysfunction, but recommended as an option for spinal fracture, dislocation, spondylolisthesis or frank neurogenic compromise, subject to the selection criteria outlined in the section below entitled, \"\n   <em>\n    Patient Selection Criteria for Lumbar Spinal Fusion,\n   </em>\n   \" after 6 months of conservative care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Patient Selection Criteria for Lumbar Spinal Fusion :\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   For chronic low back problems, fusion should not be considered within the first 6 months of symptoms, except for fracture, dislocation or progressive neurologic loss.

First, he complained that Dr. Barrash's supplemental report only \"partially address[ed]\" his objections to the first report, by describing the location of the nerves that control the bladder, and by asserting they were located at the surgical site area. Dr. Pacheco pointed out that the supplemental report did not address his objection Dr. Barrash had failed to adequately describe the standard of care. On the issue of causation, Dr. Pacheco further complained that Dr. Barrash did not address how the nerves were damaged, contending that Dr. Barrash's statement that \"instrumentation of the procedure more likely than not damaged the nerves that control the bladder\" was too \"vague and conclusory\" to address the issue. Moreover, Dr. Pacheco pointed out that although Dr. Barrash's report indicated that nerve damage during surgery can result in \"incomplete emptying\" of the bladder, he described Munoz's injury as a \"loss of bladder function,\" with no explanation of how those two conditions were related.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, Dr. Pacheco objected to Dr. Barrash's opinion that the January 2013 surgery was not medically indicated, pointing out that Munoz never made this allegation in her petition, and that the only theory of liability set forth in her petition was that he had \"negligently performed\" the January 2013 surgery. Dr. Pacheco argued that the sufficiency of an expert report must be evaluated based solely on whether the report supports a theory of liability alleged in the plaintiff's pleadings, and that this portion of the report therefore could not be utilized to meet the requirements of the TMLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Munoz's Amended Petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Munoz filed a First Amended Original Petition on November 24, 2015. In her amended petition, Munoz alleged that Dr. Pacheco had \"negligently performed\" the January 2013 surgery, and added his \"negligence includes performing surgery which is not medically indicated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    The Hearing on Dr. Pacheco's Objections and Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The reporter's record of the hearing on Dr. Pacheco's motion to dismiss indicates that it started promptly at 10:30:22 a.m. on November 24, 2015. The parties engaged in an extensive argument regarding whether the trial court could properly consider Dr. Barrash's opinion that the surgery was not medically indicated because Munoz had failed to make that allegation in her original petition. Munoz's attorney informed the trial court he had filed an amended petition adding that allegation shortly before the hearing started, acknowledging Dr. Pacheco's counsel had not likely received a copy of the amended petition, explaining he had \"filed it before she got here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   At that point in the hearing, the focus shifted to the question of whether the trial court should permit Munoz to file an amended petition so late in the game-after Dr. Pacheco had already filed his objections and his motion to dismiss, and after the hearing had already started on his motion. Dr. Pacheco's attorney objected to the filing of the amended petition, asserting that it raised a completely new and separate cause of action, and that it would be unfair to allow Munoz to bring the new claim at that late date. Munoz's attorney, on the other hand, argued that it was not a new claim. Munoz asserted her claim in the original petition, that Dr. Barrash \"negligently performed\" the surgery, was broad enough to include the claim that: (1) he was negligent in the way in which he performed the surgery; and (2) that he was negligent in performing a surgery that was not medically indicated. Munoz's counsel explained that although he believed the original petition was sufficient to cover both claims, he made the decision to file the amended petition out of an \"abundance of caution\" after he received Dr. Pacheco's objections asserting that the second claim had not been adequately pleaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    The Trial Court's Ruling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At the close of the hearing, the trial court took the matter under advisement, and later that same day, issued a written order denying the motion to dismiss. In its order, the trial court expressly found Dr. Barrash's curative report met the requirements of the TMLA, and his report adequately covered \"the negligence cause of action in the Original Petition and the Amended Petition.\" The trial court further noted Dr. Pacheco had \"objected\" to the amendment, but had failed to present any evidence to support the objection as required by Rule 63 of the Texas Rule of Civil Procedure. And finally, the trial court\n   expressly concluded the amendment did not \"present a new cause of action.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Dr. Pacheco contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion to dismiss because: (1) Dr. Barrash's curative expert report did not address the objections that he had previously made to Dr. Barrash's initial report, which the trial court had sustained; (2) the curative report did not meet the requirements of the TMLA; and (3) the curative report at most addressed an \"unpleaded and factually ungrounded theory of liability,\" which should not have been considered by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We review a trial court's decision to dismiss a case on inadequate expert report grounds for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Tenet Hosps., Ltd. v.

Here, Dr. Barrash outlined the standard of care under the ODG criteria and what conditions must exist for spinal fusion to be medically necessary. He opined that after reviewing Munoz's medical records to include her MRI, he found the conditions for the spinal fusion surgery, pursuant to the ODG, were not present and therefore, Pacheco violated the standard of care by performing the surgery of January 16, 2013 on Munoz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Munoz must link the defendant's alleged negligence to the injury suffered. If there is a break in the logical chain between the negligent act and the injury, the causation conclusions in a medical expert report are insufficient.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Regent Health Care Ctr. of El Paso, L.P. v.

App.--El Paso 2008, no pet.) (finding report insufficient due to analytical gap between worsening skin condition, fall, and patient's death). Dr. Pacheco asserts the medical expert report (1) fails to explain \"how\" the surgery was negligently performed; (2) how the nerves should have been protected; (3) fails to identify what steps should have been taken to protect the nerves; (4) basis for causation was conclusory; and (5) failed to link the loss of bladder control to the surgery. However, Dr. Pacheco's assertions appear to urge us to resolve an ultimate cause-in-fact question on the merits. We decline that invitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Here, Dr. Barrash's report meets the fair summary standard on causation by logically linking the alleged breach and the alleged harm by explaining that if the\n   medically unindicated surgery had not been performed, Munoz would not have suffered her injuries to include the urinary problems. He opines that the \"evidence-based data shows that for Mrs. Munoz, the procedure would not be effective in treating her condition.\" The medical expert report provides articulable, plausible and complete support of the allegations against Dr. Pacheco. Dr. Barrash's report provides a fair summary of Munoz's theory on causation and the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   We find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling Dr. Pacheco's motion to dismiss and objections to the medical expert report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   We overrule Appellant's issues and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Hughes, J., not participating\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    According to medical literature, spinal fusion is surgery to permanently join together two or more bones in the spine so there is no movement between them. https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002968.htm.
