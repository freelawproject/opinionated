She argues in four points on appeal that the trial court erred because it misapplied law, overlooked her evidence, and misread her petition. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
