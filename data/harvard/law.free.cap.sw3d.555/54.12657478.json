Charter schools are created under and generally governed by chapter 12 of the Education Code. This chapter provides for three charter types: home-rule school district, campus or campus program, and open-enrollment. TEX. EDUC. CODE \u00a7 12.002. This appeal concerns open-enrollment charters. Such charters are typically held and run by nonprofit corporations, qualifying under \u00a7 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318450\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/342/73/#p74\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.101(a)(3). Although less common, institutions of higher education and governmental entities are also eligible to apply for such a charter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318450\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/342/73/#p74\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.101(a)(1), (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The petitioners here are American YouthWorks, Inc., which formerly operated the American YouthWorks Charter School (collectively AYW), and Honors Academy, Inc., which formerly operated the Honors Academy Charter School (collectively Honors). Both are private, nonprofit corporations and early charter applicants under chapter 12.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318450\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/342/73/#p74\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.101 (authorizing Commissioner to grant applications for an open-enrollment charter school). AYW obtained its charter in 1996 and describes itself as a drop-out-recovery school serving \"Austin's under-served and under-privileged youth, through work, work-study and work training opportunities.\" Honors received its charter in 1998 and describes its schools as serving a large population of transient, low-income, at-risk students who have not been successful in regular public schools. Honors's schools are located predominantly in north Texas. AYW and Honors continuously operated their schools under renewals until legislative\n   changes to chapter 12 led the Commissioner to revoke their charters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pertinent here is the work of the Texas Sunset Commission, which in 2012 issued its report on the Texas Education Agency (TEA). The report included a section on charter schools.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The report noted that, while some charter schools were among the highest-achieving schools, others were among the lowest-performing schools. The Sunset Commission focused on the difficulty in addressing academic and financial issues at these low-performing schools. The report emphasized the TEA's inability to move quickly to revoke charters for poor performance, and that the delay left \"students to be educated at under performing charter schools\" for too long.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Sunset Commission believed that the TEA lacked the tools necessary to effectively address poor academic and financial performance and urged that revocations \"should occur more quickly to protect students from an inadequate education.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The report recommended that the Legislature require the Commissioner of Education to revoke a charter, without a hearing, if the charter school failed to satisfy academic or financial accountability standards for three consecutive years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the 2013 session, the Legislature acted on the Sunset recommendation by amending the Education Code to change the Commissioner's authority in this regard. Before these amendments, the Commissioner had discretionary authority under section 12.115 to revoke a charter or take a lesser adverse action against a charter holder that committed a material violation of its charter, failed in its fiscal management of the school, failed to protect the health, safety, or welfare of its students, or failed to comply with applicable law. Act of May 28, 2001, 77th Leg., R.S., ch. 1504, \u00a7 12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%205344\">\n    2001 Tex. Gen. Laws 5344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5350. After the amendment, the grounds listed in section 12.115 became mandatory. TEX. EDUC. CODE \u00a7 12.115(a). Moreover, the legislation included additional mandatory grounds for revocation, including one that required the Commissioner to revoke an open-enrollment charter if the school's academic or financial performance fell below acceptable standards over a three school-year period:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (c) The commissioner shall revoke the charter of an open-enrollment charter school if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) the charter holder has been assigned an unacceptable performance rating under Subchapter C, Chapter 39, for the three preceding school years;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) the charter holder has been assigned a financial accountability performance rating under Subchapter D, Chapter 39, indicating financial performance lower than satisfactory for the three preceding school years; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (3) the charter holder has been assigned any combination of the ratings described by Subdivision (1) or (2) for the three preceding school years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%205344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.115(c).

For purposes of revocation under Subsection (c)(2), the initial three school years for which financial accountability performance ratings under Subchapter D, Chapter 39 [financial accountability], shall be considered are the 2010-2011, 2011-2012, and 2012-2013 school years.

It directed the Commissioner to adopt an informal procedure to implement review of the Commissioner's now mandated revocation decisions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%205344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.116(a). An appeal of that decision to the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH) was permitted, but the appeal was not a contested-case hearing or subject to the Administrative Procedure Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%205344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.116(b). Instead, the legislation provided that the administrative law judge was to review the Commissioner's decision under an \"arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous\" standard and that the judge's determination was final and not subject to judicial review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%205344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.116(c). These revisions to the Education Code took effect on September 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 18, 2013, the Commissioner notified AYW and Honors by letter that their schools had been identified as charters that met the criteria for mandatory revocation under the new legislation. In these letters, the Commissioner explained that he was revoking its open-enrollment charter (effective June 30, 2014) under Education Code \u00a7 12.115(c). He cited the performance ratings that were the basis for each recipient's charter revocation and attached exhibits corresponding to the identified ratings. The Commissioner also noted that the performance ratings on which the revocations were based were \"final and not appealable\" because \"all rights to appeal the ratings identified above had been waived or exhausted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The letters further described the informal appeals process available to the schools: they had \"the right to request an informal review of, and hearing regarding\" the Commissioner's revocation decision, but \"only if the charter holder submits a written request that contains specific answers to each of the findings included in this Notice.\" The Commissioner explained further that if the charter holder's timely request was denied during the informal review, the charter school's revocation issue would be sent to the SOAH for a hearing under \u00a7 12.116. Finally, the Commissioner noted that the SOAH hearing would be \"limited to the specific findings and revocation detailed in this correspondence,\" that his decision would be upheld \"unless the judge finds the decision is arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous,\" and that the SOAH judge's decision would be final and not subject to further appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   AYW pursued the Commissioner's informal review process, but the Commissioner determined that he would proceed with the revocation. The Commissioner then forwarded AYW's appeal to the SOAH. After receiving notice of the denial of its informal appeal and the SOAH hearing date, AYW filed suit against the Commissioner and the Texas Education Agency (hereafter collectively referred to as \"Commissioner\") in district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Honors also pursued its right to an informal review with the Commissioner who again determined that the revocation would proceed. Honors's appeal was forwarded to the SOAH, and the administrative\n   law judge issued a decision upholding the revocation on May 20, 2014. Before that occurred, however, Honors intervened in AYW's pending litigation against the Commissioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Judicial Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   AYW asserted several claims in its district-court petition, including the deprivation of a vested property right without due process, the unconstitutional impairment of contract based on the retroactive use of past financial ratings to revoke AYW's charter, and ultra vires claims. AYW sought a temporary injunction specifically to stop the SOAH hearing from proceeding and more generally to prevent the revocation from occurring. Honors's petition alleged similar claims and sought similar relief, although it did not seek to stop its SOAH hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Commissioner responded with a general denial and plea to the jurisdiction. Hearings ensued after which the district court issued two orders temporarily enjoining the Commissioner from (1) taking any further action to revoke AYW's charter and (2) from taking any further action to impair Honors's educational operations or enforce any order revoking Honors's charter. The respective injunctions were slightly different because the administrative law judge decided Honors's SOAH appeal before the district court issued the temporary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Commissioner immediately appealed the temporary injunctions. The district court subsequently denied the Commissioner's plea to the jurisdiction, and the Commissioner appealed that interlocutory order as well. The Commissioner's two appeals were consolidated for decision in the appellate court. The court of appeals vacated the temporary injunctions and dismissed AYW's and Honors's underlying claims, concluding that all claims were barred by sovereign immunity.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773682\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/496/244/#p270\">\n    496 S.W.3d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Petitions for Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Petitions here challenge the validity of the Commissioner's decision to revoke AYW and Honors's respective charters, but chapter 12 does not provide for judicial review of these administrative orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. EDUC. CODE \u00a7 12.116(c)(2) (making decision of the administrative law judge final).

Because the statute does not provide for judicial review, AYW asserts both due process and contractual impairment/retroactivity claims based on an asserted vested right to its charter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CONST. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 19. AYW also asserts that the Commissioner's actions were ultra vires, precluding the application of sovereign immunity and providing another path to judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of El Paso v.

AYW's original charter incorporated by reference all applicable requirements of state and federal law, and although the charter did not specifically mention Education Code \u00a7 12.115, it did paraphrase some of that section's requirements, providing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Charterholder understands that the Board may modify, place on probation, revoke or deny renewal to a charter if the Board\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   determines that a material violation of the charter has occurred, that Charterholder has failed to satisfy generally accepted accounting standards of fiscal management, or that the Charterholder\n   has failed to comply with an applicable law or rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   AYW's subsequent charter renewal in 2002 did not again paraphrase the revocation grounds, but rather simply incorporated \"applicable law.\" AYW contends that its charter incorporated a \"for cause\" provision, specifically the limitations on revocation found in its original charter and in Education Code \u00a7 12.115, asserting that these limitations on State discretion created its vested right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Commissioner responds that AYW's charter is not a property right that can be distinguished from the legislative mandate creating such right. Because the charter-school system is a legislative creation, AYW's right to operate a school rests entirely on the Legislature's decision to continue the system. Moreover, AYW's right to any particular terms rests on the Legislature's decision to continue the current law because a charter's terms are governed by statute. Thus, although AYW's charter and its renewal take the form of a contract, both documents anticipate and incorporate changes to the law governing charters as they arise. The original charter incorporated \"amendments\" to the state and federal law governing charter schools, while the charter renewal incorporated all applicable law, which included Education Code \u00a7 12.1071. Under that section, AYW's acceptance of state funds constitutes its agreement to any amendments to the laws governing charter schools. TEX. EDUC. CODE \u00a7 12.1071. Because AYW's original charter and subsequent renewal recognize the Legislature's authority to alter the charter's terms, the Commissioner submits the documents are inextricably intertwined with the Legislature's regulatory authority, rendering AYW's interest in its charter \"entirely contingent on State discretion,\" and not a vested property right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773682\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/496/244/#p270\">\n    496 S.W.3d at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   An open-enrollment charter school is \"indisputably part of the Texas public-education system.\"\n   <em>\n    LTTS Charter Sch.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318450\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/342/73/#p74\">\n    342 S.W.3d at 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, AYW's contention is that its charter with the State created a contractual relationship that vested its place in that system.

Honors received an academic performance rating of \"Academically Unacceptable\" for 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. Honors appealed its 2009-2010 rating, but the appeal was denied. Under the revamped ratings system in 2012-2013, Honors received an academic performance rating of \"Improvement Required.\" The poor rating was due to its failure in \"Index 4,\" which is based, in part, on a school's dropout rate and includes data from prior years. Undisputed is that 2011-2012 data was used in calculating that index, which was part of the 2012-2013 academic accountability rating and the portion that caused Honors's poor academic rating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Commissioner's revocation decision was forwarded to the SOAH where an administrative law judge upheld the Commissioner's decision. The judge recognized that Honors's appeal depended on the meaning of the \u00a7 12.115(c-1)'s first sentence: \"For purposes of revocation under Subsection (c)(1), performance during the 2011-2012 school year may not be considered.\" Honors argued that the prohibition on considering \"performance during the 2011-2012 school year\" meant that the Commissioner could not consider\n   <em>\n    data\n   </em>\n   from the 2011-2012 school year. Honors maintained that eliminating the 2011-2012 data from Index 4 of its 2012-2013 academic ratings would result in an acceptable rating that would save its charter. The Commissioner, on the other hand, contended that the prohibition on using 2011-2012 performance referred to\n   <em>\n    performance ratings\n   </em>\n   from 2011-2012. The administrative law judge agreed with the Commissioner's reading of the statute and ultimately concluded that the Commissioner's revocation of Honors's charter was neither arbitrary, capricious, nor clearly erroneous:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   TEA's interpretation of the disputed sentence is consistent with the context of the rest of Texas Education Code \u00a7 12.115. The disputed sentence specifically refers to revocation under Subsection(c)(1) of \u00a7 12.115, which concerns academic performance ratings under Subchapter C of Chapter 39. This suggests that the Legislature used the word \"performance in the disputed sentence as shorthand for the phrase \"performance rating.\" The Legislature similarly used shorthand elsewhere in the section. Subsection (c)(3) uses only the word \"ratings\" when unambiguously referring to performance ratings described in Subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   For purposes of revocation, the second sentence of Texas Education Code \u00a7 12.115(c-1) requires consideration of academic performance ratings for the 2009-2010, 2010-2011, and 2012-2013 school years. The statutory directive to consider the 2012-2013, ratings could not be executed and would be ineffective if Honors's interpretation of the disputed sentence is correct. That is because 2012-2013 ratings were based on 2011-2012 performance data. In contrast, if TEA's interpretation is correct the directive to consider 2012-2013 ratings would be effective and could be executed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Further, TEA's interpretation of the disputed sentence is consistent with the broader context of the Texas Education Code into which it was enacted. That included former Texas Education Code \u00a7 39.116, which authorized the Commissioner to suspend assignment of performance ratings for the 2011-2012 school year during the period of transition to the accreditation system implemented in August 2013. Exercising his authority, the Commissioner did not issue accountability ratings for any school during the 2011-2012 school year. Apparently because the Commissioner was not required to rate academic performance during the 2011-2012 school year, \u00a7 39.116 prohibited revocation based on academic ratings for that year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    TEA v.

AYW's charter revocation, however, was not because of its academics, as was the case with Honors's revocation, but rather because of its financials. AYW received a financial rating of \"Substandard Achievement\" for school years 2010-2011, 2011-2012, and 2012-2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   And although \u00a7 12.115(c-1) excluded the 2011-2012 school year when considering revocation for unacceptable academics under \u00a7 12.115(c)(1), it did not also exclude that school year when considering revocation for unacceptable financial performance under \u00a7 12.115(c)(2). TEX. EDUC. CODE \u00a7 12.115(c)(1)-(2), (c-1). The new academic standards that made the 2011-2012 school term a transition year for rating academic performance did not significantly affect financial performance ratings and thus \u00a7 12.115(c-1) stated that \"the initial three school years for which financial accountability performance ratings under Subchapter D, Chapter 39, shall be considered are the 2010-2011, 2011-2012, and 2012-2013 school years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.115(c-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As already noted, the Commissioner notified AYW of his intention to revoke AYW's charter based on its unacceptable financial ratings and advised AYW of its right to an informal review by written request. AYW appealed the revocation decision through the informal procedure, but the Commissioner determined that he would proceed with the revocation. AYW's appeal was then forwarded to the SOAH, which issued a hearing notice. Rather than pursue the SOAH hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   AYW filed suit in district court, where it obtained the temporary injunction, which is the subject of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   AYW's ultra vires complaint is similar to Honors's in that it complains that the Commissioner used the wrong data when revoking its charter. The disagreement here is over whether a school's financial accountability performance rating (or FIRST rating) for any particular school year refers to the school year in which the financial data is collected or the year in which the data is compiled and a rating announced. By rule, a school's financial rating for any given fiscal year is based on data from the prior fiscal year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20109.1001\">\n    19 Tex.

For example, according to AYW, \"the financial accountability rating based on performance during the 2011-2012 year was called the '2011-2012 Charter School Status Detail' and accessed by\n   selecting the '2011-2012' year in the TEA dropdown menu.\" From this, AYW concludes the financial accountability rating for any particular school year should be based on performance data from that year rather than from the preceding school year. AYW further submits that, by identifying the initial three school years that could be considered for a charter revocation under \u00a7 12.115(c)(2), the Legislature prohibited the use of financial data collected before the 2010-2011 school term, the earliest identified school term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. EDUC. CODE \u00a7 12.115(c-1). AYW then concludes that the Commissioner acted beyond his authority by basing AYW's 2010-2011 financial performance rating on data collected during the preceding 2009-2010 school year, rather than during the year of performance. According to AYW, if the Commissioner had used the correct data from the performance year, its charter school would not have had three consecutive years of unacceptable financial ratings because data collected during the 2012-2013 school year produced a sufficient financial performance rating. And if AYW did not have three consecutive unacceptable financial ratings, its charter would not have been subject to mandatory revocation under \u00a7 12.115(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Commissioner responds that he used the appropriate financial ratings for the school years identified in section 12.115(c-1) and that his actions were not ultra vires, but rather required by law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20109.1002\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.115(c)(2).

Because the Education Code contemplates a written appeals process for all financial accountability ratings, and the administrative rule restricts such appeals to errors solely attributable to TEA's financial data, AYW complains that the Commissioner has placed an unauthorized limitation on ratings appeals in conflict with the enabling statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The \"unauthorized limitation\" did not prevent AYW from raising this same issue in the informal appeal of its 2013 Charter FIRST rating, however. In its written appeal, AYW also raised several data entry errors attributable to TEA as well as a reporting mistake on its part. AYW further criticized the \"inherent shortcoming in the Current FIRST rating methodology\" which \"does not correctly measure the School's financial oversight and provide meaningful information to enable the Commissioner of Education and the School to improve financial operations,\" concluding that \"[a]ll FIRST indicators constitute data errors attributable to TEA.\" As required by rule, an external independent appeals panel reviewed AYW's written appeal and advised the Commissioner on the ratings-appeal decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20109.1002\">\n    19 Tex.

AYW further submits that the finality accorded the Commissioner's decision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TEX. EDUC.

The letter also notified the charter school of its right to request an informal review and hearing regarding the Commissioner's decision but that the request had to be in writing with answers to the findings in the notice. AYW pursued the informal review, submitting a written response that in many respects tracks its briefing in this Court. For example, AYW asserted that the Commissioner and TEA had misinterpreted and misapplied the relevant rating years identified in \u00a7 12.115(c-1), had engaged in arbitrary rule making and enforced arbitrary rules, and arbitrarily neglected to consider certain extenuating circumstances relevant to AYW's poor performance ratings. As examples of these extenuating circumstances, AYW complained about the Texas Education Agency\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   \u2022 causing one of its campuses to acquire an unacceptable academic rating by requiring its merger with another poorly performing campus instead of accepting AYW's request to merely close the underperforming campus;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   \u2022 arbitrarily assigning AYW an unacceptable financial rating for one year merely because AYW's auditors were late in submitting their audit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   \u2022 failing to consider the vast improvements experienced at the charter school because the TEA's \"FIRST\" measuring tool lacked flexibility;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   \u2022 failing to consider that AYW's assets appeared to be significantly less than they actually were because of its board's decision to create a 501(c)(2) tax-exempt entity to hold property and support the charter school and the 501(c)(3) entity that held the charter;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   \u2022 failing to reconsider AYW's high staff-to-student ratio by discounting those staff members who were in contact with students but not supported or paid with charter school funds;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   \u2022 failing to consider the endowment held by AYW's supporting 501(c)(2) entity even though the 501(c)(3) entity that controlled AYW had instant access to $600,000 of that endowment; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   \u2022 failing to consider the significant amounts of interest earned by the endowment held by the 501(c)(2) and paid to support AYW.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   AYW asserted that reconsideration of one or more of these extenuating circumstances would affect its performance ratings and remove its charter from jeopardy under \u00a7 12.115(c). AYW's written response to the revocation notice also raised its constitutional claims and concluded by reserving \"its right to supplement and modify this response and to avail itself of all avenues of appeal and opposition to this revocation and closure effort including but not limited to an informal review.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Commissioner conducted an informal review of AYW's response and determined\n   that revocation would proceed, subject to AYW's right to appeal his decision to the SOAH.

In neither appeal did the Commissioner reject AYW's written submissions or refuse to consider the issues raised in them. AYW's complaint is not about the rule's application but about what the Commissioner considers most important in these appeals.

Many of the Commissioner's executive decisions, including those at issue here, are made final or permit only limited administrative review. Because the enabling statutes precluded judicial review of these executive decisions and no basis existed otherwise to invoke the district court's inherent authority, the court of appeals concluded that sovereign immunity barred the district court proceedings. The appellate court accordingly vacated the district court's temporary injunctions and dismissed the underlying proceedings for want of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Because we agree that the charter schools have no vested property right in public education or their respective charters and have failed to demonstrate the existence of any ultra vires act in the revocation of their charters, we affirm the court of appeals' judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Justice Johnson filed a concurring opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Justice Blacklock did not participate in the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   I agree with and join the Court's opinion and judgment, subject to the following comments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Court makes extensive references to\n   <em>\n    LTTS Charter School, Inc. v.
