We hold that the one-satisfaction rule applies to this case, and the trial court therefore erred in denying the nonsettling defendant the settlement credits. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case to that court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2007, Ilan Israely and Abraham Gottlieb formed Sky View at Las Palmas, L.L.C. for the purpose of purchasing and developing land in Hidalgo County. In March 2008, Sky View acquired a tract of land containing 38.416 acres in Hidalgo County (the Property), from M Construction, Ltd., the president of which was Hugo Martinez (Hugo). Sky View purchased the Property for $6.5 million, and it financed $4 million of the purchase price through a Promissory Note and Deed of Trust with Compass Bank\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the purchase loan). Sky View and M Construction also entered into a construction agreement in which M Construction would serve as the project's general contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After obtaining the purchase loan, Sky View, through Israely and Gottlieb, sought a construction loan with Compass Bank for $9 million, but the bank said it would take months to complete the due diligence for this loan. To keep the project moving while it waited for this loan, Sky View sought a second construction loan for approximately $1.5 million. Israely, through a connection made by Hugo, approached Romano Geronimo Martinez Mendez (Martinez) about providing the financing for this second construction loan. There is evidence that Martinez was provided with Israely's personal financial statements indicating Israely's net worth to be approximately $35 million dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To help facilitate this loan agreement with Sky View and Israely, Martinez retained the law firm of Kittleman, Thomas &amp; Gonzales, LLP (Kittleman) to draft the loan documents. Martinez also retained San Jacinto Title Services of Rio Grande Valley, LLC (San Jacinto) to close the transaction and serve as the title company. San Jacinto was an agent authorized to issue title insurance policies for Fidelity National Title Insurance Company (Fidelity). Martinez agreed to make this second construction loan to Sky View (the Martinez loan), which consisted of Martinez's loan of $1.275 million to Sky View and Sky View's promise to repay the loan within six months at 18% interest (the Note), secured by a lien on the Property. This was the second lien on the Property behind Compass Bank's lien. Israely and Gottlieb also agreed to each provide a personal guaranty of the Martinez loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Part of this lawsuit arises out of the closing transaction of the Martinez loan. Kittleman drafted the loan documents but allowed Carmen Solis, an escrow officer\n   with San Jacinto, to oversee the loan closing entirely. To finalize the loan, Solis sent the loan documents to Gottlieb by overnight mail, including both Gottlieb's and Israely's personal guaranty agreements. These documents were sent back to Solis fully executed, and Solis notarized them, falsely stating that they were signed in her presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October 2008, Sky View defaulted on the Note and the parties began informal negotiations regarding its repayment. Over a year later, the dispute had not been resolved, and Martinez retained the law firm of Walker &amp; Twenhafel, L.L.P (Walker) to assist in recovering on the Note. In May 2010, Martinez filed suit against Sky View, Israely, and Gottlieb (the Sky View defendants), seeking damages for \"the outstanding balance of the Note and Guaranty Agreements\" and attorney's fees. Martinez claims Walker never advised him during this time that the first lienholder-Compass Bank-could foreclose on the Property, which would adversely affect his lien interest and a claim under his title insurance policy with Fidelity. In October 2011, after Sky View had stopped making payments to Compass Bank on the purchase loan, Compass Bank foreclosed on the Property, which Martinez claims \"effectively wip[ed] out\" his secondary interest. Three months after the foreclosure, Fidelity denied Martinez's claim under his title insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Over a nearly four-year period of litigation, Martinez added Kittleman, San Jacinto, and Fidelity as defendants in his suit against the Sky View defendants, alleging various causes of action based on the closing transaction on the Martinez loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Martinez also later added Walker as a defendant, alleging several causes of action based on its representation during the litigation with Sky View.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Martinez eventually settled with each of these four added defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April 2014, Martinez proceeded to trial against the Sky View defendants based on the following causes of action: breach of the Martinez loan Note and guaranty agreements, fraud, promissory estoppel, quantum meruit, ratification/adoption, and conspiracy. The only questions submitted to the jury related to the breach-of-contract and fraud claims, and Martinez submitted only one damages question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, would fairly and reasonably compensate Martinez for his damages, if any, that resulted from either (1) Sky View's failure to comply with the Note; (2) Gottlieb's failure to comply with the guaranty agreement; (3) Israely's failure to comply with the guaranty agreement;\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   (4) Israely's fraud?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The jury found that: (1) Israely and Gottlieb authorized Sky View's execution of the Martinez loan Note; (2) Israely and Gottlieb both ratified Sky View's execution of the Note; (3) Sky View failed to comply with the terms of the Note; (4) Gottlieb failed to comply with his guaranty agreement;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (5) Israely authorized another to execute the guaranty agreement on his behalf and ratified the guaranty agreement; (6) Israely failed to comply with the guaranty agreement; (7) Israely committed fraud on Martinez; and (8) Martinez incurred damages of $2,665,832.72-the same amount Martinez claimed was due on the Note. The jury also awarded Martinez attorney's fees related to trial, appeals, and any post-judgment efforts to collect the judgment. Martinez elected to recover on the breach-of-contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In response to Martinez's motion for judgment, Sky View and Israely together asserted that under the one-satisfaction rule, they were entitled to offset the final judgment by the amounts the four settling defendants paid to Martinez, plus applicable interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the trial court rendered judgment against the Sky View defendants, jointly and severally, for the full jury award-$2,665,832.72-in damages and prejudgment interest, plus trial attorney's fees of $574,062 and contingent appellate attorney's fees of $200,000. Sky View and Israely again argued in post-judgment motions that they were entitled to settlement credits, and they requested that Martinez produce those settlement documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sky View and Israely eventually introduced an affidavit from their counsel as to the amount and timing of each of Martinez's settlements, and Martinez's counsel admitted those same amounts to the trial court in a hearing on the motions. Martinez did not file any responses or offer evidence that the Sky View defendants were not entitled to settlement credits. The trial court never ruled on any of Sky View and Israely's post-judgment motions, so their request for settlement credits was denied by operation of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 329b(e), (g). Sky View and Israely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's denial of settlement credits.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656616\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/548/18/\">\n    548 S.W.3d 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20219122\">\n    2017 WL 219122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.

After purportedly examining \"Martinez's causes of action, allegations, and the injuries he claimed\" against each of the settling defendants, the court of appeals held that Martinez's claims against Sky View and Israely were \"independent of the other injuries Martinez alleged against the settling defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. It stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Although Martinez's claims against each of the seven defendants in this case arise out of a common set of underlying facts and sequence of events, ... the damages for which the jury found Sky View and Israely liable are not part of a \"single, indivisible injury,\" as [Sky View and Israely] contend.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.

Sky View's Settlement Credits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Sky View argues that the courts below erred in failing to apply the one-satisfaction rule and denying it settlement credits for the settlements Martinez entered into with Kittleman, San Jacinto, Fidelity, and Walker. Sky View asserts that Martinez consistently pled, proved, and asked the jury to compensate him for a single, indivisible injury from all seven defendants-nonpayment of the $1.275 million Note. Thus, Sky View argues, it was entitled to settlement credits to offset the jury's damages award against it and prevent Martinez's double recovery. The court of appeals erred, Sky View contends, when it examined the causes of action Martinez asserted against each defendant rather than the injury he allegedly sustained. Sky View asks this Court to reduce the judgment \"by the $2.3 million settlement funds Martinez received and any applicable interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Martinez asserted several claims against Kittleman arising out of Kittleman's actions during the Martinez loan closing-actions Martinez alleged resulted in his inability to recover the amount due on the Note when Sky View later defaulted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Martinez also asserted causes of action against San Jacinto based on Solis's handling of the closing, and he alleged that this negligence resulted in Israely's later assertion that he did not sign the loan documents and therefore was not liable for the Note's repayment. Martinez sought damages from both Kittleman and San Jacinto equal to the amount of lost principal and interest due on the Note and the attorney's fees he incurred in seeking its repayment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, as a result of both Kittleman's and San Jacinto's alleged actions, Martinez alleged to have suffered the same injury-nonpayment of the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Similarly, the claims Martinez asserted against Fidelity arose from its role in the Martinez loan transaction and Sky View's default. Martinez alleged that Fidelity acted negligently in allowing San Jacinto-an agent authorized to issue insurance policies on its behalf-to operate as it did, and that Fidelity breached the title insurance policy by denying Martinez's claim and engaging in unfair settlement practices. As to damages from Fidelity's conduct, Martinez asserted that \"Fidelity should be responsible for covering Martinez's loss under\n   the title insurance policy.\" Finally, Martinez asserted claims against Walker based on Walker's initial representation of Martinez in its suit against Sky View seeking repayment of the Note-specifically, that Walker failed to take any steps to protect Martinez's lien interest in the Property before Compass Bank's foreclosure, and that this delay resulted in Fidelity's denial of Martinez's claim under the title insurance policy. Martinez sought to recover \"actual and special damages from Walker, including the benefit of his mortgagee title insurance policy which was lost ... [and] exemplary damages from Walker due to its gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Further, the only damages evidence Martinez provided at trial was based on his financial loss after Sky View defaulted on the Note. Martinez's damages evidence included the loan documents, Martinez's testimony about what was due on the Note-by his calculation, $2,665,832.72, which included prejudgment interest up to the date of trial-and expert testimony as to Martinez's reasonable and necessary attorney's fees. Martinez's only damages question lumped together all of his damages arising from the Note, the guaranties, and the alleged fraud. Accordingly, the jury assessed Martinez's damages under this question with one amount-$2,665,832.72, the amount Martinez claimed was due on the Note. This is the same recovery Martinez sought against each settling defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The court of appeals erred in examining only the causes of action Martinez asserted against each of the settling defendants when our precedent makes clear that the causes of action pled are not the proper inquiry in applying the one-satisfaction rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart Title\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9962201\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/822/1/#p7\">\n    822 S.W.2d at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In addition, other than the exemplary damages he sought against Walker, which we address below, all of the damages Martinez sought against each of these defendants was for an amount equivalent to his economic loss of the loan's principal and accumulated interest plus the attorney's fees he incurred in pursuing the litigation. Thus, although not adjudicated to be tortfeasors, Sky View and the settling defendants cannot reasonably be said to have caused separate injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Title\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9995251\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/860/74/#p78\">\n    860 S.W.2d at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In response to Martinez's motion for judgment, Sky View alleged that Martinez benefitted from settlement agreements with Kittleman, San Jacinto, Fidelity, and Walker based on the same injury for which the jury awarded him damages, and thus, allowing Martinez to recover the full amount of the jury's award would result in his double recovery.

In\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , we noted that if a payment is within the collateral-source rule, \"the principle forbidding more than one recovery for the same loss is not applicable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9957949\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/601/931/#p934\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9957949\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/601/931/#p934\">\n    at 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Martinez argues that because he was the named insured under Fidelity's title policy and Fidelity paid a $300,000 settlement, this payment from a collateral source prohibits that settlement credit. Further, citing a concurring opinion, Martinez argues that Kittleman and Walker were third parties acting for the benefit of Martinez, and therefore the collateral-source rule also bars settlement credits for those amounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tate v.

With regards to the Fidelity payment, Sky View correctly points out that the title policy was procured by Sky View, rather than Martinez.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court has held that in cases where the defendant procures insurance for the benefit of the plaintiff, the plaintiff cannot\n   then rely on the collateral-source rule for a double recovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Publix Theatres Corp. v.

Additionally, there is no evidence that the $300,000 payment from Fidelity constituted an insurance policy payment under the title policy; the only evidence of the payment in the record is the affidavit evidence Sky View presented as to the amount transferred and to which Martinez stipulated. As to the law firms, the only Texas case Martinez cites for this proposition is a concurrence to the court of appeals' opinion in\n   <em>\n    Tate\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947854\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/280/534/#p543\">\n    280 S.W.3d at 541-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Campbell, J., concurring). But the concurrence, contrary to Martinez's argument, would have concluded that the collateral-source rule did not apply to the payment at issue in that case-a discharge in bankruptcy of liability for medical expenses-in part because \"[a]pplication of the collateral source rule has historically benefitted those with foresight to acquire insurance in advance of injury or at least in advance of treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947854\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/280/534/#p543\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947854\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/280/534/#p543\">\n    at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).
