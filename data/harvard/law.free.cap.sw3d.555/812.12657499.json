RODRIGUEZ, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We issued our original opinion on December 20, 2017, in which we agreed with the trial court that Appellants had failed to state a claim for relief against the County for which its immunity had been waived, but holding that the trial court erred by failing to give Appellants the opportunity to amend their petition to attempt to state a viable claim for relief. The County filed a motion for rehearing, arguing that Appellants had already been given an opportunity to amend their petition after the County filed its Plea to the Jurisdiction, and that Appellants did not request the opportunity to file a second amended petition after the trial court granted the County's Plea, thereby failing to preserve this issue for appeal. Appellants did not file a response to the motion. We grant the motion for rehearing, withdraw our prior opinion and\n   judgment, and substitute the following opinion. We affirm the trial court's judgment granting the County's Plea to the Jurisdiction and dismissing Appellants' lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellants are four residents of El Paso who were found in contempt by Senior Judge Jerry Woodard for failing to obey a jury summons. Appellants filed a lawsuit on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated persons, naming Judge Woodard and El Paso County, requesting a declaration that their contempt judgments were void for lack of jurisdiction, and that Judge Woodard imposed court costs and fees in an \"illegal\" manner in their cases. In addition, Appellants sought a permanent injunction restraining and enjoining the defendants from charging illegal costs and fees in the future, a refund of all court costs, fines and fees already paid by Appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because the trial court ultimately dismissed Judge Woodard from the case, with Appellants' consent, based on the doctrine of judicial immunity, this left the County as the sole defendant in the case. The County filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction also seeking dismissal from Appellants' lawsuit, primarily arguing that it had governmental immunity from suit. In response, Appellants amended their Petition, adding an ultra vires claim against the County, as well as a claim for an illegal \"taking\" under the Texas Constitution. The trial court granted the County's Plea, and dismissed Appellants' lawsuit in its entirety. Appellants did not request an opportunity to file a second amended petition, and instead appealed the trial court's judgment to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellants contend that the trial court erred in granting the County's Plea, arguing that they raised valid causes of action in their amended Petition for which the County's immunity was waived, or in the alternative, that the trial court erred by not giving them a second opportunity to amend their Petition to correct any jurisdictional defects in their pleadings before dismissing their lawsuit. We conclude that the trial court correctly determined that Appellants' amended petition did not state any valid causes of action for which the County's immunity was waived, and we further conclude that the trial court did not commit reversible error by failing to give Appellants a second opportunity to amend their petition before dismissing their lawsuit. We therefore affirm the trial court's judgment granting the County's Plea and dismissing Appellants' lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In an apparent reaction to ongoing problems with prospective jurors in El Paso County not appearing for jury duty when summoned to do so, the \"Council of Judges of El Paso\" and Judge Stephen Ables, the Presiding Judge of the Sixth Administrative Judicial Region, began taking steps to devise a plan to address this issue as early as 1999.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record reflects that at a July 1999 meeting, the Council voted to appoint a visiting judge for \"purposes of studying methods of jury selection, the jury wheel, purging and adding jurors and methods of sanctions against jurors not responding to qualification questionnaires and juror summons.\" In addition, on that same day, the Council \"ordered that Judge Jerry Woodard be appointed to be assigned to the Jury Hall [,]\" to perform the duties outlined\n   above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly thereafter, on October 28, 1999, the Council also voted to approve the assignment of Judge Woodard and Judge Fashing to \"handle jurors,\" and more specifically, to \"question the [jury] panels, handle jury issues and qualify the jurors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Beginning on December 1, 1998, Judge Ables signed a series of orders, effective from January 1, 1999 through June 30, 2011, for three- to six-month periods of time, each labeled as an \"order of assignment by the presiding judge,\" assigning Judge Woodard to the district courts and county courts of law, later adding the county criminal courts of law to the list, for six-month periods of time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The assignment orders did not specify any particular cases, or type of cases, over which Judge Woodward was to preside.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   For reasons that are unclear from the record, Judge Ables thereafter signed an order assigning Judge Woodard for the period from November of 2013 to June 30, 2014 to the 384th District Court in which El Paso's then-local administrative judge, Judge Patrick Garcia sits. Once again, however, that assignment order did not clearly state the case or cases over which Judge Woodard was to preside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although the mechanism by which this occurred is not entirely clear from the record, the parties agree that, in several instances, when a juror failed to respond to a jury summons in a particular court in El Paso County, that court would either \"refer\" or \"transfer\" the matter to Judge Woodard for the purpose of allowing him to conduct contempt proceedings against the recalcitrant juror. The record does not indicate when this practice started or how many jurors were found in contempt by Judge Woodard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Appellants, Judge Garcia entered an order dated June 12, 2014, finding that all of the orders issued by Judge Woodard prior to that date were void, and vacating Judge Woodard's past contempt orders. The record, however, does not indicate how the matter came to Judge Garcia's attention, or what prompted him to enter that order; further, the record does not contain a copy of that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellants' Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 29, 2014, Appellants filed their first Petition on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated individuals, naming Judge Woodard and\n   El Paso County as defendants, alleging that they were among those who were adjudged to be in contempt by Judge Woodard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In their Petition, Appellants requested a declaration that their contempt judgments entered were void for lack of jurisdiction, claiming that Judge Woodard acted without legal authority in their cases. Among other things, Appellants alleged that the County had essentially created a rogue court, which they refer to as the \"Woodard Jury Duty Court,\" pointing out that the Texas Constitution only allows the state legislature to create courts, and that neither the Council of Judges nor the County had the legal authority to create any such court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants further alleged that although Judge Woodard appeared to be acting in their cases pursuant to the Judge Able's assignment orders, he had no authority to act in their cases, as he had failed to take constitutional oath of office each time he accepted an assignment from Judge Ables to handle a contempt case, thereby rendering any actions taken in those cases void.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Appellants alleged that Judge Woodard did not hold proper hearings prior to finding them and other jurors in contempt, claiming that Judge Woodard improperly acted as both \"a judge and a prosecutor\" in their cases, thereby depriving them of their due process rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants also alleged, without explanation, that Judge Woodard imposed \"illegal\" court costs and/or fees that were not authorized by statute, claiming that he \"would actively conceal that he was imposing court costs without any legal authority to do so.\" In addition, although they did not specify what role the Commissioner's Court may have played in this matter, Appellants requested a declaration that \"all Commissioners Court Orders authorizing the defendants to charge and collect court costs and any fee found for contempt of court to be [declared] unconstitutional, void, and unenforceable.\" Appellants also sought a permanent injunction \"restraining and enjoining\" the defendants from \"charging Plaintiffs court costs and fees in an illegal manner\" in the future, a refund of all court costs, fines and fees paid by Appellants, in the sum of $500 per plaintiff, as well as a \"fourfold\" refund of the \"fees\" that Appellants paid, together with attorney's fees and costs of court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Judge Woodard's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 4, 2014, Judge Woodard filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming, among other things, that he had absolute judicial immunity from the lawsuit. At a hearing held on May 9, 2016, Appellants' attorney conceded that Judge Woodward was entitled to judicial immunity, and the trial court thereafter granted the motion, and entered a judgment dismissing all of the claims against Judge Woodard with prejudice to the refiling of the same \"in any form,\" without objection from Appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    The County's Plea to the Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On November 7, 2014, the County filed its answer to Appellants' lawsuit, as well as a Plea to the Jurisdiction, claiming that it had governmental immunity from the lawsuit, and that the trial court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the matter. In its Plea, the County pointed out that Appellants had failed to allege that the County's immunity had been waived by any legislative grant of jurisdiction, and argued that Appellants had not alleged or described any facts that would support a finding that its immunity had been waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In response, Appellants filed their first amended petition on November 17, 2015, attempting to address the County's arguments. In their amended pleadings, Appellants added two new claims for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, Appellants alleged that Judge Woodard, who they referred to as a \"state official,\" had acted \"without legal or statutory authority\" when he imposed the \"court costs and fees\" under consideration herein, thereby raising what appears to be an \"ultra vires\" claim. Although their arguments were not entirely clear, at the hearing on the County's Plea to the Jurisdiction, Appellants alternated between alleging that Judge Woodard, Judge Ables, the El Paso Council of Judges, and the County had all acted illegally in allowing for the imposition of the allegedly unlawful costs and fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, Appellants alleged that the County had engaged in an \"unlawful taking of property\" when it \"intentionally charged and collect[ed] [Appellants'] money for public use.\" At the hearing on the County's Plea to the Jurisdiction, Appellants' attorney clarified that this cause of action was based on an alleged violation of the Texas Constitution, Article I, Section 17, which prohibits the State or its political subdivisions from taking property for public use without adequate compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following the hearing, the trial court issued its order granting the County's Plea to the Jurisdiction, dismissing Appellants' Petition in its entirety. Appellants thereafter requested findings of facts and conclusions of law. The trial court denied the request, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Appellants make two arguments on appeal, which we take in reverse order. First, Appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting the County's Plea to the Jurisdiction, claiming that they made sufficient allegations in their amended petition to demonstrate that the County's immunity had been waived. Second, Appellants argue that the trial court erred by granting the County's plea to the jurisdiction without giving them an opportunity to amend their petition to state \"viable state law and federal causes of action upon which a recovery could be had,\" arguing that their pleadings did not suffer from any incurable defect that could not have been corrected by an amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The function of a plea to the jurisdiction is to determine whether the court has subject matter jurisdiction over a cause of action, \"without regard to whether the claims asserted have merit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of El Paso v.

Although the Court in Camacho did not directly discuss the issue of governmental immunity, the Court did point out that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction of the plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief under both the Texas Constitution and the Texas Government Code, which give a district court \"appellate jurisdiction and general supervisory\n   control over the County Commissioners Court,\" and the power to review and set aside their decisions.\n   <em>\n    Camacho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9985824\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/831/804/\">\n    831 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   808 (citing TEX.

We do note, however, that in their prayer for relief, Appellants have asked for a \"declaration that all Commissioners Court Orders authorizing the defendants to charge and collect court costs and any fee found for contempt of court to be unconstitutional, void, and unenforceable.\" However, nowhere in the current pleadings do they allege that any Commissioners Court's orders actually exist, nor do they set forth any factual allegations in their pleadings that would suggest that the Commissioners Court took any action authorizing Judge Woodard's actions. In fact, to the contrary, Appellants expressly pled in both their original and amended petitions that the defendants were \"not authorized by any Texas Statute or any other law or the Commissioners Court to charge or collect court costs and/or penalty assessment fees [emphasis added].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Moreover, Appellants expressly alleged in their amended petition that it was Judge Woodard who improperly assessed the illegal costs and fees in their cases. Yet, as discussed above, Judge Woodard was entitled to judicial immunity for his actions in imposing any such fines or court costs, and has already been dismissed from the case on that basis. As set forth above, the only defendant left in the present case is the County, yet in their current pleadings Appellants have not alleged that the County engaged in any wrongdoing with regard to the imposition or collection of the court costs and fees in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In addition, as our sister court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Kubosh v.

First, the Texas Legislature repealed Article 3909 of Vernon's Texas Statutes and Codes several years ago by Acts 1993, 73rd Leg., ch. 268, \u00a7 46(1), eff. Sept. 1, 1993.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vannerson v.

App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1995, writ denied). Moreover, although Article 3909 was replaced with Section 118.801(a) of the Local Government Code, that statute provides no basis for Appellants' claim against the County. Section 118.801 provides that: \"An officer named in this chapter who, in bad faith, demands and receives a higher fee than authorized under this chapter or a fee that is not authorized under this chapter is liable to the aggrieved person for four times the amount unlawfully demanded and received.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE ANN. \u00a7 118.801 (West 2008). Chapter 118 of the Code lists a variety of county officials, including County Clerks, County Judge, Justices of the Peace, Sheriffs and Constables, County Treasurers, County Surveyors, and County tax-assessor-collector, who may be liable under the statute, as well as a variety of fees that may be collected by those officers. However, Chapter 118 does not list district court or county court at law judges among those who are liable under Section 118.801.

Moreover, we decline to find that Judge Woodard was acting in the absence of all authority. As Appellants' own pleadings establish, Judge Woodard was presiding over the juror contempt cases, acting at the behest of Judge Ables and the other El Paso County Judges who \"transferred\" or \"referred\" the contempt cases to Judge Woodard to handle. Those judges clearly would have had judicial immunity for their actions in holding potential jurors in contempt, and by delegating that authority to Judge Woodard, Judge Woodard was, at the least, entitled to \"derived\" judicial immunity in handling those cases.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dallas County v.

This\n   Constitutional provision provides that, \"No person's property shall be taken, damaged, or destroyed for or applied to public use without adequate compensation being made, unless by the consent of such person, and only if the taking, damage, or destruction is for: (1) the ownership, use, and enjoyment of the property, notwithstanding an incidental use, by: (A) the State, a political subdivision of the State, or the public at large; or (B) an entity granted the power of eminent domain under law; or (2) the elimination of urban blight on a particular parcel of property.\" TEX.

Instead, as explained above, Appellants only accuse Judge Woodard of violating their \"due process\" rights, and do not allege any facts that would suggest the County had any responsibility for those alleged violations. There is nothing in the pleadings or the record to suggest that Judge Woodard was executing any county policies in doing so, and to the contrary, the record indicates that he was simply engaging in judicial functions over which the County had no control. In the absence of any pleadings alleging that the County had a custom or policy that deprived Appellants of their constitutional rights, we conclude that Appellants have not pled a valid 1983 claim against the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Having concluded that Appellants have failed to plead any valid claims for relief against the County for which its immunity was waived, Appellants' Issue Two in their brief is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     APPELLANTS' REQUEST TO AMEND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In Issue One in their brief, Appellants argue that even if their first amended petition did not state any claims for relief for which the County's immunity was waived, the trial court should have given them an opportunity to file a second amended petition to attempt to cure any jurisdictional defects before dismissing their lawsuit. They request that we therefore remand this matter to the trial court with instructions to give Appellants the opportunity to file a second amended petition. For the reasons set forth below, we decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As a general rule, plaintiffs are entitled to an opportunity to amend their pleadings to attempt to cure jurisdictional defects contained in their pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas A &amp; M Univ.

However, in the present case, Appellants were given a reasonable opportunity to amend their petition after the County initially filed its Plea to the Jurisdiction, and Appellants did in fact file an amended petition in which they added two new causes of action against the County. Thereafter, the trial court found that none of the causes of action set forth in Appellants' amended petition stated a valid claim for relief for which the County's immunity had been waived, and it therefore granted the County's Plea to the Jurisdiction and dismissed Appellants' lawsuit in its entirety. As set forth above, Appellants did not request an opportunity to file a second amended petition after the trial court granted the County's Plea. Instead, they argue, in effect, that the trial court should have sua sponte given them this additional opportunity before dismissing their lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As we have previously recognized, a trial court may dismiss a plaintiff's lawsuit with prejudice upon granting a governmental entity's plea to the jurisdiction if the trial court previously provided the plaintiff with \"a reasonable opportunity\" to amend his pleadings after the governmental entity filed its Plea, and the plaintiff's amended pleadings still did not cure the jurisdictional defect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda v.

Therefore, as Appellants were already given an opportunity to amend their petition after the County filed its Plea, the trial court did not err by dismissing Appellants' petition when their amendment proved unsuccessful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Moreover, as noted above, Appellants never requested the opportunity to file a second amended petition in the trial court, and they are therefore arguing that the trial court should have, in effect, sua sponte give them an opportunity to file a second amended petition before dismissing their complaint. Even if the better practice would have been for the trial court to give Appellants the opportunity to amend their petition a second time before dismissing their complaint, we note that Appellants did not raise this complaint in the trial court, such as through the filing of a motion for new trial, and they are instead raising this issue for the first time on appeal.
