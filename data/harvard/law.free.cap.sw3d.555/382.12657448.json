After the physician agreed to work for the partnership, but before the partnership obtained his necessary credentials, the physician terminated the contract. The partnership sued the physician for breach of contract and sought summary judgment and liquidated damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court granted summary judgment to the partnership on liability and awarded liquidated damages. The partnership's claim for attorney's fees for prosecuting its case was tried to a jury. The final judgment awards the partnership $34,000 in liquidated damages, plus $58,775\n   in attorney's fees and prejudgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, the physician challenges the summary judgment in favor of the partnership, contending that fact issues exist as to whether (1) the physician-credentialing requirement, which he contends was a condition precedent to his employment, was complete before he gave notice, and (2) the parties lacked a meeting of minds on a starting date for employment. The physician also complains that the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest on attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We hold that the partnership has failed to establish the physician's liability under their agreement and therefore reverse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Texas Inpatient Consultants, LLLP is a partnership that provides hospitalist services through its employed physicians, who deliver medical care to hospitalized patients of other physicians. Texas Inpatient recruited Julius Tabe, M.D., to work for it as a hospitalist in May 2014. Tabe signed an \"Employment Agreement,\" in which he agreed to be employed by Texas Inpatient as a hospitalist physician and to provide medical services for patients at hospitals that had contracts with Texas Inpatient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The contract does not include a starting date for Tabe's employment. Rather, it provides that Texas Inpatient \"will commence payment of salary/benefits only after the credentialing at all the facilities and orientation is completed and the supervising MDs believe that the employee is ready for commencement of duties.\" The agreement explained that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   the credentialing and orientation process could take 90-120 days. Hence the contract date will be redacted to reflect the start date of duties, salary, benefits and the term.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   It further declared that Tabe's \"term of employment will begin on the effective date and shall continue for a period of three (3) years (\"Initial Term\"), unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with [its] terms....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After signing the contract, a change in family circumstances led Tabe to decide that he could not work for Texas Inpatient. On August 11, 2014, Tabe wrote Anita Sreshta, Texas Inpatient's office manager, informing her that he was withdrawing his candidacy for the hospitalist position as of September 15th.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 2nd, Dominic Shreshta, M.D., Texas Inpatient's managing partner, sent an email to Tabe notifying him that two of the four hospitals had successfully completed his credentialing and that Texas Inpatient expected him to start direct patient care on October 13th. Tabe reiterated his decision to withdraw in a September 15th email to Texas Inpatient, explaining that due to family concerns, he \"truly cannot commit to taking on any new job assignment at this time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The agreement's liquidated damages provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Should Employee voluntarily terminate or the Employer terminates his/her employment for any reason other than for disability ... within one year of executing this Agreement, Employee agrees to pay the employer the sum of [$4,000] as liquidated damages and not as a penalty. Employee understands and agrees that Employer must bear several initial expenses in order to have Employee credentialed and approved to work at the\n   various medical facilities where Employer conducts its operations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition, the provision contains a schedule that obligates the employee to pay an additional amount of liquidated damages that varies according to when written notice is given before termination. It declares, \"should Employee voluntarily terminate or be terminated by Employer for 'Cause' his/her employment without providing the Employer with the ... 120 days' written notice, Employee agrees to pay Employer liquidated damages\" as follows: For more than 105 but less than 120 days' notice, the employee owes liquidated damages in the amount of $7,500; for notice within 86-105 days, $10,000; for notice within 66-85 days, $15,000; for notice within 46-65 days, $20,000; for notice within 31-45 days, $25,000; and for notice of 30 days or less, $30,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Texas Inpatient treated Tabe's September 15th email as triggering the agreement's notice-of-termination provision and demanded that Tabe pay $34,000 in liquidated damages. When Tabe refused to pay, Texas Inpatient filed this suit. It moved for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim, which the trial court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the trial court granted Texas Inpatient's summary-judgment motion, the issue of Texas Inpatient's attorney's fees was tried to a jury. The jury found $58,775.00 in reasonable and necessary fees through trial and awarded $25,000 and $10,000 through appeal to the court of appeals and petition for review in the Supreme Court of Texas, respectively. The final judgment awards the liquidated damages amount found on summary judgment and the attorney's fees through trial found by the jury, plus prejudgment interest on those amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In his affidavit in response to Texas Inpatient's summary-judgment motion, Tabe averred that \"several procedures including credentialing had to be completed,\" and that \"[i]f the credentialing process is not successful for any reason then the physician cannot start to work. In that event, the physician will not become an employee of the prospective employer.\" These averments provide fair notice that Tabe denied the completion of credentialing as a condition precedent to employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The contract requires physician credentialing to be complete before Texas\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Inpatient and Tabe form an employer-employee relationship.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Tabe included excerpts from his deposition to further explain his understanding of the agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q. So it was your contention that this contract is not binding on you until you actually went through orientation and began working?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q, Where does it say that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A. [\n   <em>\n    Reading\n   </em>\n   ] The contract date will be redacted to reflect the start date of duties, salaries, and benefits after credentialing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The language that Tabe references expressly declares that Texas Inpatient \"will commence payment of salary/benefits only after the credentialing at all the facilities and orientation is completed.\" The use of \"only after\" in this provision manifests an intent to condition the payment of Tabe's salary and benefits on the successful completion of \"all\" credentialing and orientation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hohenberg Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10120187\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/537/1/#p3\">\n    537 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   3 ;\n   <em>\n    Gulf Liquids\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315696\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/356/54/#p64\">\n    356 S.W.3d at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This interpretation is consistent with the purpose of physician credentialing, which includes a hospital's initial decision to grant the physician staff privileges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garland Cmty. Hosp. v. Rose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9179343\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/156/541/#p544\">\n    156 S.W.3d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 544 (Tex. 2004) (observing that physician credentialing is continuing process that includes not only initial decision to grant staff privileges, but also formal reevaluations as well as continual monitoring and assessment of physician competence). The condition acknowledges that Tabe cannot perform the employment duties required by the agreement-which include \"see[ing] up to 25 patients per day at up to 3 acute care facilities\"-before the successful completion of his credentialing at those facilities. It is also consistent with the agreement's provision that the start date and initial term for employment under the contract would be finalized \"only after\" credentialing was complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The liquidated-damages provision contains language congruent with the understanding that the employment relationship is not formed until Tabe's credentialing is complete. It provides, \"Should Employee voluntarily terminate or the Employer terminates his/her employment for any reason ... within one year of executing this agreement, Employee agrees to pay Employer the sum of Four Thousand Dollars ... as liquidated damages....\" The provision is triggered by termination of Tabe's \"employment,\" not his prospective employment. This provision does not address the circumstance in this case, in which a prospective employee withdraws from an agreement to begin work on some indefinite future date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hogan\n   </em>\n   , the Eastland Court of Appeals reversed summary judgment in favor of a plaintiff, concluding, under analogous circumstances, that the defendant's summary-judgment evidence showed that the plaintiff was not entitled to immediate performance for failure to satisfy a specific condition precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387715\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/533/921/#p924\">\n    533 S.W.3d at 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, the plaintiff sought specific performance of a lease-purchase agreement and pleaded that all conditions precedent had been performed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387715\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/533/921/#p924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387715\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/533/921/#p924\">\n    at 922-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In response to the plaintiff's summary-judgment motion, the defendant alleged that the plaintiff lacked the funds necessary to close as a cash sale and produced evidence to support that allegation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387715\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/533/921/#p924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387715\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/533/921/#p924\">\n    at 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the plaintiff failed to conclusively show that he was ready, willing, and able to exercise the purchase option under the agreement, the appellate court held, he failed to meet his summary-judgment burden to establish liability as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12387715\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/533/921/#p924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Similarly, Tabe responded to Texas Inpatient's motion for summary judgment by invoking contract language that conditioned his employment-related obligations-including the start date and end date of the employment term-on the successful completion of credentialing. The evidence shows that credentialing was not complete and no employment start date was set when Tabe notified Texas Inpatient that he was withdrawing his candidacy for the hospitalist position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Texas Inpatient has not conclusively proved that Tabe breached the agreement.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Conditions precedent must occur before a party has \"a right to immediate performance and before there can be a breach of contractual duty.\"\n   <em>\n    McMahan v.
