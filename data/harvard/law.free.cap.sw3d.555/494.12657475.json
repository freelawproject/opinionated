Clark, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this appeal of a certified question of law, the defendant challenges the constitutionality of a statute that imposes a fee upon persons convicted of certain drug and alcohol offenses when forensic scientists\n   employed by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (\"TBI\") have conducted chemical tests to determine blood alcohol or drug content. The challenged statute earmarks the fees imposed to an intoxicant testing fund, and monies within this fund do not revert to the State's general fund but \"remain available for appropriation to the [TBI] as determined by the [G]eneral [A]ssembly.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2055-10-413\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 55-10-413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3)(B) (2017). The defendant argues that this statutory scheme provides TBI forensic scientists with a personal and institutional financial incentive to produce blood alcohol test results that secure convictions, which, in turn, increases fees and funding for the TBI.

We conclude that, under both the federal and state constitutions, the standards of neutrality announced in\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Connally\n   </em>\n   apply only to persons exercising judicial or quasi-judical authority and do not apply to TBI forensic scientists, who do not exercise such authority. Furthermore, even if the\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   standards applied to TBI forensic scientists, the defendant's constitutional claim would fail because, as salaried employees, the TBI forensic scientists have no direct, personal, substantial pecuniary interest in fees imposed pursuant to the statute, and any institutional financial interest the TBI forensic scientists may have as a result of the statute is too remote to give rise to an appearance of impropriety. We also disagree with the Court of Criminal Appeals' holding that the statute violates substantive due process by creating a situation analogous to an expert witness contingency fee arrangement. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

She consensually provided a blood sample upon her arrest, and this blood sample was submitted to the forensic services division of the TBI for analysis. Nothing in the record reflects that the defendant had an additional blood sample procured for independent testing as permitted by statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2055-10-408\">\n    Tenn.

She challenged the constitutionality of the BADT fee statute, arguing that by conditioning imposition of the BADT fee upon conviction and earmarking the monies to the Intoxicant Testing Fund, rather than to the State's general fund, the BADT fee statute incentivizes TBI forensic scientists to generate test results that produce convictions and BADT fees. The defendant argued that such a statutory system gives rise to an appearance of impropriety that violates her fundamental right to a fair trial guaranteed by both the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 8 of the Tennessee Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Twenty-two other persons charged in Hamilton County with an offense for which a BADT fee would be assessed upon conviction also filed motions to dismiss their indictments and suppress the results of blood alcohol testing. These persons had provided either a blood or breath sample to law enforcement. Blood samples were sent to the TBI forensic services division for testing. Breath samples were tested by a model EC/IR II breath analysis machine calibrated, maintained, and certified by the TBI. These persons raised the same constitutional challenge to the BADT fee statute as the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 1, 2014, three judges of the criminal courts for Hamilton County held a single joint hearing on all of these motions. At this joint hearing, counsel for the defendants acknowledged that the constitutional claim involved no allegations of actual unfair or inappropriate action on the part of any TBI forensic scientist and that no evidence of that sort would be presented at the hearing. Rather, the defendants explicitly premised their constitutional challenge solely on \"the appearance\" of impropriety and the \"potential\" for abuse resulting from the BADT fee statute creating in the TBI and TBI forensic scientists a \"financial interest\" to obtain convictions of certain offenses and collect BADT fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As evidence to support this constitutional claim, the defendants introduced a transcript of the testimony that former TBI Director Mark Gwyn (\"Director Gwyn\") provided the General Assembly's Senate Judiciary Committee on February 11, 2014. Director Gwyn provided the following overview of revenue generated from BADT fees and TBI expenses for forensic\n   testing of blood alcohol and drug content from 2009 to 2012:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 2009-Revenue: $999,000 and Expenses: $750,000\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 2010-Revenue: $1,011,000 and Expenses: $690,000\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 2011-Revenue: $1,500,000 and Expenses: $1,400,000\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 2012-Revenue: $2,500,000 and Expenses: $1,500,000\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   He explained that the total surplus of $1,600,000 for this four-year period had been used on equipment and training. He stated that, \"[i]n 2008, we were faced with some pretty deep cuts, cuts that would have at least caused us to do one of two things: [w]e would've had to shut down some disciplines with[in] our crime laboratory, or we would've had to start charging local law enforcement for testing.\" To avoid those options, the TBI asked the General Assembly to increase the BADT fee from $100 to $250. Director Gwyn acknowledged that the TBI had \"no way to project how many\" BADT fees would be collected in a given year or \"what type of expenses are going to go out.\" Director Gwyn emphasized that \"[f]orensic testing is very expensive.\" By increasing the BADT fee, Director Gwyn said that the TBI had been able to avoid \"lay[ing] off forensic scientists\" and had also avoided passing the cost of forensic testing \"back onto local law enforcement [which] could not pay it at the end of the day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When one state senator asked Director Gwyn whether earmarking BADT fees to the TBI via the Intoxicant Testing Fund might provide an inappropriate incentive for the TBI to do extra testing and raise additional money for its expenses, Director Gwyn responded, \"Absolutely not. There's no way to do any extra testing.\" The same senator then asked whether depositing BADT fees into the State's general fund might be preferable, as it would avoid any appearance of impropriety or basis for believing that the BADT fee was a \"revenue-generator.\" To this comment, Director Gwyn responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Yes. I mean, I think someone can say almost anything they want to say. You know, does a patrol officer out here calibrate his radar gun so it shows someone speeding at a higher rate of speed to write a ticket to generate revenue from tickets?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I think we just have to let our testing stand on its own. There's been plenty of trial and defense attorneys that have taken our toxicology and our blood alcohol exams, outsourced them to private laboratories.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Unfortunately, we had one incident in the Chattanooga area where a young forensic scientist made a mistake. He paid for that mistake. He was dismissed. We've outsourced all of the cases that [the dismissed forensic scientist] had worked. We have 2,000 of them back, and there's been no other mistake.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   So, obviously, we don't want the appearance that we're doing anything wrong. We're an open book. We're as transparent as it can be, and we welcome anybody to come in and outsource any type of testing that they would like to see.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   We just felt like that, on a conviction, part of the court fee could go to this so that we would not have to bring it back on local law enforcement and hurt them in that way, with some of them not being able to fund [these tests]. This type of testing is very expensive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The [BADT fees were] not meant to make [the] TBI rich. And, as you can see, with a million and something left over, that could be used up probably in about two instruments within the laboratory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   So, but, at the will of whatever the [L]egislature thinks, you know, obviously, I will abide by that. But, you know, and I guess that's the best answer. I mean, we don't want any negative hanging over our head, obviously.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Another defense exhibit at the joint hearing contained the TBI's financial report for the Intoxicant Testing Fund. This report reflected (consistently with Director Gwyn's testimony) that revenue from the Intoxicant Testing Fund had been used to support \"TBI operating expenditures in all its divisions, which include travel, training, supplies and equipment\" and that \"[i]n any given year, when revenue exceeds expenditures, those [surplus] funds are reserved, as directed by Tennessee Code Annotated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Director Gwyn provided written stipulations in lieu of a personal appearance and testimony at the joint hearing. Director Gwyn stated that increasing the BADT fee from $100 to $250 in 2010 had been \"necessary to offset state budget cuts that would have severely hampered state law enforcement efforts.\" He stated that, in fiscal year 2008-2009, \"the actual cost to [the] TBI for each test of bodily fluids for ethyl alcohol was approximately $84,\" and \"[the] cost for each test of bodily fluids for drugs was approximately $275.\" Director Gwyn estimated that eight special agent positions and eight special agent/forensic scientist positions \"were in jeopardy\" if the BADT fee had not been increased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Director Gwyn also clarified that the ethyl alcohol retesting performed by an independent lab at the flat fee of $35 for each sample among the large batch of samples initially tested by a TBI forensic scientist who mistakenly switched two blood samples was \"not comparable with the total toxicological services\" the TBI provides. For example, he explained that this flat $35 rate \"did not include any courtroom testimony\" and that the scope of the testing \"was clearly defined and restricted to ethyl alcohol-a luxury that [the] TBI is not afforded.\" According to Director Gwyn, between thirty-five and forty percent of samples submitted to the TBI for toxicological analysis \"require a full drug screen in addition to ethyl alcohol analysis.\" Director Gwyn also characterized courtroom testimony provided by TBI forensic scientists as \"a significant expense due to employees' time spent preparing to testify, travel time, fuel and vehicle expenses, hotel and per diem if necessary, employees' time spent waiting to testify, and actual testimony time.\" He stated that, over the prior six months, TBI forensic scientists had \"spent an average of 80.6 hours per month testifying about test results as expert witnesses.\" Because testifying is a significant part of a TBI forensic scientist's job, the TBI spends \"significant time and money training to maintain the expertise of these employees,\" including an annual training budget for the toxicology unit of $60,000. New employees are required to train for twelve-to-eighteen months before they are allowed to work independently, and during training they receive \"a salary without producing case work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Director Gwyn reiterated that BADT fees \"are used for all TBI agency operational costs as permitted by Tennessee's statutes.\" He also reiterated that, even though a defendant is assessed a single BADT fee upon conviction, \"[t]he conviction may be based on a breath alcohol analysis, a blood alcohol analysis performed on the subject's bodily fluid sample, a drug screen performed on the subject's bodily fluid sample, or a combination of testing. The type of testing performed is unrelated to the fee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The defense also introduced as exhibits TBI documents titled \"Budget Presentation\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   for fiscal years 2010-2011, 2011-2012, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014. These documents had been provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee of the Tennessee General Assembly, along with an oral presentation by Director Gwyn and other TBI personnel. In fiscal year 2010-2011, the TBI had a total budget request of $63,000,000, and the forensic services division had conducted 270,000 laboratory tests on 83,000 pieces of evidence. In fiscal year 2011-2012, the TBI had a total budget request of $64,970,600, and the forensic services division had conducted 315,600 laboratory tests on 80,000 pieces of evidence. In fiscal year 2012-2013, the TBI had a total budget request of $66,000,000 and the forensic services division had conducted 331,125 laboratory tests on 82,872 pieces of evidence. In 2013-2014, the TBI had a total budget request of $70,000,000. The record does not contain information about the number of tests the forensic services division conducted that fiscal year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The defendants also presented evidence about the TBI forensic scientist who had been fired for switching two blood samples.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the proof, this forensic scientist failed to follow TBI protocol and mistakenly switched two blood samples. This mistake resulted in a person with an actual blood alcohol content of 0.01% being charged with vehicular homicide based on the other person's blood alcohol content of 0.24%. When the State discovered the error, it moved to dismiss the charge. The TBI fired the forensic scientist and sent all samples he had tested to an outside laboratory for retesting. In a letter introduced as a defense exhibit, TBI Assistant Director Robert Royse stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   On October 3, 2013[,] TBI was notified of a discrepancy in blood alcohol testing results. Both an independent and an internal reanalysis of the data associated with these samples indicate that [a single forensic scientist] inadvertently switched two blood tubes at the time of analysis. While all indications were that this was an isolated incident, confidence in the results issued by our Laboratory is of paramount importance to the TBI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Therefore, arrangements were made for an independent laboratory to reanalyze every positive Blood Alcohol Analysis performed by this examiner. Through the State of Tennessee's competitive bidding process AIT Laboratories was awarded the contract for retesting, which totaled 2,827 samples. The scope of this independent laboratory retesting was to determine if any samples had been switched by [the forensic scientist]. Review of these 2,827 retested samples indicates that in all other cases the correct blood sample was originally analyzed by TBI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The defendants emphasized that there were variations between the results of the TBI testing and the results of the independent laboratory retesting. In some cases, the independent laboratory retesting showed a blood alcohol content of less than the 0.08% threshold necessary for DUI per se or less than the 0.20% threshold necessary for enhanced punishment. The State responded that in most cases the independent laboratory retesting reflected blood alcohol content levels higher than the TBI's initial testing results. Additionally, TBI Assistant Director Royse explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Some variation should be expected between any two scientific measurements. When comparing the retested data one must consider that ethyl alcohol is a volatile compound and many factors such as sample age, volume of sample\n   available for retesting, sample condition, and the number of times the blood tube has been opened may influence the results. Additionally, it must be noted that the supplied TBI result is the lower of two analyses and has been truncated from four decimal points supplied by the analytical instrument down to two decimal places for reporting purposes; therefore any statistical comparison between truncated and non-truncated data may be problematic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Also testifying at the joint hearing for the defendants were two defense attorneys specializing in DUI defense. Attorney Raymond W. Fraley, who practiced law in Lincoln County at the time of the hearing in 2014, had handled over 2000 DUI cases. Mr. Fraley described the increased emphasis on the results of forensic testing of blood and breath samples in DUI prosecutions and the increased number of offenses and penalties that can be established with proof of blood alcohol test results alone. Mr. Fraley opined that TBI test results greatly influence judges and prosecutors and often determine whether a defendant goes to trial or enters a guilty plea. Mr. Fraley viewed the BADT fee statute as impinging on the right to a fair trial. He did not consider cross-examination of TBI forensic scientists about the BADT fee statute a sufficient safeguard, partly because eighty-five percent of DUI cases settle prior to trial. Mr. Fraley also disagreed that the availability of independent testing of blood and urine samples\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   sufficiently protects a defendant's right to fair trial. He characterized independent testing as \"moderately inexpensive\" and said that, in his experience, most clients who had consumed any alcohol before being stopped did not pursue independent testing. Mr. Fraley estimated that only fifteen to twenty percent of his clients seek independent testing, and he theorized that errors in TBI forensic testing are likely often never discovered because of the infrequency of independent testing. Mr. Fraley acknowledged, however, that of his clients who had sought independent testing, none of the independent test results had ever differed from the TBI's initial test results. Mr. Fraley also acknowledged that the TBI has implemented a policy of duplicate testing of blood samples, which he characterized as \"good science.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Attorney Lloyd Levitt, who practiced in Hamilton County and had handled over 1000 DUI cases at the time of the hearing in 2014, described the TBI's blood alcohol test results as \"the driving factor in any DUI case.\" Mr. Levitt stated that a 2012 change in Tennessee law mandating blood tests when an impaired person kills or injures another person resulted in \"a huge increase in blood testing.\" According to Mr. Levitt, the increased number of blood samples submitted for testing after the 2012 change in the law had overwhelmed the TBI forensic services division and had resulted in a four to five month delay in receiving results from blood alcohol testing. Receipt of test results could be delayed for more than a year if retesting was required. Mr. Levitt agreed that the increased number of blood samples submitted for forensic testing had translated to the TBI receiving more money from the $250 BADT fee assessed upon each conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, defense counsel acknowledged that no evidence of actual TBI bias had been presented and that no evidence had been offered to establish that TBI forensic scientists manipulate blood alcohol tests to generate more convictions and more BADT fees. The defendants\n   contended, however, that they had shown an appearance of impropriety and that this showing was sufficient to establish the statute's constitutional invalidity. The defendants maintained that the separate statute declaring TBI test results prima facie admissible in any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding exacerbates the appearance of impropriety created by the BADT fee statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2038-6-103\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 38-6-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). The defendants argued that, just as paying a trial judge a $250 bounty for each conviction violates the state and federal constitutional due process guarantees, so too does paying the TBI a $250 bounty contingent upon conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   By a single order entered December 11, 2014, the three trial judges denied the defense motions for suppression and dismissal but granted the defendants the right to a jury instruction concerning the financial interest the BADT fee statute creates in the TBI obtaining convictions. In so holding, the trial judges described the TBI's financial interest in BADT fees as \"not negligible\" and \"very large\" in the aggregate. The trial judges nevertheless rejected the defendants' constitutional challenge, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Presumably, it is impossible to calibrate breath-test machines to overstate any positive result. Thus, no financial interest on the calibrator's part can affect the results of breath tests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   As for blood tests, presumably, despite the evidence of acknowledged and unacknowledged errors in blood tests, it is impossible to calibrate blood-test machines to overstate any positive result. The sole acknowledged error in the record was a transposition error; perhaps the unacknowledged errors in the record lie within the margin of error. Presumably, too, despite the statement in the reports in the record that \"[t]he above represents the interpretations and opinions of the analyst[,\"] blood tests are subject to minimal, if any, interpretation or opinion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Although deliberate falsifications attributable to financial interest remain a possibility, presumably, what protects defendants from accidental transposition errors also protects them from deliberate falsifications: the availability of independent analysis of blood, at state expense in appropriate cases, and the availability of underlying \"technical notes and data\" that, according to a statement in the reports in the record, the laboratory maintains in its case records. Thus, the financial interest in obtaining DUI convictions is offset by financial and other interests in continuing to have employment and avoiding criminal liability, making the possibility of a deliberate falsification attributable to financial interest remote without necessarily changing defendants' calculations regarding the advisability of independent analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   After this order was entered, the trial judge initially assigned to Ms. Decosimo's case retired, and two successor trial judges recused themselves. Senior Judge Paul G. Summers was then designated to hear the case, and the defendant renewed her motion. The defendant relied on the evidence\n   presented at the August 2014 hearing, but she also introduced evidence from the TBI's March 3, 2015 budget hearing before the General Assembly's Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as letters and charts from the Tennessee Department of Revenue containing data about BADT fee collections from 2005 to 2016. BADT fees collected over this\n   <em>\n    eleven-year\n   </em>\n   period totaled $22,059,970.90. In his March 3, 2015 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Director Gwyn stated that the TBI had a total\n   <em>\n    annual\n   </em>\n   budget of $70,000,000.00. Other TBI officials testified that same day that BADT fee collections averaged approximately $3,000,000 per year-less than five percent of the TBI's total budget. In one letter, a representative of the Department of Revenue explained that no data showed \"which portion of the total amount of the BADT fees collected is the result of a DUI or reckless driving conviction\" and that no data showed the year of conviction because court costs may be paid \"in installments over time,\" meaning \"the BADT fee may be spread out over multiple years, or even not paid at all if the individual is unable to pay the court costs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Upon considering all the evidence, the Senior Judge denied the defendant's renewed motion for suppression and dismissal. The defendant then entered a nolo contendere plea to DUI per se and reserved the following certified question of law for appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Whether the trial court erred in not dismissing this case, or alternatively, suppressing the blood alcohol evidence without which the State could not proceed against the defendant on this DUI per se conviction, where T.C.A. \u00a7 55-10-413(f) is unconstitutional in violation of due process and rights to a fair trial under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and under article I, sections 8 and 9 of the Tennessee Constitution based on the fact that the [TBI] receives a $250 BADT/BAT fee in every case in which a conviction is obtained for driving under the influence or other listed offense, wherein a TBI blood test or TBI-calibrated breath test result is used, thereby creating a \"contingent-fee-dependent system\" susceptible to bias because the TBl's testing and interpretation of these tests play the determinative role in the prosecution of the charge, and a jury instruction regarding this statutory incentive in favor of conviction is insufficient to cure the magnitude of the constitutional violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The State dismissed all other charges against the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court of Criminal Appeals resolved the certified question by holding that the BADT fee statute violates \"due process principles.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

TBI forensic scientists are not judges. They do not perform judicial or quasi-judicial functions. They do not hear witnesses or rule on disputed factual or legal questions or determine guilt or innocence. Judges and jurors perform these tasks. Indeed, their responsibilities are much more different from persons exercising judicial authority than were the responsibilities of the assistant regional administrator in\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   . For example, TBI forensic scientists have absolutely no control over procuring evidence,\n   making arrests, or initiating prosecutions. They simply perform scientific tests on evidence samples submitted to them by law enforcement. Law enforcement officers make arrests. Unlike judicial officials and prosecutors, TBI forensic scientists exercise \"minimal, if any interpretation or opinion\" when conducting blood alcohol testing. They are required to conduct scientific tests in accordance with uniform procedures and standards the TBI forensic services division is required by statute to adopt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2038-6-103\">\n    Tenn.

For all these reasons, we conclude that TBI forensic scientists are not judicial officials to whom the\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   requirements apply and are at least one step farther removed from having adjudicatory responsibilities than are prosecutors and the assistant regional administrator in\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   .

The record does contain proof that increasing the BADT fee from $100 to $250 allowed the TBI to avoid laying off eight forensic scientists, but, like the mayor in Dugan and unlike the mayor in\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   , the TBI forensic scientists had no management authority or \"executive power[ ]\" to determine how increased BADT fees would be allocated. Indeed, despite the defendant's emphasis of the fact that BADT fees are deposited into the Intoxicant Toxicant Testing Fund and do not revert to the State's general fund, we note that the BADT fee statute requires the monies to \"be invested pursuant to [Tennessee Code Annotated section] 9-4-603\" and \"remain available for appropriation to the Tennessee bureau of investigation,\n   <em>\n    as determined by the [G]eneral [A]ssembly\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2055-10-413\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 55-10-413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3)(B) (emphasis added). This statutory provision indicates that the General Assembly, rather than the TBI director, retained ultimate control over appropriating these funds to the TBI and determining the uses to which the TBI could put these funds. Indeed, the BADT fee statute describes many purposes for which the Intoxicant Testing Fund may be used, in addition to hiring and retaining TBI forensic scientists. The proof also indicates that BADT fees were indeed used to fund operations in all divisions of the TBI, not just the forensic services division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   More importantly, unlike the mayor-judges in\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   and the justice of the peace in\n   <em>\n    Connally\n   </em>\n   , TBI forensic scientists have no control whatsoever over the imposition or collection of BADT fees. As already noted, TBI forensic scientists do not make arrests. Although they perform scientific tests on evidence, they do so pursuant to statutorily mandated uniform standards and procedures and utilize scientific equipment that produces results that do not depend upon the subjective judgments of the TBI forensic scientists. Although they report the results of scientific testing to law enforcement, TBI forensic scientists do not decide whether criminal charges are brought. If criminal charges are brought, TBI forensic scientists do not determine whether an offense to which the BADT fee statute applies will or will not be charged. If a BADT fee statute offense is charged, TBI forensic scientists do not decide whether a defendant will be allowed to plead guilty to a lesser or different criminal offense. All of these tasks are performed by prosecutors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Even if a defendant is charged with an offense to which the BADT fee statute applies, TBI forensic scientists have no control over when the case will be resolved. Indeed, many months, or even years, may pass between a TBI forensic scientist reporting the results of blood alcohol testing and a trial or plea that resolves the case with conviction of an offense that triggers\n   <em>\n    imposition\n   </em>\n   of a BADT fee. Even if a TBI forensic scientist could predict when a case would be resolved by a conviction, the TBI forensic scientist cannot predict when, or even if, a BADT fee will be collected. The record clearly establishes that not even the TBI can predict how many BADT fees actually will be collected in any given year, regardless of how many have been imposed. The record also establishes that some BADT fees are paid by installments or never paid at all, when defendants are indigent. Given the lack of control TBI forensic scientists have over the lengthy and uncertain processes that must occur after blood alcohol test results are reported before any BADT fees are imposed or collected, any institutional financial incentive the BADT fee statute creates is far too remote to qualify as a possible temptation to a reasonable TBI forensic scientist to manipulate blood alcohol test results. Indeed, such a remote institutional financial incentive is far outweighed by the personal, direct, and substantial pecuniary financial interest that salaried TBI forensic scientists have in continued employment.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aetna Life Ins.

Indeed, the record on appeal illustrates that mistakes, even a single mistake, may well lead to a TBI forensic scientist's dismissal and may result in substantial administrative costs to the TBI for retesting samples initially tested by the dismissed forensic scientist. The TBI as an institution and individual TBI forensic scientists have much more to lose than to gain by altering or fabricating evidence in an attempt to increase convictions and generate BADT fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   With the availability of independent testing, the uniform scientific standards applicable to the TBI's forensic testing, the TBI's internal review mechanisms, and the TBI's response to a forensic scientist who made a mistake, it strains logic to suggest that a reasonable forensic scientist would engage in criminal, unethical, and career-ending conduct to alter or fabricate forensic scientific test results on the hope that: (1) the test results\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   lead to criminal charges of a BADT fee offense; (2) the criminal charges\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   result in conviction of a BADT fee offense; (3) the BADT fee\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   be collected expeditiously; (4) the TBI director\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   use BADT fees to retain the TBI forensic scientist instead of using the monies for some other\n   statutorily permissible purpose; and (5) the General Assembly will not appropriate the BADT fees to another purpose within the TBI. Indeed, only an irrational and unreasonable TBI forensic scientist would risk losing a salaried position and continued employment in this manner when BADT fees amount to less than five percent of the TBI's overall budget.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In summary then, even applying the rigid\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   requirements, any institutional financial incentive the BADT fee statute creates is far too remote to constitute a possible temptation to any reasonable forensic scientist to manipulate or falsify test results to increase conviction rates and generate BADT fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The defendant urges us to hold that the Tennessee Constitution provides greater protection than the United States Constitution and entitles her to relief on her due process claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court is the final arbiter of the Tennessee Constitution and may interpret state constitutional provisions more broadly than corresponding provisions of the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This appeal involves neither scenario. It involves only a facial constitutional challenge to a statute based on an allegation that the BADT fee statute creates financial incentives for the TBI, and in particular TBI forensic scientists, to provide blood alcohol test results that produce convictions and generate BADT fees. As already explained, this allegation lacks merit for three reasons: (1) the\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   requirements of neutrality that govern the due process analysis under both the state and federal constitutions do not apply because the TBI forensic scientists do not exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions; and (2) even evaluated against the strict\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   requirements, the defendant's constitutional challenge fails because the BADT fee statute does not provide TBI forensic scientists with either a direct, personal, substantial pecuniary interest or a sufficiently substantial institutional financial incentive that qualifies as a possible temptation to any reasonable forensic scientist to falsify or alter test results to produce more convictions and BADT fees; and (3) the BADT fee statute does not create a situation comparable to an expert witness contingency fee arrangement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Although we reject the defendant's constitutional claim, we acknowledge that the General Assembly could have devised a \"more felicitious way\" to provide funding.\n   <em>\n    Kaipat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11333042\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/574/#p574\">\n    94 F.3d at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the Legislature has now done just that by amending the BADT fee statute, effective May 21, 2018. We applaud this timely action by the Legislature to eliminate the grounds on which the defendant based her claim of a statutory appearance of impropriety and her constitutional challenge. However, it remains our own judicial obligation to determine, based on relevant precedent, whether the statute deprives the defendant of due process guaranteed by both the federal and the state constitutions. We conclude that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   We reiterate that this decision addresses only the statute that existed prior to May 21, 2018, the effective date of the legislation amending the BADT fee statute to eliminate the bases of the defendant's constitutional challenge. We note that this decision neither mandates nor precludes\n   cross-examination of TBI forensic scientists about the BADT fee statute or the giving of a jury instruction regarding this issue. We leave the resolution of these matters to the sound discretion of trial judges to determine on a case-by-case basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
