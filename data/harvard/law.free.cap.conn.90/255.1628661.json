Mahoney, was awarded compensation as a dependent upon his son, Leo Ma-honey, who died in consequence of an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment by the respondent. The deceased was a boy fifteen years old earning $3.50 a week. The father was a man of forty years, and until about five months before the boy\u2019s death was employed as a master mechanic. . During the last two years of his employment he suffered from a double inguinal hernia, and became for that reason incapacitated from earning any substantial amount for about five months before the son\u2019s injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-9\">Leo Mahoney lived with his father, and the family included the mother and two minor children. Leo brought all of his wages home and gave them to his father. At and before the time of the injury the father \u25a0had no income except the boy\u2019s earnings, and the family expenses during the five months of the father\u2019s idleness, and at the' time of the boy\u2019s injury, were paid out of the boy\u2019s wages and out of accumulated.savings and borrowed money. It did not appear that the expense of the boy\u2019s support, as the family were living at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>time of the injury, was less than $3.50 per week. It is found that the father\u2019s condition \u201ccalled for and now calls for an operation,\u201d but that owing to a supposed unfavorable family history he was and is unwilling to submit to an operation. Other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-6\"><em>Ralph O.

Mahoney was dependent upon his son Leo. Dependency is to be determined under our Act (Public Acts of 1913, chapter 138, \u00a7 10, p. 1739) in accordance with the fact as the fact may be at the time of the injury; and dependents are defined as members of the injured family or next of kin who were wholly or partly dependent on the earnings of the employee at the time of his injury. The respondent\u2019s claim is, that the true inquiry is whether the deceased was a financial asset to the alleged dependent, and that the mere fact that the boy\u2019s earnings entered the common family fund is not material unless those earnings exceeded the cost of his maintenance. The burden of proof, it is said, is upon the claimant, and that on the finding it has not been established that the expense of the boy\u2019s support was less than his weekly wage; hence, it is claimed, there is no legal foundation for the finding of dependency.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The respondent\u2019s contention finds support in two English cases of partial dependency. <em>Main Colliery Co., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>L. R. (1900) App. Cas. 358; <em>Tamworth Colliery Co., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>L. R. (1911) App. Cas. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>665. The English Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act provides that in cases of partial dependency the amount recoverable shall be reasonable \u201cand proportionate to the injury to the said dependents.\u201d This language required the English courts, in cases of partial dependency, to look into the question whether the deceased was a financial asset and whether his death was a financial injury to the dependent. On the other hand, our Act makes the sole test one of dependency upon the earnings of the deceased at the time of the injury, and fixes the minimum award in cases where the injury results in death at $5 per week. We are not, therefore, required in this case to strike a balance between the boy\u2019s earnings and the cost of his maintenance, with a view to ascertaining whether his death was a financial injury to the father. We are only to determine whether, at the time of the injury, the father was dependent upon the boy\u2019s earnings within the meaning of the Act. As to this we think there can be no doubt. It was the father\u2019s duty to support the boy, and it was his right to receive the boy\u2019s wages. The boy did not, as the respondent argues, give to the father his pay envelope in exchange for maintenance. Nor did the father maintain the boy in exchange for his wages. The boy\u2019s wages belonged to the father. Whatever earnings the boy turned over to his father were used by the father in discharging his legal obligation to support his family; and as the father had no other income at the time of the injury, he was plainly dependent on the boy\u2019s earnings for his means of living, within the definition laid down in <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Hotel Bond Co., </em>89 Conn. 143, 152, 93 Atl. 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The next question is whether the father was entitled to compensation on the ground of physical disability for a period in excess of that reasonably required to complete the cure of his hernia. The attempt is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>apply to a dependent, whose dependency is due to physical incapacity, the same rule that has been applied to an employee who refuses to undergo medical or surgical treatment which will relieve or remove his incapacity to work at his trade. In such cases the rule laid down in England and recently in Massachusetts, <em>Floccher\u2019s Case, </em>221 Mass. 54, 108 N. E. 1032, seems to be that unless the claimant by reason of some idiosyncracy will be subjected to unusual risk and danger thereby, it is his duty to submit to a surgical operation if it fairly and reasonably appears that the result of such operation will be a real and substantial physical gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">We think, however, that this record does not present any findings of fact which call for a determination of that question at this time. The finding that Michael F. Mahoney\u2019s condition \u201ccalled for and now calls for an operation,\u201d is not sufficiently definite to enable us to say that the rule, if we should adopt it, ought to be applied to this case. There ought to be an explicit finding of the probable favorable result of the operation and of the unreasonable refusal to submit to such operation, before it can be said that the right to continued compensation has been lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The respondent also claims that, because \u00a7 10 of the Act provides that a husband shall be conclusively presumed to be totally dependent upon a wife with whom he lives at the time of her injury, and since such dependency could not be created by the injury, there is established by the Act a conclusive presumption of mutual and total dependency in every case where husband and wife live together. From this it is argued that the claimant could not have been totally dependent upon his minor son also. The answer is that the dependency of a husband upon a wife is based upon a presumption which may not be true in fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>which does not arise until the wife is injured, and that the Act further provides that \"in all other cases questions of dependency, total or partial, shall be determined in accordance with the fact, as the fact may be at the time of the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">There is one reason of appeal which we think is well taken, and it relates to the fact that an operation was performed upon the boy in the attempt to save his life. The operation was performed by Doctor Verdi, and before Doctor Verdi was consulted Doctor Slattery was originally summoned by the claimant to perform the operation and left his office during office hours for the purpose of performing it. In the meantime Doctor Verdi had been engaged and for that reason Doctor Slattery acted merely as assistant. The finding of the commissioner is that \"under ordinary circumstances a charge of twenty-five dollars for an assistant would be ample, but under the circumstances of this case fifty dollars is a reasonable charge.\u201d We think the respondent cannot be answerable for the additional charge of $25 under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">There is error in part and the cause is remanded to the Superior Court with direction to modify its judgment to conform to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
