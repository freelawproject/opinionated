This intent need not be formed before or at the moment of separation; if it is formed afterward and is then acted on, the abandonment is then complete.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b224-11\">While a separation of husband and wife pursuant to agreement does not amount to an \u201cabandonment,\u201d the mere existence of such an agreement does not, under \u00a7 391, constitute a \u201csufficient cause\u201d for an actual, total renunciation of marital rights and duties, continued for years and until the death of one spouse, accompanied with adulterous conduct meanwhile upon the part of the surviving claimant.

About 1886 Rubin came to this country, and in 1889 or 1890 the plaintiff and the children joined him here. The plaintiff and Rubin continued to live together as husband and wife until the spring of 1893, when, in consequence of domestic quarrels which finally culminated in Rubin calling the plaintiff a vile name and telling her to get out, the plaintiff left Rubin and his home. About two months afterward Rubin and the plaintiff, who are both of the orthodox Jewish faith, went before a rabbi in Brooklyn, who, after an ineffectual attempt at reconciliation, performed the ceremony of rabbinical divorce. Shortly afterward Rubin contracted a rabbinical marriage with another woman; and later, in the same year, the plaintiff also contracted a rabbinical marriage with one Kantor, with whom she has ever since lived, and still lives, as his wife, and to whom she has borne two children. Rubin died intestate, in South Windsor, in August, 1911, and the plaintiff applied to the Court of Probate claiming to be his lawful widow and, as such, entitled to her statutory share of his estate under \u00a7 391 of the General Statutes. The Court of Probate held that she was not entitled to her widow\u2019s share, on the ground that she had abandoned Rubin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>without sufficient cause and continued such abandonment until his d\u00e9ath. From this decree the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, which dismissed the appeal because it reached the conclusion that the plaintiff, without sufficient cause, abandoned Solomon Rubin as her husband, if he was ever legally her husband, and continued such abandonment to the time of Rubin\u2019s death, and therefore was not entitled to any share in his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-6\">The material portion of \u00a7 391 reads as follows: \u201cNor shall either party be entitled to such statutory share who, without sufficient cause, had abandoned the other, and had continued such abandonment to the time of the other\u2019s death.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b226-7\"><em>Charles D.

The reason for this omission appears from the record to be that the trial court, at or near the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, suggested that the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony had made out a clear case of abandonment on her part, and that it would therefore be unnecessary to pass upon the validity of the Russian marriage. The appellee, acting on that suggestion, offered no evidence. In thus failing to pass upon the validity of the Russian marriage there was no error, especially none of which the plaintiff can complain; for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the determination of the case upon the sole ground of abandonment, necessarily assumed that the plaintiff was Rubin\u2019s widow, and we shall assume that to be the fact on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Some of the exceptions for refusals to find as requested seem to proceed on the erroneous- theory that the office of the finding is to recite evidence; and as we look at the case, none of the exceptions to the finding are material.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Abandonment is a question of fact, and the finding or conclusion of the trial court is conclusive of that fact. Abandonment of a wife has been defined by this court as the act of a husband who voluntarily leaves his wife with an intention not to return to her and not to resume his marital duties toward her or to claim his marital rights. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>27 Conn. 14, 25. The intent to permanently discard all marital rights and duties need not be formed before or at the moment of separation. It may be formed afterward, and if then acted on, the abandonment is complete. This plaintiff has twice solemnly and ceremonially renounced all her marital rights and duties toward Rubin, once by the rabbinical divorce of 1893, and again by the rabbinical marriage to Kantor in the same year; and for seventeen years has lived with Kantor as his wife, has borne him children, and still continues to live with him. A more complete case of an actual abandonment of the lawful husband cannot well be imagined.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">But the plaintiff claims that in point of law there can be no abandonment of a wife or husband based upon the consent of the abandoned party. She claims that the original separation was at the invitation or command of Rubin; that the rabbinical divorce of 1893 was in legal effect an agreement by the parties for a permanent separation, with permission to marry again according to the custom of their religion; and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>subsequent rabbinical marriage of the plaintiff to <em>Kantor, </em>followed by seventeen years of married life in Kantor\u2019s home, being with the consent of the lawful husband, could not in law amount to the abandonment of him. The principle relied on is stated by Bishop as follows: <em>\u201cA </em>married partner who concurs in the other\u2019s going away cannot complain of the going. In consequence whereof, a separation by the mutual consent of the parties is not desertion in either.\u201d 1 Bishop on Marriage, Divorce &amp; Separation, \u00a7 1690.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We think, however, that the principle rests on broader grounds than those of estoppel, and that the underlying reason why separation by mutual consent can never amount to desertion which will give ground for a divorce, is that the State has an interest in the maintenance of the marital status and in the mutual observance of its essential obligations. <em>Boland </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>72 Conn. 217, 220, 44 Atl. 15. It is alleged, on the authority of <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clement, </em>71 N. H. 5, 51 Atl. 256, that an agreement for separation between husband and wife conclusively establishes that at the time of the agreement the husband did not abandon his wife; and further that there can be no abandonment of the wife so long as she continues to consent to the separation. We agree, of course, that an agreement for separation cannot, in and of itself, work an abandonment, nor will a continued separation in pursuance of such a contract amount to an abandonment unless and until some independent fact intervenes\u2014such as the wife\u2019s adultery in this case\u2014from, which the abandonment may begin to run; but we cannot agree that such an agreement is in point of law a sufficient cause, under our statute, for a total actual abandonment of marital rights and duties continued up to the death of one of the consorts. In this case, for example, the wife has been guilty of conduct which, but for this supposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>agreement for separation, would admittedly forfeit her statutory share in her husband\u2019s intestate estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Turning now to the consideration of \u00a7 391, the plaintiff\u2019s argument assumes that the word \u201cabandonment\u201d in this section means the same thing as the word \u201cdesertion\u201d in our divorce statute, \u00a74551. On the other hand, the defendant claims that the word \u201cabandonment\u201d in \u00a7 391 means the same thing as the same word in \u00a7 4543, which deals with the property rights and personal rights of a wife married before April 20th, 1877, when abandoned by her husband. It was held in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>27 Conn. 14, 25, that the word \u201cabandonment\u201d in the Act of 1853, now \u00a74543, referred to an abandonment in fact, not necessarily a desertion within the meaning of our divorce statute. Section 391 must also be so construed in order to effectuate its obvious purpose, namely, the protection of intestate estates from the technical but unj ust claims of surviving husbands and wives who have, without sufficient cause, abandoned their marital rights and duties and continued such abandonment to the time of the other\u2019s death. Again, the language of \u00a7 391 shows that it was not intended to be limited to cases of desertion, for the very suggestion that there may be \u201csufficient cause\u201d for abandonment indicates that the latter word includes abandonments which may, as well as those which may not, be justifiable according to the circumstances of the particular case. Thus, an absence from the husband\u2019s home continued so long as to require the conclusion that it was intended to be final and permanent, might, nevertheless, be justified by showing that the wife was driven away by intolerable cruelty, and continued to live apart from a reasonable fear of its renewal. It may be that such an absence, unaccompanied by aggravating circumstances, would be justified by showing that it was in pursuance of a mutual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>agreement for separation, especially if the wife still remained dependent upon the husband for support, or the continuance of the marital status was otherwise recognized-</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">But <em>\u201ca </em>voluntary separation is not a license to commit adultery\u201d <em>(Franklin </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>154 Mass. 515, 517, 28 N. E. 681), and if the wife, after such an agreement for separation, lived in adultery with another man up to the death of her lawful husband, that would surely amount to an abandonment \u201cwithout sufficient cause,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 391. In <em>Wildman </em>v. <em>Wildman, </em>72 Conn. 262, 271, 44 Atl. 224, we said \u201cit would not be fraudulent to deprive an unfaithful wife of dower\u201d; and for the same reason it must follow that a widow who was absent from her husband at the time of his death, by his consent, would not be entitled to dower, under \u00a7 386, if it were shown that she had been living in adultery during such absence. The argument applies with equal force to \u00a7 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">This plaintiff, by throwing aside the mantle of her religion and claiming now to be the lawful widow of Rubin, necessarily characterizes her rabbinical marriage with Kantor as adulterous; and if we regard the rabbinical divorce of 1893 as an agreement for a permanent separation, it is not a sufficient cause for the plaintiff\u2019s living in adultery with Kantor until Rubin\u2019s death. The fact that Rubin himself has contracted a rabbinical marriage which was in law adulterous, will not help the plaintiff, for although two wrongs may sometimes bar a remedy, they do not make a right. Of course, the plaintiff can have no standing in this or any other court founded on the claim that the rabbinical divorce was a mutual license to commit adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">It seems to us that this case presents an \u00e1bandonment within the meaning of the statute. The rabbinical divorce between Rubin and the plaintiff was a separa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>tion with intent never to resume their marital rights or duties, and that intent was clinched by the subsequent rabbinical marriages of both parties. In point of fact the abandonment by the plaintiff was complete and continued up to the death; and to permit the plaintiff to share in the estate which Rubin accumulated during the seventeen years while she was living as the wife of another man, and so to diminish the shares of Rubin\u2019s children, would be to perpetuate the very injustice which the legislature intended to prevent. Moreover, the finding is that the plaintiff is still living with Kantor, as his wife, and it is not impossible, though we express no opinion on the point, that in case of Kantor\u2019s death she might claim her widow\u2019s share of his estate. See <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>68 N. J. Eq. 736, 62 Atl. 680, 3 L. R. A. (N. S.) 244 and note.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
