Shortly thereafter a conservator was appointed by the same court upon the inebriate\u2019s own application in which she alleged her residence to be in Stamford. <em>Held </em>that in view of these facts it could not be said as matter of law that the court erred in finding that the inebriate was, at the time of her commitment, a \u201cresident\u201d of Stamford within the meaning of \u00a7 2744 of the General Statutes authorizing the commitment of one who was a \u201cresident of or domiciled within the probate district.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b544-6\">One who invokes the action of a Court of Probate, alleging his residence within the probate district, will not afterward be permitted to deny the truthfulness of that allegation and challenge the jurisdiction of the court in that proceeding upon the ground of his nonresidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b544-7\">Courts of Probate in this State possess only such powers as are expressly or by implication conferred upon them by statute.

Prior to March 26th, 1914, all resided at Dobbs Ferry, New York. On this day Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Schutte was an habitual drunkard. She was then living with Mr. and Mrs. Mattern. On this day Mrs. Schutte was found lying in an intoxicated condition in the railroad station at Dobbs Ferry, and there remained from 10 a. m. until 3 p. m., when Mr. Mattern was notified, went to the station and placed her in the ladies\u2019 room of the station. He returned to his school and when it was dismissed advised with Doctor Barry, and acting upon his advice, and with the object of benefiting Mrs. Schutte, arranged to place her in Dr. Givens\u2019 sanitarium in Stamford. He then hired an automobile and in company with Dr. Barry drove to Dr. Givens\u2019 sanitarium and arrived there in the evening of the 26th. When Mrs. Schutte arrived at Dr. Givens\u2019 she was informed of her whereabouts, and was told by Dr. Givens that she could not remain in the sanitarium unless she signed a voluntary commitment, which was a request for treatment in his institution. She had so far recovered as to understand her act, and she thereupon signed the voluntary commitment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-6\">Thereafter Dr. Givens prepared, upon information furnished by Mr. Mattern, an application addressed to the Court of Probate for the district of Stamford, petitioning for the commitment of Mrs. Schutte to an inebriate asylum, and Mr. Mattern signed this. In this application Mr. Mattern was described as a brother of Mrs. Schutte, when in fact he was a brother-in-law. Mr. Mattern signed the application upon the advice of Dr. Givens that a relative, under the statute under which the application was brought, was any person connected with the alleged inebriate by blood or marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-7\">The Court of Probate made an order for due service of and hearing upon this application, and service was made upon Mrs. Schutte at Dr. Givens\u2019 sanitarium in accordance with the order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-8\">On the morning of the 27th, Dr. Givens presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>to Mrs. Schutte a second voluntary commitment which, after its details were explained to her, she signed. At this time Mrs. Schutte was normal, sober and knew exactly what she was doing. Dr. Givens\u2019 motive in presenting the second commitment to Mrs. Schutte was that he desired to make certain that she had not changed her mind, and that her act of signing of the night before continued to be her voluntary act. Mrs. Schutte had notice of the hearing, but made no request to be present.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-6\">The Court of Probate, after hearing had on April 1st, 1914, ordered Mrs. Schutte committed to said sanitarium for one year from April 1st, 1914.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-7\">Mrs. Schutte, at the time of her commitment to Dr. Givens\u2019 sanitarium, was voluntarily residing in Stamford and was an habitual drunkard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-8\">Thereafter Mrs. Schutte communicated with her friend Dr. Douglass, and upon his advice and through him Mrs. Schutte employed as an attorney Mr. Nicholson. Shortly thereafter Mr. Nicholson, after consultation with Mrs. Schutte, prepared an application for the appointment of a conservator over Mrs. Schutte and filed the same in the Court of Probate describing Mrs. Schutte as a resident of Stamford. Service was made on Mrs. Schutte in accordance with the order of the Court of Probate. Thereafter, upon evidence produced by Mr. Nicholson, the Court of Probate appointed Dr. Douglass as conservator of Mrs. Schutte on April 27th, and she was thereupon released from the sanitarium.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-9\">No appeal was taken from the order appointing the conservator. No appeal was taken from the order committing her to Dr. Givens\u2019 sanitarium.

Our study of the evidence has failed to convince us that the court committed error either in finding material and relevant facts contrary to the evidence, or in refusing to find such facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">The appellant, Mrs. Schutte, was committed to Dr. Givens\u2019 sanitarium by order of the Court of Probate for the district of Stamford, pursuant to General Statutes, \u00a7 2744. That section gives the Court of Probate for any probate district of this State power to commit, after hearing had, one who is found by it to be (a) a resident of, or domiciled in, the district and (b) an habitual drunkard, upon application by (c) any of his relatives and (d) upon such reasonable notice to the alleged inebriate as it may prescribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">The appellant attacks this order of commitment because of lack of jurisdiction to issue it upon two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>grounds: first, that she was not a resident of the probate district of Stamford, and hence not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Probate of that district; and second, that the application upon which the order issued was made by Mr. Mattern, a brother-in-law of the appellant, and not by a brother, as it recites, and because the application was not made by a relative of Mrs. Schutte the Court of Probate was without jurisdiction to issue its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The word \u201crelative\u201d or \u201crelatives,\u201d when used generically, includes persons connected by ties of affinity as well as consanguinity. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary; Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary; <em>Wapello County </em>v. <em>Eikelberg, </em>140 Iowa, 736, 117 N. W. 978, 979. These words may also be used with a restricted meaning, and when so used, they refer to those \u25a0only who are connected by ties of consanguinity or blood. It is with this meaning these words are used in a will, unless the contrary appears. There the popular and general meaning is controlled by a technical meaning arising from definite construction. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Van Riper, </em>47 N. J. Eq. 563, 22 Atl. 1055, 14 L. R. A. 342; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>197 Mass. 273, 83 N. E. 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The term \u201cany of his relatives,\u201d in \u00a7 2744, has never been before us for construction. The purpose of the statute is to protect the person and safeguard the rights of the person alleged to be an habitual drunkard, by providing that the application shall be made by one who has \u00e1 public interest, as a selectman, or by one who has a private interest, as a relative. The degree of the relationship is not specified in the statute. Near relatives by affinity are generally bound by a closer tie of affection to their relative than are his remote relatives by blood. The interest of the relative by affinity may be greater than that of the relative by blood. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Before the order of commitment can issue, the court must find the fact of habitual intemperance, and that service has been made upon the alleged inebriate. The very informality of procedure in our courts of probate will tend to prevent a finding of these jurisdictional facts either ill-advisedly or through the imposition of a relative by affinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The court found that Mrs. Schutte* was a voluntary resident of Stamford at the time the order of commitment was issued. We cannot say as matter of law that the court erred in making this finding. Shortly after the commitment order, the attorney of Mrs. Schutte procured the appointment of a conservator of her upon the representation that she was a resident of Stamford; and her course of conduct after her commitment recognized and approved of the court\u2019s action. The appellees do not and could not properly claim that the bringing of Mrs. Schutte into this State by force or fraud, and the compelling her presence within the State against her will, would have made her a resident of the State and have conferred jurisdiction upon the Court of Probate. The finding not only shows that her residence was a voluntary one, but her conduct subsequent to the commitment also indicates her full acquiescence in the fact of her residence in Stamford.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The order appointing a conservator is attacked for want of jurisdiction in that Mrs. Schutte was not at the time a resident of Stamford. The finding shows the contrary. Further, Mrs. Schutte having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court of Probate upon her representation that she was a resident of Stamford, will not be permitted to deny that jurisdiction because of the claimed untruthfulness of her representations. Mrs. Schutte claims, in addition, that she was capable of managing her affairs when a conservator was appointed. The finding shows the reverse, and we think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the trial court was justified in so finding. The order appointing a conservator was made April 27th, the petition for its revocation was filed the following May 6th. It is not based upon the claim that there had been a change in the condition of Mrs. Schutte, but upon the claim that the order, when made, was erroneous, and based upon facts contrary to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The ruling dismissing the appeal was right for another reason. Prom the original order of commitment and the order appointing a conservator, no appeal was taken. .The appeal to the Superior Court which we are considering was from the denial by the Court of Probate of the application to set aside the order of commitment and the order appointing a conservator. The appeal before us is from the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing the appeal from the Court of Probate. The Court of Probate was asked to revoke its own orders previously made and from which no appeal had been taken. If the Court of Probate for the district of Stamford had power to revoke its own orders, upon the facts before it, it could take jurisdiction of the application, otherwise not. Our courts of probate possess such powers only as are expressly or by implication conferred by statute upon them. <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>26 Conn. 273, 286. By statute (\u00a7 203) they are given power to \u201cmodify or revoke any order or decree made by them <em>ex parte </em>before any appeal therefrom.\u201d The finding in this case shows that due notice was given of the pend-ency of the commitment proceedings, and that the conservator proceedings were instituted and conducted by Mrs. Schutte through her agent, and her attorney. Neither order was an <em>ex parte </em>one.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The same question was before us in <em>Delehanty </em>v. <em>Pitkin, </em>76 Conn. 412, 56 Atl. 881, and we there held (p. 417) that the Court of Probate had no such power, and that any other conclusion would run \u201ccounter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>to all our legislation and decisions with reference to the powers of that court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The reasoning of that opinion seems to us sound, and the case must be regarded as authoritative for the proposition that the power of our courts of probate to set aside or modify their own decisions is limited to the instances given by statute; beyond these the Court of Probate cannot go. A final probate decree can be set aside, reversed or modified, only upon appeal duly taken from it. If the lack of jurisdiction appears when it is too late to take an appeal, the judgment will fall when collaterally attacked. If hardship of frequent occurrence result to the innocent from the application of this rule, the legislature \u201cmay be trusted to apply some appropriate remedy,\u201d as we remarked in <em>Delehanty </em>v. <em>Pitkin, </em>76 Conn. 412, 424, 56 Atl. 881. The fact that our statute (\u00a7 194) has remained unchanged for over twelve years since this observation was made, suggests that the instances of hardship either have not occurred, or have not occurred with frequency.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In this opinion Prentice, C. J., Thayer and Roraback, Js., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b551-9\">Beach, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7G\">(concurring). I concur in the result, on the ground that the Court of Probate has no power, in the absence of express statutory authority, to revoke its own decrees, and, with some hesitation, in the conclusion that Mrs. Schutte was a resident of Stamford; but I think the latter conclusion ought to be put more emphatically on the ground that she had already evidenced an intention to take up her abode in Dr. Givens\u2019 sanitarium for an indefinite time, before the application for her commitment was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>The statute (\u00a7 2744) limits the jurisdiction in these cases to \u201cthe Court of Probate for the district in which he resides, or is domiciled\u201d; and this very properly restricts the inquiry into the habits and reputation of the person whose liberty is at stake, to a district where he may be supposed to be known, and from which it may be assumed that disinterested witnesses may conveniently be summoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Since this woman already had her domicil and residence in the State of New York on March 26th, the Court of Probate for the district of Stamford was without jurisdiction in the premises on March 27th, unless she had acquired a new residence in the meantime. This she could not do in twenty-four hours except by forming an intention to remain in Stamford long enough to give her the character of a resident, as distinguished from a transient person; and the only evidence of such an intent in this case is found in her written requests for treatment, which may be supposed to express an intention to remain for an indefinite time for that purpose, when corroborated in that particular by her subsequent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Residence, as distinguished from domicil, means a temporary residence; but when the word is used as a limitation of jurisdiction, it must also be distinguished from a place in which one is transiently found. In that restricted sense, residence is the place where one has temporarily fixed his abode with an intention to depart, which is definite as to purpose but indefinite as to time. <em>Brisenden </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>53 Fed.
