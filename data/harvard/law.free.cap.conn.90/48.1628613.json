Currie of Danbury, deceased, to the defendant Woodin as the sole heir at law of said decedent, taken by the plaintiffs to the Superior Court in Fairfield County and tried by the court, <em>Curtis, J., </em>after the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a jury trial had been denied; facts found and judgment rendered for the defendant confirming the decree of the Court of Probate, from which the plaintiffs appealed for alleged error of the trial court in denying their motion for a trial to the jury.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AIl\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-11\">The order and decree of the Court of Probate directed that the real and personal estate of the intestate be distributed to Verna Currie Woodin, the daughter of the intestate, as the only heir at law and sole distributee of said estate. The appellants, who are sisters of the intestate, appealed to the Superior Court, assigning as reasons of appeal that the appellants are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>only legal heirs of the deceased and that the appellee was not his natural nor legitimate child. Appellee filed a general depial, and the appellants in due season claimed the case for a jury trial upon all the issues of fact. On appellee\u2019s motion the case was stricken from the jury docket. Judgment was subsequently rendered for the appellee and the decree of the Court of Probate confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">The assignments of error raise the single question whether in an appeal from an order of distribution, involving the ascertainment of the heirs of an intestate, the appellants were entitled, upon claiming the case in due season, to a jury trial upon the issue of the paternity of the heir and distributee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-7\"><em>Howard W. Taylor, </em>for the appellants (plaintiffs).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-8\"><em>Eugene C. Dempsey, </em>for the appellees (defendants).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b63-9\">Beach, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbR\">Since 1826 our statutes have provided for a jury trial in appeals from probate involving the validity of a will, but not in other appeals from probate; thus plainly excluding from the jury docket all appeals from probate except those involving the validity of a will or paper purporting to be such; and by the common consent of the profession this always has been so understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">The appellants, however, claim that if such is the effect of the present statute (Chapter 178 of the Public Acts of 1911, p. 1440), it is unconstitutional because the statutes in force at the adoption of the Constitution of 1818 provided that \u201call actions that shall be tried before the Superior or County courts, when issue is joined on any matter of fact, shall be tried by a jury of twelve men,\u201d etc. Revision of 1808, p. 35, \u00a7 8. And because they also provided that the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>should have jurisdiction of \u201ccivil causes or actions, between party and party, whether the same do concern the realty, and relate to any right of freehold or inheritance; or whether the same do concern the personalty,\u201d etc. Revision of 1808, p. 205, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Appeals from probate are not \u201cactions\u201d or \u201ccivil causes or actions, between party and party.\u201d The accepted meaning of the term \u201ccivil action\u201d in this State is very well illustrated by the provision of our Practice Act (General Statutes, \u00a7 607) that \u201cthere shall be but one form of civil action, and the pleadings therein shall be as follows: The first pleading on the part of the plaintiff shall be known as the complaint, and shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the cause of action, and a demand for the relief to which he supposes himself to be entitled.\u201d Controversies arising in the Court of Probate in the course of the settlement of estates are not civil actions in that sense. They are not commenced by the service of process and no complaint or other pleadings are required. On the contrary, the parties to such controversies are not permitted to delay the settlement of the estate by instituting civil actions in the courts of general jurisdiction to determine their rights. Public interest requires that so far as the determination of their controversies is necessary to the settlement of the estate, they should be determined in the Court of Probate as matters incidental to such settlement, by the informal proceedings which are customary in those courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Neither is an appeal from the Court of Probate to the Superior Court a civil cause or action. It has no more of the ordinary attributes of a civil action than the original proceedings in the Court of Probate. The rules of court require that the appellant, \u201cunless otherwise ordered,\u201d shall file reasons of appeal, and that other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>pleadings \u201cmay thereafter follow in analogy to civil actions.\u201d Rules of the Superior Court, p. 207, \u00a7 13. The phrase \u201cin analogy to civil actions\u201d expresses the proper status of an appeal from probate, as a special proceeding authorized by statute, but not a civil action. Independently of the language of the rule, appeals from probate are not civil actions because it has always been held that the Superior Court, while hearing appeals from probate, sits as a court of probate and not as a constitutional court of general or common-law jurisdiction. It tries the questions presented to it <em>de novo, </em>but in so doing it is not exercising the general jurisdiction conferred upon it by the statutes on which the appellants rely. It is exercising a special and limited jurisdiction conferred on it by the statute authorizing appeals from probate. It was solely by force of this statute that the appellants were able to reach the Superior Court at all; and when reached by that path the Superior Court is a tribunal which has no greater powers than those of the Court of Probate. <em>Davis\u2019 Appeal, </em>39 Conn. 395, 401; <em>Hewitt\u2019s Appeal, </em>53 Conn. 24, 1 Atl. 815; <em>Mallory\u2019s Appeal, </em>62 Conn. 218, 223, 25 Atl. 109; <em>Mack\u2019s Appeal, 71 </em>Conn. 122, 129-131, 41 Atl. 242; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>84 Conn. 560, 564-566, 80 Atl. 817. It is, in effect, a court of probate in which no right of trial by jury exists, save as it is specially conferred by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The appellants make the claim that their appeal relates to a \u201cright of freehold or inheritance,\u201d within the very words of the statute of 1808; but those words are intended to confer upon the Superior Court jurisdiction of actions, such as actions of ejectment and trespass, specially adapted for the purpose of trying the title to land; and the Superior Court on this appeal sits as a court of probate and has no jurisdiction to try the title to land. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>84 Conn. 560, 80 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Atl. 817. It ascertains the rightful heir in this case only as an incident of its probate power to distribute intestate real estate, and in so doing it follows our probate, and not our common-law, procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">There is no merit in the claim that the trial court erred in declining to exercise its discretion in favor of a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
