It also owns the right and privilege of maintaining a dam at the outlet to Snipsic Lake at its present height, and thereby flowing lands of one Doyle from whom the defendant Koelsch purchased a tract of land on the eastern shore of the lake comprising about half an acre and bounded westerly by Snipsic Lake. Koelsch bought this land in 1908, many years after the plaintiff\u2019s reservoir had been established at its present level, and built a cottage thereon which he generally occupied with his family during a portion of the summer season of each year. At that time there existed on the western shore of the lake an extensive public pleasure-resort and picnic-ground called Thompson\u2019s Grove, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the plaintiff bought and suppressed in 1909, giving notice at the time, through a newspaper published in Rockville, that it would institute proceedings for the removal of any buildings on its watershed which should be found objectionable. In 1912 the plaintiff company, being informed that the defendants were contemplating the establishment upon the premises bought from Doyle of a public pleasure-resort similar in character to Thompson\u2019s Grove, gave personal notice to the defendants that no enterprise of that character would be permitted within the plaintiff\u2019s flowage area or watershed, to which notice the defendant Koelsch replied that when he got ready he would build. In May, 1913, the defendants established a general public pleasure-resort equipped with devices to attract the general public, including a dance pavilion, music and refreshment rooms, boating facilities, shooting gallery, and other kindred attractions, and after extensive advertising, opened the same to the public on May 30th, and operated it for three days. As many as three hundred and fifty people were, at certain times, in attendance. On June 2d the plaintiff obtained a temporary injunction restraining the defendants from maintaining their public pleasure-resort. No actual pollution of the waters of the reservoir by reason of the maintenance of the defendants\u2019 pleasure-resort has been found, but it is found that by reason of the location of the premises sloping toward the reservoir, its waters will be liable to be polluted in case the defendants continue to use their premises as a public pleasure-resort and picnic-ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-6\">Section 5 of chapter 137 of the Public Acts of 1909 (p. 1062) provides that \u201cwhenever any land or building is so used, occupied, or suffered to remain that it is a source of pollution to the water stored in a reservoir used for supplying residents of a city, town, or borough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>with water or ice, or to any source of supply to such reservoir, or when such water or ice is liable to pollution in consequence of the use of the same, either the authorities of such town, city, or borough, or the county or town health officer, or the person, firm, or corporation having charge of such reservoir, or the right to procure ice therefrom, may apply for relief to the Superior Court in the county where such reservoir or water is located, and said court may make any order in the premises, temporary or permanent, which, in its judgment, may be necessary to preserve the purity of such water or ice.\u201d And \u00a7 6 provides that \u201cwhenever any order is made by the Superior Court for the abatement of any nuisance to such water or ice, and said court shall find that compliance with said order will damage any person or corporation or deprive him or it of any substantial right, said court may assess just damages in favor of such person or corporation, to be paid by such municipality, person, or corporation, as the court may decree.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\">Pursuant to this Act, the defendants, in their answer, alleged by way of counterclaim that compliance with the terms of the injunction prayed for would damage them and deprive them of a substantial right, and demanded damages pursuant to the statute. The Superior Court has assessed the sum of SI,800 as just damages in favor of the defendants, and has annexed to the judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from using their premises as a public pleasure-resort or picnic-ground, a direction that the plaintiff company pay said sum to the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-7\"><em>Charles Phelps, </em>for the appellant (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-8\"><em>William F.

It is said that at the common law, damages are not allowable for the abatement of a nuisance, and, further, that under the Act of .1909 the defendants are not entitled to damages, because any pecuniary damage which they may have suffered in consequence of proceeding with the establishment of this nuisance after general and personal notice of the plaintiff\u2019s intention to enjoin its maintenance, is not \u201cjust damages\u201d within the meaning of the statute, especially in view of the public obligations of the plaintiff corporation. It is also said that the plaintiff has a property right in the waters in the reservoir and in having them kept free from pollution, and that this property right is invaded by the acts of the defendants; that the defendants have no riparian proprietorship or other right in the land covered by the waters and reservoir, and that the injunction is a proper exercise of the police power of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">We take up first the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the defendants\u2019 pleasure-resort was a common-law nuisance, for the abatement of which no damages are recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">There was no evidence of any actual contamination of the water, and therefore no finding of nuisance. It is, however, found that the waters of the reservoir will be liable to become polluted by a continued use of the defendants\u2019 premises as a public pleasure-resort; and this is claimed to be a sufficient basis for the conclusion that such use ought to be enjoined without compensation. It may be doubted whether the finding of liability to pollution establishes the existence of such a real and immediate danger as would, in the absence of statute, be required to justify an injunction against a threatened nuisance. <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Illinois &amp; Chicago District, </em>180 U. S. 208, 248, 21 Sup. Ct. 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Passing that point, it must be conceded that a public pleasure-resort and picnic-ground is not necessarily a common-law nuisance. It may become one, if improperly conducted, but there is no allegation or finding that the defendants\u2019 resort was improperly conducted. The sole basis for the claim that the defendants\u2019 resort was abatable as a nuisance is found in its proximity to the waters of Snipsic Lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">So that the true scope and effect of the plaintiff\u2019s claim of law is that any kind of a menace to the purity of the waters of its reservoir becomes, by virtue of the danger to the public health, a nuisance, which it has a right to have abated, without the payment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">We think this claim is too broad, and that \u00a7 6 of the Act of 1909 was intended to provide for the assessment of damages in cases like this, where the thing complained of as a nuisance, or as dangerous to the public health, would be unobjectionable except for its proximity to a source of water-supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The history of this legislation shows that the General Assembly, while giving full protection to sources of water-supply, has always made some provision for possible compensation to the injured landowner, and has never acceded to the plaintiff\u2019s broad claim that danger to the public health was of itself a sufficient ground for an injunction without compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">The original legislation on this subject was chapter 27 of the Public Acts of 1883 (p. 243), which was limited to cases of actual \u201cinjury to the water,\u201d and authorized the Superior Court to make any orders necessary to preserve its purity. The Act then provided that \u201cwhere the law requires compensation to be made,\u201d the court should appoint three disinterested freeholders who should determine and award the compensation to be paid before the order was carried into effect. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>General Assembly thus recognized, at the beginning of this legislation, that modern theories of sanitation might require the court to issue injunctions for which compensation was required by law, although the order was necessary to preserve the purity of a public water-supply. In the Revision of 1902 the right to injunctive relief was extended to cases where \u201csuch water is liable to pollution\u201d (\u00a7 2599), and the recognition of a possible right to compensation takes the form of a direct grant (\u00a7 2600) of power to \u201ctake such lands or rights\u201d as the Superior Court might deem necessary for the purpose of preserving the purity of the water-supply, coupled with the same provision for compensation (\u00a7 2601) as in the Act of 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In 1903 the Act (Public Acts of 1903, Chap. 192, p. 148), which up to that time had been restricted to reservoirs, was extended to any source of supply for such reservoirs, and the powers given to the Superior Court extended to any judge thereof in vacation. By the present Act, ice ponds are protected as well as sources of water-supply, and the Superior Court is given power, when any order is made for the abatement of any nuisance to water or ice, to assess just damages. Sections 2600 and 2601 remain in force, and the result is that there are now two methods of compensating an injured landowner; one under \u00a7 2601, by the appointment and award of a committee of freeholders, and the other by the Superior Court. The former applies to cases when an application is made for the taking of lands or rights therein which are deemed necessary for the purity of the water-supply, and is limited to cases where \u201cthe law requires compensation to be made.\u201d The latter extends to cases where the abatement of a \u201cnuisance to such water or ice,\u201d damages the landowner or deprives him of any substantial right, in which case the court \u201cmay assess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>just damages.\u201d We think the phrase \u201cnuisance to such water or ice,\u201d aptly describes a condition which is objectionable only, or chiefly, because of its effect, or potential effect, on such water or ice; and that \u00a7 6 authorizes the assessment of just damages to a landowner who is damaged or deprived of a substantial right by the abatement of such a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The next question is whether the damages awarded in this case are \u201cjust damages,\u201d and the plaintiff\u2019s claim on that point is that the defendants have no right to compensation because they went into the business after full notice and with the knowledge that the plaintiff would seek an injunction. It is pointed out that one who avails himself of the proximity of the water-supply to establish a new business which would be impossible except for such proximity, and after notice that it will create a nuisance, stands in a very different equitable position from one who has long carried on a lawful business which afterward, in the light of better knowledge of sanitation, comes to be regarded as dangerous to the public health. That is quite true, and it must doubtless have had its effect on the amount of damages awarded in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">On the other hand, it cannot be so that the plaintiff, by maintaining a public water-supply and by very properly giving notice of its intention to protect it, can acquire any legal rights in adjoining lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">If these defendants have been lawfully deprived of the right of carrying on a public pleasure-resort and picnic-ground on their land, it must be because their property has been pro <em>tanto </em>taken for a public use, and for that taking they are entitled to just compensation, under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s property right in having its water-supply kept free from pollution is merely an incident of the public use to which its property is dedicated, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>must be exercised in accordance with the Constitution and the statutes. We are not called upon to determine whether the State might in the exercise of its police power have forbidden the defendants to make any use of the reservoir for boating, for it has not attempted to do so. The question whether the defendants are riparian owners affects only the amount of their just damages, and it is not assigned as error that the damages awarded are excessive, or assessed upon a wrong theory, if assessable at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
