The accident occurred at the intersection of Myrtle avenue and Adams street between 5 and 6 o\u2019clock in the morning on the 7th day of December, 1899; and the evidence establishes that it was dark, and that the plaintiff\u2019s wagon was struck by a car coming uptown on the track on which cars were run downtown, displaying no headlight on the end of the car which came into collision with the plaintiff\u2019s wagon. Upon the trial defendant introduced no evidence, but relied upon its motions to dismiss the complaint upon the grounds that the plaintiff had not established negligence on the part of the defendant, or lack of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s servant; and from the judgment in favor of the plaintiff an appeal comes to this court, the defendant urging that the plaintiff has failed to establish lack of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>This accident occurred at a street intersection, where the rights of the parties are equal, and, as it was the crossing place of two street railroads, it was peculiarly a point at which a high degree of care might fairly be expected of the defendant in the operation of its cars; and the fact that the car which struck the plaintiff\u2019s wagon was running on the downtown track, coming uptown without displaying a headlight or ringing a bell, or giving any special notice of. its approach to this dangerous street intersection, is sufficient to establish the' negligence of the defendant, which is practically admitted on this appeal. The morning was dark, and plaintiff\u2019s driver testifies that: \u201cI looked up the track, or down the track, rather, towards Myrtle avenue,\u2014in the line, in fact, the car should be coming; and I didn\u2019t notice no car;\u201d and he then drove on over the crossing, the car striking his wagon near the rear end. If we consider the hour of the morning, the darkness, the congestion of traffic, and the fact that the car was upon a track where it was not customary to find a car coming in that direction without any headlight, it can hardly be said, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff\u2019s servant was guilty of contributory negligence in not seeing this approaching car. It was at a point where he could not look with safety in one direction all of the time. He was liable to danger on three sides. And it is not ordinarily necessary, in order to take the case to the jury, for the plaintiff to swear that he looked every instant of the time, or while passing over every foot of the ground.
