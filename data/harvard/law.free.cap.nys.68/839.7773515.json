Upon the trial the sale and the delivery of the goods and nonpayment of the balance claimed were substantially conceded. The defendant claimed, however, that his freight charges on the goods in question were $89.47 more than they should be, and that this excess was caused by careless conduct of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor in the method employed in forwarding shipments. This defense was not available under the pleadings, but, waiving that point, it does not seem to be supported by the evidence. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>defendant bases his contention upon certain alleged oral promises made by an employ\u00e9 of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor; but the engagements of the parties were in writing, and could not be affected by prior or contemporaneous oral promises or negotiations. The judgment in the court below was proper, and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
