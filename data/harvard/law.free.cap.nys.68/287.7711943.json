The evidence, which is undisputed, shows that the plaintiff, a man 70 years of age, while attempting to get onto one of the cars of the defendant at the New York end of the Brooklyn Bridge, was thrown down, and sustained a painful injury to his side, by the sudden starting of the car. Plaintiff was engaged in selling glassware on commission for several different houses, but there was no evidence of .his earning power, except that it may be inferred from the testimony that he had been able to care for himself. After the accident he went to a hospital in New York, where the doctor prescribed the use of a liniment, and subsequently he entered the hospital of the Kings county almshouse, where he remained for a period of about two months, because, being unable to work, he had nowhere else to go. He testified that he was in pain at the time of the trial of the action from this injury, the trial occurring some three months after the accident. There was a conflict of evidence upon the question of whether the plaintiff\u2019s side showed a depression at the point of contact, indicating a continuation of the difficulty, and the amount of the judgment indicates that the trial court found in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s contention upon this point. Taking this view of the case, we are not prepared to say that $400 is an excessive judgment, and we do not conceive it to be error on the part of the trial court to refuse to make examination of the plaintiff\u2019s person. The burden of establishing the injury was upon the plaintiff, and we are satisfied that there was evidence sufficient to support the decision of the court below, and that the defendant had no right to demand that the court examine the plaintiff to determine a dispute between opposing doctors. If there are any authorities in support of this contention, defendant\u2019s counsel have not called the attention of the court to them, and, in the absence of such authorities, the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
