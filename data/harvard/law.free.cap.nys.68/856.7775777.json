The tenant\u2019s remedy in such a case is by way of counterclaim or independent action. O\u2019Brien v. Smith (Sup.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 408, affirmed in 129 N. Y. 620, 29 N. E. 1029. In this case the rent became due in advance, on September 1, 1900, under the terms of the lease, and, as no counterclaim was interposed to cover the portion of the month of September alleged to have been surrendered and accepted by the landlord, the plaintiff was entitled to a judgment for the entire month\u2019s rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">The judgment, therefore, must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
