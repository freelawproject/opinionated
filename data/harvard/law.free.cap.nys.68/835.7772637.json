The action was brought to recover damages for the destruction of respondent\u2019s property caused by the running away of a horse owned by the appellant, and coming into collision with a show window in appellee\u2019s store, breaking the plate glass thereof, and destroying goods displayed therein. It is conceded that a runaway occurred, and that respondent Suffered damage thereby. The only other questions involved in the appeal are the amount of damage done, the vicious propensity of the horse to run away, and the owner\u2019s knowledge of it. These questions were all sharply contested, and the record shows that both sides presented testimony concerning each of them. The evidence on the part of the respondent is amply sufficient to support the judgment, and it must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
