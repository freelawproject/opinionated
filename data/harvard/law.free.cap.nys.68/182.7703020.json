I think that the learned trial justice rightly dismissed the complaint at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, for the reason that no negligence on the part of the defendant was shown. One witness testified that he \u201cheard the engine going up. the track,\u2014 heard the cars going up the track. They were throwing sparks. The sparks were flying up in the air from the engine, and flying over on the farm.\u201d On cross-examination he testified: \u201cI did see the engine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>* * It was a freight engine. * * * There is a little bit of a curve at that point where these cars go around; and engines pull hard up there,\u2014labor, and make a good deal of noise. I have seen other engines throwing sparks there,\u2014freight engines particularly,\u2014when going westward.\u201d This is all of the testimony bearing upon the alleged negligence of the defendant in the matter of casting the sparks. In Frace v. Railroad Co., 143 N. Y. 182, 38 N. E. 102, the court held that it could take judicial notice of the fact that no system yet invented can wholly prevent the emission of live sparks from an engine under certain conditions. It did not appear in this case that the emission of the sparks in question was peculiar to that engine, or that such emission was in unusual quantities, but, on the contrary, it was shown that other and similar engines, at the same place, \u201cpulled hard up there, labored, and made a good deal of noise, and threw sparks.\u201d This was plainly insufficient to make out a prima facie case against the defendant. Flinn v. Railroad Co., 142 N. Y. 11, 19, 20, 36 N. E. 1046; Rood v. Railroad Co., 18 Barb. 80, 86, 87; Van Nostrand v. Railroad Co., 78 Hun, 549, 29 N. Y. Supp. 625; Dougherty v. King, 22 App. Div. 610, 48 N. Y. Supp. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
