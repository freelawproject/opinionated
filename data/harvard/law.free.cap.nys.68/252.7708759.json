Proc. \u00a7 3253, allowing an additional allowance for costs in certain cases, based on a percentage of the \u201camount claimed or value involved\u201d; hence an additional allowance was not void, as having no basis for computation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Acq\">S.

Rule Prac. No. 45, providing that application for such allowance must be made before \u201cfinal\u201d costs are adjudged; the judgment being interlocutory, and there being nothing prohibiting an allowance to a party who has taxed costs under an interlocutory judgment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b272-9\">Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-10\">Action by Frank Richards Abbey against Jerome B.

Rules Prac., which provides that the application for an additional allowance \u201cshall in all cases be made before final costs are adjusted.\u201d The plaintiff alleged that he had certain interests in mines out of which the defendant Wheeler had taken minerals amounting in value to upwards of $700,000, which he sold, and received therefor, to the use of the plaintiff, upwards of $250,000. Upon this allegation we think there was sufficient basis for an allowance; for the smaller sum, at least, must be regarded as the amount \u201cclaimed or the value of the subject-matter involved.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3253.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">With respect to rule 45, Gen. Rules Prac., it appears that the defendant Wheeler interposed a demurrer to the complaint, which was finally sustained at the general term, with leave to plaintiff to amend upon payment of the costs of the action. Costs were taxed prior to the entry of the interlocutory judgment, and paid to the attorney for the defendant Wheeler. The plaintiff\u2019s time to serve an amended -complaint finally expired by default, after which no steps were taken by either party until a notice of motion was served by the defendant Wheeler for an allowance in addition to costs. It thus appears that the judgment which was entered, and the costs which were taxed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>were interlocutory, and not final. No allowance could be granted upon an interlocutory judgment, and therefore none could be included in the costs as adjusted upon the entry of the interlocutory judgment. The rule invoked (rule 45, Gen. Rules Prac.) in express language provides that the application for an allowance \u201cshall in all cases be made before final costs are adjusted,\u201d and it will therefore be seen that there is nothing in the rule which prevents a party who has taxed costs under an interlocutory judgment from applying before entry of final judgment for an allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Upon the merits, we find no facts which would justify our interfering with the discretion exercised by the special term, and the order accordingly should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
