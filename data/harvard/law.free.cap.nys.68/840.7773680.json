Negligence will not be imputed to a party merely because he regulates his conduct upon the assumption that the other party will conduct himself with reasonable care. If the defendant acted with ordinary prudence, he would not have made the turn in question until he proceeded several feet closer to the southerly crossing, and, in that event, the collision would be avoided. Generally the question of contributory negligence is one of fact to be determined by the jury, and is within the province of the court only where the inference of plaintiff\u2019s negligence is certain and incontrovertible. Kettle v. Turl, 162 N. Y. 255, 56 N. E. 626. We therefore think the court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for a nonsuit, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
