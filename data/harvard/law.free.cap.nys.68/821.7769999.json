Plaintiff recovered judgment at trial term of the city court, which was affirmed upon appeal to the general term of that court, and an appeal from such affirmance taken to this court. The question here presented for consideration arises by reason of one of the conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>\u2022contained in the certificate of membership upon which this suit is founded, wherein it was stipulated that the defendant should not be liable for \u201cinjuries, fatal or otherwise, resulting directly or indi- \u2018 rectly from, or in any wise contributed to, by * * * poison in any form or manner, or contact with poisonous substances.\u201d It is conceded that carbolic acid is a poison, but plaintiff contends that the injuries resulting from the effects of the throwing of the carbolic acid were not caused by \u201cpoison in any form or manner, or contact with poisonous substances,\u201d within the meaning of the membership certificate, claiming the word \u201cpoison\u201d therein is used in its ordinary meaning, as a substance taken internally. It would seem that this position is assumed because of the opinion of the presiding justice in the case of Bacon v. Association, 44 Hun, 599, and appears to be the sole basis.for this contention. A reference to the opinion discloses the fact that in that case (page 602) the insured stated in his application for insurance that he was aware that the benefits \u201cwill not extend * * * to death or disability caused wholly or in part * * * by taking of poison in any form or manner.\u201d There the application was made part of the certificate, and the expression of opinion of the learned presiding justice was made in view of the \u2022use of the word \u201ctaking.\u201d The case was reversed upon appeal (123 N. Y. 304, 25 N. E. 399), but the opinion of the court of appeals does not touch upon the point here under consideration. There is a very \u2022evident distinction between the use of the words \u201cby taking of poison\u201d and \u201cby poison.\u201d The expression \u201cby taking of poison\u201d may very well be held to mean the internal use of poison, but such cannot be considered the meaning of the words of the certificate in this case, except by a forced construction. This distinction is pointed out by Judge Gray in his opinion in the case of Paul v. Insurance Co., 112 N. Y. 472, 478, 20 N. E. 347, 349, 3 L. R. A. 443, 446, where' the words \u201cinhaling of gas\u201d were under consideration in connection with a clause in a policy relieving defendant from liability for injuries occasioned by the \u201cinhaling of gas.\u201d The court there held that those words applied only to a voluntary and intelligent action on the part of the insured. The death of the insured was occasioned by the \u00bfas being turned on in a room where insured was sleeping and breathing the air impregnated with the gas. Judge Gray said: \u201cIf the policy had said that it was not to extend to any death caused wholly or in part by gas, it would have expressed precisely what the appellant now says is meant by the present \u25a0phrase, and there could have been no room for doubt.\u201d Here the words of the certificate are \u201cby poison\u201d and not \u201cby taking poison,\u201d making the language of Judge Gray directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The further contention of plaintiff, that by the subsequent words \u201ccontact with poisonous substances\u201d is meant and intended a voluntary and conscious action of plaintiff, is likewise without force. This argument is based upon the Paul Case, just cited, and that of Menneiley v. Assurance Corp., 148 N. Y. 596, 43 N. E. 54, 31 L. R. A. 686, in both of which the decisions are predicated upon the use of the word \u201cinhale\u201d in connection with gas, and therefore can have no application here; for neither that word, nor any words of similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>effect, are found in the membership certificate in this case. The rule is well settled that, where the meaning of words in such a certificate as is here under consideration is in doubt, they should be construed most strongly against the insurer, and the benefit of all doubt given to the insured. In this case the meaning is clear and beyond any doubt. McGlother v. Accident Co., 32 C. C. A. 318, 89 Fed. 685. The injuries suffered .by plaintiff were occasioned \u201cby poison\u201d or by \u201ccontact with poisonous substances,\u201d within the meaning of the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The judgment and order of the city court must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs'to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
