The court correctly instructed the jury in the colloquial charge on the law of the case. Three additional requests, touching the burden of proof and the absence of contributory negligence, were charged at defendant\u2019s request. Five other requests were thereupon submitted to the court, and, in refusing to charge them as requested, the justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>observed, \u201cI think my charge covers what you ask me to charge.\u201d Four of these five requests were properly refused. One, being the familiar rule that the jury may disregard the testimony of an interested witness, should have been charged, as that proposition had not been alluded to; but, as said in Gardner v. Friederich, 25 App. Div. 533, 49 N. Y. Supp. 1087:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">\u201cIf the court had failed to charge specifically as to the proposition requested, counsel should have pointed out the omission and corrected the court. The appellants contend that this matter was not even alluded to in the charge. If that be true, then it was the counsel\u2019s duty to call the court\u2019s attention to the omission.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The exception is therefore unavailing. The charge as a whole gave the true rule by which the jury were to be governed, and the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
