Fuchs v. Pohlman, 2 Daly, 210; Jennings v. Miller, 10 Misc. Rep. 763, 31 N. Y. Supp. 814; Dalton v. Loughlin, 4 Abb. N. C. 187. By section 1409 of the consolidation net, the clerks of this court must keep a docket in which judgments are entered, and it is this record in the clerk\u2019s office which enables a litigant to ascertain when a judgment is entered, and when the time in which to appeal therefrom will expire. A question having arisen as to when the judgment in this case was entered, the return will be sent back for correction, so that the date of entry may be inserted.. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
