The ordinance gives the right of way only to \u201cambulances of the department of health.\u201d There was not sufficient evidence here to establish the fact that this ambulance was within the ordinance. . If the ordinance relates to all ambulances, there is no reason apparent why general words should not be used embracing all, for it is assumed that all the ambulances in use are in some sense under the jurisdiction of the health department. The learned trial justice, on reflection, decided that his ruling was erroneous, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>see no reason to disturb that conclusion. The order setting aside the verdict and granting a new trial should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">Order setting aside verdict and granting new trial affirmed; costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
