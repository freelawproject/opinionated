The defendant, in his answer, admits the allegations concerning the existence in the month of August, 1895, of the two corporations at Kansas City, and that they were competitors, but denies that the defendant was the owner of the controlling interest. He also denies the employment of the plaintiff, or the making of a contract of employment, or the rendition of any service by the plaintiff under a contract of employment. The cause came to trial, and the plaintiff introduced evidence which showed that he brought the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>fendant, Snyder, into relation with Mr. Morgan, and that the introduction was procured, and many interviews between the defendant and Mr. Morgan arranged for, by the plaintiff. The evidence supports the view that this was done at the request of the defendant; but it is also shown that, while the purpose of the plaintiff\u2019s employment was to bring the parties together, he was to be entitled to compensation only in the event of the defendant being able to sell the Missouri Gas Company to the United Gas-Improvement Company, or to purchase from the United Gas-Improvement Company its interest in the Kansas City Gas Company, or, as he himself testifies, the defendant\u2019s agreement, in his own language, was, \u201cI will pay you the sum of ten thousand dollars, whether I sell my plant to the old company, or whether I buy theirs.\u201d The contract for compensation, assuming it to have been made as the plaintiff contends, was for an amount to be paid under specific circumstances, and in a certain event only, which event never happened. The contract proven by the plaintiff himself is not the one alleged in the complaint. He was not entitled to compensation as a broker, nor merely for the bringing of the parties together. The defendant did not sell or buy. In April, 1897, as the result of. negotiations begun in October, 1896, a consolidation was effected of the interests of the two rival gas companies in Kansas City, but in the meantime the defendant and his associates had expended over a million dollars in the enterprise in which he was interested and the whole situation concerning the properties had changed. Mr. Morgan testifies that the negotiations between the defendant and himself, begun in 1895, terminated in September of that year, and at that time they had come to no agreement; that such an agreement as was finally made between them with respect to the consolidation of the interests was not proposed at any of the meetings in 1895. There seems to have been no communication between Mr. Morgan and the defendant from September, 1895, until October, 1896, when negotiations were begun afresh, as Mr. Snyder testifies, by Mr. Morgan, and they resulted in October in an agreement by which the consolidation above referred to was effected. There was an interval of a year or more between the termination of the negotiations following the introduction by the plaintiff of Mr. Morgan to the defendant, and the resumption of communications between those parties. The purpose of the plaintiff\u2019s employment in 1895 failed. The fact that a year afterwards an entirely different transaction, under changed conditions, was entered into between Mr. Morgan and the defendant does not entitle the plaintiff to recover upon the prior agreement, relating as it did to a special object which was not attained.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
