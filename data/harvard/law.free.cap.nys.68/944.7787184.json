Under the general denial contained in the answer the defendant could have proven- all that it expected to prove under the subsequent separate defenses, and clearly, therefore, their appearance in the answer was wholly unnecessary, if, indeed, not wholly unwarranted; but whether the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was by demurrer, or by motion to strike out, is the question before us. We think we are called upon to decide this question upon the authority of the very recent case of Durst v. Railroad Co. (Sup.) 67 N. Y. Supp. 297, wherein it is held that the remedy is by demurrer. While this is not a decision of the appellate division, the reasoning is so clear to our minds, and the authorities cited in the opinion so fully sustain the decision of Mr. Justice Gaynor, that while it remains unreversed it is controlling upon us. We are satisfied with the following conclusions reached in the Durst Case, viz.: \u201cIf an alleged defense contains no new matter, it is obviously insufficient, and therefore demurrable.\u201d And that is the case with this alleged defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-18\">The interlocutory judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-19\">FITZSIMONS, C.
