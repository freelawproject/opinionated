Stevenson Brewing Co. v. Eastern Brewing Co., 22 App. Div. 523, 48 N. Y. Supp. 89. Plaintiff\u2019s mortgage was filed April 6,1898, and on February 17, 1899, 48 days before the expiration of the year, the renewal was filed. The statute, however, requires the filing to take place within -30 days before the expiration of the year, and the refiling becomes absolutely nugatory if done either before or after the time feed by the statute. Thomas, Mortg. \u00a7 302; Jones, Mortg. \u00a7 282; Newell v. Warner, 44 Barb. 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The defendant Saul, as a warehouseman in possession of the chattels, with a right to sell them in discharge of his lien, is to be regarded the same as a judgment creditor in respect to his right to assail the validity of the mortgage, and as to such a creditor, whether the debt accrued before or after the default in the refiling, a mortgage with the infirmities established against the one in question becomes absolutely void. State Trust Co. v. Casino Co., 5 App. Div. 385, 39 N. Y. Supp. 258. But, even if the validity of the mortgage could not be impeached, the defendant, being a warehouseman, was entitled to the payment of his lawful charges before being required to surrender possession of the property. Laws 1897, c. 418, art. 6, \u00a7 73. These charges the plaintiff refused to pay, and, in either aspect of the case, he could not recover, and the judgment for defendants must be affirmed.,</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
