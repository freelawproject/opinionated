The defendant admitted that, except for work alleged to have been spoiled by the plaintiff, the amount due him was $86.20. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff had spoiled eight garments, causing a loss to the defendant of five dollars each, and the trial justice, upon conflicting evidence, decided that the claim of the defendant was well founded, and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $46.20, without costs. That decision is not against the weight of evidence, and the judgment should be affirmed, with costs of the appeal to the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
