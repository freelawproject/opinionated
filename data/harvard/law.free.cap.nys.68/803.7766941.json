The court denied the motion, and exception was duly taken. This was reversible error. The plaintiff had the right to discontinue at any time before the case was submitted, and a refusal on the part of the court to permit the discontinuance is a sufficient ground for the reversal of the judgment for the defendant. Goldberg v. Victor, 26 Mise. Rep. 728, 56 N. Y. Supp. 1044. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
