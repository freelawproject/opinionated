The plaintiff, however, failed to establish that the sale was effected through his agency, as its procuring cause, or that he was the means of bringing the parties to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>getlier, or that his efforts were instrumental in producing the sale. Whether the defendant had prior negotiations with the same person is not disclosed by the record. On the meager testimony adduced, too much is left to conjecture. The complaint was properly dismissed, and the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
