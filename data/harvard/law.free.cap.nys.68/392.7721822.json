The appellant contends that in such a case the order of arrest will not be vacated on motion, inasmuch as it involves the trial of the merits of the cause of action on affidavits. The rule, however, seems to be established that an order of arrest may be vacated in the same manner in which it was obtained,\u2014that is, on a motion based on affidavits,\u2014and that, when a motion to vacate an order of arrest is made, although the right to arrest grows out of the cause of action, it is the duty of the court to examine the affidavits, and to dispose of the case according to the just preponderance of the proof as contained therein. Corwin v. Freeland, 6 N. Y. 562; Levy v. Bernhard, 2 App. Div. 336, 37 N. Y. Supp. 849. On the affidavits submitted on the motion, the preponderance seems to be in favor of defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s right to try the merits of his cause of action before a judge and jury still remains, and, if successful, he is entitled to enforce judgment by execution against the defendant\u2019s body. In cases of this kind orders of arrest ought to be applied for in comparatively rare instances, and granted with caution by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">Order appealed from affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.
