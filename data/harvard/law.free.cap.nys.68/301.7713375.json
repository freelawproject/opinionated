By Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1357, an appeal lies to the appellate division from any order affecting a substantial right made by a court of record in a special proceeding. <em>EeW, </em>that when the owner of land on a creek was a party to the appraisal in eminent domain proceedings by the city to acquire an easement in the creek, and made no objection to the jurisdiction of the court, to the right of the city to the easement, or to proceed under the charter as to the laws or ordinances on which the proceedings were based, equity would not entertain a suit for injunction based on such objections, since under the charter and Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1357, plaintiff had ample remedy by interposition in the proceedings.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-13\">Appeal from Monroe county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-14\">Suit by James Hooker against the city of Rochester and others.

The plaintiff owns part of the bed of said creek and the land upon either bank. He was made a party to the appraisal proceeding, and interposed no-objection to the jurisdiction of the court, or to the right of the city to acquire the easement, or to proceed under the charter, instead of under the condemnation law, or to the validity of the laws or ordinances upon which such proceeding was based.' The foregoing are the sole grounds of objection to the condemnation proceeding, and the-only ground upon which the plaintiff contends that this suit can be maintained is that the county court was without jurisdiction to hear and determine such objections, and that he has no adequate remedy at law. Section 176 of the city charter authorizes the institution of eminent domain proceedings in the county court, as well as in the-supreme court, and provides that when the application is made for the appointment of commissioners, and before their appointment, the court shall hear \u201call parties interested if desired.\u201d We are of opinion that this provision of the statute authorized the interposition by plaintiff, by affidavit or answer, of any legal objection to the right of the city to maintain such proceeding, or to acquire the easement through his premises, and that, if it did not, the court would necessarily have such inherent power.
