Attention is called to one or two slight omissions not authorized by the architect, but as to these the plaintiff very properly invokes the rule that the right to enforce a contract will not be defeated by reason of inadvertent, trifling, and unimportant omissions. A literal compliance as to all details is not necessary. A substantial performance will support a recovery, and in such a case an allowance should be made to the defendants to cover any slight damage they may have suffered by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to strictly perform the contract in every detail. Desmond-Dunne Co. v. Friedman-Doscher Co., 162 N. Y. 488, 56 N. E. 995. It was, therefore, error to dismiss the complaint, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
