The trial was had with the aid of a jury. At the close of the charge of the trial justice defendant requested the court to charge as follows: \u201cThat the gripman of the defendant, or motorman, was held to the exercise of ordinary care only, and, if they believe he acted with the care of an ordinarily prudent person under the circumstances, the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d In response to this the court charged as follows: \u201cIf the plaintiff was prudent, and did all a man could do, and the accident occurred, it was the defendant\u2019s fault. If the defendant\u2019s servant was prudent, and it occurred, it was the plaintiff\u2019s fault,\u201d\u2014to which defendant duly excepted. The first sentence of the proposition charged is clearly an error, and affecting, as it does, the vital point at issue, must result in the reversal of the judgment. It was, in effect, a direction to the jury to find for plaintiff if they found plaintiff was prudent; that, as a matter of law, defendant was negligent, irrespective of the conduct of defendant\u2019s motorman. Other errors are assigned, which it does not become necessary to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
