A defense of tender after action commenced must include interest and costs to the time of tender. The amount paid into court in this case did not embrace interest and costs to the time of tender, and the defense was therefore ineffectual, and, on the rendition of judgment for plaintiff, the justice should have allowed him a full bill of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Judgment will be modified accordingly, and as modified affirmed, with costs of this appeal and disbursements to the appellants. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
