The action was brought by the plaintiff to recover $297 for the alleged loss of profits on an alleged oral contract by which the plaintiff claimed he was to furnish and place in the defendant\u2019s new bank building what is known as a \u201cWatchman\u2019s Time Clock,\u201d with connections. The main-question involved was whether such a contract was made between the plaintiff and the defendant, and the municipal court decided, upon conflicting evidence, that no such contract was ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-17\">I ,am of the opinion that the decision of the municipal court was correct, and that the judgment should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
