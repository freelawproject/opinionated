The defendant was the owner of an apartment house in the city of New York, in which was located a dumb-waiter for the use of tenants in the building. The plaintiff was a-retail dealer in ice, and about three weeks prior to the day of the accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>he first went to the defendant\u2019s building for the purpose of supplying one of his customers with ice. The dumb-waiter was then pointed out by the janitor of the building, and as soon as the plaintiff saw it he noticed that the bottom of it was rotten, and that the wood was worn around the screws holding a portion of the bottom in place; to which fact he called the janitor\u2019s attention, at the same time informing him that it was dangerous to use it. He testified, referring to this interview:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-5\">\u201cQ. You said that you told him it was dangerous also? A. Yes, I told him it was dangerous. Q. Well, now, that was the first day that you went there that you told him it was dangerous? A. Yes, sir. Q. Because it was rotten? A. Yes. Q. What made you think it was dangerous? A. I saw it was; that the bottom of it was rotten. Q. And you thought it would pull out? A. Yes; Q. That was the idea? A. Yes. I continued to use that dumb-waiter every day except Sunday from the time I first went there\u2014three weeks before the 1st of October\u2014until and including the 1st of October, 1897.\u201d He further testified that: \u201cFrom the first day I went there up to the 1st of October, 1897, the bottom of this dumb-waiter that I have described as being rotten was never replaced by any new bottom, nor were any repairs done on it from the time I first saw it up to the 1st of October, 1897.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">On the 1st of October, when the plaintiff arrived at the building, he found that the dumb-waiter was at or near the third floor. He stepped into the shaft beneath the dumb-waiter, took hold of the rope operating it, and commenced to pull it down, when a piece of the bottom \u201cpulled out\u201d (as he had three weeks before predicted that it would), fell, and struck him on the head, inflicting a serious injury. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, upon motion of defendant\u2019s counsel, the complaint was dismissed, and from the.judgment thereafter entered the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">We are of the opinion that the judgment should be affirmed. There was sufficient evidence to establish defendant\u2019s negligence, but this alone did not entitle the plaintiff to recover. In addition to this, he had to establish that he himself was free from negligence contributing to the injury which he sustained. This he did not do. On the contrary, it appears from his own testimony that, with full knowledge of the dangerous and defective condition of the dumb-waiter, he continued to use it every day for three weeks prior to the accident; and on that day he had no reason to suppose that its condition had been changed in any way, or that any repairs had been made upon it. He not only knew its condition, but he also appreciated the danger of using it in such condition, because he informed the janitor, when he first saw it, that the bottom was liable to pull out, and this is just what did occur. Yet, notwithstanding his knowledge of its defective and dangerous condition, he got into the shaft, directly underneath the dumb-waiter, and in such a position that, if anything did \u201cpull out\u201d and fall, it could not help but hit him. Under such circumr stances we think the court was justified in holding as a matter of law that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. It follows that the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">VAN BRUNT, P. J., and PATTERSON and INGRAHAM, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1050-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>O\u2019BRIEN, J. I dissent.</author>\n<p id=\"AvJZ\">To hold that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as matter of law, it must be presumed that he knew on the day of the accident that the dumb-waiter was defective, and out of repair. He could not see it that day, for the reason that it was up three stories in a shaft, and he was below. Whether he was' guilty - of contributory negligence, therefore, depends upon whether the presumption is to be drawn that, as matter of law, he must have known on the day of the accident that the condition of the dumbwaiter was the same then as when he saw it. on his prior visits to the house. Was he chargeable with knowledge that the defendant, after notice, had neglected and refused to perform his duty to repair it? The plaintiff, as stated, could not see its condition on that day; and, even if he was bound to recall the defects which he saw on his former visits, was he bound to presume, as matter of law, that these had not been removed? I think not, and therefore dissent. Under the circumstances I think that the question of contributory negligence was purely one of fact.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
