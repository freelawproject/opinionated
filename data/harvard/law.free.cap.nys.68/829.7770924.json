Appellant claims that the judgment was void, because rendered without jurisdiction. It is claimed that the judgment must be reversed upon a number of grounds. Only one of these need be considered. No personal service of defendant was made, but the return shows that an attachment was granted and issued to the marshal, upon which jurisdiction was evidently intended to be founded. The only provision for entering judgment without personal service on defendant or his appearance is that in section 1329 of the consolidation act and section 2918 of the Code of Civil Procedure, where it is stated that judgment may be entered in such a case \u201cwhere property of the defendant has been duly attached by virtue of a warrant of attachment.\u201d Before property can be duly attached, the warrant must have been lawfully issued. In this case, however, no warrant was properly issued. The affidavit upon which the warrant was issued clearly shows that the ground on which the warrant was sought was the alleged nonresidence of defendant, who, it was alleged, \u201cresided at Plattsburg, state of New York, and without the county of New York.\u201d This is insufficient to support an attachment in the municipal court. An attachment can only be sustained where the defendant is a nonresident of the state, and not merely a nonresident of the county. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2906, and Consol. Act, \u00a7 1317. Plaintiff probably placed reliance on the case of Van Kirk v. Wilds, 11 Barb. 520. When that case was decided, chapter 300 of the Laws, of 1831 was in force, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>by section 33 thereof such a warrant as was here issued was proper. This act, however, was repealed upon the enactment of the Code (Laws 1880, c. 245, \u00a7 1, subd. 9). The warrant of attachment, having no-proper foundation, was issued without jurisdiction, and was void, and accordingly it follows that no property of defendant could have been duly attached by virtue of it. Kingsford v. Butler, 71 Hun, 598, 24 N. Y. Supp. 1094. The necessity of personal service was not, therefore, dispensed with, and the judgment herein entered was without jurisdiction, and void, and must be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
