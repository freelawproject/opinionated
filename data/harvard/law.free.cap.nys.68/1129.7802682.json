J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avx\">The policy of insurance issued by defendant to plaintiff\u2019s father provided \u201cthat defendant should have satisfactory evidence of the death of the insured.\u201d Upon the trial the complaint was dismissed upon the ground that no such satisfactory evidence of death was presented to it. The testimony clearly shows that defendant had proper and satisfactory evidence of the death of the insured, because its vice president and adjuster, after they were notified of such death, endeavored to have plaintiff accept a nominal sum for her claim, and, upon her refusal to accept such offer, notified her that she was entitled to nothing. Thus it appears that they had full and satisfactory evidence of death, but wished to escape their lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>bility under the policy to pay $500 to plaintiff; also to avoid the payment o\u00a3 any sum, if possible; and had a clear and well-defined determination to pay as little as possible in any event. Such seems to be the habit of many life insurance companies. During the lifetime of the insured they willingly receive all the money he offers, but after his death seem unwilling to pay to the beneficiary the sum fixed by the policy. I think that such a practice should be discouraged, not encouraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">. The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
