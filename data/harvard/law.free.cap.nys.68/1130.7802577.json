The plaintiff* upon certain representations made to him by the defendant\u2019s treasurer, had been induced to part with the sum of $700, and these representations were subsequently ascertained to be untrue, as it is alleged. The defendant does not deny a single allegation, or present any affidavit whatever in support of its motion to vacate, and we are, therefore, to decide the question upon the. plaintiff\u2019s statement of the case. We think the allegations were entirely sufficient, and that a cause of action is shown in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant; and, there being no other question before us for consideration, it follows that the order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
