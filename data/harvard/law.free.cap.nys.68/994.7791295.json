We think, however, that he overlooked the fact that she interposed the counterclaim against the plaintiff of being a faithless husband. Supplemented as this defense is by the affidavits in support of it, we think, apart from the probability of the defendant\u2019s success in meet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>ing her husband\u2019s charge, that she should be permitted to establish such defense, if she can, upon the trial; and, to that end, some amount should be awarded her as counsel fees, although that part of the order appealed from which denied alimony should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">. The order, accordingly, should be modified by inserting a provision granting to the defendant counsel fees to the extent of $75, and as so modified affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
