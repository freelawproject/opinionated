Cohen,\u201d and \u201cto the order of bearer, Ennulot,\u201d respectively, and it is claimed by the appellant\u2019s counsel that such checks are, in legal effect, payable to bearer, and hence were negotiable. We cannot, however, yield our assent to this proposition. The checks were not, as claimed, payable to a bearer \u201cgenerally,\u201d but to a particular bearer,\u2014one to B. Cohen, and the other to Ennulot,\u2014and therefore were not negotiable without the indorsement of the payee thereon. 1 Daniel, Neg. Inst. (4th Ed.) \u00a7 105; Tied. Com. Paper, \u00a7 243; Warren v. Scott, 32 Iowa, 22. See Neg. Inst. Law, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 28. The rule applicable to this question is stated by Daniel in his work on Negotiable Instruments in these words (section 105):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">\u201cIf the bill or note be payable \u2018to the bearer, A.,\u2019 it is the same as if simply payable to A., and is not negotiable. But, if payable to A., or bearer, it is the same as if payable to bearer; and so if payable to A., or holder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">The uncontradicted proof shows that the checks were payable to real persons who had rendered services to the maker as tailors, and they were signed by him upon the representation of the forger that each of the payees was entitled to receive the amount of the check for work actually performed. The forger testified that, instead of delivering the checks to the payees, he indorsed their respective names thereon, and got one Aaron Zwerdling to cash them; that he gave no part of the moneys so obtained to the payees, or either of them; and that he had no authority from either of them, or the maker, to indorse the checks. Zwerdling, on the other hand, testified that he cashed the checks for the payees; but they denied indorsing them, or receiving any part of the sums for which they were drawn. The jury resolved the conflict of testimony in favor of the plaintiff, and we think, upon a careful examination of the record, that they were warranted in finding\u2014as must be assumed from their verdict they did find\u2014that the indorsements were forged. Forgery of such indorsements being thus established, title to the checks in controversy did not pass; and the plaintiff, having paid the amount thereof to the defendant in ignorance of the facts, is entitled to recover back the moneys so paid. Citizens\u2019 Nat. Bank of Davenport v. Importers\u2019 &amp; Traders\u2019 Bank of New York, 119 N. Y. 195, 23 N. E. 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The counsel for the appellant urge that the trial justice erred in refusing to submit to the jury the question of the intent of the maker as to whether the checks in suit should or should not be payable to bearer. We think such refusal was proper. The rule invoked by the appellant\u2019s counsel applies only to a case where the maker knows the payee to be fictitious, and actually intends to make the paper payable to a fictitious person. Shipman v. Bank, 126 N. Y. 318, 330, 27 N. E. 371, 12 L. R. A. 791. Here we have no such situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Counsel for the appellant contend, finally, that the trial justice erred in sustaining an objection to a question put to the maker on cross-examination with a view of showing reimbursement to him by the forger. But such defense was not pleaded, and hence the evidence was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The judgment must, therefore, be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-11\"> Opinion rendered by the associate justices after the death of Presiding Justice Beekman.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
