A year later the plaintiff demanded his goods, and the defendant refused to let him have them till he paid a year\u2019s rent and some other charges. <em>Held </em>that, defendant having no right to detain the goods for unpaid rent, the facts were sufficient to sustain a complaint for conversion.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b1149-11\">Appeal from trial term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1149-12\">Action by Clarence W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6-\">It was error to dismiss the complaint. The evidence of plaintiff, uncontradicted as it was, would have entitled and justified the court in directing a verdict in his favor. It proves that defendant was the owner of a lot of ground at 130th street and Park avenue, and leased it to plaintiff (who was a junk dealer) for the storage of old junk of all kinds. Plaintiff took possession about May, .1896, and about September, 1897, as he terms it, closed the yard, and placed on the gate his own lock, and leaving in the yard a quantity of junk of considerable value. With plaintiff\u2019s consent, on or about October 15, 1897, it appears that defendant caused his agent to remove plaintiff\u2019s lock from the gate, and placed thereon a lock owned by defendant, thus securing the goods stored in the yard. This state of affairs continued down to September 20, 1898, when plaintiff demanded his goods from defendant, who, through his agent, \u2014one Beaver,\u2014refused to deliver the goods to plaintiff unless one year\u2019s rent was paid; also some other charges. This demand was not complied with. Plaintiff\u2019s was the only evidence submitted. It appears to us that plaintiff had, lawfully, goods in defendant\u2019s yard; that by defendant\u2019s consent the same were left in said yard after plaintiff had left it, and \"had had a right to their possession at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>time thereafter if in defendant\u2019s possession. Apparently it was in his possession when a demand for them was made upon him, for his agent said to plaintiff, \u201cYou may have them if you pay us the rent due from you.\u201d Defendant had no right to retain the goods for unpaid rent, and the detention of the goods because of plaintiff\u2019s failure to pay said rent was an unlawful act, and made the defendant guilty of conversion; wherefore we say that it was error to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">The judgment must be reversed, with costs to appellant to abid\u00e9 the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
