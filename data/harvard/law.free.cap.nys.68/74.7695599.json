Is it possible that Clark is practicing the same tactics .as when he was foreman of the Providence Journal, from which he was unceremoniously bounced, so it is reported, for making false entries on the pay roll, and pocketing the proceeds? Many merchants of Rhode Island cherish his memory very dear. If the Sun wants to get a true certificate of the character of its head rat, let them consult ex-Governor Brown and other well-known citizens of Rhode Island. The rates of wages paid in the Sun establishment range from \u00a712 up to \u00a727 per we\u00e9k. It may go a little higher on the books; but, if Mr. Clark is living up to his reputation, it is safe to say that he gets a good share of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-22\">\u2018 For this publication the defendant was subsequently indicted, tried, and convicted of a libel, and sentenced to be imprisoned in the penitentiary for the term of three months. From this judgment he has appealed, and asks for a reversal upon the grounds: (1) That the trial court erred in not permitting the defendant to testify as to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>belief of the truth of the article published; and (2) in instructing the jury as to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">A libel is defined by the Penal Code (section 242) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">\u201cA malicious publication, by writing, printing, picture, effigy, sign or otherwise than by mere speech, which exposes any living person, or the memory of any person deceased, to hatred, contempt, ridicule or obloquy, or which causes, or tends to cause any person to be shunned or avoided, or which has a tendency to injure any person, corporation, or association of persons, in his or their business or occupation, is a libel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The following section (243) provides \u201cthat a person who publishes a libel is guilty of a misdemeanor,\u201d and the next section (244) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">\u201cA publication having the tendency or effect mentioned in section 242 is to be deemed malicious if no justification or excuse therefor is shown. The publication is justified when the matter charged as libelous is true, and was published with good motives and for justifiable ends. The publication is excused when- it is honestly made in the belief of its truth, and upon reasonable grounds for this belief, and consists of fair comments upon the conduct of a person in respect of public affairs, or upon a thing which the proprietor thereof \u25a0offers or explains to the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">It was admitted upon the trial that the article was. published in a newspaper called the \u201cUnionist,\u201d and that the defendant at that time was in charge of such newspaper; he himself saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">\u201cI have admitted here that I was the editor of the Unionist on the 28th day of September, 1899. I was so regarded. I was regarded as the editor. *' * * The article in question passed through my hands. 1 saw it. Q. But do you assume the responsibility for this alleged libel? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">The defendant was then permitted to testify fully as to his motives in publishing the article, and, among other things, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">\u201cWell, my motives were as a union man, as a believer in trades unions, as a man who has been always a trades union man ever since he became a journeyman, almost,\u2014I wanted to show the public,\u2014I wanted to show Col. Bartlett and his fellow stockholders the caliber of the man that they had as the foreman of the New York Sun. &lt;= * * Well, my motives were, of course, as I said, to show the caliber of this man. I had heard, in an indirect way, of him for over ten years. * * * My motive was to show the caliber of the complainant, Mr. Clark, and not only to the Sun people, but to other employers of union men throughout the city. That is about all that I can say in reference to motive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">He was then asked the following question: \u201cQ. Now, Mr. Sherlock, when you published this alleged libel, did you in good faith and honesty believe the statements therein contained to be true?\u201d An objection was made by the counsel for the people, which was sustained, and the defendant was not permitted to answer. The defendant insists that the court erred in making this ruling, and this is the first ground alleged as calling for a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">We are of the opinion that the ruling was right. Section 244 of the Penal Code, above referred to, it will be noticed, provides that a publication is excused \u201cwhen it is honestly made in the belief of its truth, and upon reasonable grounds for this belief.\u201d It is not justified unless the person making the publication has \u201creasonable grounds\u201d for believing that the statements made are true. Therefore, before a party can be permitted to testify as to his belief, the facts upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>which that belief is based must be given, so that the jury may determine not only whether the publication was honestly made, but whether the person had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d for the belief. One cannot testify as to his belief as to the truth of an article published until he has first stated the facts and circumstances upon which the belief is predicated. If we are right in this conclusion, then it necessarily follows that the ruling was correct, because not a single fact or circumstance was given by the defendant establishing, or tending to establish, the truth of the statements contained in the publication. On the contrary, it seems to have been conceded that Clark never had been employed by, nor had any connection whatever with, the Providence Journal, that he was not \u201cunceremoniously bounced,\u201d that he never made \u201cfalse entries on the pay roll,\u201d and that he never \u201cpocketed the proceeds.\u201d ' The defendant having utterly failed to give any testimony justifying his belief, the court properly held that he could not testify as to his belief. Powers v. Skinner, 1 Wend. 451; Hotchkiss v. Oliphant, 2 Hill, 510; Rice v. Withers, 9 Wend. 139. The publication of a libel is a wrong, and the person against whom the article is directed is presumed to have sustained damage, irrespective of the intent of the publisher (Holmes v. Jones, 147 N. Y. 59, 41 N. E. 409); and, when the person responsible for the publication is sought to be punished in a criminal proceeding,'he cannot excuse himself by testifying that he believed the article was true, until he has given facts and circumstances from which a legal inference can be drawn that there was at least some ground for the belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">This brings us to a consideration of the other ground of error alleged, viz. that the court erred in instructing the jury as to-the law of the case. After a careful consideration of the charge as made, we do not think it is subject to the criticism made upon it by the appellant\u2019s counsel; and it is to be observed that the defendant\u2019s counsel at the trial was so impressed, because we do not find that any exception was then taken to the charge, or any requests made on behalf of the defendant, in which the court did not acquiesce. What is complained of is that the trial court, in effect, took from the jury \u201cthe right to determine the law.\u201d But the most casual consideration of the charge as a whole will show that the court not only did not do this, but, on the contrary, stated to' the jury that they were the sole judges of \u201cthe law and the fact.\u201d This statement was made to the jury no less than five times during the course of the charge, and near the close of the charge the court said: \u201cYou are the sole judges of the law and the facts. You may decide this case as your consciences and your judgments dictate, and I believe you will do so,\u201d\u2014while at the beginning of the charge substantially the same thing was stated. The court, in calling the jury\u2019s attention to the constitutional provision to the effect that it was the sole judge of the law and the fact, said, \u201cBy the organic law of this state, namely, the constitution, which is the highest law of this state, it is provided that the jury are to be the sole judges of both the law and the fact.\u201d And the jury could not have misunderstood the instructions thus given simply because the learned trial judge thereafter commented on this provision of the constitution, or explained to them the law relating to libel. A judge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>where a person is on trial for the crime of libel, not only has the right, but it is his duty, to tell the jury what the law is, in order that they may properly discharge their duty; and, so long as he does not interfere with their functions by arrogating to himself the right and power which belong to them,\u2014that is, to determine both the law and the fact,\u2014no error is committed. Our conclusion, therefore, is that the defendant had a fair trial. The jury were properly instructed by the judge presiding at the trial, and they found, upon evidence sufficient to sustain the finding, that the defendant was guilty of the charge set out in the indictment, and it follows that the judgment must be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
