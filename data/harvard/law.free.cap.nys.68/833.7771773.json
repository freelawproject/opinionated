De Lemos v. Cohen, 28 Mise. Rep. 579, 59 N. Y. Supp. 498. It was therefore improper to open the case for the purpose assigned, and the judgment appealed from must be reversed. The defendant, however, was seriously prejudiced by being required to proceed to trial originally before the plaintiff furnished the bill of particulars ordered by the court, and, after a consideration of the entire record, we are of the opinion that the ends of justice will be promoted by a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">Judgment appealed from reversed, and new trial ordered, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
