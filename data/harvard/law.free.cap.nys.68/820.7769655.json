Where an attorney is retained for a particular case, and is discharged without cause, the measure of damage is ordinarily the stipulated compensation. Marsh v. Holbrook, 3 Abb. Dec. 178; 3 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 426, 427. The defendant did not attempt to prove that the plaintiff would incur expense in the performance of his duties, and there was, therefore, no ground laid for claiming a deduction from the fee agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
