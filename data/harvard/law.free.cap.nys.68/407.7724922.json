The plaintiff, in crossing such bridge with a heavy traction engine upon which he was riding, and which it was claimed weighed, with its load and attachments, considerably more than four tons, broke through the bridge, and was seriously injured. Negligence was charged against defendant for not keeping such bridge in reasonably safe repair, and its breaking down, and the injury consequent thereon, is charged as the result of such negligence. This action was brought to recover against defendant for the injuries sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>tained. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of plaintiff, and from the judgment rendered thereon and the order denying a new trial this appeal is taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b428-4\">Argued before PARKER, P.

That statute, in substance,\" provides that whoever suffers injury from the breaking of a bridge upon a public highway, when attempting to take across it a load exceeding four tons in weight, cannot recover against the town damages for the injury so sustained, but, on the contrary, the town may recover damages from him for the injury to the bridge. There was evidence tending to show that the load which the plaintiff was attempting to take across this bridge considerably' exceeded four tons, and therefore, if the statute did apply to this bridge, the request to charge was evidently both material and correct. We are of the opinion that such statute does apply to the bridge in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">By the construction of its railroad, it became necessary for the defendant to erect this bridge in the highway, and it was therefore lawfully and properly erected. Prom that time forth it became necessary, for the public use, that some one should keep it in proper repair, and the law imposed that duty upon the defendant instead of upon the town. But the amount of care which the company must thereafter give to such repairs, and the extent to which such bridge must be kept serviceable and safe for the public use, was not enlarged by the statute which imposed such duty upon the company. It does not require that such bridge should be a stronger bridge or a safer one than is needed to meet the ordinary purposes and use to which such highway is put, nor is any reason apparent why such an additional duty should be imposed upon the company. The bridges over the streams crossing the highway which are maintained by the town are deemed sufficiently strong and safe if a load not exceeding four tons may be safely taken across. Why should this particular bridge be required to carry more than the bridge over a stream one-half a mile east of it is required to sustain? We see no reason for holding a railroad company under such circumstances to any stricter duty or liability than is held against the town. The statute in this respect marks the extent of the duty which is imposed upon each, and we think the trial court should have charged as the defendant requested. Its refusal to do so was error, for which a new trial must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">When the action brought by Bush to recover for injuries caused by this same accident was before us, a majority of the court were not of the opinion that the record presented this question in a man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>ner which permitted us to pass upon it. In this record it is specifically presented, and we have reached the conclusion above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">For that reason the judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">SMITH and EDWARDS, JJ., dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
