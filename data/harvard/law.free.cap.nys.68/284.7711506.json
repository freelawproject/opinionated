Proc. \u00a7 3221, provides that no property is exempt from levy and sale on execution issued on a judgment for a servant\u2019s wages, and if the execution is returned unsatisfied an execution against defendant\u2019s person may issue. An officer received an execution issued on a judgment for wages of a domestic servant, but renewed it at the judgment debtor\u2019s request, and afterwards both that execution and one against the person were returned unsatisfied. In an action against such officer, plaintiff\u2019s attorney testified that, on the day the first execution issued, the debtor had more than property enough to satisfy the execution, which he said belonged to him. <em>Held </em>sufficient to establish plaintiff\u2019s damages by reason of the officer\u2019s renewal of the execution.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2g\">On a former appeal in this action (52 App. Div. 276, 65 N. Y. Supp. 382) we held that where the defendant, as marshal, had an execution in his hands, and extended the judgment debtor\u2019s time for the payment of the judgment beyond the time fixed for the return of the execution, and, without consultation with the plaintiff, procured its renewal, he was liable for the damages sustained by the judgment creditor. The evidence at the last trial showed that the plaintiff on January 30, 1900, recovered a judgment in the municipal court for $25.37, for wages as a domestic servant, against one Chrysler. By section 3221 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \u201cno property of the defendant is exempt from levy and sale by virtue of an execution issued\u201d upon such a judgment, and if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>execution is returned unsatisfied an execution against the person may be issued. Execution was issued to the defendant on February 5th, which was renewed through the procurement of the defendant on February 25th, and returned by him unsatisfied on March 17th. An execution against the person was issued to the defendant on March 20th, and returned not satisfied on April 28th. It appeared by the defendant\u2019s testimony that he saw Chrysler only once, and that this was about two weeks after the issuing of the first execution, when Chrysler asked him to delay for a week, when he thought he would be \u201cable to straighten the matter out,\u201d and the defendant assented. Subsequently he tried to see Chrysler, but was unable to find him. Mr. Clark, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, testified that on February 5th, the day of the issuing of the execution, he saw \u201cMr. Chrysler in possession of more than enough property to satisfy the execution on that day.\u201d On cross-examination the fact appeared that Chrysler told Mr. Clark that the property belonged to him, and no motion was made to strike out the testimony. This evidence, though slight, was sufficient to establish the plaintiff\u2019s damages by reason of the defendant\u2019s renewal of the execution. The judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Judgment o\u00ed the municipal court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
