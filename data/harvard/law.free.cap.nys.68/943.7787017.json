In opposing the motion, the attorney for plaintiff, who has had charge of the several matters between the plaintiff and defendant, states positively in his affidavit that the several payments made by the defendant were so made upon the express agreement that the same be first applied upon the extinguishment of claims other than the claims involved in the sequestration suit (i. e. the claim upon which the judgment herein was recovered was involved in the sequestration suit); that the moneys received have been so applied, and that the whole of the judgment herein remains unpaid. It thus appears that a very serious conflict exists between the parties upon the application of the moneys paid, and the question of payment of the judgment herein remains in doubt and uncertainty. Under like circumstances it has been decided that the party seeking the relief should be left to his action therefor, provided relief can be had in that form (Hill v. Hermans, 59 N. Y. 396; Van Etten v. Hasbrouck, 4 N. Y. St. Rep. 803); and, after a very careful examination of the record on this appeal, we are of opinion that the special term should have remitted the defendant to his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-14\">Order appealed from reversed, and motion denied, with $10 costs and disbursements. Order for examination of defendant in proceedings supplementary to execution reinstated, and defendant directed to appear thereunder upon a day to be named in the order entered thereon. Leave is granted to the defendant to apply, if so advised, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>for a stay of proceedings supplementary to execution pending the determination of any action he may institute to have the judgment adjudged paid.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
