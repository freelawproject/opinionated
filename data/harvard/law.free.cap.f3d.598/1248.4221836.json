Specifically, Brummer argues that the forfeiture provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(d)(1) does not apply to violations of \u00a7 922(e), or, in the alternative, that the district court may in its discretion refuse to order forfeiture under \u00a7 924(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-14\">The parties do not dispute the facts. A federal grand jury indicted Brummer with knowingly and willfully delivering a package containing firearms and ammunition to a common carrier, for transportation and shipment in foreign commerce, without providing written notice to the carrier that the firearms and ammunition were being transported and shipped, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e). The indictment also called for Brummer to forfeit to the United States one Smith and Wesson .357 caliber revolver, one Walther .380 caliber pistol, and six rounds of .380 caliber ammunition upon conviction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(d)(1) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461(c). Brummer pleaded guilty to knowingly and willfully violating \u00a7 922(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-16\">The district court, despite Brummer\u2019s arguments to the contrary, concluded that the forfeiture provision of \u00a7 924(d)(1) applies to violations of \u00a7 922(e). The district court also stated that if it had the discretion to do so, it would deny the forfeiture of Brummer\u2019s weapons, but that it lacked discretion to deny forfeiture. Brummer challenges those conclusions in this appeal. We review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation. <em>Chepstow Ltd. v. Hunt, </em>381 F.3d 1077 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-17\">The forfeiture provision at issue in this appeal provides in applicable part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-18\">Any firearm or ammunition involved in or used in any knowing violation of subsections (a)(4), (a)(6), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), or (k) of section 922, or knowing importation or bringing into the United States or any possession thereof any firearm or ammunition in violation of section 922(i), or knowing violation of section 924, or willful violation of any other provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, ... shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1271-19\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(d)(1). The statute under which Brummer was convicted, \u00a7 922(e), makes it unlawful for anyone:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj6\">knowingly to deliver ... to any common or contract carrier for transportation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>shipment in ... foreign commerce, to persons other than licensed importers, licensed manufacturers, licensed dealers, or licensed collectors, any package or other container in which there is any firearm or ammunition without written notice to the carrier that such firearm or ammunition is being transported or shipped....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">Brummer argues that because \u00a7 922(e) is not contained in \u00a7 924(d)(1)\u2019s list of \u201cknowing\u201d violations, a violation of \u00a7 922(e) does not fall within the ambit of the forfeiture provision of \u00a7 924(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">Brummer\u2019s argument misses the mark. The statute that provides the penalty for a violation of \u00a7 922(e) states in applicable part that \u201cwhoever ... willfully violates any other provision of this chapter shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(D); <em>see Bryan v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 184, 187-88, 118 S.Ct. 1939, 1943, 141 L.Ed.2d 197 (1998) (explaining \u00a7 924\u2019s relation to the rest of Title 18, Chapter 44 of the United States Code). Willfulness is therefore an element of the offense under \u00a7 922(e). <em>See United States v. Andrade, </em>135 F.3d 104, 108 n. 2 (1st Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Ali, </em>68 F.3d 1468, 1473 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">The indictment charged Brummer with knowingly and willfully violating \u00a7 922(e). During his plea colloquy, Brummer acknowledged that willfulness is an element of a \u00a7 922(e) violation, and he pleaded guilty to a willful violation of \u00a7 922(e). That provision falls within the same chapter as \u00a7 924(d)(1), which provides that \u201cany firearm or ammunition involved in or used in any ... willful violation of any other provision of this chapter ... shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture.... \u201d Under the plain language of \u00a7 924(d)(1), the forfeiture provision applies to willful violations of \u00a7 922(e). \u201cIf the meaning of the statutory language is plain, we go no further.\u201d <em>Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. United States, </em>455 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">Brummer also argues that, even if the forfeiture provision contained in \u00a7 924(d)(1) applies to violations of \u00a7 922(e), the district court retains discretion to deny forfeiture. Brummer bases that argument on the fact that \u00a7 924(d)(1) provides that \u201c[a]ny firearm or ammunition involved in or used in any [of the specified offenses] shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture,\u201d not that such property \u201cshall be forfeited.\u201d Brummer\u2019s argument is that the phrase \u201cshall be subject to seizure and forfeiture\u201d gives the district court discretion to return firearms and ammunition in appropriate cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">Again, Brummer\u2019s argument misses the mark. It completely ignores 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461(c), a provision cited in the part of the indictment containing the forfeiture allegations. Section 2461(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-10\">If a person is charged in a criminal case with a violation of an Act of Congress for which the civil or criminal forfeiture of property is authorized, the Government may include notice of the forfeiture in the indictment ... pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. If the defendant is convicted of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture, the court <em>shall </em>order the forfeiture of the property as part of the sentence in the criminal ease pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHFI\">(emphasis added). \u201cThe word \u2018shall\u2019 does not convey discretion. It is not a leeway word.\u201d <em>United States v. Quirante, </em>486 F.3d 1273, 1275 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-11\">Brummer was charged with willfully violating \u00a7 922(e). As we explained earlier, \u00a7 924(d)(l)\u2019s forfeiture provision applies to willful violations of \u00a7 922(e). The indictment charging Brummer. with violating \u00a7 922(e) included a notice of forfeiture. Brummer pleaded guilty and was convict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>ed. The district court therefore was required to order forfeiture of the property. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461(c). The statute directs that the court do so \u201cpursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.2(b)(1) requires that, \u201c[a]s soon as practical after a ... plea of guilty or nolo contendere is accepted, on any count in an indictment or information regarding which criminal forfeiture is sought, the court must determine what property is subject to forfeiture under the applicable statute.\u201d Rule 32.2(b)(2) explains the next step: \u201cIf the court determines that the property is subject to forfeiture, it must promptly enter a preliminary order of forfeiture ... directing forfeiture of the specific property....\u201d The district court properly determined that the two guns and six rounds of ammunition involved in Brummer\u2019s willful violation of \u00a7 922(e) were subject to forfeiture under \u00a7 924(d)(1). Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2 therefore required the district court to direct forfeiture of the guns and ammunition. The court lacked discretion to do otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
