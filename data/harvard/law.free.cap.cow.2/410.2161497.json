These may be filed <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b410-8\">And if these, or the like papers, are lost, the court will allow new ones to be drawn and filed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b410-9\">And they will allow the party to amend his continuances or a nisi <em>prius </em>clause, in the judgment roll.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b410-10\">These, and the like amendments, will be allowed after error brought, after paying the costs of the motion; and the proceedings in error, provided the plaintiff in error choose to discontinue.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AYAp\">This cause was tried April 12th, 1821, when a verdict was foun(l for the plaintiffs, subject to the opinion of the Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>on a case, which was made; and in August term, 1822, the Court delivered their opinion in favor of the defendants. (20 John. 229, S. C.) The defendants\u2019 attorney then drew the record; but having soon after left the city of New York, where he resided, and where the cause was tried, on account of the yellow fever prevailing there, he did not them search for the <em>nisi prius </em>record. The judgment was afterwards delayed by an order to stay proceedings, and a motion to amend the case, and for a re-hearing, on the part of the plaintiffs, till January term, 1823, when the motion was denied. The judgment was then further delayed, by an injunction, till February thereafter, which being then dissolved, the defendants\u2019 attorney caused the judgment to be. signed and filed, but forgot to search for the <em>nisi prius </em>record. On the 25th of July last the plaintiffs sued out a writ of error. The defendants\u2019 attorney inquired for the <em>nisi prius </em>record at the office of the Clerk of the siftings, where it was not found;. nor could the plaintiff\u2019s attorney give him any account of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-4\">In the record, the venire was awarded as returnable in October term, 1819, at the City Hall of the city of New York, and the parties were stated as appearing there; whereas by an appointment of the Governor, (the yellow fever prevailing in New York,) the Court was then held at the Capitol in the city of Albany. There was also a mistake in the <em>nisi prius </em>clause, in omitting; the usual words, \u201cif they, or either of them at a sittings appointed,\u201d and in some other particulars.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-5\"><em>P. A Jay, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABK\">moved for leave to. file a <em>nisi prius record, postea, Cleric's certificate, venire, </em>and <em>panel, nunc pro tunc, </em>as of the term of May, 1821, and also to amend the record, in the particulars specified.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-6\"><em>Hopkins, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b411-7\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AdWp\">It is a matter of course to allow these and the like amendments, where the omission or informality is accounted for. We grant the rule as applied for, on paying the costs of this motion, and if the plaintiffs choose to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>continue their proceedings in error, the defendants must also pay the costs of the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
