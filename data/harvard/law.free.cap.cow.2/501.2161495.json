They pleaded not guilty, and the indictment was remanded to the general sessions of that county; but the defendants b ought a <em>certiorari </em>to remove the indictment to this Court. This writ was granted, on motion, in August term, 1821. The general sessions, at their August term of the same year, received the writ, and directed a return to be made, without requiring the defendants to give bail; nor did the defendants themselves enter into recognizance, as required by the statute. (1 R. L. 141, s. 4.) At the January term of this Court, 1822, the defendants obtained a rule that all proceedings be stayed until the public prosecutor should consent to the issuing of a commission to take the testimony of foreign witnesses, a copy of which rule was served on the District Attorney of Erie, on the 23d day of May thereafter.
