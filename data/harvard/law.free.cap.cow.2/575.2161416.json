Strong, </em>Attorney.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-9\">This writ was allowed by Mr. Recorder Riker, on an af \u25a0 fidavit of Mr. Strong, counsel for the respondents in the Court of Sessions, detailing the commencement of the cause there, the evidence, points made, and the decisions thereon, with the order of the Sessions quashing the order of removal; and the Court below made a full return, embracing the particulars to which the affidavit related. The affidavit did not show that the Sessions had stated a special case, and for this cause,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-10\">\n<em>D. Robert</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJkr\">now moved to quash the certiorari and return. He said the practice of submitting to this Court questions of law, arising upon evidence given at the Sessions, depended on their stating a case voluntarily; but this Court will not compel them to do it. The Sessions are an inferior jurisdiction, proceeding summarily, as to which the general rule is that they are not bound to send up any matter upon certiorari, except their process and record of judgment. Such is the rule in England as to the Quarter Sessions; and the statute, (1 R. L. 285, s. 18,) requiring the Court of Sessions in the city of New York to state a case, upon certiorari, strongly implies that no other Court of Sessions is bound to do this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-11\">To show when certiorari lies, and its nature and object, he cited 1 Ld. Raym. 469, 580 ; 1 Salk. .144; 2 Burr. 1042.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>And to show when the proceedings of summary jurisdictions may be reviewed on the merits, he cited Burr. Sett. Cas. 64, 77, 278, 454 ; 3 John. Rep. 23; 1 T. R. 755; 2 Burr. 1040.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b577-4\">But <em>the </em>Court,</author>\n<p id=\"Aex\">without hearing Mr. <em>S. B. </em>Strong, who was to have argued against the motion, said that the constant practice of this Court is, to require the Sessions to state the evidence and points of law in their return. And though this is denied in England, and rests upon the will of the Court below, as Mr. Robert had insisted; yet, in this state, if the Sessions should refuse to make such a return, this Court would compel them to do it, by a rule.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Motion denied with costsi</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Savage, Ch.
