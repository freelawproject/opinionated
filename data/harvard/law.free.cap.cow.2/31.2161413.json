The plaintiff entered a default on the 3d Jan., 1S22; and a rule to assess damages upon all the counts. Now, all these matters were insisted on for error, as well, as the <em>general </em>assessment of damages. And accordingly,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-5\"><em>S. M. Hopkins, </em>for the plaintiff in error, stated the following points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-6\"><em>1st. </em>That the <em>capias </em>is in the name of <em>John </em>Knickerber, but the subsequent proceedings are in the name of <em>John Knickerbacker.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-7\">2d. That Golden did not appear in the suit, either by filing bail, or in any other mode as required by law ; the common bail piece .filed by Knickerbacker, on the behalf of Golden, having been filed contrary to the statute, and therefore void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-8\">3d. That from the showing of Knickerbacker in his declaration, he had no cause of action against Golden, at the time of the commencement of the action or at the time of entering judgment therein.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-9\">4th. That there is a variance between the declaration and the judgment record in this : that in the declaration Knickerber counts on a note made in 1821, whereas in the judgment record no such note is mentioned, but a note alleged to have been made in 1820.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>5th. That the matters and causes of action alleged and set forth in the second count of the declaration, are triable and determinable only by a jury; but that, nevertheless, he whole matter contained in the declaration was referred ,) the Clerk, who reported thereon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-4\">6th. That the declaration is of October term, generally, referring to the <em>first day </em>of the term, although, from the showing of Knickerbackei, his writ was taken out after that day, and was returnable on the last day of the term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-5\">He said, it is true, that a part of the objections are of form. Many errors may be called so, which are yet of vital importance. Matters of form are essential, to enable parties to avail themselves of .their rights ; and there is no safety for a defendant, if the plaintiff is allowed to travel entirely out of the ordinary course of judicial proceedings. Here the plaintiff\u2019s name is wrong, and there was no chance for the defendant to appear in a right name.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-8\">The plaintiff having brought the defendant into Court, should have allowed him a regular time to appear. Not having done so, the proceedings are intrinsically erroneous. The <em>capias </em>was returnable the 27th of October, and the plaintiff filed common bail on the 29th of November following. The defendant did not appear at all. Finding a judgment against him, he has a right to look to the continuity of the proceedings. The declaration relates to the first day of the term, and in judgment of law was put into Court before the return day of the process.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Had the plaintiff sued in his right name, he had no authority to file common bail, until forty days after the return of the process. The statutc<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> is conditional, <em>\u201c </em>that in cases where special bail may be required, if the defendant shall not cause the same to be given within double the time required for that purpose by the rules of the Court, it shall be lawful for the plaintiff to file common bail for the defendant.\u201d The 40 days, which are double the time allowed for pleading in the Supreme Court, did not expire till the 6th of December. The 20 days\u2019 time for appearing in that Court ran from the 27th of October, the return day of the writ. This formality should have been strictly complied with. The plaintiff can, in no case, in the Supreme Court, file common bail till after 40 days from the second week of term.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> But the plaintiff has not only ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>peared for us out o\u00ed time, but he appeared for us at the sui 0f a person not named in the process. It is settled that he cannot do this even after the double time for appearing has 6xpired.;<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtK\">The plaintiff then declared upon a note payable nearly one 7ear -aft61 the action was commenced; but when he comes to make up the record, he corrects the date, and makes it payable one year .earlier.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4m\">The rule that the Clerk assess damages, generally, upon all the counts, is a substantial error, and decisive of the cause- The defendant\u2019s right to have the damages assessed by a jury have been wholly disregarded. The only exception to this right is by statute,<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> when a judgment by default, demurrer, or confession, is given upon a written contract for a sum certain.- Wherever there is the least uncertainty in the damages, the law always calls for the intervention of a jury. The same thing is required by the most sacred rights of the parties. This very point was decided in the case of <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Waterman &amp; Wells, </em>on error from the Mayor\u2019s Court of New York to the Supreme Court, M. S. May term, 1821.<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> The statute authorizing an assessment by the Clerk, in any case, is at best in derogation of a common law right, and should be construed strictly.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>J. L. Viele &amp; A. Van Vechten, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMMZ\">The defendant will contend, that the judgment of the Supreme Court ought to be affirmed, for the following among other reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>1. Because the plaintiff in error could have had complete relief as to every error complained of, in the Court below, and by neglecting to apply there, has waived those errors, if the7 are Such\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>2. Because none of the errors relied upon lay the foundation for a writ of error in this Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-5\">3. Because all the errors complained of by the plaintiff, if any exist, are cured by the statute of jeofails.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A03\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>This is an attempt, by a writ of error, to correct mere ciericai mistakes, without first applying to the Court below for their correction. But by adverting to the constitution,<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> it will be seen that this Court, was formed for the purpose of revising errors in the' actual decisions of the Supreme Court. The Justices of the Supreme Court are required, on writ of error, to assign the reasons by which they were guided in the judgment of the Court below. But these errors all passed on in silence; and the Court-were never called to pronounce upon them, though perfectly competent to administer relief. Why did the defendant omit to apply to that Court ? Shall he be allowed to dela^ and keep silence, during the whole round of this proceeding there, and then come here to correct errors, which he never brought to the view of the Supreme Court ? That Court have given no decision upon these matters, within the meaning of the constitution, as is plain from the nature of the objections. The mistake of the name, the variance between the declaration and record, the mistake in filing the common bail piece, and the general assessment of damages, &amp;c., are all matters of which the defendant ought properly to have availed himself in the Court below. The error in the name could not mislead ; for the name is right in the <em>ac etiam. </em>The defendant probably knowing the plaintiff\u2019s demand to be just, lies by till the judgment is perfected. He doubtless knew of the irregularity, but if not on discovering it, he should have gone to the Supreme Court, where the fact of his knowledge could have been tried on affidavit. The delay, after a' knowledge of his rights, should defeat his application to set aside the proceedings, and would have had this effect by the rules of that Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>[S tro am, Senator. Will error lie for a mere irregularity <em>1 </em>I had supposed it would not. The usual course is to seek redress by motion in the Court below.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-5\">\n<em>Hopkins,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiFg\">said he was not prepared, at this moment, to say, upon authority, that error would lie; but he insisted that every <em>irregularity </em>is <em>error. Error </em>is a generic term; and includes not only those defects apparent upon the face of the record, but every omission or mistake in proceeding to judgment, which would be a ground for setting it aside in the Court below.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-6\">\n<em>Viele &amp; Van Vechten,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYj2\">denied that every irregularity is technically an error, so as to be the subject of a writ of error. But suppose it to be as contended on the other side, at any rate, these matters should have been suggested to the Court below, in order to warrant a writ of error. In <em>Sands </em>v. <em>Hildreth,</em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>on appeal from the Court of Chancery, the Chancellor stated that the appellants never appeared at the hearing to make a defence, in consequence of which, his decree was given as a matter of course, on the default of the defendants below. This Court, therefore, dismissed the appeal. This was on the ground that the merits had not been reviewed in the Court below, through the neglect of the appellants. In <em>Gelston and Schenck </em>v. <em>Hoyt,</em><footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendants below joined in demurrer to their special pleas, but when the demurrer was called upon the calendar, they made default, and judgment passed without argument; and this Court, for that reason, refused to hear the demurrer argued here. The reasoning of the Chancellor, in that case, applies most emphatically, to these matters of irregularity. \u201c It is, (says the Chancellor,) <footnotemark><em>(i)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an unfair proceeding; for it takes from the party demurring, an advantage which he would have been entitled to in the Supreme Court, if the inclination of that Court had been against him of withdrawing his demurrer, and replying to the pleas. So of all matters of irregularity. The Court below will exercise a discretion, when their attention is called to them, in amending or overlooking them altogether, or setting aside the proceedings according to the various circumstances of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>case. A writ of error deprives us of all these advantages jn <em>Henry v. Cuyler et </em>ux.<footnotemark>(j)</footnotemark> this Court quashed a writ of error brought by the defendant below, who had demurred and suffered judgment against him upon the demurrer by default, although the same question had been determined against him in another cause ; and the cause was brought here by consent of counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-3\">If the doctrine of these cases is sound, the writ of error in this case cannot be sustained. In cases of irregularity, the objection must be made at the first opportunity which offers. This is not only the rule of law, but it is required by common justice. It is unjust to lie by in silence, for months and years, till the cause has gone through all its forms, and then surprise the party by a writ of error, or appeal, even after an execution satisfied. All the irregularities in the proceedings below are thus waived by the party entitled to object. The inference is, that he means to acquiesce, on the judgment being against him according to the course of the Court. This action was upon a promissory note. Perhaps the very reason why the Court below was not applied to, was because the irregularity had been waived by delay, and there were no merits upon which to found the application.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayt\">But suppose error will lie, where the party has suffered a judgment by default, it does not follow that every mistake is the proper subject of a writ of error. Will error lie for an imperfection, of which a party cannot avail himself in pleading <em>1 </em>The <em>capias </em>does not appear upon the record; and when it is defective, it is almost a matter of course to amend it in the Court below. A mistake in the name is amendable.<footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark> It would be a libel upon justice, to say that every little slip of an attorney or clerk is to ground a writ of error. These the Courts will always correct, and they are never taken advantage of in practice, except for the purposes of legal chicanery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-6\">If the party will come here upon these matters, this Court will, at least, hold him to the rules which govern in the Court below. Here is a delay since Nov. 29th, 1821, to make an objection to the mode of appearance. The defendant now comes in and says, \u201c I have never appeared. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>On my neglect to do this, the plaintiff had a right by statute to appear for me. But he did this prematurely; and thereby took away my right to appear at all.\u201d We deny the consequence. We did that which was a part of the defendant\u2019s duty; and which he has altogether neglected. If we appeered for him oiit of season, he should have treated our act as a nullity, and appeared of course, or got rid of our irregular appearance upon motion, and then have come in by his own act. The defendant should have moved in this case, to set aside the proceedings before the next term.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-4\">[Sudam, Senator.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY6\">I remember a case in the Supreme Court, in which I was concerned as counsel, where the plaintiff went on and took his default by mistake, without naving filed common bail at all, and the defendant had not appeared in any way. In that case, the Court considered the filing common bail a mere matter of form, and allowed the plaintiff, on motion, to appear for the defendant, <em>nunc pro tunc.]</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-5\">The objection that the declaration was of October term, generally, is merely technical, and if it could be urged as irregularity, either here or in the Court below, it is clearly amendable. But, according to the reasoning on the other side, it is <em>no </em>objection. It is said the caption relates to the first day of term, and thus in contemplation of law, precedes the return day of the <em>capias; </em>but it is not denied that it also extends to every other day in the term, including the last, or return day, as well as the first. These cases \u2018 of relation to the first day of term are frequent in our judicial proceedings. They depend, however, on a fiction of law, which is always moulded to the purposes of equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-6\">Variance between the declaration and record cannot be objected here. The record is right; and this is the only evidence of the proceedings below. As between this and the declaration, the record should govern. The very reason why the defendant did not go to the Supreme Court was, probably, because the record gave the true date of the note, We venture to predict that this Court will have business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>enough, and not of a very pleasant nature, if they once con sent to take cognizance of petty irregularities like this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD9\">The damages were properly assessed by the Clerk. The declaration contains one count upon a promissory note. To this the money counts are superadded, which is the usual case in declaring upon a note. The statute<footnotemark>(l)</footnotemark> provides that when judgment by default is given in any action upon any promissory note for the payment of money, the Court shall direct the Clerk to assess the damages. These general counts are as good upon a promissory note, as a count setting forth the note itself. Do they not, then, come within the language of the statute ? An action containing these counts may properly be called an action upon a promissory note. But if error, it is a matter which the Court below should have been called upon to correct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-4\">If the note is misdescribed in the declaration, the plaintiff must then resort to his money counts. In such case he must give proof of the note to the Clerk within the 18th section of the act. (1 R. L. 523.) The Clerk is in such case required at the request of either party, to reduce the evidence to writing, and report it to the Court specially, who are to pass upon its competency\u2014so that no danger can arise from his assessing damages upon the money counts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-5\">[Sudam, Senator.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyS\">The usual practice in England is, I believe, to enter a <em>remittitur </em>as to the general counts, when the damages are assessed by the Clerk.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-6\">\n<em>Velie &amp; Van Vechten,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axsf\">referred to <em>Shepherd </em>v.

It does not, as here, depend Upon a statute provision. It will be seen from the cases cit-<em>r _ . . </em>. , ed, that there the paper upon which the assessment takes place, must as matter, of practice, be spread upon the record. But with us this cannot be important.

This principle has been frequently-acted upon.<footnotemark>(p)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-7\"><em>Hopkins, </em>in repl<em>y.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai2\">There is no doubt that, if the defend- / ant had voluntarily appeared, or his judgment had been after verdict, many of these errors would have been amendable. But gentlemen forget that this is not an application to amend. It is a proceeding on an issue of <em>in nullo est erratum </em>upon multiplied irregularities. The course pursued on the other side was unexpected, and has driven me to a course of research so sudden and desultory, that it is difficult to methodize the authorities which I must use in reply. Almost every volume of law mentions the distinction between faults curable and incurable by verdict and <em>nil dicit; </em>but perhaps we must search in vain for an authority, to show, that all the mistakes and omissions which we complain of, would not be cured by the default. It would be difficult to find an adjudged case in favor of bringing an action of debt upon a bond; and it is so in relation to severa of the errors assigned. Much has been said of the justness of the plaintiff\u2019s demand. But this Court are called upon for a decision which is to form a precedent upon a record brought here for adjudication on its validity, and in which specific errors are assigned. The Court are confined to the face of the record. They will not yield to a course of argument which will make every thing uncertain, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>render it impossible to advise what course shall be taken upon a given state of things appearing of record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-13\">May not a writ of error be brought upon irregularity, ot error in the intermediate proceedings? If not, what becomes of the multiplied distinctions in the books between errors curable and incurable, under the statute of <em>amend\u2022 ments </em>and <em>jeofails </em>? In Tidd\u2019s Pr. 102, authorities are cited, showing that the want of an original writ is aided by a verdict, though otherwise of a defective original. It is there said, that if an amended original is returned on certiorari, it will save the verdict, though it were originally defective. But in this case no amendment is pretended. \u2022 We are at issue upon the error as it stands. As was remarked by an honorable Senator, the Court below might have ordered common bail filed <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>to save the proceedings, but they were never asked to do this ; and if the doctrine contended for here is to prevail, the statute of common bail is a nullity. \u00ab,</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-14\">Lilly\u2019s Entries, 221 to 292, present a series of precedents in which errors are assigned in the intermediate proceedings in the cause. Many of these are in mere matter of form, but notwithstanding taken for granted to be error unless amended. The want of a warrant of attorney, or the appointment of a guardian, no venire, no original and the like, are treated as fatal errors, unless amended below and shown to be perfect by a return to the certiorari.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-15\">Error will lie upon a judgment by default. <em>Salkield </em>v. <em>The Ld. William Howard,</em><footnotemark><em>(q)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is an express authority, and in Serjeant Williams\u2019 note to <em>William </em>v. <em>Gwyn,</em><footnotemark><em>(r)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is said that error will lie by the heir upon a judgment in a real action. In <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Blunt,</em><footnotemark><em>(s)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is decided that after a judgment upon demurrer, there could be no motion in arrest, but agreed that it would be otherwise after a judgment by default. In <em>Creswell </em>v. <em>Packham, </em><footnotemark>(t)</footnotemark> judgment was given silently, and without argument, upon demurrer, and the Court say that a motion in arrest cannot be heard, but they agreed that error would lie.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-16\">The cases showing what errors are fatal after a judgment by default or upon verdict, are cited in <em>2 </em>Dunl. Pr. 705. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Lilly, 221, assigns for error that the original was <em>clausum fregit. </em>The judgment was not reversed because the error was not amendable, but because it was not in. fact amended. The same, 234, assigns for error, that an original and <em>capias </em>issued before the cause of action accrued. This shows that error may be assigned in the mesne process as well as in the original. The same author, 236, gives an assignment of errors that there is no writ of inquiry, in opposition to the case cited on .the 'other side from H. Black stone and Fitz-Gibbon. Error was assigned that the defendant was in the Fleet, and no declaration, served upon him.<footnotemark>(u)</footnotemark> To serve the declaration personally, in that case, was a statute duty in <em>England,</em><footnotemark><em>(v)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as filing common bail was here. In this as in that case, the defendant is not in Court, except for the purpose of a particular mode of proceeding ; and the party must keep within the terms of the statute. Error was assigned in the admission of a <em>prochein amy; </em><footnotemark>(w)</footnotemark> and in <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Smith,</em><footnotemark><em>(x)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>error was assigned for want of almost all the intermediate proceedings, which were amended and certified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-5\">All the arguments <em>ad captandum </em>suchas that we should have stood upon our guard, and watched and amended, fail before these authorities. We were not thus bound to play the guardian for the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. What are lawyers\u2019 forms aqd precedents for ? What but to preserve the boundaries and barriers by which legal proceedings are to be kept regular ? And is not the party to see at his peril, that his proceedings are regular ? Suppose a lawyer files a judgment roll without any previous or intermediate proceedings : it is said by gentlemen that we cannot go beyond the record itself. In such a case the clerk on error returns a regular record ; and if we are thus confined, no judgment can be reversed. An opportunity to set it aside has perhaps gone by in the Court below. A notice of the motion may not have been signed ; or the party may have delayed his application, for some cause which the Court below, in the exercise of its discretion, may not think sufficient to excuse the delay; must the party sit quietly down and submit to the sacrifice of his whole estate, perhaps from a mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>slip of the pen ? Suppose a <em>ca. sa. </em>had been the first proceeding in this case. We might as well be asked, \u201c why did you not appear and defend the action <em>V </em>in that case as in the present one. The <em>capias </em>was void and we were not bound to notice it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-9\">Has the constitution altered the settled order o\u00ed things which we have been considering <em>1 </em>Is so important a change to be introduced by mere implication <em>1 </em>If so, would not a substitute have been provided ? We had early adopted the English statute of <em>amendments </em>and jeofails, which presuppose that writs of error will lie upon judgments by default on grounds which the statute professes to cure. After the adoption of that statute, in <em>Price </em>v. <em>M\u2019Evers,</em><footnotemark><em>(y)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>error was brought to this Court upon a judgment by default against the defendant in the Supreme Court, <em>[this very case) </em>upon a mere miscast of sixpence in the <em>in toto attingens ; </em>and the writ was holden to lie; though the record was amended upon the defendant in error paying all the costs. Here, though the party may be permitted to amend the formal errors, the Court cannot allow an amendment of the errors in substance; the prematurity of the. suit, and the mis-assessment of the damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-10\">This is not a proper occasion on which to make the objection that error will not lie upon a judgment by default. It should come upon motion to quash the writ of error. It is remarkable, that at a previous term a motion for such an order was made and refused, in this very cause, as I have been informed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-11\">\n<em>Viele.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAsf\">With permission, I must correct the gentleman in his statement as to the result of that motion. It is true, that such a motion was made; but it was not passed upon, because the late Chancellor was absent. It was merely suggested by an honorable member of the Court, that the cases upon the authority of which the motion was made, did not apply to this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-12\">\n<em>Hopkins.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7d\">Surely the suggestion was.correct. Those</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqBq\">cases do not apply to errors which the opposite party himself has committed; but merely to cases where the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>is put at issue, and the party makes default at the hearing.<footnotemark>(z)</footnotemark> They have been cited on this occasion; and are either defaults in arguing demurrers, or at a hearing in the Court of Chancery when the cause is called upon the calendar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-5\">That it is fatal on error, if it appear by the record that the cause of action arose after the commencement of the suit, the Court are referred to <em>Cheetham </em>v. <em>Lewis,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> Venables </em>v.

The writ of certiorari issued, in order to bring into this Court all the proceedings not stated in the record, required any affidavits used on a motion to set aside the default, and any rules or orders actually made by the Supreme Court thereon ; but no such affidavit, rule, or order, is returned. The plaintiff in error, having made no application whatever <em>to the </em>Supreme Court, for any redress, now asks this Court to reverse the judgment thus entered against him. The Judges of that Court not having, in fact, decided any question in the cause, have not given reasons upon this occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">If a defendant, making no defence in the Supreme Court, suffering a judgment to be entered against him by default, and making no application to that Court for any redress, might come before this Court and ask the same redress which that Court might have afforded, this Court would become, in effect, a Court of original jurisdiction, and would be employed in deciding questions which the Supreme Court had never determined. Such a course of proceeding would be inconsistent with the constitution, and pregnant with great mischiefs. The jurisdiction of this Court is merely appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>late. It is a jurisdiction to re-examine and re-judge ; to cor rect erroneous decisions actually made; to affirm, reverse, or alter determinations made by Judges, who may give, and are bound to give reasons for their determinations. It is not a jurisdiction to determine, in the first, instance, causes or questions which have not been submitted to the decision of other Courts. This separation of jurisdictions it is our duty to maintain. He who comes here to complain of errors must show not merely the formal proceedings which in a general course of practice may take place, without the knowledge of the Judges, and without any direction from the Court, in file particular cause, but he must also show some judgment or some decision, upon a question actually presented to vthe Judges for their determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>The casi stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-16\">Jurisdiction of this court is</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Writ of error upon a judgment by default dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">In this case, the plaintiff in error, not having submitted to the Supreme Court any of the objections which he now urges here, and not having made the least effort to obtain the decision of that Court, upon any one of those objections, he is not entitled to be heard in this Court. The proper disposition of such a case is, I conceive, not to affirm or reverse the proceedings, but to dismiss the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">Bowker, Bowne, Bronson, Cramer, Dudley, Bar'Ll, Greenly, Hunter, Porter, Thorn and Wheeler, Senators, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">Sudam, Senator. This cause comes before the Court on a writ of error to the Supreme Court, and all the supposed errors assigned by the plaintiff\u2019, (except the 5 th,) are those existing in the interlocutory procee lings in the Court below, and do not appear in the record. These proceedings (the <em>\u2022'apiqs, </em>declaration, &amp;c.) have been brought into this Court, by a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>and three questions are presented for its consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-14\">1. Whether this Court on a writ of error will take cognizance of mere irregularities in the Court below, which might be corrected there.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-15\">2. Whether this Court will sustain a writ of error to the Supreme Court, when the judgment in that Court has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>permitted to be taken by default, the error assigned appearing on the face of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">3. When the assessment of damages by a Clerk of the Supreme Court, on a declaration containing a count on a promissory note, and <em>the money counts, </em>is authorized by our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">I am satisfied that this Court ought not to take notice of mere <em>formal defects </em>in the proceedings of the Supreme Court. <em>(Cheetham </em>v. <em>Tillotson, </em>4 John. Rep. 499.) It is for that Court to redress injuries which may result from a violation of its rules or practice, and it could not be tolerated that judgments in that Court should be reversed here, for mere mistakes in form, and in no wise affecting the merits of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">This court will not notice mere formal defects, arising from rules of practice in the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\"><em>2. </em>The second question\u2014whether the Court will sustain a' writ of error in the Supreme Court, on a judgment by default in that Court, deserves to be seriously considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">Whether error lies upon a judgment by default.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">This point is presented by the counsel for the defendant in error, as a preliminary objection, and they contend that the writ of error <em>ought to be quashed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-16\">Is made a preliminary objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">In support of their position the counsel cited the case of <em>Gelston &amp; Schenk </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>(13 John. 561.) In that cause the plaintiff below had demurred to two of the special pleas put in by the defendants, who joined in the demurrer, but <em>declined </em>arguing the demurrer before the Supreme Court, when the cause was called on, and permitted a judgment on the demurrer by default. That case differs essentially from the one now under consideration. The party had made his defence. He was in a situation to have taken the judgment of the Supreme Court upon the very question which he attempted to discuss in this Court, and he was very properly told it was an established rule, that a point waived by him in the Court below could not be open to discussion in this Court. He had himself abandoned that ground, and by this means misled his adversary, and deprived him of rights which the Supreme Court could have afforded him, had the demurrer been overruled. It was a <em>voluntary abandonment of a point </em>on which it was in his power to have taken the judgment of the Supreme Court, and if not satisfied, then to call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>for the opinion of this Court. So, also, in the case of <em>Sands </em>v. Hildreth, (12 John. Rep. 493.) There the cause had been regularly set down for a hearing on bill and answer, and upon notice to the party, -the appellant did not appear, but suffered a decree to pass against him by default. This Court dismissed the appeal, because he had voluntarily permitted a decree to pass against him, when he might have taken the judgment of the Chancellor on the merits of his cause. If he had taken his opinion, it might have been uni-necessary to resort to this Court. Not having done this, he was presumed to have acquiesced in the justice of the judgment pronounced by the Chancellor, and this Court would not aid him in a course of litigation which he had once concluded to abandon.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-17\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Cases cited to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>A party who, on hearing, or notice, voluntarily withdraws himself from the deliberate judgment of the court, should not be heard on appeal or error.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">Preliminary questions of this kind are always addressed to the sound discretion of the Court, guided by principles which have heretofore, and ought in future to govern Courts of appellate jurisdiction; and I fully subscribe to the doctrine, that a party who has placed his cause in a situation to receive the deliberate judgment of the Supreme Court or Court of Chancery, aftd who, upon a hearing, on notice, voluntarily withdraws himself from the deliberate judgment of the Court below, and permits his adversary to recover by his default, is, and ought to be precluded from agitating the same points in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">But this is not the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">But -the case of the plaintiff in error is not within the rule laid down in the cases cited, nor is it within that established in the case of <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Cuyler, </em>(17 John. 469.) The plaintiff in -error was prosecuted in the Supreme Court, and he did .not appear to the writ. He permitted the plaintiff below to perfect his judgment, and he now says that there is error in that record. I cannot subscribe to.the doctrine, that to. enable a party to maintain his writ of error, (which is a writ of right,) it is necessary that he should <em>appear </em>and <em>liti gate </em>the suit in the Court below. He <em>may rest </em>on the honesty and integrity of the plaintiff, and presume -that he will not enter a judgment for a greater sum than is justly due. But he may find himself egregiously deceived. A judgment may have been entered against him for $10,600, when only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>$100 was due. And shall it he said that,, in such a case, he cannot take advantage of the errors of his adversary, to reverse an unjust recovery ? This may he stating an extreme case, but a moment\u2019s reflection will suggest a variety of cases in which the greatest injustice might be effected, and the injured party without a remedy, unless his writ of \"error is secure to him. <em>If </em>he appears in the suit below, he then takes into his own hands the estimate of his rights. If he <em>waives </em>them, it is his own act, and he ought to be concluded. But if he trusts to the plaintiff, if he does not place any obstacles in his way to a speedy recovery, and he afterwards finds that the plaintiff himself has so conducted the suit, that in judgment of law his proceedings are erroneous, he is, in my opinion, entitled to the judgment of this Court upon the <em>record.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Upon the face of all our records the judgment recorded is that of the <em>Court: </em>and I can see no constitutional objection to sustaining this writ of error. A judgment by default is as much the judgment of the Court, as that on a verdict, or after argument on a case made. The words of the constitution are, (Art, 5, s. 1,) \u201c And when a writ of error shall he brought on a judgment of the Supreme Court, the justices of that Court shall assign <em>the reasons for their judgment.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">A judgment by default is as much a judgment of the court as if rendered on a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Where is the difficulty in the Justices of the Supreme Court assigning the reasons of their judgment ? In the case of <em>Gelston </em>v. Hoyt, before cited, Chief Justice Spencer assigns, as \"the reason for the judgment, that \u201c when the cause was called, (meaning the issue joined on the demurrer,) the defendant\u2019s counsel appeared and declined to argue. Whereupon judgment was given for the plaintiff, on the defendant\u2019s counsel declining the argument.\u201d Upon these reasons, assigned by the Chief Justice, it appeared the plaintiffs in error had waived, in the Court below, that part of their defence which was embraced by the demurrer, and this Court justly held them to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">And the su preme court may assign reasons for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In the case now before the Court, on the 5th error assigned, (which is the only one appearing on the face of the record) there could be no difficulty in assigning the reason why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the Court referred the matter to their Clerk, to assess the \u00bf|amages_ in tile act (1 R. L. 134, s. 7) organizing this Court, and regulating the course of its proceedings, it is dedared that this Court shall <em>\u201c </em>examine all such errors as shall be assigned or <em>found in such </em>record, or in any process or proceedings concerning the same, and <em>call upon </em>the Judges of the Supreme Court to assign the reasons of such judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Writ of orror not confintualiy argued courkSUpieme</p>\n<p id=\"Anq\">I cannot discover, either in the language of the consti'cution, or in the words of the statute, that the writ of error . can be supported in those .cases only which are <em>actually </em>argued before the Justices of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Cases of great hardship and injustice might arise, in which the party would be without a remedy, unless it be true that a writ of error to the Supreme Court can be maintained on a judgment or decision of that Court upon interlocutory proceedings, (such as motions to set aside judgments for irregularity, &amp;e.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">nothin general^ lie upon a dequestion0\u201d of practice, ar\u00f3mg upon amda/it inthesupreme court,</p>\n<p id=\"AGz\">^ ^ understand his honor the Chancellor, his opinion is, that such would be the proper course, and it may be supposed that he is supported by the judgment of this Court, in the case of <em>Clason </em>v. <em>Shotwell, </em>(12 John. Rep. 31.) \u2022 . . x iy I concur in the opinion of the Court on the <em>very point </em>necessarily decided in that cause. <em>It went far enough to reach that individual case, </em>which formed an exception to the general rule. But I must, dissent .from the reasoning which would seem to go beyond the case then under consideration. This Court has never, as yet, said that a writ of error can be brought upon the opinion of the Supreme Court on a case presented to them by affidavits, and arising out of the practice of that Court, and I trust \u25a0 they never will so pronounce the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Error was brought m this judgment by <em>Cheetham v. Tillotson, </em>5 John. 430.</p>\n<p id=\"A5d\">I am entirely supported in my opinion by the case of <em>Cheetham </em>v. <em>Tillotson, </em>(5 John. Rep. 430.) That ivas a writ of error on a judgment in a Supreme Court, .by <em>default </em>and <em>damages assessed on a writ of inquiry. </em>The <em>error alleged </em>was, that the <em>charges in the declaration were not libellous. </em>The learned counsel. <em>(Woodworth &amp; </em>Henry) who argued the cause, never raised a doubt as tp the jurisdic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>tion of this Court, though the excitement produced by that controversy was well calculated to elicit all technical objections to the writ of error. The <em>judgment </em>of the Supreme Court was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">From a review of all the authorities, I am satisfied that the established rule of this Court is, to deny to a suitor the right of litigating questions <em>here </em>which <em>he had placed in a situation to receive the judgment of the Court </em>belo-w, and which he had, <em>on the hearing there, voluntarily abandoned </em>; and that, with the exception of the case of <em>Clason </em>v. <em>\u00a1Shotwell, </em>this Court have never sanctioned a writ of error, to review the decisions of an inferior Court, pronounced on affidavits, and that this was a case <em>sui generis, </em>and ought not to <em>be extended beyond the precise point there decided ; </em>that the case now before the Court is within the authorities cited <em>; </em>and that the writ of error ought not to be quashed for the cause assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">Rule of this court as to denying appeals &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">This ease not within rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">When a judgment is taken by default, the party puts himself upon the <em>regular proceedings </em>of the plaintiff) and he never can be said to waive that to which he never assented, or in which he never was an actor. Nor can this Court exclude a case of palpable error, (when such a case shall be presented,) merely because the defendant below did not appear in the suit. It would in my opinion, violate the first principles of justice, as well as the words of the constitution, and the law by which this Court is organized.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">And why.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">3. This leads me to the consideration of the 5th point made by the plaintiff in error\u2014that the declaration containing a count upon a promissory note, and the money counts, the damages ought to have been assessed <em>by a jury, </em>and not by the <em>Clerk of the Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-16\">General assessment of damages upon note and money counts, not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The decision of this question does not depend upon the English authorities. By the 15th section of the \u201c act for the amendment of the law, and the better advancement of justice,\u201d (1 R. L. 522,) the Court is authorized, in certain cases, on a judgment by default, to refer it to their Clerk to assess the damages. By the 17th section, if the suit be on any bill of exchange, <em>promissory note, </em>&amp;c., truly set forth in \" the declaration, the execution of such bill or note, &amp;c.; need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>not \"be proven. By the 18th section the Clerk is author) zed to take proof and to <em>reduce the testimony of witnes ses wr^nff &gt; and, if required, to report the same to the Court. </em>Now it is a well settled principle that a promissory note may be given in evidence under the money counts. So may the Clerk assess damages on an <em>account stated. </em>The assessment of damages by the Clerk being authorized by law, disposes of this point; for we are to presume, (after judgment,) that the necessary proof was given to him, to justify his report. Upon the coming in of that report, the judgment entered upon it is the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Our statute enlarges the English rale o\u00ed reference to the Clerk, and embraces cases in which it would, in England, be necessary to execute a writ of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment of the Supreme Court ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">For dismissing For affirming,\u2019 8.</p>\n<p id=\"Aur\">ErWIN, LeFFERTS, Livingston, LyNDE, McInTYRE, Kedfield and Wooster, Senators, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">It was thereupon ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the writ of error brought in this cause be dismissed this Court, and that the plaintiff in error pay to the defendant m error his costs in defending the writ of error, to be taxed, and that the record be remitted, &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
