Otherwise, where the condition is for the payment of money only.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-10\">Debt, on the penalty of a bond for $3000, conditioned for the payment of $1500, and the performance of other acts; with a partial assignment of breaches. Plea, <em>non est factum, </em>with notice of set off, of accounts. The cause being referred, the referees reported a balance of only 13 dollars due to the plaintiff, who filed the report, and entered a rule for judgment, upon the penalty.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-11\">\n<em>J W. Wheeler,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqeA\">in behalf of the defendants, now moved for costs, to be set off against the plaintiff\u2019s recovery ; and that the judgment be corrected according to the statute, (1 R.L. 515, 516,s.l.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-12\"><em>H. B. Davis, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-Qh\">The plaintiff is entitled to judg ment for the penalty, as a security for further breaches. (1 R. L. 518, s. 7. <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Suffelt, 2 </em>John. Cas. 406. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>10 John. 219.) Had the sum been found by verdict, there would have been no doubt of this. Does finding the same sum, upon reference, alter the case ? Here is a discount, by set off, from $1500 to $13. The claim exceeded $400, within the statute, (L. N. Y. sess. 41, ch. 79, s. 1.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-13\"><em>Wheeler, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdP\">The plaintiff does not take his judg ment for the penalty, but for the balance found. (1 R. L 516.) The provisions referred to, in the 50 dollar act, relate to <em>accounts </em>not <em>bonds.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b412-14\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AKPS\">The plaintiff must take costs according to his judgment, which is for the penalty. <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Vancott, </em>13 John. 345.) It is peculiarly proper, in this case, that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>should be so, for the bond is conditioned, among other things, to perform covenants; and the judgment ought to stand as security for further breaches. It would have been otherwise, had it been merely for the payment of money. <em>(Van Antwerp </em>v. <em>Ingersoll, </em>2 Caines\u2019 Rep. 107. 1 R. L. 515, 516.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
