The action was brought to recover back money which had been rightfully received by the defendants, as trustees of a school district in the town of Louisville, in the county of St. Lawrence, under a resolution of the inhabitants of that district, imposing a tax on the plaintiff and others for the intended purpose of building a school house; but which resolution was after-wards rescinded and the purpose of building the school house was utterly abandoned, and no expense was incurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>und\u00e9r the resolution.

He relied upon the act, (sess. 43, ch. 132, s. 2,) passed 30th March, 1820, giving double costs to- trustees of school districts when they succeed in an action brought against <em>them, for, or concerning any matter or thing done by virtue of their </em>office..</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-5\"><em>J.

Here was an act done by the defendants in virtue of their office. The money was received and withheld by them as trustees. In assumpsit against a Sheriff, for money received by him as an officer, I believe the Court have allowed him double costs on a nonsuit or-verdict passing in his favor.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b528-7\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AdFA\">The case of <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Bramble, </em>(3 M. &amp; S. 131,) is in point, arid contairls the true distinction. In construing this and thelike statutes, allowing double cost's, -there is a distinction in reason, as well as authority, between acts of <em>misfeasance, </em>and those merely of <em>nonfeasance. </em>The latter is often a mere omission to fulfil a contract; which does riot' call for the protection of the statute;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
