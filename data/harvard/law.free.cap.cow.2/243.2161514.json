Stephens, </em>for the respondent, moved to set aside a default for not answering the petition of appeal in this cause; and for a rule requiring the Register of the Court of Chancery to send hack to this Court all the papers, rales, orders and decrees, relating to the appeal, which were remitted by this Court on obtaining the default; and that the respondent have leave to proceed in the cause, as if no default had been entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-18\">The default (as appeared by the affidavits) had been taken under the following circumstances: The respondent (being then and still insolvent) obtained a judgment at law against the appellants, in the Common Pleas of Washington county. The appellants filed their bill, in the Court of Chancery, for relief against the judgment, and obtained an injunction against proceeding thereon, which was afterwards, (Nov. 12,1822,) on the coming in of the answer, dissolved. On the 12th Dec. 1822, on a motion for a re-hearing, the order dissolving the injunction was confirmed. Dec. 18th, 1822, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the First Judge of Washington Common Pleas granted an order staying all further proceedings upon the judgment, on the part of the respondent, until the further order of that Court, upon paying the amount of the judgment into the hands of the Sheriff of that county, on the execution issued in the cause. Dec. 27th, 1822, the appellants appealed to this Court, from the order made upon the motion for a rehearing. Upon this state of the case, the counsel for the respondent, intending to move to quash the appeal, it was agreed between him and the counsel for the appellants, that the papers for that motion should be served when conve nient for the respondent\u2019s counsel, and that they- would have the motion disposed of before answering the petition of appeal. Notice of that motion was accordingly given, for the 3d Tuesday of Feb. 1828, but the motion was afterwards postponed, by agreement of counsel, for one week, and was then again postponed, by agreement, on request of the appellants\u2019 counsel, till it should be mutually convenient for both counsel to go to Albany, in order to attend to the motion. April 4th, 1823, the last day of the session of this Court, without giving any notice to the respondent, his solicitor or counsel, of his intention so to proceed, the counsel for the appellants moved for and obtained an order of this Court, reversing the order of the Chancellor dissolving the injunction, for want of an answer to the petition of appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-7\">On the 13th Jan. preceding, the usual order had been obtained, to answer the petition of appeal in eight days, &amp;c.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> which was, with a copy of the petition of appeal, served on the solicitor for the respondent, on the 25th of Jan. last. It was upon an affidavit of these facts, that the order for a default was taken. Since these proceedings, the money received upon the execution had been paid to the attorneys of the respondent, on their giving security to the Sheriff to refund the same in the event of his being made liable for it. None of the above stipulations or arrangements were reduced to writing between the counsel.
