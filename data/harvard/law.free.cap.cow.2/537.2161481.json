To show that a pauper was settled at Albany, by being entered and recognized as a pauper of that city, the almshouse books being (as insisted) burnt, parol proof of their contents was offered; <em>held, </em>that admitting the books to have been burnt, parol was not the next best evidence but the quarterly returns should be produced.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-8\">On certiorari from the general sessions of the peace of the v x county of Albany.

He also swore, that he was born upon Mills\u2019 Island, near the city.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-8\">N. Bassett,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6RR\">a constable of Niskayuna in 1812, swore, that during that year, on an order of removal, he conveyed the father from Niskayuna to the almshouse in Albany, where, as the witness was afterwards informed by the superintendent and others, he died.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-9\">Bassett\u2019s testimony was objected to as inadmissible, but received <em>de bene esse.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-10\">D.

This was since 1815.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-12\">Evidence was given of a declaration of Wendell, the superintendent of the almshouse in 1815, that there had been a fire there by which the records were burnt up; that Wendell is since dead.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-13\">George W. Welsh,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWm\">superintendent of the almshouse at the time of the hearing, produced a book, which he swore he received from the brother of Hewson, the late superintendent, (deceased,) and which purported to be a book of the almshouse, and to contain the names of paupers belonging to that establishment, from 1806 to 1814, inclusive, in which the name of Jacob Clute was not to be found; that there is no other general book in which the names of paupers are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Kept; that he makes a quarterly return to the Common Council containing the names of all the paupers remaining in the almshouse, aud opposite the name' of each pauper, is stated the age of the pauper, the time of admittance, death, &amp;c.; that he is informed it was customary for his predecessors to make these returns, as he now does; and the present corporation law requires this to be done. At the June term, 1823, the sessions affirmed the order.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-4\">The counsel for Niskayuna admitted that Clute, the pauper, was married about 30 years ago, at Gnilderland, (then Watervliet,) and had several children.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b539-5\"><em>J. V. N. Yates, </em>for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHR\">The father\u2019s service for two years, as an apprentice, in Albany, is established. Parol evidence was admissible tinder the circumstances of the case. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Root, </em>18 John. Rep. 60, 73. 1 Phil. Ev. 176, 178. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Long Buckby, 7 </em>East, 45. Burr. Set. Cas. 151. 1 Const, 490. 1 John. Cas. 488, per Spencer, C. J. 1 Caines\u2019 Cas. Err. 27. 10 John. Rep. 377. <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Baremore, </em>5 John. Ch. Rep. 550.) The lapse of time, the death of Goervey and of Jacob Clute, and the fire at the almshouse, have deprived us of any other proof than what we have given. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>(4 M. &amp; S. 48,) is in point. The father has removed to Albany, upon his evidence of having served an apprenticeship; the removal was acquiesced in, and became conclusive upon them. (3 Burns\u2019 J. 597, and the cases there cited.) The service would confer a settlement, though.not under an indenture. (Van Schaick\u2019s ed. of Colonial Laws, 752.) Service under defective indentures gains a settlement. <em>(Overseers of Hudson </em>v. <em>Overseers of Taghkanac, </em>13 John. Rep. 245.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-6\">But Albany recognized and supported the father as their pauper; and in this view, no matter how he came there. <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Wakefield, </em>5 East, 335. <em>Same </em>v. <em>Chadderton, </em>2 East, 27. <em>Same </em>v. <em>Chatham, </em>8 East, 498. <em>Fort Ann </em>v. <em>Kingsbury, </em>14 John. Rep. 367. <em>King </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>15 John. Rep. 281.) The order need not have been produced. It was not relied upon as binding in itself, but merely to show the character in which the pauper was received. Parol proof was competent for this purpose. (1 Phil. Ev. 218, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>219. <em>Livingston </em>v. Delafield, 1 John. Rep. 523. <em>King </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>15 John. Rep. 281. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Wakefield, </em>5 East, 335, 6.) But the order of removal was probably destroyed by the fire in the almshouse, which renders parol proof admissible. <em>(Jackson </em>v. Neely, 10 John. Rep. 374.) The declarations of the superintendent of the almshouse, were good evidence of the destruction. (Peak\u2019s Ev. 74. <em>Fairlie </em>v. <em>Hastings, </em>10 Ves. 127.) No objection was made for want of notice to produce the order. But the nature of the proceeding was a sufficient notice that the order would be required. <em>(Jolley </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>1 Campb. Rep. 143. <em>How et al. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>14 East, 274. <em>Bucher </em>v. <em>Jarratt, </em>3 B. &amp; P. 143.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-8\">Nor was it necessary to produce the quarterly returns. They were mere private papers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-9\">To make the settlement of the grandfather available, it should be shown that he was not only settled in Niskayuna, but that he was settled there at the time of his death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-10\">The son\u2019s settlement followed that of the father; His being. married 30 years ago, and emancipated doe's not vary the case, unless he acquired a settlement in his own right.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b540-11\"><em>J. E. Lovett, </em>for the defendant in error, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-12\">1. That the proof of the indentures and service as apprentice, was inadmissible. <em>(Case of The Inhabitants of Bilton, </em>1 East, 15. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Warley, </em>6 T. R. 534. 4 Com. Dig. Evidence, A. 3, 4. 3 Bl. Com. 368. 1 Phil. Ev. 167, 173, 347. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>10 John. Rep. 363. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Eriswell, </em>3 T. R. 708, per Grose, J. Burr. Sett. Cas. Case No. 94, 102, 104, 173, 203, 227, 262. 2 East, 28, per Ld. Kenyon, C. J. 4 Burn. J. 403. Ld. Raym. 1117.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-13\">2. Failing t\u00f3 show \u00e1 settlement by indenture and apprenticeship, it cannot be converted into a hiring and service, within the colonial law. (4 T. R. 770. 4 Burn, J. 418, 419, 752. Burr. Sett. Cas. No. 173, 203. 1 Bl. Com. 364. 4 Burn. J. 283.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-14\">3. There is no legal proof that the father was removed to Albany by the order of removal. (Com. Dig. Evidence, A. 4, and most of the authorities cited to the first point. 1 Phil. Ev. 338.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>4. If the father was entertained as'a pauper of Albany, itcbminunicated no settlement to the sdtij who was- several years before emancipated1 (5 T. R. 586. 3 T. R. 356. 4 Burn, J. 232. 1 Bl. Com. 363, note.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-3\">5. If the almshouse' books Were destroyed, evidence should have been given from the quarterly returns. (2 Caines\u2019 Rep. 106. 6 T. R. 247. Burr. Sett. Cas. No. 93, 197, 251. 1 East, 527. 5 T. R. 670.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b541-4\"><em>Curia, </em>per Savage, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avac\">The question-is,- where was the last legal settlement of-Gerdt Glute, the pauper ?</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">It is admitted-that his grandfather-was settled in Niskayuna.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">I-t does not appear- from the-return, that the pauper ever gained a settlement in his Wn right, any where.\"- We-must then look back and inquire, where was the settlement of his father ? If we admit the parol evidence which was received\u2018by the sessions,\" it appears that Jacob-Glute, father of the pauper, was born upon Mill\u2019s Island. In what town this island was situate, at that time,- does not appear; nor is it, at present, material. The place of the birth is,\" <em>prima facie, </em>evidence\" Of the place of settlement. It remains- so, till the settlement \"of the father is ascertained, and then the settlement of the child is the\" same as that of the father: <em>(Delavergne v. </em>N<em>oxon, </em>14 John. Rep. 334. <em>O. of Vernon v. O. of Smithfield, </em>17 id. 91.) The father of Jacob Glute was settled in Niskayuna : and the birth of the\u2019latter upon Mills\u2019 Island did not give him a different settlement This circumstance, then, does not relieve Niskayuna.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">It is next contended that he served an apprenticeship for more than two years in Albany. To gain a settlement in this manner, he must have been bound an apprentice or servant <em>by indenture, or by deed, contract or writing not indented ; </em>and in consequence of such binding, have served a term not less than two years. (1 R. L. 279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The testimony does not show that Jacob was bound in either of these ways. There is no evidence, that any written instrument ever existed, binding him to Goervey. For aught that appears, the binding may have been by parol, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>which case no settlement would be gained. <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Inh. of </em>Abingdon, Burr. Sett. Cas. 292.) The evidence admitted by the sessions was certainly too loose; but in the view which I have taken of the case, it is not necessary to particularize. . Jacob Clute had a settlement in Niskayuna, because his father had. He did not acquire a different settlement by birth, or by apprenticeship.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">It is contended, however, that he was acknowledged as a pauper of Albany, in 1812; that he was received on an order of removal from Niskayuna, and supported in the almshouse, till 1815, when he died there. These facts are proved by parol, but the books produced disprove them; and the appellants have not brought forward the best evidence in their power. They might have produced the quarterly returns of the superintendent, if they supposed that any of the books were destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">They omitted to. give notice to produce the order of removal, and were, therefore, not entitled to give parol proof of its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq2V\">But even if there were no objection to the competency of the evidence, the facts proved by Niskayuna would not make out a settlement of Gerrit Clute in Albany, by showing that his father had one there in 1812. The pauper is now about 50 years of age ; in 1812, he must have been 39. He had been long before emancipated, and his settlement did not follow that of the father, though the latter may afterwards have gained one in Albany.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the order of the sessions be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">Judgment of affirmance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
