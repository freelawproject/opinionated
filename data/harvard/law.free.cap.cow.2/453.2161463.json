He produced an original rule in this cause, of the last October term, as follows: \u201c On motion on the part of the defendant in this cause, for judgment as in case of nonsuit, and after hearing counsel for both parties, ordered that the same be denied with costs\u201d\u2014a taxed bill of costs; and an affidavit of E. W. that on the 11th Feb. 1824, he delivered to the defendant copies of the rule and taxed till, and at the same time showed him the original, and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>manded the costs, which he neglected to pay. The demand was made pursuant to a power of attorney, (signed by the defendant\u2019s attorneys,) in these words: \u201cWe hereby authorize and empower E. W. to demand and receive the amount of the foregoing bill of costs of ten dollars and fifty one cents of A. P. Mr. P.\u2019s payment of said sum to E. W. will be in full discharge of said costs. Feb. 9, 1824.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-4\">S. <em>Sherwood, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmR\">relied on what was said by the Court in <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>(3 Caines\u2019 Rep. 95,) <em>\u201c </em>that, in all cases, the period within which costs are to be paid is 20 days.\u201d These have not expired since the demand; and the motion for the attachment is premature.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-5\"><em>Sudam, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG2\">The rule as laid down in that case is too broad. It applies only to the plaintiff where he is allowed to stipulate, after a default in not bringing on his cause to trial at the Circuit, on payment of costs. (Reg. Gen. October term, 1802. <em>Witmore </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>3 Caines\u2019 Rep. 135.) In all other cases the costs must be paid <em>instanter.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b454-6\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Afx3\">The defendant is mistaken in supposing he had *20 days after the demand within which to pay these costs. The rule upon which he relies does not apply to this case. It is confined to costs which are due from the plaintiff where he is allowed to stipulate to go to trial on payment of costs, upon the defendant\u2019s moving for judgment as in case of non-suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Rul\u00e9 granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
