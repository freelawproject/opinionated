A. Spencer,, moved to set aside a writ <em>o\u00ed certiorari </em>to a Justice\u2019s Court. The affidavit, on which the <em>certiorari </em>was founded, detailed the facts so as to exhibit the errors relied upon, but omitted to state the verdict or judgment. The <em>jurat </em>was dated August 9th, 1823, and on the 4th November thereafter the defendant below made another affidavit stating the verdict and judgment, and the <em>certiorari </em>was laid before the Hon. N. Williams, Circuit Judge, and allowed on that day. Judgment was, ip fact, rendered July 11, 1823.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-18\"><em>Spencer </em>made two points : 1. That the affidavit showing the verdict apd judgment, thpugh pf the substance pf the affidavit on which the <em>certiorari </em>was allowed, was not made within 30 days; and 2. That the affidavit was not laid before the Circuit Judge within 90 days after the judgment. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>cited <em>Dickson </em>v. <em>Selye, </em>(6 John. Rep. 326,) and <em>Clark </em>v. Lawrence, (1 Cow\u00e9n, 48,) and 1 R. L. 396.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-3\"><em>J. Platt, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abb\">said, the verdict and judgment are not a material part of the proceedings. The 17th section of the act, (1 R. L. 396,) provides, that the party applying for the <em>certiorari </em>shall, within 30 days after the judgment, make affidavit, satisfying the officer who allows the writ, that there is reasonable cause for granting it, for error in the judgment, which shall be specified in the affidavit; and within 90 days thereafter cause the affidavit to be presented to the officer. Whete the affidavit discloses material, errors in the pleadings or proofs, the legislature never could have intended that the mere formal statement of the verdict or judgment should be essential. There is no use in such a statement. The very applic\u00e1tion for a <em>certiorari </em>is ah averment that there is a judgment of some sort. If at all material'the 6th of Johnson\u2019s Reports, cited oh the other side, presents a class of cases, in which the present is included, allowing a supplemental affidavit, to supply the defect; after th\u00e9 thirty days; The 90 days are to be computed from the time of taking the affidavit\u2014not the rendition of the judgment.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b441-4\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AOP\">We are clearly with you that the affidavit was presented to the Judge in proper Season; The only question is, whether the supplemental affidavit Was admissible.</p>\n<author id=\"b441-5\"><em>Spencer, </em>in reply.</author>\n<p id=\"APtH\">By the statute, the officer allowing the <em>Certiorari </em>is to be satisfied byaffidavit showing for cause that there is <em>error i\u00f1 the judgment. </em>These are the v\u00e9ry terms of the statute; The affidavit must necessarily show \u00e1 judgment, before it can point out th\u00e9 errors which it contains. The judgment is a part of the merits on which the writ is fo\u00fcnd\u00e9d: <em>Dickson </em>v. <em>Selye </em>settles this question; The Cohrt 'say, in that cas\u00e9, that every thing relating to the merits must be stated in the \u00e1ffid\u00e1vit which is made within the 30 days.</p>\n<author id=\"b441-6\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AaG\">The only question is, whether the Judge was warranted ill receiving th\u00e9 supplemental affidavit. We think the mere omission to state the judgment might be supplied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>by an affidavit made after the 30 days. There was no error complained of in the judgment itself. The party stated all which he relied upon for error within the 30 days, which was a substantial compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
