The action in the Court below, was brought by Newman against Van Antwerp. The declaration contained two counts. The first count averred, that Newman was owner and proprietor of divers goods and chattels, (enumerating them,) of the value of, &amp;c., which had been let to hire to one Husted, for a certain term, and were in Husted\u2019s possession, as lessee thereof; but that the defendant, knowing the premises, and intending to injure Newman in his. reversionary interest. While the same goods were in possession of Husted, and before his term had expired, seized and took the goods from and out of the possession of Husted, and converted and absolutely sold and disposed of the goods to the defendant\u2019s own use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-6\">The second count was trover for the same articles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-7\">Plea, the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-8\">On the trial, the facts set forth in the first count were proved. The.sale was made and the action commenced during the term, for which the goods were out upon lease. The sale was of the goods as the absolute property of Hus-ted, and was made by the defendant as Sheriff of Albany, in virtue of a <em>fi.fa. </em>against Husted; without particularizing his special property as the subject of sale. Notice of Newman\u2019s interest was given to the Sheriff at the time of the sale. The defendant below moved for a'nonsuit, which was denied, and the Court charged the jury in favor of the plaintiff, who found accordingly. The defendant excepted to this decision and charge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-15\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5x\">The first question which presents itself-is, whether the lessee obgoods .and chattels fon a term, has an interestwhich is the; subject of -.a sale on execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">It .is. well settled in the. .English courts, that the, lessee\u2019s Interest in goods maybe sold,. <em>(Gordon </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>7 T. R. 11, <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Macauley, </em>4 id. 489, <em>Manning's case, </em>8 Co. 191,) and the purchaser,is entitled to, the beneficial use-of them during the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">The-next question is, whether,the Sheriff by a sale absolute; in,its terms, on an execution against the lessee, cap, di vest the lessor of his. interest ?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">It is contended on the; part \u00a1of the. defendant in .error, that the.purchaser at the Sheriff \u2019s.sale acquires..a, complete title, and will hold-the. chattels .thus purchased, against the.lessor, or .general owner-; and severalau.thqrities.are,cited, to .support. that position. The cases cited, decide,-that; when goods of-a defendant are- sold, on execution,, and,\u00bb afterwards, the. judgment is reversed;.though the.\" judgment i\u2018s, that,the. defendant shall-be restored .to.-all he.hath lost, &amp;.c,, yet in such case the purchaser shall hold the property, because .the Sheriff, at the time of the sale, had lawful authority to sell, and,-therefore, the defendant shall not be restored-to-the possession of the goods themselves, but shall receive the, value of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">In a note to <em>Matthew Manning's case, </em>(8 Co. 191,) there is a case <em>(Amner v. </em>Loddington) in-pain).; Pinpoint held a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>tease fdr99years, df e\u00e9'rtain hd\u00fcs'\u00e9sin London. Byhiswill he d\u00e9vised'the\u00fci to his Wife for\u2019her life, fed after her'death, to her children unpfeferr\u00e9d. After his death, his Wife married Full\u00e9shurst; atid on \u00e1n exec\u00fct\u00edd\u00f1 against Fullesh\u00fcrst, the Sheriffs solddhe term -(By Wh\u00ed\u00dch I understand the lease for'99 years):tb\u2019Ltiddingtdn. Afterwards, the '.judgment oil Which the execution had issued,'and By'virtue ofwhi'ch the sale Was made, Was reversed, and the Wife of Fullesh'ttrst died. After her death, her daughter unprdf\u00e9rr\u00e9d, Alic'e F\u00fcllesh\u00fcrst, etiter\u00e9d an\u00f1:m\u00e1de a lease <em>to'the </em>plaintiff, Amrier. After several aigtitiients infhe Cothmdti Pleds, three several points were adjudged: 1. That the executory \u2018devise Wa's good ; -2. That it could \u00f1\u00f3t'be destroyed By'a sale, either By the Wife or By the Sheriffs; and S. That the sale by the Sheriffs shtiuld stand, \u00f1otwithstahdi\u00f1g'the reversal, arid the plaintiff in error should be restored to the value; for the Sheriffs, who mad\u00e9th\u00e9 sale, h\u00e1cl lawful B\u00fcthbrityfd sell, and by the sale,'th\u00e9 V\u00e9ndee'hadanabsdl\u00fcf\u00e9 property in the \"term <em>during the life of ike Wife ; </em>arid jridgriierit was given for the plaintiff, Which wits afterwards affii'nled, dri a Writ df error, in the King\u2019s Bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">So in the case titid\u00e9r consideration, the interest of the lessor cannot Be destroyed in Virtue of a sate either By H\u00fast\u00e9d \u25a0or the Sheriff. The purchaser from one 'dr the other, -possesses th\u00e9 Merest df Hristed till the \u2018expiration of the lease, and then the property reverts to the Original owner. A'contrary doctrine would\u2018give the Sheriff power, By virtue of an execution against one mail, to take the goods arid chattels of another, arid By a sale, to diVest the dw'rie'r rif Ms title.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">That the correct doctrin\u00e9 is laid down in this n\u00f3te to <em>Manning\u2019s case, </em>we have the authority of Lord Mansfield, in <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Chitty </em>and Blackiston, (1 Burr. 34,) where he says, (speaking of <em>Manning\u2019s case </em>among others,) \u201c None of these cases authorize the Sheriff to sell the goods of a third person; and it is admitted the vendee is not protected here, because at the time of the sale, the Sheriff had no authority to sell.\u201d So in the case under consideration, the Sheriff had no authority to sell any thing but the goods of Husted. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>vendee is protected in his purchase as between the parties to the judgment, but not when the interests of third persons are concerned. So President Pendleton, in <em>Burnley </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>(1 Wash. Rep. 313,) commenting on <em>Manning\u2019s case, </em>asks, \u201c But if an execution issue against the goods of A, and the Sheriff seize and sell the property of B, will it be said that this is done by lawful authority <em>1 </em>surely not.\u201d In <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>(7 John. Rep. 536,) the Court say that no case admits a title in the purchaser, where the Sheriff acted without authority. In <em>Storm </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>(6 John. Rep. 44,) the decision in favor of the purchaser rests on the want of evidence of demand and refusal, or actual conversion, one of which was necessary, because he came lawfully into possession, that is, by color of law. That case is no authority for saying that the purchaser acquired a good title, but the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">My opinion, therefore, is, that the Sheriff had authority to sell the interest of Husted ; that it was not in bis power to divest Newman, the lessor, of his property in the goods ; nor has he done so. Newman, therefore, has no right of action against him. When the suit was commenced, Newman could not know that his goods would not be restored to him at the expiration of the lease. He was, therefore, premature in bringing his suit, unless an injury had been done to his reversionary interest. Had the Sheriff or any other person destroyed the goods, in that case, it would be apparent that they could not be restored, and' probably an action would lie at any time after the destruction of .them; but such is not this case. I am of opinion, that the judgment in the Court below should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
