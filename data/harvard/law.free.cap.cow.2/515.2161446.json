It was in case, for debauching the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, <em>per quod servitium amisit, </em>from the 18th day of August, 1822, being after the action commenced ; which was so laid through a clerical mistake of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. And the cause was carried-down for trial, tried, and a verdict found for the plaintiff, before the mistake was discovered by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The declaration stated, that at the time the injury was committed, the daughter was an indented servant to P. F. and was an infant under 21 years ; that she continued a servant till the 18th August, 1821, when in consequence of her pregnancy, the indentures were annulled, and she went to reside with the plaintiff, her mother, who was a widow, and while an infant still living with the plaintiff, viz. on the 24th Feb. 1822, was delivered of a male child, &amp;c., <em>per quod, </em>&amp;c., from the 18th August, 1822, <em>(as before.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">The cause was tried before Judge Nelson, at the last Otsego Circuit, upon its merits, but several objections were taken during the trial, to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover; and a motion was made for a nonsuit upon the ground (among others) that the declaration alleged the loss of service to have commenced after the commencement of the suit; but this point, with others, was reserved by the Judge for the opinion of this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-6\"><em>S. A. Foot, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANS\">moved to amend the declaration and <em>nisi prius </em>record, by striking out of this averment, 1822 and inserting 1821.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-7\"><em>Starkweather &amp; I. Seelye, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABk\">did not deny that an amendment should be granted, if clear that the party could not be injured by it; but the Court would guard against the possibility of this. (2 Vin. 304, and the cases there cited.) Here the time is material as to the damages. Had the plaintiff been confined to an estimate of damages from 1822, it would have been a matter of mere mathematical calcula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>tion. The defendant was surprised. He comes to defend upon one state of the pleadings, and evidence is received applicable to another and different state, embracing a larger amount in damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-7\">At any rate; the motion is premature. It is connected with one of the points res\u00e9rved at the trial, which is tb be brought before the Court on \u00bf c\u00e1se, and should be postponed till the argument is heard upon. the c\u00e1se. If the am\u00e9ndmen t is granted, the defendant should have leave to plead and go to trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-8\"><em>Fool, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALS\">This is \u00e1 mere clerical mistake, and stands in the way of discussion upon the case, arid for that very reason should be amended now. Suppose it may have misled the defendant, the Court will not allow him to lib by and trip up another, upon such a mistake. <em>(Henry </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>19 John. 49.) It appeared upbil the d\u00e9clar\u00e1tioti, and he should have demurred. But is a surprise a mere matter of presumption? None is shown. The Court will, at least, require the defendant to show th\u00e1t he was injured. Why should he have a new trial without first showing that he was prejudiced ?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AQp\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A3HD\">This mistake is, clearly, th\u00e9 subject of amendment. The defendant shows no prejudice from it; nor db we see how he could have been prejudiced by it. Though the exception was taken at the Circuit, the Judge was right in not allowing it. We order amendments in case's like this at any stage of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
