Hoffman,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ1\">moved in arrest of judgment, and the only question was upon the degree of certainty necessary in setting forth the bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-8\">He said the indictment should set forth an exact copy, or its purport, so that, on its face, it may appear to be susceptible of forgery. (1 Chit. C. L. 234. 3 id. 1040, and the cases there cited. 2 East, C. L. 975, 985, s. 53, 58, &amp;c. <em>People </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>3 John. Cas. 299. <em>The State </em>v. <em>Gustin, </em>2 South. Rep. 744.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-9\">Independent of authority, it is clear that the indictment should be so certain, as to inform the party what he is called upon to meet, to enable the jury to understand and apply the evidence; to warrant the Court in giving judgment ; and, in the event of an acquittal, to save to the party his plea of <em>auterfois acquit. </em>The generality and uncertainty of this indictment will do neither.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-10\">Neither the notice to produce the bond, nor the evidence that it was in the defendant\u2019s possession, was sufficient to dispense with its production.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-11\"><em>Talcott, </em>(Attorney General,) contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0U\">There can be no dispute about the general rules of certainty upon which indictments for forgery are to be framed. The only difficulty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>is in their application, in saying what the law considers uncertainty. If-the strictness contended for is to prevail, it will overthrow some of the best established principles on thjs subject. It is enough that the offence is brought within tire words, of the statute creating it, (3 Ch. C. L. 468,) which are, <em>bond,or writing .obligatory. </em>(1 R. L. 405.) Neither the time nor amount is essential to the crime. What is to become of the numerous cases where counterfeit bank notes are destroyed by the offender <em>1 </em>Is he to escape because they cannot be particularly described ? No. Neither the date nor time of payment, are holden material in that case. <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ross, 2 </em>Mass. Rep. 373.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-7\">The present case comes within the distinctions laid down in <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>(8 Mass. Rep. 107.) The instrument must be described, or a reason given in the indictment why the description is omitted. Judgment was arrested in that case because no' reason for the omission was given. In this case the cause appears upon the face of the indictment, .and is sufficiently shown in evidence. <em>(Commonwealth. </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>3 Mass. Rep. 85.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-8\"><em>Hoffman, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APD\">said-that in <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>the indictment was much more certain than this. Yet the Court arrested the judgment, because it was not certain enough. What is there.said about less certainty being admissible, if the indictment show an excuse for it, was <em>obiter.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b524-9\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AiT\">The evidence of this crime was most clear ; and the only question is, whether the indictment is sufficiently certain to warrant us in giving judgment. The indictment excuses the <em>want </em>of a more particular description, ]by averring that the bond was. with the defendant. There is no doubt of the general rule, that the instrument forged, must be set. forth with particularity and certainty ; but to require this unqualifiedly, in all cases, without exception, would result in a failure of public justice. We think <em>The Commonwealth v. Houghton, </em>presents the true distinction. \u201c There are cases,\u201d says Judge Sedgwick,, \u201c which will form just and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>necessary exceptions to this rule ; as where the instrument forged has been destroyed by the prisoner, or has remained in his possession,\u201d &amp;c. <em>\u201c </em>But,\u201d he continues, <em>\u201c </em>in every such .instance, that the exception may be admitted, it must appear in the indictment what is the cause of the non-descnption of the instrumentgiving the present case precisely.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The general proposition, so often repeated in the books, that the instrument must be produced in evidence, is no more than the rule on the civil side, that the best evidence the nature of the case admits must be produced. Thb rule always yields, where the instrument is either lost, destroyed, or, as here, in the hands of the opposite party. This exception underwent full consideration in <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>(3 Mass. Rep. 82,) and the Judges were unanimous in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The evidence that the bond continued in the defendant\u2019s possession, was sufficient. He presented it to Sinclair, and after this we have nd account of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Motion denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Note, The pfisonbr was sentenced to the Auburn state prison for 7 years.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
