The plaintiff\u2019s proof, on the trial, was, that the note of $39 50, was given on a full settlement of accounts between the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-8\">The defendant proved a promissory note of $600, given by the plaintiff to him, dated Nov. 5th, 1816 ; that when this was given, the note of $200 was paid, and the plaintiff, not having it present, agreed to destroy it; but nothing was claimed to be due on the other note for $600, which was introduced merely as a part of the transaction, and to show a payment of the note of $200. Payment by the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>of $50, on a bond given <em>by </em>the plaintiff, to a third person, was also proved, but disallowed as a set off, because no request, by the plaintiff, to pay it was proved. The defendant then proved a set off of $24, for boarding the plaintiff and the jury found for the plaintiff for $50.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-8\">\n<em>Sudam.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEXe\">in behalf of the defendant, moved for costs, to be set off against the damages of the plaintiff. He cited 1 R. L. 387, Laws, N. Y. sess. 41, ch. 94, s. 1 &amp; 5. 1 R. L., 344, s. 5.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b414-9\"><em>Ruggles, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A49a\">moved to enter a suggestion on record, that the demands of the parties, proved at the trial, exceeded $400; and that costs be allowed the plaintiff. He said, the case comes within the 1st section of the $50 dollar act. The 1st section of the 25 dollar act denies jurisdiction to a Justice where the demands of the parties exceed $200; and the 5th section of the act concerning costs, (1 R. L. 344,) accordingly, gives the plaintiff costs in the Common Pleas, when the accounts between the parties exceed that sum, and the plaintiff\u2019s demand is reduced by payments or discounts to less than 25 dollars. The 1st section of the 50 dollar act, denies jurisdiction to the Justice) where the accounts of the parties exceed $400. Under the 5th section of the act concerning costs, the plaintiff was confined to the Common Pleas; but this is virtually repealed by the 5th section of the 50 dollar act. This section provides that if the plaintiff, in any Court of Record, recover less than 50 dollars, he shall not recover costs, if the suit might have been brought before a Justice. It may be contended, that the case is not within the 4th section of the act concerning costs. (1 R. L. 344.) But that never was intended of a case, which was not cognizable before a Justice; otherwise there would be instances, in which, though a Justice has no jurisdiction, the plaintiff can have no costs in any other Court. The statute should be so construed, as to avoid this absurdity. Wherever a justice has no jurisdiction, the Court will give costs, and by a corresponding rale of construction, will deny them when the Justice has jurisdiction. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>are rules, which this Court has frequently acted upon, in suits against attorneys, <em>(Varian </em>v. <em>Ogilvie, </em>3 John. Rep. 450. <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>6 id. 332. <em>Bailey's Case, 1 </em>John. Cas. 32. <em>Willot </em>v. <em>Star, </em>8 John. Rep. 123. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Sackrider, </em>7 id. 537. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Garnsey, </em>13 id. 465.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-4\">\n<em>Sudam,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayq\">in support of his own motion, and in reply to Mr. <em>Buggies. </em>The inquiry is, simply, whether a plaintiff, recovering 50 dollars only, in this Court, is entitled to his costs. No question can arise upon the <em>proviso </em>in the 1st section of the 25 or 50 dollar acts. The provisions of the two acts are <em>va. pari materia, </em>and no doubt, the latter must bear the same construction, as to costs, where $400 are involved, as the former, where $200 were in question. In each case, the Justice is without jurisdiction, but the plaintiff must go to the Common Pleas. Will the Court make a difference between the cases, by saying that the 5th section of the 50 dollar act impliedly repeals the 4th section of the statute of costs ? There is nothing like a repeal of the latter section, and in this Court, the plaintiff must still pay costs, according to its provisions. The 5th section of the 50 dollar act has contributed to vary the rule of costs in the Common Pleas only. Where the plaintiff, in that Court, now recovers more than 25, but less than 50 dollars, though he has no costs, neither does he pay costs to the defendant. Such I understand to have been the decision of this Court\u2014a decision, which presupposes the 5th section of the statute of costs in full force, and without interfering with the 4th section of that statute, gives the proper effect to the 5th section of the 50 dollar act. The phraseology, in the 5th section of both these statutes, shows, that the one in the. 50 dollar act was passed in reference to the one in the statute of costs. In the latter, it is, that the plaintiff shall not recover any costs, but shall pay costs. In the former, he shall not recover any costs; but it does not compel him to pay any. Thus all these provisions stand together, each having a different effect, according to the several objects for which they were passed. The plaintiff seeks costs upon a constructive right to them, but his title cannot be allowed on this ground. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>must show an express provision. Statutes giving costs are penal, and cannot be extended by construction. (Bac. Ab Statute, (I.) p. 390. 2 Dunl. Pr. 710.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b416-6\"><em>Ruggles, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALm\">The distinction, which would confine the plaintiff to the Court of Common Pleas, in order to avoid paying costs, is not well founded. The 5th section of the 50 dollar act provides for the cases excepted in the 5th section of the statute of costs, and evidently means to give the plaintiff costs, when he recovers any thing in a Court of Record; provided, the action could not have been brought in a Justice\u2019s Court. It contains a provision, in this respect, inconsistent with the 4th section of the statute of costs, and so far is a repeal of that section. Thus taken out of the operation of the 4th section, the case comes within the first section of the same statute which gives costs to the plaintiff, whenever he recovers any thing.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b416-7\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A1l\">On looking into the case, we find it unnecessary to determine,' whether, within the several statutory provisions, examined on the argument, the plaintiff would have been entitled to costs, had his claim been reduced to 50 dollars, by reason of payment, discount or set off. The 600 dollar note was not produced by way of set off, and the $200 note was merged in the one of $600, which was admitted to have been settled and paid; so that, in truth, the recovery was a balance, upon the notes of $39 50 and $28, which the plaintiff recovered, after deducting the set off of $24 dollars for board. The three last claims, alone, were in question upon the trial. The only ground on which it was contended, that a Justice wanted jurisdiction, was, that the demands of both parties exceeded $400. This is answered by its turning out, that the two large notes were not subsisting demands, and constituted no part of the amount between the parties. This brings the amount in controversy, below 100 dollars. The account intended by the statute must be subsisting, unliquidated accounts. So far as they have been settled, and a balance struck upon them, that balance can alone be properly considered the account between the parties. The case is clearly with \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>in the 4th section of the statute concerning costs. The plaintiff can take nothing by his motion, which is denied with costs; and the motion, in behalf of the defendant, is granted with costs. e</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
