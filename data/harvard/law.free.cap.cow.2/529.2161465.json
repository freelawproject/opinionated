Ruggles </em>and <em>A. </em>Spencer, for the motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-7\"><em>A. Burr, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b529-8\">At another day, <em>A. Spencer' </em>proposed to procure and read counter affidavits to support the credibility of the witness impeached, and show that the others were real persons. He said the affidavits upon the other side were a surprise upon him at the argument, and he was not then prepared with authority to show that counter affidavits were admissible. Since that time he had examined <em>Pomroy </em>v. <em>The Columbian Insurance Company, </em>(2 Caines\u2019 Rep. 260,) which established the admissibility of the affidavits to impeach the credibility of the witnesses, and he found by a note at the end of that case, that evidence is also admissible to sustain it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b529-9\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Akxv\">It is contrary to the uniform practice, to receive counter affidavits in support of a motion. This has never been done even in support of character ; and if their admissibility were matter of discretion, we think it would be an abuse of that discretion to hear them</p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
