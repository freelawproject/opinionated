The bail piece was filed the 29th of May, and on the 31st the plaintiff\u2019s attorney entered an exception thereon. No notice of the exception was ever given to the bail, nor did he know anything of it\u2019 until about five months after it was entered. No waiver of the exception had ever been entered upon the bail piece; but the attorneys of Thorp and Reynolds, had agreed orally to waive the exception. A declaration was filed in chief, ( not <em>de bene esse,) </em>in consequence of this agreement; the cause proceeded to judgment; a <em>ca. sa. </em>had been returned <em>non est, </em>&amp;c., and the defendant sued as special bail, by <em>capias, </em>returnable at this term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-11\">\n<em>J.

In <em>Flack </em>v. <em>Eager, </em>the declaration was filed <em>de bene esse.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b514-13\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AiPu\">We think this case clearly within the principle of <em>Flack </em>v. <em>Eager ; </em>and in <em>The People </em>v. <em>Judges of Onondaga, </em>(1 Cowen, 54, 56,) the Court say, that if bail who are excepted to, do not justify within the time allowed by the rules of the Court, they cease to be bail; and the plaintiff cannot hold them by waiving the exception, even where there is no surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
