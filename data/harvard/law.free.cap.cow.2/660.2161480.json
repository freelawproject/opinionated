Because there was no demise by Leggett to Schuyler, either implied or expressed. 2d. If there was a demise, it was by parol, for seven years, and, therefore, void by the statute of frauds and perjuries. 3d. Because Leggett could not dis-train for rent .under a parol-demise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b662-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>His honor the Judge overruled these objections, and di reeled the jury to find for the defendant, who found according.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b662-12\"><em>S. </em>G. Huntington, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHC\">now moved for a new trial. He insisted that if the last agreement was not a leacing of the premises, there was no rent due for which Leggett could distrain. If, under an agreement for a lease at a certain rent, the tenant is let into possession before the lease is executed, the lessor cannot distrain for rent during the first year; for there is no demise expressed or impli\u00b0d.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> . An agreement to let will not operate as a lease, if a future executory act was in view.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The old letting was at end by the last agreement. The cases in which the tenant has been considered as being in under the terms of an old lease, where he holds over after his term has expired.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> are those in which no new contract was entered into. The new lease here differs in terms from the old.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-13\">Again: this was a demise for seven years, by parol, and void, therefore, by the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-14\">[The counsel also raised the objection, that the lease being by parol, and containing no clause of distress, the defendant for that reason, had no right to distrain, upon which the arguments were the same as in the next preceding cause.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b662-15\"><em>E. Cowen, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az8\">relied upon the case of <em>M\u2019Leish </em>v. <em>Tate,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as in point for the defendant. There the Court gave effect to an unexecuted lease for nine years, on the ground that the lessee had held under it, and the landlord expressed a willingness to execute it; but the tenant declined. An avowry was sustained upon a mere draft of a lease not executed by either party. The present is certainly a much stronger case for the avowant. In <em>Hagan </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>cited from 2 Taunton, which was the case of a holding under an executory agreement to execute a lease, the landlord dis-trained before the year had pasesd. There could, therefore, be no tenancy from year to year, which plainly exists in this case. Here has been more than \u00e1 year\u2019s holding urn der the new lease. If this was void, either by the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>frauds, or because it was never executed, then comes the holding over under the old lease. Upon one or the other of these grounds, the plaintiff was a tenant from year to year, at the .rent talked of between the parties. The agreement and draft of the lease will, at least, amount to an admission that the premises were worth the sum mentioned in the lease, and a promise to pay that sum. This would be a parol lease, under which the defendant might distrain.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\"> <em>Hegan </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>2 Taunt. 148. <em>Hearn v.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWyO\">The cases cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel show, that to entitle the landlord to distrain, there must be a letting, and an agreement to pay rent\u2014that an occupancy under an agreement for a lease at a future time is\u2018not sufficient. The facts in this case show an occupancy, in the first instance, under a parol demise from year to year. When the new arrangement was made, a parol agreement must have preceded the directions to Mr. Palmer to draw the lease. Though this lease was never, in fact, executed by Schuyler, yet his occupancy was either under this lease, or the parol agreement, in pursuance of which the directions were given for the lease. In either case, there was.a letting by Leggett to Schuyler, and an agreement by Schuyler to pay the rent. If the occupancy has been under the lease, then, having accepted possession under it; he takes the estate subject to the covenants and the conditions contained in it. In that case his liability exists, and also the landlord\u2019s right to distrain. If the occupancy has been under the parol agreement, then he has held under a parol demise for seven years ; which, though it is void as a lease for the term, yet it enures as a tenancy from year to year, <em>(Clayton </em>v. <em>Blakey, </em>8 T. R. 3,) and must regulat. the terms on which the tenancy subsists in other respects; as the rent, the time of the year when the tenant must quit, &amp;c. <em>(Doe </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>5 T. R. 471. Roberts on Frauds, 244, 5, 6.) Rent being due by the terms of the parol demise, the landlord\u2019s right to distrain was perfect; and the defendant was at liberty, under the avowry in this case, to avail himself of either a parol or written lease. In my opinion, the defendant must have judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">New trial denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
