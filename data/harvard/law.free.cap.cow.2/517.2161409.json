The return was simply the Justice\u2019s certificate endorsed upon the copy of the affidavit served upon him, stating in effect, that the affidavit contained a true history of the proceedings in the cause before him. It appeared among other things, by this return, that Wightman, the plaintiff below, declared against Clapp, the defendant below, in assumpsit upon an account; that Clapp pleaded the general issue as to all except 5 dollars of the plaintiff\u2019s account, and a tender as to this, which he paid into Court. He also gave notice of set off. On the trial, there was no proof of i . _ . * <em>1 </em>a tender, nor was it stated m the affidavits or return, that there Was any such proof offered upon the trial. It farther appeared from the return that the jury found a verdict for Clapp of $3 57, notwithstanding the $\u20185 paid into Court. The fact was not contradicted by any of the affidavits. v <em>J</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-22\"><em>J </em>Koon, contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b517-23\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aipy\">On looking into the \u00e1ffidavits and return which have been submitted to us, we find the truth of the latter strongly supported by several witnesses; and the additional testimony which the defendant in error seeks to have returned, appears to us wholly immaterial; blit if it were otherwise, it would be idle to grant an amendment, when we cannot help seeing from the whole case, that the judgment must be reversed. The defendant below pleaded a tender of 5 dollars, which he paid into Court, thereby admitting this sum to b\u00e9 due to the plaintiff. No proof of a tender was offered or pretended, nor it is now pretended that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>such proof exists; yet the jury found 3 dollars and 57 cents for the defendant, contrary to his recorded confession, he owed the plaintiff 5 dollars. Such a verdict cannot be sustained. An amendment would be useless, and is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Motion denied</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
