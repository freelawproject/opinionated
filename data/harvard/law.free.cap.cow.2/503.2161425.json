The defendants\u2019 attorney entered a rule to reply, served a notice thereof on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and entered a default for want of a replication. The default was entered March 26th, 1823. May 16th, of the same year, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney entered a rule of course, in the common rule book, that the plaintiff have leave to discontinue that suit without costs; and immediately commenced the present suit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-12\"><em>B.

It is not of course to enter a rule to discontinue without costs, on receiving a plea of the defendants\u2019 discharge under the insolvent act. This can be done only upon special motion, and under circumstances to be shown on affidavit and approved by the Court. <em>We </em>should <em>grant </em>the motion, therefore, as applied for, but it comes too late. Judgment is perfected. Where an issue is joined in a cause, a motion to stay proceedings for non-payment of the costs of a former action, may be made before trial in the second. <em>(Cuyler </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>Vandcrwerk, </em>1 John.
