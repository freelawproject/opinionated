And it is further ordered, that if upon the trial of the said issue a verdict shall be given for the said David, or it shall happen that the plaintiff shall not further prosecute his said bill, for any other cause than for not confessing lease and entry and also ouster subject to the condition aforesaid, then,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The defendant\u2019s attorney signed this special consent rule with a duplicate, and tendered it to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, requesting him to join, at the same time delivering to him a copy of the above affidavit, and showing to him the original. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney refused to join in the rule.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-4\">Willard,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aux\">now moved for leave to enter into a special consent rule as above drawn. He cited Adams on Ejectment, 236; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denniston, </em>(4 John. Rep. 312) <em>Langendyck et ux. </em>v. Burhans, (11 John. 461,) 2 Archbold, 47. He said the lessors of the plaintiff ought also to pay the costs of this motion for not accepting the tenant\u2019s offer in the first instance.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-5\"><em>S.

But we think lie was not bound to do this. Entering into a special consent rule is not a matter of course, but should be on a special application to the Court; especially where the affidavit is so general and loose as the one which was served upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. We grant the application, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The following rule was entered:</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">\u201c On, \u00abfee. ordered, that David L. Lytle, the tenant in possession of the premises in the declaration of ejectment mentioned, have leave to enter into a special consent rule,requiring him to confess <em>lease </em>and <em>entry </em>at the.trial, but not <em>ouster </em>also, unless an <em>actual ouster </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s lessors, or one of them, by the said David, shall be proved.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
