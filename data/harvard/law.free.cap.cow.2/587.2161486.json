Special bail was put in on the 6th August last, and notice thereof given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, the next day. The plaintiff did not serYe a declaration till in February term, 1824, so that two terms, including August term, (when bail was put in,) had elapsed since the defendant had put in bail. 'On the copy of declaration being left at the office of the defendant\u2019s attorney, he declined receiving it. On these facts,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b588-5\">\n<em>C. S.

This fact, and supposing there was a perfect understanding between him and the defendant\u2019s attorney, and also supposing that the term of putting in bail was exclusive., induced him to delay declaring til! the 13th March.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b588-9\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A8_\">The term at which bail is put in must be reckon- \u25a0 ed inclusive; and the plaintiff was, in strictness, too late ; ' but as a very satisfactory excuse is given for the delay, the motion must be denied, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
