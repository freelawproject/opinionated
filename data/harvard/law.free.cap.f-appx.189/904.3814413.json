Harris argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights, because his trial counsel mistakenly told him that voluntary intoxication was not a possible defense to his first-degree murder charge for the November, 1998 killing of his long-time girlfriend. Harris argues that counsel\u2019s failure to pursue this defense could not have been a tactical decision because counsel misinformed him of the applicable law. Harris also argues that the alleged deficiency prejudiced him because, had the jury been informed that he was voluntarily intoxicated, it would either have acquitted him or convicted him of the lesser offense of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-19\">In March 2003, Harris filed a motion for post-conviction relief in Florida state court. The Florida trial court denied his motion and the Fourth District Court of Appeals affirmed. Harris then filed his petition for writ of habeas corpus with the federal district court. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), a federal court may not grant habeas relief on claims that were previously adjudicated in state court, unless the adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law ... or resulted in a decision based on an unreasonable determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d A state court\u2019s summary, unexplained rejection of a constitutional issue qualifies as an adjudication that is entitled to deference. <em>Wright v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>278 F.3d 1245, 1254 (11th Cir.2002). The state court only is required to reject a claim on the merits, not to provide an explanation for \u00a7 2254(d)(1) to apply. <em>Id. </em>at 1255. A state court decision that does not rest on procedural grounds alone is an adjudication on the merits, regardless of the form in which it is expressed. <em>Id. </em>at 1255-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, a prisoner first \u201cmust show that counsel\u2019s performance was [constitutionally] deficient\u201d (\u201cperformance prong\u201d). <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Second, the prisoner must establish that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense (\u201cprejudice prong\u201d). <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]here is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to approach the inquiry in the same order or even to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">To prove the deficient performance prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, the prisoner must show that counsel made errors so serious that he or she was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. The proper measure of attorney performance is reasonableness under prevailing professional norms. <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. The guiding principle is \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential, and there is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 689,104 S.Ct. at 2065.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">To prove prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. A reasonable probability is one sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 104 S.Ct. at 2067.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">A petitioner raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must satisfy a heavy burden of proof in order to prevail. \u201cGiven the strong presumption in favor of competence, the petitioner\u2019s burden of persuasion \u2014 though the presumption is not insurmountable \u2014 is a heavy one.\u201d <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1314 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc); <em>see also Rogers v. Zant, </em>13 F.3d 384, 386 (11th Cir.1994) (noting that \u201cthe cases in which habeas petitioners can properly prevail on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel are few and far between\u201d). \u201cThe test has nothing to do with what the best lawyers would have done. Nor is the test even what most good lawyers would have done. We ask only whether some reasonable lawyer at the trial could have acted, in the circumstances, as defense counsel acted at trial.\u201d <em>White v. Singletary, </em>972 F.2d 1218,1220 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">In Florida, before October 1, 1999, voluntary intoxication was a recognized defense to specific intent crimes such as first-degree murder. Effective as of October 1, 1999, voluntary intoxication has been eliminated as a defense in Florida. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.051 (1999). The defense was not a complete defense, however, but available to negate specific intent. <em>Gardner v. State, </em>480 So.2d 91, 92 (Fla. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>1985); <em>Chestnut v. State, </em>538 So.2d 820, 822 (Fla.1989). Thus, the defense of voluntary intoxication was available only to reduce the charged offense to a lesser-included offense. Voluntary intoxication was not an available defense for general intent crimes, including second-degree murder or manslaughter. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>871 So.2d 298, 301 (Fla. 1st Dist.Ct.App. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Although Harris contends that his counsel should have correctly instructed him as to the voluntary-intoxication defense, these allegations are not enough to overcome the heavy burden of proof required to show ineffective assistance. <em>See Chandler, </em>218 F.3d at 1314. Harris offers no explanation as to why his trial counsel should have pursued the voluntary-intoxication defense. The evidence presented at trial and at the suppression hearing demonstrated that Harris was not intoxicated or under the influence at the time he committed the offense. Therefore, any argument that counsel would have made regarding voluntary intoxication would have been inconsistent with the evidence. <em>See, e.g., White, </em>972 F.2d at 1221 (holding that defense counsel\u2019s failure to present voluntary intoxication as a defense in a capital-murder prosecution was not beyond the range of reasonable professional judgment and, thus, did not amount to ineffective assistance, in view of inconsistency of intoxication defense with deliberateness of the defendant\u2019s actions during the shootings). Because Harris has not produced any evidence to rebut the presumption of competence, he has not shown that his counsel was ineffective. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689,104 S.Ct. at 2065.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Moreover, Harris\u2019s claim also fails because there was no prejudice. The voluntary-intoxication defense was not a complete defense, but available only to negate specific intent and reduce the charged offense to a lesser-included offense. Harris was found guilty of only the lesser-included offense of second-degree murder, which is a general-intent crime to which voluntary intoxication was not a defense. <em>See Wilson, </em>871 So.2d at 301. In other words, a voluntary intoxication defense could not have assisted Harris on the second-degree murder charge. Since Harris was convicted of only the lesser-included offense, due at least in part to the efforts of defense counsel, he suffered no prejudice. Accordingly, the district court was correct that the state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to, nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, and, thus, the district court did not err in denying Harris\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Therefore, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Upon a review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
