The district court sentenced Daniels to a term of 360 months imprisonment for the drug conspiracy count, and 240 months for the money laundering count, to run concurrently. On appeal, Daniels challenges only his sentence. He contends that the district court impermissibly relied on statements he gave pursuant to a valid proffer agreement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-23\">On March 17, 2004, Daniels executed a proffer agreement <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> with the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>in which he agreed \u201cto be fully truthful and forthright\u201d concerning the investigation into his offense, and \u201cto submit to polygraph examination(s)\u201d if requested. In turn, the Government agreed that it would not use any \u201cstatements made or other information\u201d Daniels provided against him. The agreement specified that Daniels\u2019s \u201cfailure to be fully truthful and forthright at any stage will, at the sole election to the Government, cause the obligations of the Government within this Agreement to become null and void.\u201d A failure to pass a requested polygraph exam \u201cto the satisfaction of the Government\u201d would similarly constitute a breach of the agreement, negating the Government\u2019s obligations. If Daniels breached his obligations under the agreement, the proffer agreement expressly authorized the Government to \u201cuse for any purpose any and all statements made and other information provided by [Daniels] in the prosecution of [Daniels] on any charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Daniels argues that the district court erred in concluding that he breached the proffer agreement by failing the government administered polygraph exam. We disagree. A proffer agreement operates like a contract; accordingly, to discern whether Daniels breached the agreement, we must examine its express terms. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>219 F.3d 343, 346 (4th Cir.2000) (citing <em>United States v. Cobblah, </em>118 F.3d 549, 551 (7th Cir.1997)). Here, the contract terms explicitly require that Daniels be truthful and that he pass a polygraph test \u201cto the satisfaction of the Government\u201d if requested to undergo such a test. Indisputably, he failed to pass the given polygraph test, thereby clearly breaching the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Accordingly, because Daniels breached the proffer agreement, we conclude that Daniels\u2019s other contentions\u2014 namely, that the district court impermissibly enhanced his sentenced based on statements he made during the proffer interview \u2014 lack merit. Under the precise terms of the proffer agreement itself\u2014 which Daniels signed \u2014 any breach by Daniels renders the Government\u2019s obligations null and void, and permits the Government to use Daniels\u2019s statements to prosecute him. The district court thus did not err in relying on Daniels\u2019s own statements and admissions to establish the factual predicates necessary to enhance his sentence under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">We further find that the district court did not violate <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) in sentencing Daniels. Rather, the court properly calculated the advisory Guidelines range, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, made appropriate enhancements based on Daniels\u2019s own admissions, and imposed a reasonable sentence within the Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-14\"> A \u201cproffer agreement\u201d is an agreement between the Government and a defendant in a criminal case \u201cthat sets forth the terms under which the defendant will provide information to the government\u201d; it \"defines the obligations of the parties and is intended to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tect the defendant against the use of his or her statements.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>219 F.3d 343, 345 n. 1 (4th Cir.2000). On January 28, 2005, ten <em>months </em>after executing the proffer agreement, Daniels signed a written plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
