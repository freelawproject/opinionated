He contends that the district court erred by adjusting his offense level because he recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-25\">The district court did not err by adjusting Fisher\u2019s offense level. Fisher carried a passenger in a cargo compartment underneath the floorboard of the sleeper section of his tractor-trailer that was not designed to hold people. Moreover, Fisher was deliberately ignorant of the hiding positions of his passengers. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Mesa, </em>443 F.3d 397, 403 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
