United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Substantial evidence is defined as that evidence which \u201ca reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">To prove conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846, the government must prove an agreement to violate a federal drug law, the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the conspiracy, and the defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary participation in such conspiracy. <em>United States v. Strickland, </em>245 F.3d 368, 384-85 (4th Cir.2001). Notably, a defendant may be convicted of conspiracy without knowing all of his coconspirators, or of all of the conspiracy\u2019s details, as long as he joins the conspiracy understanding its unlawful nature and willfully joins in the plan on at least one occasion. <em>Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 858. Once the existence of a conspiracy is established, only a slight link between a defendant and the conspiracy is needed to support conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The evidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, showed that Conrad knowingly and voluntarily participated in a conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute fifty grams or more of crack. Conrad\u2019s cousin, Samuel Spease (Spease), testified at trial that he served as a lookout for Conrad either across the street from or in front of a trailer from which Conrad sold crack to individual customers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Spease\u2019s lookout duties included him radioing by walkie talkie Charles Hairston (Hairston), whom Spease testified \u201cwas in it with us,\u201d when a crack customer approached the trailer in which Conrad was waiting to make a sale. (J.A. 130). According to Spease, once he notified Hairston of an approaching customer, Hairston \u201ctook it from there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Spease also testified that sometimes Hairston would serve as the lookout. In exchange for Spease\u2019s lookout activities, Conrad either paid Spease money or provided him with some crack. Spease testified that he was a lookout for Conrad for approximately two or three weeks and that Conrad had approximately ten to fifteen customers per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">During the time relevant to Conrad\u2019s conspiracy conviction, police executed a search warrant at the same trailer and consequently seized various amounts of crack packaged for individual distribution, $1,192 in United States currency, a set of digital scales used to weigh drugs for individual sales, a walkie talkie, a loaded firearm, and Conrad\u2019s North Carolina driver\u2019s license, which license had been laying on a desk in the master bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">The evidence also showed drug trafficking activity at a second trailer, located in a neighboring North Carolina county, in which Conrad lived and sublet a portion with a separate entrance to Hairston. During the time of the charged conspiracy, 30.5 grams of cooling crack was seized, pursuant to a search warrant, from the stove-top of the second trailer\u2019s shared kitchen. A set of scales and a box of latex gloves were also seized from the shared kitchen. Additionally, the police seized 5.9 grams of cocaine hydrochloride, a key ingredient of crack, from a shelf in Conrad\u2019s bathroom. Conrad himself even admitted on the witness stand at trial that he knew Hairston was selling drugs from this second trailer, but that he \u201cneeded half the rent.\u201d (J.A. 285).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">From this outlined evidence, we have no trouble concluding that Conrad\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of crack, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7'841(b)(1)(A), 846, is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we affirm such conviction. We dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>pense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-16\">. At the time of his conspiracy conviction, Conrad was also convicted of various federal firearm and drug charges. Conrad does not challenge these other convictions in the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\">. Conrad's mother paid the rent on the trailer, which trailer was across the street from the trailer in which she lived.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
