Gollick\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising the issues of whether the district court erred in calculating the drug weight for sentencing purposes and whether his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Gollick filed a pro se supplemental brief further addressing the drug weight issue and alleging ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing and on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we find plain error occurred in Gollick\u2019s sentencing under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">Because Gollick raised no objection at sentencing, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cAny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. We will find plain error if the district court could not have imposed the sentence it did without exceeding the relevant Sixth Amendment limitation. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 550-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-15\">Gollick pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute a quantity of oxycodone. Although ninety and one-half eighty-milligram oxycontin pills were seized from Gollick, he did not stipulate to any drug quantity and no amount was indicated in either the plea agreement or the indictment. The district court determined Gollick\u2019s base offense level was twenty-eight under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) (2001) based on findings in the presentence report that Gollick was responsible for 3100 eighty-milligram oxycontin tablets. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>With a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and criminal history category III, Gollick\u2019s sentencing guideline range was seventy to eighty-seven months. While Gollick did not object to the presentence report, his silence did not constitute an admission to drug weight under <em>Booker. See United States v. Milam, </em>443 F.3d 382 (4th Cir.2006). If Gollick had been sentenced based on the ninety and one-half oxycontin phis, his base offense level would have only been sixteen, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, resulting in a guideline range of twenty-seven to thirty-three months. Because Gollick\u2019s sentence clearly exceeded the maximum authorized by his guilty plea, we find plain error occurred at sentencing that affected his substantial rights. We find Gollick\u2019s remaining issues are merit-less. We find no support for Gollick\u2019s challenge to the calculation of drug weight, and we conclude his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel should be raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and affirm Gollick\u2019s conviction. We conclude, however, that Gollick\u2019s sentencing violated <em>Booker. </em>Accordingly, although we affirm Gollick\u2019s conviction, we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We deny Gollick\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to seal the <em>Anders </em>notice. We also deny Gollick\u2019s pro se motions requesting new counsel, transcripts at government expense, and an extension of time for additional pro se supplemental briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-11\">. We construed Gollick's pleading filed on December 15, 2004, as his pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-12\">. Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Gollick\u2019s sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating an error is \"plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\">. Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \"consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \"within the statutorily prescribed range ... and reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
