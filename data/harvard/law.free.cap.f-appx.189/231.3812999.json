Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">On February 11, 2002, in Union, South Carolina, Blair engaged in an argument with Emmette Dawkins, which resulted in Blair firing two shots at Dawkins. Officers conducting a post-incident investigation of the scene recovered one intact round of ammunition, two spent projectiles, and one spent casing. The casings were 9mm and had a manufacturer\u2019s stamp of \u201cMRP.\u201d Evidence presented at trial demonstrated that this manufacturer\u2019s stamp indicated that the casings were manufactured in Brazil and that ammunition of this type was not manufactured in South Carolina. At trial, Blair was found guilty of the one count charged in the indictment \u2014 \u201cThat on or about February 11, 2002, in the District of South Carolina, the Defendant, DENNIS BLAIR, after having been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, did knowingly possess in and affecting commerce, 9mm caliber ammunition which had been shipped and transported in interstate commerce.\u201d J.A. at 14. The jury was instructed with the statutory definition of ammunition, which \u201cmeans ammunition or cartridge cases, primers, bullets, or propellant powder designed for use in a firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(17)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-17\">On appeal, Blair contends that the jury instructions in this case constructively amended his indictment by allowing him to be convicted based on a theory not present in his indictment. Specifically, Blair argues that the indictment only mentioned \u201cammunition\u201d that had traveled in interstate commerce \u2014 meaning that the jury should have been allowed to convict him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>only on a theory that he possessed whole ammunition that had traveled across state lines \u2014 not on a theory that he possessed the component parts of ammunition that traveled across state lines, in accordance with the statutory definition of ammunition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Blair acknowledges that he did not raise this objection below and that our review is therefore for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim. Proc. 520b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). In this case, we hold that there is no plain error because there was no error at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The government presented evidence at trial that the component parts of the ammunition found at the scene had traveled in interstate commerce. Blair argues that this evidence does not demonstrate that whole ammunition traveled in interstate commerce because Blair could have reloaded the ammunition himself in South Carolina.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because, Blair contends, his indictment referred only to \u201cammunition\u201d and not to the component parts of that ammunition, he should not have been convicted upon only a demonstration that the component parts of the ammunition traveled in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">This argument fails. \u201cAmmunition\u201d has a statutory definition, which indicates that \u201c[t]he term \u2018ammunition\u2019 means ammunition or cartridge cases, primers, bullets, or propellant powder designed for use in any firearm.\u201d 18 U.S.C \u00a7 921(a)(17)(A). This is the meaning of the term \u201cammunition\u201d as used in all of the statutes under which Blair was indicted. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 921(a)(indicat-ing the scope of the definitions contained therein). This was also the definition with which the jury was properly instructed. Blair, in effect, argues that the government had an obligation to define every term used in his indictment, even though those terms had clear statutory definitions. Blair points to no authority requiring the government to take on this burden, and we can find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">In sum, we affirm Blair\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before us and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\"> Reloading is a process though which used shell casings are repacked with propellant powder and a projectile.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
