On appeal, Stevens challenges all of his convictions as violative of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), which prohibits the exercise of peremptory strikes \u201cto challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712. Additionally, Stevens challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his \u00a7 924(c) conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-16\">Stevens\u2019 <em>Batson </em>challenge is based upon his argument that the district court erroneously allowed the government to peremptorily strike a potential black juror, Juror No. 6, because of her race. \u201cA finding by the [trial] court concerning whether a peremptory challenge was exercised for a racially discriminatory reason is given great deference by this court; we review that finding only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Grimmond, </em>137 F.3d 823, 833 (4th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-17\">The three-step burden-shifting analysis of a <em>Batson </em>challenge is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-18\">When making a <em>Batson </em>motion, the defendant must first make a \u201cprima facie\u201d showing of purposeful discrimination. Once the defendant establishes a prima <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a race-neutral explanation for the challenge. If the prosecutor satisfies this requirement, the burden shifts back to the defendant to prove that the explanation given is a pretext for discrimination. The ultimate burden always rests with the opponent of the challenge to prove purposeful discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 833-34 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cOnce a prosecutor has offered a race-neutral explanation for the peremptory challenges and the trial court has ruled on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination, the preliminary issue of whether the defendant had made a prima facie showing becomes moot.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 359, 111 S.Ct. 1859,114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991) (plurality opinion). \u201cAt this step of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360, 111 S.Ct. 1859.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">According to counsel for the government, she struck Juror No. 6 because, in her four years as a prosecutor, it had been her experience \u201cthat folks that have sat on juries believe they are experts and are sometimes not able to discuss issues with others. [Juror No. 6] indicated she has served on a jury before, a criminal jury.\u201d (J.A. 55). The burden therefore shifted back to Stevens to demonstrate that the government\u2019s articulated, race-neutral reason was a pretext for racial discrimination. <em>United States v. Joe, </em>928 F.2d 99, 102 (4th Cir.1991). Stevens asserted that the government\u2019s reasoning was pretextual because the government did not strike Juror No. 12, a potential white juror who also had previously served on a criminal jury. <em>See Miller-El v. Dretke, </em>545 U.S. 231, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196 (2005) (If \u201cproffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack who is permitted to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination to be considered at <em>Bat-son\u2019 </em>s third step.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The following exchange between the district court and the government then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">[GOVERNMENT]: But when I saw her response to the question, I was not comfortable having her on the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0d\">THE COURT: The response of [Juror No. 6]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">[GOVERNMENT]: Yes. Yes. I watched as she answered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">THE COURT: What was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-12\">(J.A. 55).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-13\">[GOVERNMENT]: I watched as you asked questions of who had sat on juries, and things like that, and I looked at the response on their faces and she kind of smirked. It may not be a smirk, but it\u2019s something that didn\u2019t leave me comfortable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-14\">(J.A. 56).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-15\">Counsel for Stevens responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think she has given very solid grounds that she might have given a look, she might not have given a look.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-16\">The district court considered this argument and concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-17\">It\u2019s not whether the grounds are solid. The question is whether or not she has given a neutral justification for [her] exercise to strike. I\u2019m going to accept it on its face, and I do so, and the motion is denied. The record is preserved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-18\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-19\">We hold the district court\u2019s finding that the government had a race-neutral justification for peremptorily striking Juror No. 6 is not clearly erroneous. The district court was in a position to observe Juror No. 6 as well as the demeanor of government counsel, and, \u201c[a]s with the state of mind of a juror, evaluation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s state of mind based on demeanor and credibility lies peculiarly within a trial judge\u2019s province.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 365, 111 S.Ct. 1859 (internal quotation marks omitted). In sum, we reject Stevens\u2019 Batson challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">We also reject Stevens\u2019 challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support his \u00a7 924(c) conviction for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. A verdict must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the government, to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Substantial evidence is defined as that evidence which \u201ca reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The evidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, showed that Stevens was the driver of a borrowed vehicle. While the vehicle was parked on the side of the road with the engine running, Stevens kept a loaded firearm at his feet in the floorboard and held 5.437 grams of cocaine base in his hands, which cocaine base was packaged for distribution in fifty-four knotted, clear-plastic baggie corners. From this evidence, the jury could reasonably infer that Stevens possessed the firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
