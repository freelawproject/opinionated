Shah contends that the IJ erred by denying his asylum application as untimely, urging that he had good cause not to file it within the statutory period. Shah also contends that the IJ erred in denying his application for withholding of removal because he presented evidence to show that it is more likely than not that he will be subject to persecution upon his return to Pakistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum relied on the IJ\u2019s determination that Shah\u2019s application was untimely. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of asylum. <em>Cf. Zhu v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 521, 526 (5th Cir.2004). Shah has not shown that the evidence presented in his case compels the conclusion that the IJ erroneously denied his application for withholding of removal. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). As there is substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s determination, Shah is not entitled to relief. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Accordingly, Shah\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR.
