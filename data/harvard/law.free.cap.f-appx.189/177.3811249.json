We find the district court properly construed the motion as one under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Raines v. Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>ed States, </em>423 F.2d 526, 528 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1 (4th Cir.1970); <em>see also Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---,-, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2647, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005) (when a motion is \u201cin substance a successive habeas petition,\u201d it \u201cshould be treated accordingly\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Because Bailey\u2019s petition was properly construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion, the order dismissing the motion is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>Jones v. Braxton, </em>392 F.3d 683 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of his constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Bailey has not made the requisite showing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\">. Bailey asserts on appeal that the district court should have construed his claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000). Because \u00a7 2255 has not been rendered inadequate to address Bailey\u2019s claims, <em>see In Re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333-34 (4th Cir.2000), we conclude the district court did not err in construing his petition as arising under \u00a7 2255 rather than \u00a7 2241.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-22\">. To the extent Bailey\u2019s petition is construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, that claim fails, as Bailey has failed to allege: (1) newly discovered evidence; or (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>see also United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005) (holding <em>Booker </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
