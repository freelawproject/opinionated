Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Marlin Andrew Marrs appeals the forty-one-month sentence imposed after remand, on his guilty plea to distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000). Marrs challenges the reasonableness of this sentence, contending that it is longer than necessary to comply with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006). We find, however, that the district court sentenced Marrs only after appropriately considering and examining the sentencing guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as instructed by <em>Booker. </em>The court sentenced Marrs within the applicable advisory guideline range and well below the twenty-year statutory maximum set forth in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">We cannot conclude that, under these circumstances, Marrs\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (finding that sentence imposed within properly calculated advisory guidelines range is presumptively reasonable), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309,164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 346 (4th Cir.2006) (finding that district court\u2019s \u201cdetailed inquiry into the various circumstances bearing upon [defendant\u2019s] sentence\u201d satisfied court\u2019s obligation to consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
