See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b191-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Kenneth Gordy pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine and fifty grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2005) (Count 1), possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2005) (Count 3), conspiracy to launder money, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1956(h) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005) (Count 4), and maintaining a drug-involved premises for the purpose of distributing five kilograms or more of cocaine, and aiding and abetting the same, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 856(a)(l)-(2) (West Supp.2005), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (2000) (Count 5). He appeals his sentence of concurrent 135-month prison terms on each count, asserting that the district court erred by applying the two-level firearm enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Under the guidelines, a defendant\u2019s offense level must be increased by two under USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) if a dangerous weapon was possessed during the offense. This \u201cadjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) cmt. n. 3. The district court\u2019s enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">In order to apply the enhancement, the government need not establish a perfect connection between the possession of the firearm and the commission of the drug offense. <em>Id. </em>The enhancement does not \u201crequire[] proof of precisely concurrent acts, for example, a gun in hand while in the act of storing drugs, drugs in hand while in the act of retrieving a gun.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>128 F.3d 850, 852 (4th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). On review of the record, we cannot say that the district court committed clear error in applying the firearm enhancement to Gordy.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">Gordy\u2019s claim that the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is without merit. We find that the district court fully considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2005) in imposing Gordy\u2019s sentence. Because the district court imposed a sentence within the properly calculated guideline range and within the statutory maximum, we find the sentence reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert, denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006) (No. 05-10474).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-16\">Accordingly, we affirm Gordy\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
