Williams argues that the government breached the plea agreement by grudgingly recommending a sentence of 36 months pursuant to the plea agreement, yet volunteering to the district court a series of harsh characterizations of Williams\u2019 crime and his prior criminal his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>tory. The government makes three arguments in response: (1) that Williams made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal any issue except an upward departure from the applicable guidelines range, and therefore this Court should not consider his appeal; (2) Williams violated the plea agreement first, rendering the government\u2019s alleged breach a nullity; and (3) the government did not breach the plea agreement, and even if it did, the error was not plain. Because the government\u2019s first argument raises a threshold question, we address it before turning to the merits of Williams\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Whether a defendant effectively waived his right to appeal his sentence is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Copeland, </em>381 F.3d 1101, 1104 (11th Cir.2004). We have held that a plea agreement is \u201cin essence, a contract.\u201d <em>United States v. Howle, </em>166 F.3d 1166, 1168 (11th Cir.1999). Accordingly, even where an agreement explicitly lists exclusive grounds for appeal and the defendant waives all others, he does not implicitly waive the right to appeal a breach of the terms of the plea agreement. <em>Copeland, </em>381 F.3d at 1105. Any claim to the contrary is \u201cquite meritless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The reason for this is obvious: there would be no point in entering into a contract if the other party could violate its terms with impunity. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">We reject the government\u2019s argument that Williams waived his right to appeal a breach of the plea agreement. Williams did waive his right to appeal his sentence except on the ground of upward departure from the otherwise applicable sentencing guideline range. In doing so, however, Williams did not implicitly waive the right to appeal a breach of the plea agreement. <em>See Copeland, </em>381 F.3d at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Having rejected the government\u2019s threshold argument, we turn now to the issue itself. Williams contends that he reasonably understood from the plea agreement that the government would not advocate either directly or indirectly a sentence above 36 months. He argues that the government breached the plea agreement by emphasizing the dangerous nature of his past and current criminal history in response to an open-ended question by the district court. We ordinarily review <em>de novo </em>whether the government breached a plea agreement, <em>United States v. Mahique, </em>150 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir.1998), but where, as here, the defendant did not object at sentencing we review only for plain error, <em>United States v. Romano, </em>314 F.3d 1279, 1281 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">A reversal under plain error review requires (1) error (2) that is plain, (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>For an error to affect substantial rights, \u201cin most cases it means that the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The party seeking to establish plain error has the burden of persuasion as to prejudice. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>545 U.S. 1127, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">When addressing the prejudice prong of plain error review in the context of a sentence imposed after the breach of a plea agreement, we have found plain error where the breach resulted in the court sentencing under a higher guidelines range. <em>Romano, </em>314 F.3d at 1281-82. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Conversely, we have refused to find plain error where the defendant did not preserve an objection and there was no effect on the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1503-04 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Although the government breached the plea agreement, Williams\u2019 claim fails because he cannot establish prejudice under the third prong of the plain error test. Williams has not shown that the government\u2019s remarks, which were based on information already in the record, had a negative effect on his sentence. In rejecting the 36-month sentence the government had agreed to recommend, the court expressed surprise it had done so and said: \u201cI just don\u2019t feel compelled to agree with the government\u2019s recommendation.\u201d The court made deta\u00f1ed findings regarding the nature of Williams\u2019 current and past convictions, explaining: \u201cI don\u2019t take it at all lightly, and I\u2019m surprised that the government does.\u201d W\u00fcliams has not met his burden to show prejudice, and on that basis we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
