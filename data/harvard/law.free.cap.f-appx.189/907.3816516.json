On October 19, 1999, Carr was sentenced to 240 months imprisonment after a jury found him guilty of (1) conspiring to distribute a quantity of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, and (2) distributing a quantity of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of amount of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The presentence investigation report set Carr\u2019s base offense level at 32, holding him accountable for at least 500 grams of methamphetamine pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(c)(7), and the district court did hold him accountable for that amount at sentencing. On January 13, 2006, the district court denied Carr\u2019s motion to reduce that sentence, which is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-18\">Carr contends that Amendment 591 requires the district court to consider the offense conduct charged in the indictment, a detectable amount of methamphetamine (not 500 grams of methamphetamine), and to apply U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(13), which would reduce his sentence from 240 months to less than 120 months and result in a downward departure for an overstated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>criminal history. He argues that holding him accountable for at least 500 grams of methamphetamine is synonymous with holding him accountable for uncharged relevant conduct. Carr contends that the district court interpreted Amendment 591 too narrowly in finding that it only applies to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2. Carr\u2019s contention that the district court could not hold him accountable for at least 500 grams of methamphetamine in determining his base offense level is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 907 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">\u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant when that defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Section 3582(c)(2) grants the district court jurisdiction to reconsider original sentencing determinations where the retroactive reduction in sentence is \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 591 is retroactively applicable. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Amendment 591 amends U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.l(a) to instruct the district court to \u201c[djetermine, pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines), the offense guideline section from Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) applicable to the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 591. The amended commentary to \u00a7 IB 1.2 reads: \u201cThis section provides the basic rules for determining the guidelines applicable to the offense conduct under Chapter Two (Offense Conduct). The court is to use the Chapter Two guideline section referenced in the Statutory Index (Appendix A) for the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.2). Nothing in the plain language of the amendment or its commentary supports the district court\u2019s finding that it applies only to \u00a7 2D1.2. Instead, the language reveals that it applies to all guidelines sections available under Chapter Two. Although we stated in <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005), that Amendment 591 \u201cwas designed to clarify [when] enhanced penalties provided by U.S.S.G \u00a7 2D1.2\u201d apply, we did not hold or mean to imply that Amendment 591 is only applicable where a defendant\u2019s sentence is increased by \u00a7 2D1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Carr still loses, however, because this case is controlled by our holding in <em>Moreno. </em>In that case, the defendant, like Carr, had been convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1). 421 F.3d at 1219. He appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1218. Also like Carr, the defendant argued that Amendment 591 prohibited the court \u201cfrom selecting the base offense level ... where the judge (not the jury) found the requisite drug quantity used in determining the appropriate base offense level under the applicable offense guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">We held that \u201cAmendment 591 directs the district court to apply the guideline dictated by the statute of conviction, but does not constrain the use of judicially found facts to select a base offense level within the relevant guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1219-20. Any argument to the contrary \u201c \u2018confuses two distinct steps taken to arrive at a guidelines sentence: [1] selection of the applicable <em>offense guideline, </em>and [2] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>selection of the <em>base offense level </em>within that applicable offense guideline.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1220 (quoting <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>293 F.3d 584, 586 (2d Cir.2002)). We held that \u201cbecause Amendment 591 only applies to the selection of the relevant offense guideline, not the selection of a base offense level within the applicable offense guideline, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying [the defendant\u2019s] \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">To the extent Carr argues that <em>Moreno </em>was wrongly decided and should be overturned, his argument is foreclosed by the prior panel precedent rule. <em>Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1300 n. 8 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cUnder the well-established prior panel precedent rule of this Circuit, the holding of the first panel to address an issue is the law of this Circuit, thereby binding all subsequent panels unless and until the first panel\u2019s holding is overruled by the Court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Amendment 591 governs only the choice of the appropriate offense guideline, not the base offense level within that guideline. Carr\u2019s contention is without merit, and we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Calhoun v. Lillenas Publ\u2019g, </em>298 F.3d 1228, 1230 n. 2 (11th Cir.2002) (\u2018We may affirm the district court on different grounds as long as the judgment entered is correct on any legal ground regardless of the grounds addressed, adopted or rejected by the district court.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
