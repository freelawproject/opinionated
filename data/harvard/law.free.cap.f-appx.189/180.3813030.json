She does not challenge her convictions on appeal, but contends only that (1) the sentencing court erred in finding the amount of loss caused by her offenses, thereby miscalculating her Guidelines sentencing range; and (2) her sentence is otherwise unreasonable. As explained below, we affirm her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">On May 26, 2005, Shull and the Government entered into a written plea agreement, whereby she agreed to waive her right to indictment and plead guilty to a two-count information. The information was filed against her in the district court on May 31, 2005. Count One charged the knowing concealment of an event that would have affected Shull\u2019s ability to obtain Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d), in contravention of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383a(a)(3) (the \u201cSSI offense\u201d). In Count Two, Shull was charged with having used, with the intent to defraud, \u201cone or more unauthorized access devices,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2) (the \u201caccess device offense\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">On June 30, 2005, the district court conducted Shull\u2019s Rule 11 plea hearing in Huntington, West Virginia. At that hearing, Tim Morton, a Special Agent with the Social Security Administration\u2019s Inspector General\u2019s Office, testified that Shull had accepted SSI benefits while concealing the fact that she worked as a personal care assistant for two elderly women, Ms. Gray and Ms. Stanley. According to Morton, Shull worked as a caretaker for Ms. Gray from July 2004 until her death in September 2004, and thereafter worked as Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Stanley\u2019s caretaker until she passed away on December 21, 2004. Morton further testified that, as a result of concealing her caretaking activities, Shull had received $6,598.44 in SSI benefits from the Social Security Administration (the \u201cSSA\u201d) to which she was not entitled. In responding to this testimony at the plea hearing, Shull acknowledged that it was \u201csubstantially correct.\u201d J.A. 37.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shull also admitted that, without authorization, she had registered credit cards in Gray\u2019s name, she had used those credit cards to make purchases, and that she had forged checks drawn on Gray\u2019s account. After finding a sufficient factual basis for Shull\u2019s guilty pleas and satisfying itself that Shull fully understood her rights and what she was doing, the district court accepted Shull\u2019s guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Shull\u2019s presentence report (the \u201cPSR\u201d) was submitted to the district court on August 8, 2005. It recommended assigning Shull a base offense level of 6 for each of her offenses, see USSG \u00a7 2B1.1 (2004), and grouping the offenses under the Guidelines, see <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3D1.2(d). The PSR further recommended applying (1) a four-level enhancement because the amount of loss resulting from Shull\u2019s offenses, when combined, totaled more than $10,000 ($6,598.44 on the SSI offense and $6,966.44 on the access device offense), <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(C); (2) a two-level enhancement because the offense charged in Count Two involved the unlawful use of a means of identification, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10); (3) a four-level enhancement because Shull \u201cknew or should have known\u201d that the victim of her access device offense (Ms. Gray) was vulnerable, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l); and (4) a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a). The PSR therefore calculated Shull\u2019s total offense level at 12, which, when combined with a criminal history category of III, yielded an advisory Guidelines sentencing range of fifteen to twenty-one months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">Shull thereafter filed objections to the PSR, contending that it overestimated the losses caused by each of her offenses. In Shull\u2019s view the loss caused by her SSI offense was $3,474 \u2014 not the $6,598.44 indicated by the PSR. Shull\u2019s objection centered on her assertion that, when she worked as a caretaker for Ms. Gray and Ms. Stanley, she was their employee and was not self-employed. Pursuant to its regulations, the SSA\u2019s calculation of income for SSI eligibility purposes depends, in part, upon whether the income is received in the form of employee \u201cwages\u201d or \u201c[n]et earnings from self-employment.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1111(a) <em>&amp; </em>(b). Importantly, employee wages count as income for the month in which the wages are actually received, while income earned through self-employment is divided \u201cequally among the months in the taxable year.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In Shull\u2019s view, she was a wage-earning employee when she worked as a caretaker from July though December 2004, and her resulting income therefore only affected her SSI eligibility for those specific months. She thus contended that she was entitled to all of the SSI benefits she had received for the six months from January through June of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">Shull further contended, in objecting to the PSR, that the loss caused by her access device offense should be reduced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>approximately $500, from the PSR\u2019s recommendation of $6,966.44 to the sum of $6,439.98. In so contending, Shull asserted that some of the access device activity cited in the PSR had been approved by Ms. Gray. Shull therefore maintained that the total loss caused by her offenses was $9,913.98, and that application of a two-level enhancement for amount of loss \u2014 in lieu of the four-level enhancement recommended by the PSR \u2014 was appropriate. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(B) &amp; (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Shull renewed her objections to the PSR at her September 12, 2005 sentencing hearing. In responding to Shull\u2019s contention concerning the SSI offense, the Assistant United States Attorney asserted that \u201cwhen the Social Security Administration was presented with the facts of this case and they went through and made the calculation for overpayment, they considered [Shull] ... as self-employed.\u201d J.A. 71. According to the prosecutor, the SSA therefore concluded that, because she had concealed her caretaking activities, Shull received $6,598.44 in SSI benefits to which she was not entitled. When questioned by the sentencing court, Shull\u2019s lawyer acknowledged the SSA ruling, but maintained that it should not be accorded any weight by the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The court overruled Shull\u2019s objection to the PSR on the amount of loss caused by her SSI offense. In so doing, the court appears to have relied exclusively on the SSA\u2019s ruling, concluding that \u201csome deference is fairly afforded to the Social Security Administration.\u201d Accordingly, the court found the loss caused by Shull\u2019s SSI offense to be the amount specified by the SSA in its ruling, that is, $6,598.44. After finding that a loss of $6,268.21 was attributable to her access device offense, the court concluded that the total loss resulting from Shull\u2019s offenses was the sum of $12,866.65, which sufficiently supported the four-level, amount-of-loss enhancement recommended by the PSR. The court thus concluded that the PSR had correctly calculated Shull\u2019s Guidelines sentencing range as fifteen to twenty-one months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In deciding upon an appropriate sentence, the court stated that it was \u201cbaffled at why\u201d Shull had committed the SSI offense, in that the court had given her a \u201cbreak\u201d on a similar conviction two years before. J.A. 82-83. The court then sentenced Shull to twenty-one months in custody, the top of the Guidelines range. The court further ordered Shull\u2019s sentence to run consecutive to the twelve-month sentence she had previously received for violating the conditions of her supervised release, yielding a total of thirty-three months. Shull appeals from her sentence, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">On appeal, we review a sentence imposed under the advisory Guidelines regime established by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to determine whether it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cReasonableness review involves both procedural and substantive components.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434. A <em>post-Booker </em>sentence is procedurally reasonable if the sentencing court has properly calculated a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, determined whether a sentence within that range serves the other factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and then imposed an appropriate sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 432. Because a sentencing court is obliged to consult the Guidelines, an error in the Guidelines calculation renders a resulting sentence unreasonable per se. <em>See id. </em>And a sentence that is procedurally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>reasonable is entitled to a presumption of substantive reasonableness if it falls within the properly calculated Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 433. In conducting our review, \u201cwe review legal questions, including the interpretation of the guidelines, de novo, while factual findings are reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Shull\u2019s primary appellate contention is that her sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the sentencing court erred in calculating the loss caused by her offenses as more than $10,000 and, consequently, in applying a four-level amount-of-loss enhancement in its determination of her Guidelines range. Specifically, she maintains that the court clearly erred in finding that her SSI offense caused a loss of $6,598.44. According to Shull, the court should have determined that she was a wage-earning employee when she worked as a caretaker, and that she was therefore entitled to the SSI benefits she received for the six-month period from January through June of 2004. Under Shull\u2019s view, the loss caused by her SSI offense was $3,474, which, combined with the loss of $6,268.21 attributed to her access device offense by the sentencing court, would yield a total loss of $9,742.21, resulting in an enhancement of two levels only. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Shull\u2019s SSI offense consisted of accepting SSI benefits while concealing her care-taking activities, and the loss caused by that offense was the value of the SSI benefits she improperly received because of her concealment. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(f)(ii) (2004) (\u201cIn a case involving government benefits ..., loss shall be considered to be not less than the value of the benefits obtained by unintended recipients .... \u201d). In its administrative ruling on the matter, the SSA concluded that it would have awarded Shull $6,598.44 less in SSI benefits if she had disclosed her caretaking activities. And, in seeking to ascertain the amount of loss caused by Shull\u2019s SSI offense, the sentencing court relied on the SSA\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">On appeal, Shull does not challenge the validity of the SSA\u2019s ruling. Rather, she contends that the sentencing court was not entitled to rely on the ruling for two reasons: (1) the burden of proof is allocated differently in SSA proceedings than it is in federal sentencing proceedings; and (2) as no record of the SSA proceeding was introduced at Shull\u2019s sentencing hearing, the SSA\u2019s ruling could not be \u201cmeaningfully] reviewed]\u201d by the sentencing court. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10. In so contending, Shull has misconstrued the amount of loss inquiry. The court was not obliged to determine whether Shull was an employee, on the one hand, or self-employed, on the other; its task was to determine the difference between the value of the SSI benefits Shull actually received, and the value of those she would have been awarded if she had disclosed her caretaking activities. And the agency that administers a benefit program is in a decidedly better position than a federal sentencing court to determine the amount of benefits a claimant would have received if she had been honest. The SSA\u2019s ruling was therefore strong evidence that it had overpaid Shull by $6,598.44, and the sentencing court was thus entitled to rely upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">In these circumstances, the sentencing court did not err in finding that the loss caused by Shull\u2019s SSI offense was $6,598.44. As Shull has not challenged the court\u2019s finding that a loss of $6,268.21 was caused by her access device offense, the court thus did not err in concluding that her offenses caused a loss of more than $10,000. And the court was therefore obliged to apply a four-level amount-of-loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>enhancement in its calculation of the Guidelines range. Accordingly, we reject Shull\u2019s contention that her sentence is procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Shull further contends that, even if procedurally reasonable, her twenty-one-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. In that regard, Shull\u2019s sentence fell within her properly calculated Guidelines range of fifteen to twenty-one months, and is therefore presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.2006). Shull attempts to rebut this presumption by maintaining that her sentence was greater than that necessary to \u201creflect the seriousness\u201d of her offenses and to \u201cafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) <em>&amp; </em>(C), and also that a lesser sentence would afford her a greater opportunity to make restitution, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(7). Although Shull\u2019s contentions might have properly aided the sentencing court in selecting an appropriate sentence, they are insufficient to overcome the presumption that her Guidelines sentence is substantively reasonable. In these circumstances, this contention must also be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we reject Shull\u2019s assignments of error and affirm her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\">.
