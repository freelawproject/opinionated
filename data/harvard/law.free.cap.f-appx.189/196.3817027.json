To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Sibhat fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-23\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Sibhat\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Sibhat fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Finally, we uphold the Board\u2019s denial of Sibhat\u2019s request to remand his proceedings to the immigration judge to consider the additional evidence that he submitted on appeal. Although the Board does have the authority to remand proceedings for further factfinding, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (2006), it \u201cwill not remand to the [immigration judge] to consider additional evidence proffered on appeal if the evidence \u2018was available and could have been presented at an earlier hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berte v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 993, 997 (8th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Matter of Grijalva, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 27, 36, 1995 WL 314388 (B.I.A.1995)). Because we find that the additional evidence submitted by Sibhat clearly could have been presented before the immigration judge, we find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in declining to remand the case. <em>See Obioha v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 400, 408 (4th Cir.2005) (setting forth standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-17\"> Sibhat does not challenge the denial of his request for protection under the Convention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Against Torture in his petition for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
