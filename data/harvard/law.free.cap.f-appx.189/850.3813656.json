The district court found that the proper vehicle for Dukes\u2019 claims was a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, and noted that Dukes could not file a \u00a7 2241 petition under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause to avoid the AED-PA\u2019s rules restricting the filing of successive \u00a7 2255 motions. On appeal, Dukes argues that the trial court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition because his sentence of 324 months\u2019 imprisonment was imposed under a sentencing system that is unconstitutional under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and he should not be barred from obtaining relief because he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the conduct considered to enhance his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363,1365. When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from this Court before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255; <em>In re Blackshire, </em>98 F.3d 1293, 1293 (11th Cir.1996). The \u201csavings clause\u201d in \u00a7 2255, however, permits a prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. The burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy rests with the movant. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">The restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause, and, consequently, a petitioner who has filed and been denied a previous \u00a7 2255 motion may not circumvent the AEDPA\u2019s successive-motion rule simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). The savings clause only applies when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244; <em>see also Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365-66 (applying the three-part <em>Wofford </em>test).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">In the context of a \u00a7 2241 petition, \u201cactual innocence\u201d refers to a defendant\u2019s actual innocence of the crime of conviction. <em>See Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). A petitioner can only establish actual innocence once the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 has been applied to \u201copen a portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">The district court did not err in this case by dismissing Dukes\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition because \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause does not apply. Dukes\u2019 claim centers on <em>Booker. </em>Dukes failed to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test as we have held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number><em>Booker </em>is not retroactively available on collateral review. <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 868 (11th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 312, 163 L.Ed.2d 269 (2005). Because Dukes did not satisfy the first prong with regard to his claim, we need not address the remaining prongs. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244-45 (\u201c[T]he only sentencing claims that may conceivably be covered by the savings clause are those based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision overturning circuit precedent.\u201d). Because Dukes never \u201copened the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding, he cannot raise his claim that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the conduct considered to enhance his sentence. Therefore, the district court did not err by dismissing Dukes\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
