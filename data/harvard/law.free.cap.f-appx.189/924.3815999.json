Avila asserts his sentence is unreasonable because the district court refused to forego the application of the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, by downwardly departing or sentencing him outside of the advisory Guidelines range. He asserts the proper base offense level was 32, based on his guilty plea to 250 pieces of crack cocaine, rather than 34, as the presentence investigation report noted, or 37, as the court found under the career offender provision. Avila further maintains that, post-<em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the advisory Guidelines do not require the district court to apply the career offender provision. He asserts application of the career offender provision was unwarranted because the offense level under that provision over-represented his \u201cactual culpability,\u201d and, further, his prior offenses were minor, especially considering the armed robbery occurred more than 15 years ago. We conclude Avila\u2019s sentence is reasonable, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-19\">We review final sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. Following <em>Booker, </em>in imposing a sentence, the district court must first accurately calculate the defendant\u2019s Guidelines range and second consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine a reasonable sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 786. In determining whether a sentence is reasonable, the district court should be guided by the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). Those factors include, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense, (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant, (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to afford adequate deterrence, and to protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and (4) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar histories who have committed similar conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). However, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">A district court\u2019s decision to classify a defendant as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). <em>Booker </em>\u201cdid not alter the standard by which we review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-5\">A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). \u201c[I]f the offense level for a career offender from the table in [\u00a7 4B1.1] is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the table in [\u00a7 4B1.1] shall apply. A career offender\u2019s criminal history category in every case under this subsection shall be Category VI.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). According to the table in \u00a7 4B1.1, if the statutory maximum for the offense is life imprisonment, the base offense level is 37. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">With regard to the district court\u2019s Guidelines range calculation, the court did not err in determining Avila qualified as a career offender, which resulted in a base offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI. Avila was convicted of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(iii), a controlled substance offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The mandatory maximum term of imprisonment under Avila\u2019s statute of conviction is life. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Avila had prior felony convictions for armed robbery and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. In fact, Avila admitted at sentencing those prior convictions satisfied the requirements of the career offender provision. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). It is undisputed Avila was over 18 years\u2019 old at the time he committed the instant offense. <em>See id. </em>Thus, the district court correctly calculated Avila\u2019s Guidelines range and applied the career offender provision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">With regard to the reasonableness of Avila\u2019s sentence in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Avila argues the district court should not have applied the career offender designation because it over-represented his criminal history, as his prior offenses were minor and at least one occurred more than 15 years ago. Here, the court carefully considered Avila\u2019s criminal history and found that, \u201c[w]ith that type of a pattern, the [c]ourt really can\u2019t find that his career offender designation ... significantly over represents his actual criminal activity and his actual convictions. He\u2019s established a pattern going back almost 20 years.\u201d Furthermore, Avila does not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>tend the district court failed entirely to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We conclude the court\u2019s application of the career offender provision did not over-represent Avila\u2019s criminal history.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">The district court correctly calculated Avila\u2019s applicable Guidelines range, and we agree with the district court that Avila\u2019s 262-month sentence (at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range and below the statutory maximum of life) \u201cis sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of sentencing as set forth in the statute, considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, including the advisory guidelines.\u201d We conclude Avila\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-10\">. Nonetheless, Avila asserts the district court should not have applied the career offender provision, but, instead, should have applied a base offense level of 32, as opposed to 34, because he pled guilty to 250 pieces of crack cocaine. Because, as explained above, the district court did not err in applying the career offender provision, Avila\u2019s argument concerning an applicable base offense level of 32 rather than 34 is moot. Moreover, to the extent Avila contends the district court erred in failing to grant his request for a downward departure on the grounds his career offender designation over-represented his criminal history, this Court is without jurisdiction to review that finding because the district court understood its authority to make such a decision. <em>See Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1245-46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b949-16\">. Avila also contends his sentence is unreasonable because the Guidelines support a 100 to 1 ratio between sentences for convictions involving crack cocaine and those involving powder cocaine, which resulted in a disparity in Avila's sentence. However, the 100 to 1 ratio does not render a sentence unreasonable. The 100 to 1 ratio is mandated by Congress, contemplated by the Guidelines, and this Court has found it appropriate. See <em>United States v. Byse, </em>28 F.3d 1165, 1171 n. 9 (11th Cir.1994); see <em>also </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii), (iii); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) (establishing different penalties for offenses involving cocaine powder and cocaine base).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
