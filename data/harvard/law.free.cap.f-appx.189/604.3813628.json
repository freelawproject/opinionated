Although petitioner challenges the Immigration Judge\u2019s finding that the children may not be petitioner\u2019s, the Immigration Judge made the alternate holding that: \u201cAssuming that they are [petitioner\u2019s children], the Court finds that the petitioner, nevertheless, has not met her burden in establishing exceptional and extremely unusual hardship would result to those two children.\u201d Therefore, even if we held in petitioner\u2019s favor on her due process argument, she would still lose her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-17\">Accordingly, we conclude that petitioner has failed to raise a colorable constitutional claim to invoke our jurisdiction over this petition for review under the REAL ID Act, Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, 119 Stat. 231 (2005). <em>See Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). We dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction because we lack jurisdiction to review the Immigration Judge\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioner did not demonstrate that his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir. 2005); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-18\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-19\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b627-20\">PREGERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AuJ7\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b627-21\">I dissent. This case, and the sixty-four others like it filed today, will have an adverse effect on children born in the United States whose parent/parents are illegal immigrants. When a parent is denied cancellation of removal, the government effectively deports the United States-born children of that parent. This unconscionable result violates due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>because circumstances will force children to suffer de facto expulsion from the country of their birth or forego their constitutionally protected right to remain in this country with their family intact. <em>See, e.g., Moore v. City of E. Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 503-05, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) (plurality opinion) (\u201cOur decisions establish that the Constitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely because the institution of the family is deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d); <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972) (recognizing that \u201c[t]he integrity of the family unit has found protection in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Furthermore, as a nation we should recognize that many children born of illegal immigrants serve and have served with honor and distinction in our military forces, and many have laid down their lives on the altar of freedom.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
