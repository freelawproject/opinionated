No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">Defendant pled guilty to his participation as a crewmember of a boat that transported over four tons of cocaine on three separate trips. Defendant argues that the district court should have applied a two-level minor role reduction to his offense level, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). He contends that he was a mere crewman-machinist on the boat, that he was neither an owner nor a distributor of the drugs, and that he did not know the destination of the drugs. He characterizes his role in the offenses as that of a \u201cnautical mule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-16\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s determinations about a defendant\u2019s role in an offense. <em>See United States v. Ryan, </em>289 F.3d 1339, 1348 (11th Cir.2002). The defendant bears the burden of establishing a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-17\">Sentencing courts should consider two principles when determining the defendant\u2019s role in the offense: \u201cfirst, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 940 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(ien </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>The district court committed no clear error in determining that Defendant\u2019s role in the offense was not minor. Defendant\u2019s sentence was based only on the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable at sentencing: his being a crewmember on a boat that transported over four tons of cocaine on three separate trips. Defendant admitted that he operated the boat\u2019s motor on these trips. And the district court correctly pointed to the large drug quantity in denying the minor role reduction. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943 (amount of drugs imported is \u201cmaterial consideration\u201d in assessing defendant\u2019s role in his relevant conduct). Under these facts, we need not proceed to the second <em>De Varon </em>inquiry. <em>See id. </em>at 945 (recognizing that first inquiry may, in many cases, be dispositive). We see no error in the district court\u2019s refusal to apply a minor role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
