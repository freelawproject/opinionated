Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-25\">Counsel for Murdock has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>in which he states there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but presents for this court\u2019s review the issue of the propriety of Murdock\u2019s prison sentence. Although notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Murdock has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Murdock admitted the substance of the conduct that violated the terms of his supervised release, so there was an adequate basis for revocation. The court considered the statutory maximum, the advisory guideline range, and Murdock\u2019s history of violations, and imposed a sentence of twelve months, at the top of the advisory range. We have reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs and find no reversible error in Murdock\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the revocation of Murdock\u2019s supervised release and the resulting term of imprisonment. This court requires that counsel inform Murdock, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Murdock requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Murdock.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
