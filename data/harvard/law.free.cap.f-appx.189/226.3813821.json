We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Credibility determinations of the immigration judge and the Board are entitled to deference as long as they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Based upon the materials before us on appeal, the immigration judge\u2019s decision, and the Board\u2019s order, we find the evidence supports the Board\u2019s and the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Xu was not credible. Accordingly, Xu\u2019s challenge to the denial of her application for withholding from removal must fail. We further uphold the determination that Xu\u2019s asylum application was frivolous. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.20(2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b248-17\"> Xu did not challenge the immigration judge\u2019s finding that her asylum claim was statutorily barred as untimely either here or before the Board. Further, she raised no specific claim regarding the Convention Against Torture before the Board. Thus, these claims fail for lack of exhaustion, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000) (\"A court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right\u201d); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert, denied, </em>543 U.S. 1049, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005) (holding that the court lacks jurisdiction to consider an argument that was not raised before the Board), and as abandoned in this court, <em>see Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (holding failure to raise specific issue in opening brief constitutes abandonment of that issue under Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
