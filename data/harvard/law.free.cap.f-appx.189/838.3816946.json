On appeal, Cortes Pinz\u00f3n argues that the district court erred (1) in denying him a mitigating-role adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, and (2) by imposing an unreasonable sentence, one greater than those received by similarly situated defendants, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">\n<em>I. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 mitigating-role adjustment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\"><em>\u201cPost-Booker, </em>we continue to review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines just as we did <em>pre-Booker.\u201d United States v. Ellis, </em>419 F.3d 1189, 1192 (11th Cir.2005). We require the district court \u201cto calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThis Court has long and repeatedly held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, ... it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two points if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant is a minor participant if he is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but [his] role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.5). The Sentencing Guidelines also permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by four points if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a). A defendant is a minimal participant if he is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">In determining whether a mitigating-role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 940. Regarding the first prong, we have stated that \u201cthe district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn other words, the district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. Under the first prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>test, we explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-10\">[i]n the drug courier context, examples of some relevant factual considerations include: amount of drugs, fair market value of drugs, amount of money to be paid to the courier, equity interest in the drugs, role in planning the criminal scheme, and role in the distribution. This is not an exhaustive list, nor does it suggest that any one factor is more important than another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 945. Nonetheless, we noted that \u201cbecause the amount of drugs in a courier\u2019s possession \u2014 whether very large or very small \u2014 may be the best indication of the magnitude of the courier\u2019s participation in the criminal enterprise, we do not foreclose the possibility that amount of drugs may be dispositive \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 in the extreme case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">As for the second prong, we have stated that \u201cthe district court may also measure the defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to that of other participants in the relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. In assessing a defendant\u2019s relevant culpability, we have concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">[f|irst, the district court should look to other participants only to the extent that they are identifiable or discernable from the evidence. This is a fact-intensive inquiry. Second, the district court may consider only those participants who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant. The conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.... Simply put, a defendant is not automatically entitled to a minor role adjustment merely because [he] was somewhat less culpable than the other discernable participants. Rather, the district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not clearly err when it denied Cortes Pinz\u00f3n a mitigating-role reduction because (1) he was held accountable only for the quantity of cocaine related to his role in the offense; (2) the court found his role, which included monitoring the vessel\u2019s plug and throwing bales off the vessel before apprehension, to be significant and critical to the criminal enterprise; and (3) he faded to produce any evidence in support of his mitigating role. <em>See De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 941, 943. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">\n<em>II. Booker</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">We review sentences imposed under the post <em>-Booker </em>advisory Guideline scheme for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 260-63, 125 S.Ct. at 765-66 (holding that appellate court review sentences for unreasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors). Following the <em>Booker </em>decision, we have held that the district court must first correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s advisory Guideline range, and then, using the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court can impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as it is reasonable. <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">Our review for reasonableness is deferential. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cWe must evaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a). In our evaluation of a sentence for reasonableness, we recognize that there is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-12\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>parities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 786; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We also have noted that \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">In <em>United States v. Scott, </em>we held that a district court\u2019s statement that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors alone is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences to indicate that it considered the factors. 426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005). We have held \u201cthat nothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329. We have concluded that the defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable because the district court accurately calculated the Guideline range and the defendant\u2019s sentence at the low end of the range reflected the court\u2019s consideration of his evidence in mitigation. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">In the instant case, we conclude from the record that the district court imposed a reasonable sentence. First, the district court correctly calculated the Guideline range. <em>See Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178. Second, the district court, in sentencing Cortes Pinz\u00f3n to a low-end Guideline sentence took into consideration the statutory 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although the district court did not explicitly discuss each statutory factor, it was not required to do so. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329. Third, the district court applied the Guidelines in an advisory fashion. Because, based on our review of the record, Cortes Pinzon\u2019s sentence was reasonable, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Based on our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm Cortes Pinzon\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
