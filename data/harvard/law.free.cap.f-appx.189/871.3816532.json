He was sentenced to 135 months imprisonment and appeals the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Waugh contends that the record is ambiguous regarding whether the district court recognized that it had authority to depart downward from the guidelines range based on Waugh\u2019s medical condition, and thus, we should remand the case for resentencing. He relies on our decision in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Valencia, </em>148 F.3d 1273, 1274 (11th Cir.1998) for the proposition that a district court must clearly state on the record whether it believed it had authority to depart downward.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a downward departure unless the court incorrectly believed that it lacked authority to grant the departure. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). We have noted that \u201cit would facilitate review if sentencing judges would state on the record that they believe they have or do not have the authority to depart,\u201d <em>Sanchez-Valencia, </em>148 F.3d at 1274, but we have never said that such a statement is required. Instead, we have held that \u201cwhen nothing in the record indicates otherwise, we assume the sentencing court understood it had authority to depart downward.\u201d <em>United States v. Chase, </em>174 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir.1999). In this case, the district court did have authority to depart downward because while physical impairment is a discouraged basis for departure, an extraordinary physical impairment may warrant departure. United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5H1.4 (2000); <em>United States v. DeVegter, </em>439 F.3d 1299,1306 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The district court did not believe it lacked authority to depart downward based on Waugh\u2019s illness, and so we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision denying the departure. The court stated that Waugh\u2019s sickle cell anemia is not \u201csomething that would require a downward departure on the basis of illness.\u201d This indicates that the court understood it had authority to depart on the basis of illness, but believed that Waugh\u2019s illness did not warrant departure. Likewise, contrary to Waugh\u2019s contention, the court\u2019s statement that it did not believe Waugh\u2019s sickle cell anemia was a \u201cbasis for a downward departure\u201d does not reveal ambiguity as to whether the court believed it had authority to depart. That statement came after the court explained that Waugh\u2019s condition is common in the federal prison system and that he could be properly cared for in prison. Read in context, the statement shows that the court did not believe that Waugh\u2019s condition merited departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Because nothing in the record indicates otherwise, we will assume that the district court understood it had authority to depart downward. <em>Chase, </em>174 F.3d at 1195. Thus, we affirm Waugh\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
