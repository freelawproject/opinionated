The Presentence Report recommended a guidelines range of 84 to 105 months for the \u00a7 846 violation and a consecutive mandatory minimum of 60 months for the \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) violation. The district court sentenced Statts to an 84-month term of imprisonment for the \u00a7 846 violation and a consecutive 60-month term for the \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">On appeal, Statts primarily argues that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court improperly admitted the grand jury testimony of an unavailable witness during his sentencing. Relying on <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), Statts contends that the Confrontation Clause should apply to the district court\u2019s consideration of this evidence. In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission at trial of testimonial statements that are not subject to cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 50-51, 124 S.Ct. 1354. We conclude that Statts\u2019 position is without merit. <em>See United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Crawford </em>did not make the Confrontation Clause applicable at sentencing); <em>United States v. Roche, </em>415 F.3d 614, 618 (7th Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Luciano, </em>414 F.3d 174, 179 (1st Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>413 F.3d 239, 243-44 (2d Cir. 2005) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Additionally, Statts argues that he is entitled to resentencing because the district court considered this grand jury testimony in determining the relevant drug quantity under the guidelines without inquiring whether it bore sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d <em>United States v. Uwaeme, </em>975 F.2d 1016, 1021 (4th Cir.1992). Contrary to Statts\u2019 position, it is apparent from the record that the district court, in fact, discounted the estimation of drug quantity from the grand jury testimony by noting that it was \u201cout of bounds.\u201d J.A. 136. Also, Statts stipulated to the relevant drug quantity in his plea agreement and confirmed this stipulation during his plea hearing. Moreover, the district court heard ample evidence from other live witnesses to support its factual findings on the relevant drug quantity. Given Statts\u2019 own stipulation and the additional evidence supporting this stipulation, we conclude that the district court did not err in determining the relevant drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Finally, Statts claims that he is entitled to resentencing because his sentence is unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We have held that \u201ca sentence within the properly calculated Guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, properly calculated and considered the guideline range, and weighed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Statts has failed to rebut the presumption that the sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
