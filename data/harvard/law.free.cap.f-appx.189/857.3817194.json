We understand Jessie McDaniel to raise three related but distinct arguments: first, that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony of Dr. Emily Ward as an expert witness; second, that the district court\u2019s ruling should be reversed upon <em>de novo </em>review because Dr. Ward\u2019s allegedly inadmissible expert testimony was an essential basis for the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendants; and third, in the alternative, that Dr. Ward\u2019s testimony was inadmissible as hearsay to the extent it was factual rather than expert evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">We agree with Jessie McDaniel that Dr. Ward\u2019s testimony is properly understood as expert testimony. But even if, as such, its admission constituted an erroneous abuse of discretion, we may not reverse the district court\u2019s related evidentiary ruling unless it resulted in \u201csubstantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Conroy v. Abraham Chev.-Tampa, Inc., </em>375 F.3d 1228, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). The only prejudice allegedly suffered by Jessie McDaniel was the district courts\u2019s reliance upon Dr. Ward\u2019s testimony in considering Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. That testimony, however, did no more than confirm the otherwise unrefuted results of an autopsy conducted by Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences. Having presented no substantial evidence of his own, Jessie McDaniel cannot successfully claim that he suffered prejudice from the admission or consideration of Dr. Ward\u2019s merely corroborative testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">This same logic also explains why we cannot reverse the district court\u2019s summary judgment upon <em>de novo </em>review. The only basis for that request is the district court\u2019s admission and use of Dr. Ward\u2019s testimony \u2014 which, again, simply confirmed an otherwise uncontradicted finding on one of a number of questions (the cause of Roger\u2019s death) at issue in this case. It is therefore impossible that, had Dr. Ward\u2019s expert testimony been excluded, a genuine issue of material fact would have remained to preclude summary judgment. Accordingly, the decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
