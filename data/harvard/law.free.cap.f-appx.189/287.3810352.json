The district court originally imposed a total sentence of seventy-eight months in prison: eighteen months on one of the wire fraud counts and a consecutive sixty months on the remaining twenty-six counts. Ebersole appealed his convictions and sentence. We affirmed Ebersole\u2019s convictions, but vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing, concluding that, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Ebersole\u2019s sentence violated the Sixth Amendment, and that the sentence enhancement for abuse of a position of trust was improper \u201cin the present circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Ebersole, </em>411 F.3d 517, 534 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1142,163 L.Ed.2d 1003 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-25\">Upon remand, the district court sentenced Ebersole to a total of sixty-three months in prison: concurrent sixty month terms on the wire fraud counts and concurrent three-month terms on the false claims counts to be served consecutively to the wire fraud counts. Ebersole timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-26\">Ebersole argues that his sentence following <em>Booker </em>violates his due process rights, as informed by ex post facto principles. This claim is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Ebersole\u2019s sentence. We deny Ebersole\u2019s motions to remand or to file a supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
