Barker pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000), and distribution of more than 500 grams of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(l)(2000). The district court sentenced Barker to 175 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. The district court also announced an alternate sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment (60 months on each count, to run consecutively). Barker filed a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration of Final Judgment Order,\u201d citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(a), arguing that there are clerical errors in the final judgment as to his alternate sentence and the description of the statutes under which he was convicted. The district court denied the motion, finding that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are inapplicable to Barker\u2019s criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-18\">While we agree with the district court that the relief sought was unavailable through Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(a), Barker\u2019s claims of clerical error could be corrected under authority of Fed. R. Crim. P. 36. We find, however, that the alternate sentence contained in the final judgment comports with the alternate sentence announced by the court at the sentencing hearing. Hence, to the extent the district court declined to amend Barker\u2019s alternate sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-19\">However, we find there is a clerical error in Barker\u2019s criminal judgment as to the description of the statutes under which he was convicted. The first page of the Judgment accurately reflects that Barker was convicted for violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846 (2000). However, on page two of the Judgment, under the Imprisonment section, it inaccurately lists the statutory violation as \u201cTitle 18 U.S.C.\u201d rather than \u201cTitle 21 U.S.C.\u201d We modify the district court\u2019s order only to direct that the clerk of the district court correct this typographical error. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crim. P. 36. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; MODIFIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
