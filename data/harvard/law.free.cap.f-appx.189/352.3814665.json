Robinson has appealed his conviction and his 262-month sentence. Robinson argues that the district court erred by admitting into evidence a detachable magazine, bearing Robinson\u2019s fingerprint, which was found with the firearm identified in the indictment. He contends that the magazine should have been excluded from evidence because its potential to prejudice the jury exceeded its probative value. Robinson further argues that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment because it is based in part on facts not found by the jury or stipulated to by Robinson. He suggests that his sentence is unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the trial court considered his use of the firearm in the armed robbery as relevant conduct under the United States Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">We conclude that the admission of the magazine into evidence was within the broad discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>355 F.3d 358, 361 (5th Cir.2003). The court instructed the jury that the magazine was not an illegal weapon, and Robinson\u2019s fingerprint on the magazine is probative of the fact that Robinson possessed the firearm. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">The district court\u2019s consideration of Robinson\u2019s relevant conduct in determining the appropriate guidelines sentencing range did not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 798 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2884, 165 L.Ed.2d 908 (2006). Robinson\u2019s sentence, which is at the bottom of the properly calculated advisory sentencing guidelines range, is not unreasonable and, accordingly, it is affirmed. <em>Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554-55; <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 797-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
