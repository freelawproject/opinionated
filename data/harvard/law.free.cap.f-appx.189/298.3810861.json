In accordance with the REAL ID Act, we convert Ocloo\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition into a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order. <em>See Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1055, 163 L.Ed.2d 882 (2006); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Ocloo argues that his due process rights were violated because he was not served with the respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Even if Ocloo\u2019s assertion concerning want of service is correct, the REAL ID Act precludes us from granting relief in relation to this claim, as we may not remand Ocloo\u2019s suit to the district court. <em>See Rosales, </em>426 F.3d at 735-36; <em>New York Life Ins. Co. v. Brown, </em>84 F.3d 137, 142 (5th Cir.1996). Consequently, this claim is now moot. <em>See Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987). Ocloo\u2019s petition for review is dismissed as moot to the extent that he raises a claim concerning service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Ocloo also contends that the BIA erred in determining that his prior conviction for possession of cocaine was an aggravated felony. There is no need for us to assess the merits of this claim. The BIA\u2019s order of removal was based both on Ocloo\u2019s cocaine conviction and his felony conviction for aggravated sexual assault of a child. Ocloo does not challenge the BIA\u2019s determination that he was removable based on the latter conviction. Further, this conviction alone provides grounds for removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Ocloo\u2019s petition for review is denied to the extent that he challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that he was removable based on his cocaine conviction. All outstanding motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
