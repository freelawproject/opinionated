On appeal, Taylor argues that, because the district court did not properly consider his probable inno<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>cence, his sentence above the 180-month mandatory minimum was unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">After <em>Booker, </em>we review sentences under the advisory guideline regime for \u201cunreasonable[ness].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 765. Following the <em>Booker </em>decision, we have stated that the district court first must correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s guidelines range, then, using the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court can impose a more severe or more lenient sentence, as long as it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-6\">The relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-7\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-8\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-9\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-10\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-11\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-12\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed [treatment];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-13\">(3) the kinds of sentences available;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-14\">(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-15\">(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-16\">(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-17\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 260-61, 125 S.Ct. at 765-66. There is no requirement, however, that the district court engage in a detailed, step-by-step analysis of every factor. As we have held, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324,1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-19\">\u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence within the advisory guideline range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, but is expected to be reasonable. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d). We have held that a district court\u2019s statement that it considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences. <em>Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-20\">In the instant case, the district court accurately determined that Taylor\u2019s guidelines range was 210 to 262 months imprisonment. The district court then sentenced Taylor to 210 months, the low end of that range. Taylor argues that the district court failed to consider evidence that Taylor was innocent when sentencing him. Taylor asserts that the district court should have sentenced him to the 180-month mandatory minimum because of residual doubt about his guilt. Taylor introduced some evidence that the firearm in question belonged to another man, Yusuf Armstead, although the evidence was not subject to cross-examination. The district court noted that Taylor had made this argument to the jury at trial and they had rejected it. Although Taylor had suggested the possibility of new evidence, the district court obviously did not find it sufficiently persuasive to depart from the jury\u2019s finding. The judge stated that \u201cone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>of the things I have got to do is honor the findings of the jury.\u201d The district court then stated that it would not depart downward from the guidelines range because of Taylor\u2019s \u201csubstantial\u201d criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">In this case, the district court explicitly stated that it took the \u00a7 3553(a) factors into account, and would not depart from the guidelines range because of Taylor\u2019s criminal history. Nothing in the record suggests that the district court did not take into consideration Taylor\u2019s argument of possible innocence. However, the district court declined to depart downward because of Taylor\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Because (1) the district court does not have to explain its consideration of every \u00a7 3553(a) factor, and (2) because the court specifically cited Taylor\u2019s extensive criminal history as the reason for sentencing within the guidelines range, Taylor\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b946-18\">.
