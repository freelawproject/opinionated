Before this court is Williams\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>appeal and a joint motion to remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Williams argues the sentence imposed violates her Sixth Amendment rights under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and challenges the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines as mandatory. Because she objected at sentencing based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Williams has preserved the constitutional issue. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 415 (4th Cir.2006). For the reasons set forth below, we grant the motion to remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">As calculated by the probation officer and adopted by the district court, Williams\u2019 base offense level was six. <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(2) (2003) (\u201cUSSG\u201d). This was increased six levels, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(D) (2003), because the total loss attributable to Williams was $63,788.65. Williams\u2019 offense level was then raised two levels for abuse of trust. USSG \u00a7 3B1.3 (2003). After a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Williams\u2019 total offense level was twelve. USSG \u00a7 3El.l(a) (2003). This, coupled with a criminal history category I, yielded a sentencing range of ten to sixteen months\u2019 imprisonment. USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A (2003) (sentencing table).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">We first find the district court did not commit Sixth Amendment error in sentencing Williams. A Sixth Amendment error occurs when the district court imposes a sentence greater than the maximum permitted based on facts found by a jury or admitted by the defendant. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. To ascertain whether the defendant\u2019s sentence violated her Sixth Amendment rights <em>post-Booker, </em>this court employs the defendant\u2019s \u201cguideline range based on the facts he admitted before adjusting that range for acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005). Williams conceded a total loss of $12,634. Thus, according to Williams\u2019 own admission, her base offense level is ten. USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(C) (2003) (requiring a four-level increase for total loss greater than $10,000). Assuming a category I criminal history, Williams\u2019 sentencing range would be six to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A. As Williams\u2019 sentence does not exceed the maximum sentence authorized by the facts she admitted, there is no Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">We next address the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines as mandatory; because Williams preserved the issue by objecting below, we review for harmless error. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 268, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d at 416. \u201c[T]he burden is on the government to prove that the district court would not have imposed a lesser sentence if it had known that the Guidelines were not mandatory.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>445 F.3d 724, 741 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">We conclude that the Government has not carried its burden. The sentencing transcript reveals that the district court explicitly relied on the minimum term authorized by the calculated guidelines range as the controlling factor in determining Williams\u2019 sentence. Though the district court did not sentence Williams to the lowest sentence available under the guidelines, its comments indicate that the minimum term was the baseline consideration for its ultimate sentencing determination. Even though the twelve-month sentence falls within the proper guidelines range, the district court was laboring under the mistaken view that the guidelines range was ten to sixteen months. Had the district court faced the proper guidelines range of six to twelve months, it seems likely that the district court would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>have imposed a twelve-month sentence\u2014 the top end of the range. Accordingly, we grant the motion to remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
