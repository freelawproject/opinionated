On appeal, Pearson argues that his court-appointed defense counsel, Monica T. Myles, knew of his mental incapacity but failed to request a mental evaluation before advising him to plead guilty. He also argues that Myles prevented him from being able to withdraw his guilty plea. The district court held that Pearson failed to state a claim because Myles did not act under color of state law in her capacity as his defense counsel. Pearson does not address the district court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). <em>Leal v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Coir., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001). Section 1915A of the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) provides that \u201c[t]he court shall review, before docketing, if feasible or, in any event, as soon as practicable after docketing, a complaint in a civil action in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a). Upon review, the court is to identify cognizable claims, or dismiss the complaint or portions thereof that are frivolous, malicious, fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seek monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b). A complaint fails to state a claim when it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff could prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief. <em>See Brower v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number><em>County of Inyo, </em>489 U.S. 593, 598, 109 S.Ct. 1378, 1382, 103 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">\u201cIn order to prevail on a civil rights action under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show that he or she was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). \u201c[S]tate action requires <em>both </em>an alleged constitutional deprivation \u2018caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State or by the rule of conduct imposed by the State or by a person for whom the State is responsible,\u2019 <em>and </em>that \u2018the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Patrick v. Floyd Med. Ctr., </em>201 F.3d 1313, 1315 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis in original) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">\u201c[A] public defender does not act under color of state law when performing a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 453, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981). Because Myles was performing traditional lawyer functions in her representation of Pearson, she was not acting under color of state law. Therefore, Pearson has no \u00a7 1983 cause of action against Myles in connection with her representation of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Upon review of the record and consideration of Pearson\u2019s brief, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-9\">. Pearson's motion to submit a new brief is DENIED. Pearson does not offer any facts, changes in law, or additional arguments which would render a new brief necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
