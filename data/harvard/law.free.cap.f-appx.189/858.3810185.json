The hearing focused on the following issues, as presented in appellant\u2019s request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-15\">1. Whether the Local Education Agency\u2019s (\u201cLEA\u201d) decision to utilize a harness to secure the student in her bus seat violated her and her parents\u2019 right to a free appropriate public education (\u201cFAPE\u201d);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-16\">2. Whether the student was entitled to an Independent Educational Evaluation (\u201cIEE\u201d), and whether the LEA violated federal or state law regarding appellant\u2019s request for an IEE for the student;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-17\">3. Whether the LEA violated the student\u2019s right to privacy under federal and state law when the student\u2019s bus driver described problems she was having with a ten-year-old autistic girl on her bus at a meeting of the Jefferson County Board of Education, to a newspaper reporter, and to a television reporter; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-19\">4. Whether the LEA violated the IDEA and the Aabama Administrative Code by failing to obtain prior written consent from appellant prior to an observation of the student by Mary Paris, an Autistic Spectrum Specialist employed by the LEA, in the school setting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-20\">After hearing the evidence adduced with respect to these issues, the due process hearing officer, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), handed down a decision adverse to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-21\">Following this decision, appellant brought this law suit in the district court, seeking review of the ALJ\u2019s decision pursuant to the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. After appellant filed a second amended complaint, the parties joined issue, and appellee moved the court for summary judgment. Based on the entire administrative record and the parties\u2019 submissions, the district court concluded that the issues appellant had raised lacked merit and therefore gave appellee summary judgment. <em>See </em>Memorandum Opinion dated November 29, 2005. Appellant now appeals. Her brief presents these arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-22\">1. The district court failed to apply the standard of review mandated by <em>Hendrick Hudson Central Sch. Disk v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-23\">2. The district court erred in finding that appellee\u2019s unilateral decision to utilize a harness and strap the student into her seat without reconvening the IEP process or obtaining parental input violated the student\u2019s and her parents\u2019 rights to FAPE;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-24\">3. The district court erred in holding that LEA\u2019s response to appellant\u2019s request for an IEE addressing the student\u2019s be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>havioral needs complied with IDEA and the Alabama Administrative Code and thus did not deny the student a FAPE;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-4\">4. The district court erred in holding that the LEA did not violate the IDEA and the Alabama Administrative Code by failing to obtain appellant\u2019s prior written consent before having the student evaluated by an autism specialist in the school setting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-5\">5. The district court erred in finding that the LEA did not violate appellant\u2019s (and the student\u2019s) right to privacy under the IDEA by allowing its employee to discuss the student\u2019s behavioral problems during a public school board meeting and with the local news media;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACh\">6. The district court erroneously shifted to appellant the Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 burden of production on appellant\u2019s claims under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Rehabilitation Act, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-8\">7. The district court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s claims against Staggs and Darrow as alleged in Count II of the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">We have considered these arguments in full, and find them meritless for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-12\">. The Memorandum Opinion did not address the sixth and seventh arguments. Our review of the record, however, convinces us that they are meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
