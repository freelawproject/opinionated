The IJ rejected Tjie\u2019s application for asylum as untimely and denied his applications for withholding of removal and for relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-19\">We lack jurisdiction to review Tjie\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s rejection of his asylum application as time-barred. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(D), (a)(3); <em>see also Sokolov v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 566, 568-69 (7th Cir.2006). Although the REAL ID Act retroactively restored this court\u2019s jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law regarding final orders of removal in many circumstances where such review otherwise would be barred, the determination whether a \u201cchange in circumstances\u201d or \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d justified Tjie\u2019s failure to file his asylum application in a timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>manner does not involve such a constitutional claim or legal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We will uphold the finding that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal or relief under the CAT if that finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir. 2005). When the BIA has summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, as here, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 594 (5th Cir.2006). The substantial evidence standard requires that the agency decision be based on the record evidence and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, 78 </em>F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir. 1996). Under this standard, the IJ\u2019s determination will be affirmed unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Tjie has not established that the evidence compels a conclusion that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be persecuted if returned to Indonesia. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138-39 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344. Although Tjie testified that he and his mother and father were robbed and attacked by ethnic Indonesian Muslims in 2001, he has not established that this isolated incident, which the IJ determined was motivated primarily by robbery, amounted to past persecution or demonstrated a clear probability that Tjie would be subjected to persecution if returned to Indonesia. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 187-88 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Abdel-Masieh v. United States INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 583-84 (5th Cir. 1996). Tjie is correct that his claim may be based solely on his own oral testimony. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). The IJ did not err, however, by noting that he had provided no supporting documentation, because this observation was made in conjunction with a determination that Tjie\u2019s testimony, while credible, was insufficiently detailed and consistent by itself to support his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Tjie also has failed to show that the IJ\u2019s determination that he was not entitled to CAT relief was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344. The evidence did not reflect that it was more likely than not that Tjie would be subjected to torture upon a return to Indonesia. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
