Appellant sued Mr. McGinnis\u2019s employer, Arco Pipe Line, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). She sought to recover benefits she claims were due under his work-related accidental death benefits plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Arco Pipe Line.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-23\">The parties agree that the Plan provides benefits only if the employee was \u201cat work.\u201d The issue presented in this appeal is whether Mr. McGinnis should be considered \u201cat work\u201d while he was com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>muting home. The underlying facts are not in dispute. Whether the phrase \u201cat work\u201d as used in the Plan includes a commute home raises a pure question of law. Our review is <em>de novo. See Nickel v. Estate of Estes, </em>122 F.3d 294, 298 (5th Cir.1997). We conclude that Mr. McGinnis was not \u201cat work\u201d at the time of his death, and we therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment against Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">A benefits handbook given to employees explicitly provides, \u201cThe plan won\u2019t pay a benefit for any death that ... occurs while you\u2019re commuting between your home and your regular place of work.\u201d In \u201cERISA parlance,\u201d an \u201cemployee benefits handbook [is] a \u2018Summary Plan Description\u2019 (SPD).\u201d <em>Sunbeam-Oster Co. Group Benefits Plan for Salaried &amp; Non-Bargaining Hourly Employees v. Whitehurst, </em>102 F.3d 1368, 1370 (5th Cir.1996). We have held that SPDs are binding. <em>See Hansen v. Continental Ins., </em>940 F.2d 971, 982 (5th Cir. 1991). Therefore, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the term \u201cat work\u201d is ambiguous, and that it might include a commute home, the benefits handbook resolves any ambiguity in the Plan itself. Under the benefits handbook, Mr. McGinnis was not \u201cat work\u201d within the meaning of the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Appellant resists this conclusion by arguing that Mr. McGinnis meets the definition of \u201con duty\u201d contained within certain Department of Transportation regulations. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.2. Setting aside potential differences between the concepts of \u201cat work\u201d and \u201con duty,\u201d the definition of \u201con duty\u201d in those regulations does not govern the Plan. The \u201con duty\u201d concept is delineated for the purposes of hours-of-service regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation, not for death benefits plans. <em>See generally </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Because Mr. McGinnis was commuting home rather than \u201cat work\u201d when he died, the district court correctly concluded that he was not entitled to death benefits under the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, this Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
