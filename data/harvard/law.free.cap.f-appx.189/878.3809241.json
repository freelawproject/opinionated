He argued that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional, that the district court misapplied federal law to label a prior conviction a crime of violence, and that the district court impermissibly delegated judicial powers to a probation officer. Murphy acknowledges that each of these arguments presented on appeal is controlled by our prior decisions. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b901-25\">A grand jury charged Murphy with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g), 924(e). Murphy pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement in which he reserved the right to appeal any sentence imposed. According to the stipulated facts, in February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>2005, an officer responded to a call suggesting a possible drug violation involving a green car parked at an apartment complex. Murphy told the officer that he had come out to the car to get a pair of shoes, but when the officer looked through the car\u2019s window, he saw a plastic baggie containing what appeared to be marijuana. The officer arrested Murphy for possession of marijuana. Upon searching the car, the officer detected the smell of burned marijuana and found a handgun in the front driver\u2019s side door, an ecstacy pill, and a scalpel with cocaine on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Regarding past criminal activity, Murphy conceded that he had been convicted in Florida of: (1) two instances of possession of a controlled substance; (2) possession with intent to sell a controlled substance; (3) sale of cocaine; and (4) battery on a law enforcement officer. Murphy conceded that his civil right to possess a firearm had not been restored, and the gun found in his car had traveled in interstate and foreign commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Murphy objected to, among other things, the classification of his prior offense of carrying a concealed firearm as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), codified in relevant part at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). During the sentencing hearing, he asserted that the underlying facts of the offense were that he had a handgun in his sock and that he never displayed, used, or presented the gun in a dangerous manner. The government argued that a prior conviction for carrying a concealed firearm is, under the Florida statute, a \u201cviolent felony\u201d and that the district court could not look to the underlying facts of the offense. Murphy asked the court to consider out-of-circuit authority in support of his argument; however, the court indicated that the well-settled rule of this circuit regards a prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon as a violent felony under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">The court sentenced Murphy to 180 months imprisonment. Additionally, the court imposed a five-year term of supervised release, which included \u201cstandard condition 13.\u201d The condition stated that \u201c[a]s directed by the probation officer, the defendant shall notify third parties of risks that may be occasioned by the defendant\u2019s criminal record or personal history or characteristics and shall permit the probation officer to make such notifications and to confirm the defendant\u2019s compliance with such notification requirement.\u201d Rl-24 at 4. Murphy did not object to the imposition of standard condition 13 before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">On appeal, Murphy has raised three issues for our consideration. First, he argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) violates the Commerce Clause. Second, he argues that district court should have looked beyond the language of the Florida statute to determine whether his prior conviction was a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. Finally, he argues that standard condition 13 impermissibly delegates judicial power to the probation office.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Murphy concedes that the binding law of this circuit dictates the result in each of his three issues. We note from the outset that \u201c[o]nly the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269,1280 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations and citations omitted). We usually review constitutional issues <em>de novo; </em>however, because Murphy raises his constitutional challenge to \u00a7 922(g) for the first time on appeal, we have the discretion regarding whether to address the issue. <em>Id. </em>Despite his failure to raise his constitutional argument below, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>we will consider his arguments on appeal. \u201cWe review the terms of a supervised release for abuse of discretion, but where the defendant fails to object at the district court, we reverse only for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Nash, </em>438 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). We address Murphy\u2019s issues in the subsequent sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">A. <em>Commerce Clause and \u00a7 922(g)(1)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Murphy asserts that we should revisit the issue of whether \u00a7 922(g)(1) violates the Commerce Clause because our current precedent cannot be harmonized with recent Supreme Court analyses. He argues that the only source for federal jurisdiction over felon-in-possession cases is the inclusion of the phrase \u201cin or affecting commerce\u201d in the statute, and it is now firmly established that the Commerce Clause cannot be used to federalize criminal behavior that is typically the subject of state prosecution. He contends that, in light of the combined effect of <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598,120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), and <em>Gonzales v. Raich, </em>545 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005), it is unclear how courts should analyze \u00a7 922(g)(1). He concedes that he did not object to the statute but asserts that there is reversible plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">The Commerce Clause provides that \u201cCongress shall have the power ... [t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several [sjtates.\u201d U.S. Const, art. 1, \u00a7 8. It is unlawful for a person \u201cwho has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment\u201d for more than one year \u201cto ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). We have previously upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) in light of <em>Lopez, Jones, </em>and <em>Morrison. See Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1280. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Raich, </em>which is the only intervening Commerce Clause case, does not alter our decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result, \u00a7 922(g)(1) remains a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s legislative power, and we affirm Murphy\u2019s conviction pursuant to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">B. <em>Whether a Prior Conviction for Carrying a Concealed Firearm Is a Violent Felony Under the ACCA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">Murphy next argues that we should reconsider our prior decisions to the extent that they indicate that carrying a concealed firearm under Florida law is <em>per se </em>a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. He asserts that, similar to the Florida crime of driving under the influence, carrying a concealed firearm is not <em>per se </em>a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d He contends that the facts of the underlying offense should be considered in determining whether it was a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d and in light of <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the district court can look beyond the surface of the statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The ACCA provides that any person who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and has three previous convictions for a \u201cviolent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another,\u201d shall be imprisoned not less than 15 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The statute defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or another; or (ii) is burglary ... or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). We have determined that \u201c[cjarrying a concealed weapon is conduct that poses serious potential risk of physical injury.\u201d <em>United States v. Hall, </em>77 F.3d 398, 401 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Based our decision in <em>Hall, </em>the district court did not err in finding that Murphy\u2019s prior conviction for carrying a concealed firearm was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. While <em>Shepard </em>establishes the types of evidence a court may consider when determining whether an offense constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d when it is unclear from the face of the statute, we have held that the nature of this offense is clear from the statute at issue in this appeal. <em>See Hall, </em>77 F.3d at 401. As a result, the district court correctly applied circuit law.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">C. <em>Standard Condition 13</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Murphy argues that standard condition 13 of his supervised release is an unconstitutional delegation of judicial powers to the probation officer. He asserts that although it is unclear whether the court intended to give the probation officer as much authority as it did with regard to the condition, the wording of the condition, when compared to that of the other conditions, reveals that standard condition 13 is unlike the other conditions in that it gives the probation officer a broad range of discretion. Murphy contends that the condition either unconstitutionally delegates authority to the probation officer or that the delegation is ambiguous, in which case the rule of lenity applies in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Because Murphy did not object to the condition at the district court, we review for plain error. \u201cTo find reversible error under the plain error standard, we must conclude that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected substantial rights.\u201d <em>Nash, </em>438 F.3d at 1304 (quotations and citations omitted). \u201cIf these three criteria are met, we may reverse for plain error if it \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">\u201cTo determine if a court improperly delegated the judicial authority of sentencing, we have drawn a distinction between the delegation to a probation officer of a \u2018ministerial act or support service\u2019 and \u2018the ultimate responsibility\u2019 of imposing the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1304-05. \u201cWhere the court makes the determination of <em>whether </em>a defendant must abide by a condition ... it is permissible to delegate to the probation officer the details of where and when the condition will be satisfied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1305. In <em>Nash, </em>we considered a condition with identical language to that which Murphy now challenges and determined that the condition did not improperly delegate a judicial function to the probation officer. <em>Id. </em>at 1306. As a result, the condition is not an improper delegation of judicial function and there was no error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">Murphy appealed his conviction and 180 month sentence stemming from his guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>plea for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He argued that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional, that the district court misapplied federal law to label a prior conviction a violent felony, and that the district court impermissibly delegated judicial powers to a probation officer. Each of these arguments is controlled by our prior decisions. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-8\">. Murphy presents no substantive argument that <em>Raich </em>changes the Commerce Clause analysis for purposes of his challenge. In fact, <em>Raich </em>dealt with the issue of whether solely intrastate regulation of a federally controlled substance could be governed by state law in the face of a contrary federal statute and did not address whether \"any provision or section of the [Controlled Substances Act] amounts to an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority.\u201d <em>Raich, </em>545 U.S. at 15, 125 S.Ct. at 2204-05. Thus, <em>Raich </em>does not provide any new guidance that would help us conclude that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
