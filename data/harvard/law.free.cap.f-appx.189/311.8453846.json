More specifically, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that NCI\u2019s claims of misappropriation of corporate opportunity were unliquidated and, therefore, excluded from the eligibility analysis for Chapter 13 filings under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(e). For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">Appellee Carroll Thomas Harkness (\u201cHarkness\u201d), a former vice president for appellant NCI Buildings Systems, L.P. (\u201cNCI\u201d), filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on January 6, 2004. Prior to the bankruptcy filing, NCI had brought a state court lawsuit against Harkness alleging breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, constructive trust, embezzlement, and misappropriation of corporate opportunity. Just days before his response to NCI\u2019s summary judgment motion in state court was due, Harkness filed his bankruptcy petition, triggering the automatic stay of his state court proceedings under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">On December 29, 2004, after two previous amendments, NCI filed a proof of claim for $200,000.00 in unsecured debt and $1,188,299.97 in secured debt. 2 R. at 238; <em>see also id. </em>at 243 (describing the underlying collateral subject to constructive trust for the secured debt). The secured portion of its claim was based, inter alia, upon several alleged instances of Harkness\u2019s misappropriation of corporate opportunities that were described in supporting documents attached to the proof of claim. <em>Id. </em>at 239 (itemizing damages). Because the underlying state court action had not yet issued a ruling on NCI\u2019s motion for summary judgment at the time of Harkness\u2019s bankruptcy filing, it is undisputed that no judgment has issued with respect to NCI\u2019s tort claims of misappropriation of corporate opportunity that are the focus of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">Based on its proof of claim, NCI moved to dismiss Harkness\u2019s bankruptcy petition, arguing that Harkness was ineligible for Chapter 13 relief under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(e). Section 109(e) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzZ\">Only an individual with regular income that <em>owes, </em>on the date of the filing of the petition, noncontingent, <em>liquidated, </em>unsecured debts of less than $307,675 and noncontingent, liquidated, secured debts of less than $922,975 ... may be a debtor under chapter 13 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEE\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(e) (emphasis added). NCI contended that its misappropriation claims were liquidated because the amount of the claims was readily calculable, regardless of the fact that Harkness disputed them. Harkness filed an objection to NCI\u2019s motion to dismiss and sought to have its Chapter 13 plan confirmed by the bankruptcy court, arguing that the misappropriation claims were contingent and un-liquidated. Following a hearing, the bankruptcy court found that NCI\u2019s claims were both unliquidated and contingent and, therefore, did not render Harkness ineligible for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. In the same order, the bankruptcy court confirmed Harkness\u2019s Chapter 13 plan on March 21, 2005. Upon a subsequent motion for reconsideration, the bankruptcy court again denied NCI\u2019s request for dismissal of the Chapter 13 petition on April 21, 2005.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>ing in a Memorandum Opinion and Order on August 18, 2005. On October 20, 2005, the district court denied NCI\u2019s motion for reconsideration for the same reasons announced in its previously issued opinion. NCI timely filed its notice of appeal on November 16, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">This court has jurisdiction over the instant appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We review the district court\u2019s decisions under the same standard of review that the district court applied to the bankruptcy court\u2019s decisions. <em>See In re Amco Ins., </em>444 F.3d 690, 694 (5th Cir.2006); <em>In re Whitaker Constr. Co., </em>439 F.3d 212, 216 (5th Cir.2006). Findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, while conclusions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>See Amco Ins. ., </em>444 F.3d at 694; <em>Whitaker Constr. Co., </em>439 F.3d at 216. \u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">NCI argues that its misappropriation claims were liquidated because, although disputed by Harkness, the amounts were capable of being precisely determined based on the proof of claim and supporting documents. Citing <em>In re Visser, </em>232 B.R. 362, 365 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.1999), NCI maintains that the district court erred by not presuming the factual predicate for NCI\u2019s claims in conducting its liquidity analysis. In addition to challenging the factual bases of each alleged instance of misappropriation, Harkness responds that the claims are not susceptible to precise determination because there has been no formal evidentiary hearing or judicial decree to fix the amount in any meaningful way. Therefore, Harkness maintains that there was no legally enforceable liquidated debt at the time of his filing that would render him ineligible for Chapter 13 relief under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-13\">As the district court correctly noted, courts generally agree that a debt is liquidated if the amount of the claim is readily ascertainable, whether it is contested or not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See In re Horne, </em>277 B.R. 320, 322 (Bankr.E.D.Tex.2002) (\u201cA debt is liquidated if the amount due and the date on which it was due are fixed or certain, or when they are ascertainable by reference to (1) an agreement or (2) to a simple mathematical formula.\u201d); <em>see also In re Pulliam, </em>90 B.R. 241, 246 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.1988) (\u201cBecause Congress did not insert the term disputed in \u00a7 109(e), disputed debts must be counted in determining whether a petitioner may be a debtor under Chapter 13.\u201d). In affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling, however, the district court found that NCI\u2019s misappropriation claims were unliquidated because debts based on tort are generally unliquidated unless and until resolved by judicial decree or otherwise fixed in some meaningful way. <em>See Denham v. Shellman Grain Elevator, Inc., </em>444 F.2d 1376, 1380 (5th Cir.1971) (describing tort and quantum meruit claims as unliquidated because they \u201cby their very nature are not fixed unless and until juridical award to fix liability and amount\u201d); <em>see also 2 </em>Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 109.06[2][c] (15th ed. rev.2005) (\u201cA debt is not liquidated if there is a substantial dispute regarding liability or amount.\u201d). Based on our review of the record and the parties\u2019 arguments, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>elude that the district court did not clearly err in affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s rulings that NCI\u2019s misappropriation claims were unliquidated under \u00a7 109(e).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">We additionally note that NCI\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Visser </em>for the proposition that the district court must presume the factual predicate for NCI\u2019s claims is misplaced. Ordinarily, the bankruptcy court will not look beyond the amounts asserted by the debtor in the debtor\u2019s schedules in conducting the \u00a7 109(e) eligibility analysis, unless it finds that the schedules were not filed in good faith. <em>See </em>2 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 109.06[3] (citing <em>In re Sco-vis, </em>249 F.3d 975, 982 (9th Cir.2001)). Moreover, in <em>Visser, </em>the debtor failed to object to the creditor\u2019s proof of claim and actually admitted to the misappropriation of corporate funds underlying the creditor\u2019s claim. <em>See Visser, </em>232 B.R. at 363. In dismissing the Chapter 13 petition, the court concluded that the claim was liquidated for purposes of the eligibility determination under \u00a7 109(e) because determining the amount due on the claim did not involve the use of judgment or discretion, but rather \u201csimple arithmetic\u201d to add up the amount of money from each instance of embezzlement to determine the total amount of the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 365. In contrast, Harkness both objected to the proof of claim and contests each alleged instance of misappropriation of corporate opportunity. As a result, absent any formal evi-dentiary findings, the misappropriation claims were not susceptible to precise determination with the use of simple arithmetic. <em>See In re Pearson, </em>773 F.2d 751, 756 (6th Cir.1985) (holding that \u201cthe fact that evidence must be taken to determine the amount of the claim indicates that, until then, the claim was unliquidated\u201d for the purposes of the \u00a7 109(e) eligibility analysis). Therefore, the district court did not err in stating that NCI had not sufficiently met its burden to demonstrate that its misappropriation claims were unliqui-dated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1077-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">. As the district noted in its Memorandum Opinion and Order, the parties did not include a transcript of the bankruptcy court hearings for either the initial motion to dismiss or the motion for reconsideration in the record on appeal. 1 R. at 90-91.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">. NCI does not dispute the district court\u2019s recitation of this legal standard to determine whether the misappropriation claims were liquidated. Rather, NCI argues that the district court reached a result that conflicted with the applicable standard based on the facts underlying its proof of claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">. We also conclude that NCI\u2019s argument that the court's determination somehow created a per se rule that all tort claims not reduced to an enforceable judgment are unliquidated is wholly without merit. The district court narrowly concluded that NCI had not sufficiently proven the factual predicate for its claim, and we can locate no indication of any such broad legal pronouncement in its opinion and order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
