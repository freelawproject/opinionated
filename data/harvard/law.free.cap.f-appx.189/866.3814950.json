He argues that the court improperly found that he was a manager or supervisor even though he was pressured by drug dealers to participate in the offense by soliciting individuals to take a cruise and bring back narcotics to the United States on the return cruise. He also argues that he was not as involved in the drug scheme as the other participants, he did not exercise control or supervision over the other participants, and he was never entrusted by the drug dealers with the money or drugs that were the subject of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cguidelines\u201d) <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881, 892 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u25a0 \u2014 - U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1447, 164 L.Ed.2d 145 (2006). After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court still must calculate the guidelines range correctly, and the same standards of review apply to its calculations. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005). We review only for clear error a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">The guidelines provide that \u201c[i]f the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,\u201d the defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by three levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). In analyzing a defendant\u2019s role, the district court should consider \u201cthe exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>cised over others.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The district court did not clearly err by enhancing Harrison\u2019s sentence based on his role as a manager or supervisor. By recruiting his codefendants and assisting them in obtaining the drugs used to carry out the offense, Harrison played a managerial role in the offense and he exercised supervision over participants in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Harrison also contends that the sentence imposed by the district court was not reasonable under <em>Booker </em>review. He argues that the court failed to give adequate consideration to his mitigating personal characteristics, including the absence of a father during childhood, his father\u2019s rejection of him at age 31, and a traumatic event he suffered at age 11 when neighborhood children burned him. He states that, despite these problems, he sought to better himself through employment. Further, he argues that the district court gave insufficient weight to the disparity between his sentence and the sentence of a codefendant who was a more trusted member of the drug enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\"><em>Post-Booker, </em>we review a sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). The district court is not obligated to specifically address and analyze every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record, and district court\u2019s statement that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors alone is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). The factors in \u00a7 3553(a) include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the guidelines range; and (6) \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">The record indicates that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, including the disparity between Harrison\u2019s sentence and the sentence of his codefendant. It sentenced Harrison below the guideline range, reflecting its consideration under \u00a7 3553(a) of mitigating factors. The sentence imposed is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
