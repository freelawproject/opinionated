In criminal cases, the defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. RApp. P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that \u00a7 3582 pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>ceeding is criminal in nature and ten-day appeal period applies, citing <em>United States v. Petty, </em>82 F.3d 809, 810 (8th Cir.1996), and <em>United States v. Ono, </em>72 F.3d 101, 102-03 (9th Cir.1995)). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an extension of time to file a notice of appeal of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on its docket on May 20, 2005, <em>see </em>Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(6), and, therefore, the ten-day appeal period expired on June 6, 2005. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26 (providing that \u201cintermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays\u201d are excluded when the time period is less than eleven days). Ward states that he received a copy of the district court\u2019s order denying his motion on August 12, 2005. Ward then filed a notice of appeal, dated August 16, 2005, which the district court filed on August 19. Under <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S. Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), Ward\u2019s notice of appeal was filed outside of the thirty-day excusable neglect period.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Ward, however, asserts on appeal that because he did not receive a copy of the court\u2019s order denying his \u00a7 3582 motion, the appeal period should be extended and his notice of appeal deemed timely filed. Ward\u2019s argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Little, </em>392 F.3d 671 (4th Cir.2004), in which the court concluded that the time to appeal may not be extended in a criminal case even though the party seeking to appeal did not receive proper notice of the district court\u2019s order. <em>Id. </em>at 681-82. Because the appeal period cannot be extended based upon the failure to receive notice of an order in a criminal case, we conclude that Ward\u2019s appeal of the order denying his motion to correct sentence or modify the judgment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 is untimely filed. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
