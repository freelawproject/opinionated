We shall assume familiarity with the facts set forth in the district court\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">The district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment is subject to de novo review, with all inferences drawn in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Haulbrook v. Michelin North America, Inc., </em>252 F.3d 696, 702 (4th Cir.2001). A plaintiff asserting wrongful discharge under the ADA must demonstrate that (1) she is disabled; (2) she was otherwise qualified for her position; and (3) her discharge \u201coccurred under circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">To establish that she is otherwise qualified under the second prong, the plaintiff must show that she, \u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111. Here, as Dareangelo conceded, her position as central office technician \u201crequired her to spend ninety percent of her time on the telephone with co-workers in remote locations, discussing installation and/or provisioning of equipment.\u201d Appellant Br. at 8. Interaction with co-workers was therefore an essential function of her position. Moreover, Verizon\u2019s Code of Business Conduct directs employees to be \u201crespectful, cooperative, and helpful toward customers, suppliers, our co-workers, employees and the general public\u201d and to refrain from acting in \u201can abusive, threatening, discriminatory, harassing or obscene manner toward any employee or others with whom we come in contact during the course of business.\u201d J.A. 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">As the district court concluded, the record is replete with instances of Darcangelo\u2019s threatening, abusive, and harassing behavior toward her co-workers and supervisors in the course of performing her duties. Indeed, Dareangelo undertook egregious actions admittedly designed to provoke her co-workers and supervisors, such as walking out of meetings and hanging up on co-workers; posting a photo of her supervisor\u2019s head placed in the center of a rifle target; and aiming racially-charged terms, racial slurs, offensive lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>guage, and derogatory nicknames at her co-workers and supervisors. Darcangelo\u2019s aggressive and antagonistic behavior thus demonstrated her complete inability to interact with others in a courteous manner, as required by her position and Verizon\u2019s Code of Business Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Moreover, Darcangelo failed to show that she could perform the essential functions of her position even when given reasonable accommodation. Darcangelo\u2019s expert opined that Verizon could have limited her interactions to supervisors sympathetic to her bipolar condition. However, the ADA does not require Verizon to subject its employees to Darcangelo\u2019s abusive behavior, which, not surprisingly, created considerable anxiety within her work environment, even if that behavior was related to her bipolar disorder. <em>See Jones v. Am. Postal Workers Union Nat\u2019l, </em>192 F.3d 417, 429 (4th Cir. 1999) (\u201cThe law is well settled that the ADA is not violated when an employer discharges an individual based upon the employee\u2019s misconduct, even if the misconduct is related to a disability.\u201d (internal citations omitted)). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to grant Verizon\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
