In determining Hailey\u2019s sentence, the district court found that he qualified as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA prescribes a minimum sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. The district court, after considering the advisory sentencing guidelines and the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), imposed a sentence of 190 months\u2019 imprisonment. Hailey appeals his sentence, ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>guing that the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">On February 1, 2004, a police officer noticed Hailey in a parked car with an expired registration certificate in Southern Pines, North Carolina. When approached, Hailey admitted he was smoking marijuana. The officer also found Hailey was in possession of a firearm. A federal grand jury subsequently indicted Hailey in the Middle District of North Carolina for possessing a firearm in commerce after a felony conviction, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The federal indictment did not charge, nor did Hailey stipulate, that he was an armed career criminal under the ACCA. Hailey subsequently pled guilty to the charge of felony possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">In calculating the advisory sentencing guidelines range, the district court found that Hailey qualified as an armed career criminal, thereby enhancing Hailey\u2019s base offense level to 30 with a criminal history category of VI. A defendant qualifies as an armed career criminal if he has at least \u201cthree previous convictions ... for a violent felony or serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Hailey\u2019s offense level of 30, when combined with his criminal history category of VI, yielded an advisory sentencing guidelines range of 180 to 210 months. U.S.S.G. Sentencing Table, Ch. 5, Pt. A. The district court imposed a sentence of 190 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Prior to sentencing, Hailey objected to his qualification as an armed career criminal on two grounds: (1) that he did not have the three predicate convictions for \u201ca violent felony or serious drug offense, or both\u201d and (2) that pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), elements of the ACCA must be charged in the indictment and either found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Regarding the first objection, the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) listed Hailey\u2019s three adult convictions and noted that his predicate convictions rendered him an armed career criminal under the ACCA. The PSR identified the three predicate convictions as one felonious elude of arrest by motor vehicle and two felonious common law robberies. Hailey, however, took exception to the first of these three predicate convictions (eluding arrest by motor vehicle) on the ground that it was not a violent felony for ACCA purposes. He asserted that because the maximum sentence to which he was exposed for this conviction was only ten to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment, the conviction was not a \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">As to the second objection, Hailey argued that the indictment failed to inform him that he faced ACCA punishments because it did not (1) enumerate the predicate convictions; (2) specify whether the predicate convictions met the elements of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or \u201cserious drug offense,\u201d or (3) allege that the three prior convictions for qualifying felonies were committed on \u201coccasions different from one another.\u201d Hailey conceded at the sentencing hearing that at least two Circuits have ruled against this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">The district court overruled both of Hailey\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">Hailey now appeals his sentence, raising the same two pre-sentence objections to his ACCA enhancement. We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate conviction under 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u00a7 924(e). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>326 F.3d 535, 537 (4th Cir.2003). We also review <em>de novo </em>whether the enhancement was unconstitutionally imposed as a matter of law. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 280-81 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Under the ACCA, a \u201cviolent felony\u201d is any crime punishable for a term exceeding one year that \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). It is \u201coften a question of law whether a [prior] felony meets the statutory definition of a \u2018violent felony\u2019 \u201d because violence is often inherent in the prior crime. <em>Thompson, </em>421 F.3d at 283-84 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Hailey argues that his prior conviction for eluding arrest by motor vehicle does not qualify as a predicate conviction under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">To the contrary, Hailey\u2019s prior conviction satisfies both requirements under the ACCA. First, the crime charged (eluding arrest by motor vehicle) is punishable by a prison term exceeding one year even though Hailey was eligible to receive a sentence of only ten to twelve months imprisonment. For ACCA purposes, lengths of punishment \u201cshall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held,\u201d which in this case is North Carolina. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20); <em>see also United States v. Lender, </em>985 F.2d 151, 156 (4th Cir.1993). The relevant question is whether <em>any </em>defendant charged with the crime could receive a sentence of more than one year, not whether Hailey in particular did or could have. That is, the court must consider \u201cthe maximum <em>aggravated </em>sentence that could be imposed for that crime upon a defendant with the worst possible criminal history.\u201d <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 246 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Jones, </em>195 F.3d 205, 206-08 (4th Cir.1999)). At the time of Hailey\u2019s conviction in 2002, North Carolina law provided that felonious elude of arrest was a class H felony that carried a maximum of thirty months\u2019 imprisonment for defendants with prior criminal records. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-141.5 (1997) (speeding to elude arrest); N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(d) (1997) (felony sentencing); <em>see also State v. Funchess, </em>141 N.CApp. 302, 309, 540 S.E.2d 435, 439 (N.C.2000); <em>State v. Mullaney, </em>129 N.CApp. 506, 508, 500 S.E.2d 112, 114 (N.C.1998). Thus, the crime meets the first requirement for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The crime also meets the second requirement under the ACCA. Although it is not among the crimes enumerated in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), it satisfies the \u201cotherwise\u201d clause of this provision: the offense in abstract \u2014 speeding by motor vehicle to elude arrest \u2014 creates a serious potential risk of injury to others in the vehicle\u2019s path. It is an active crime that poses an obvious risk of injury. <em>Cf. United States v. Hairston, </em>71 F.3d 115, 118 (4th Cir.1995) (holding that felony escape from custody in North Carolina constitutes a violent felony under ACCA given that the \u201csupercharged nature of events surrounding an escape\u201d presents \u201can immediate and substantial risk that the situation will escalate\u201d to one involving physical force and/or injury) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This holding is consistent with the holdings in <em>United States v. Jones, </em>195 F.3d 205 (4th Cir.1999). <em>Accord United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242 (4th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that Hailey\u2019s prior conviction for felonious elude of ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>rest by motor vehicle qualifies as a predicate conviction under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Hailey also alleges that his ACCA sentence violates his constitutional rights under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2581,159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). Because Hailey was sentenced after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220,125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), however, he cannot establish constitutional error. Under <em>Booker, </em>there is no Sixth Amendment error when a defendant is sentenced under a non-mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 245-46, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>see also United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he use of extra-verdict enhancements in an advisory guidelines system is not unconstitutional\u201d under <em>Booker.) </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>United States v. Martins, </em>413 F.3d 139, 152 (1st Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment [under <em>Booker </em>] is not violated simply because a judge finds sentencing facts under the guidelines; rather, the error is only that the judge did so pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system.\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Antonakopoulos, </em>399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2005)). Pursuant to <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial scheme, the district court here considered the advisory guidelines range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and selected a sentence within the range that it considered reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Even if Hailey had been sentenced under a mandatory guidelines scheme, however, he could not show constitutional error under <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Shepard. </em>The Supreme Court has held that prior convictions \u2014 more precisely the fact of prior convictions \u2014 may be used to enhance sentences even if those convictions have not been found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This recidivism exception survives <em>Booker </em>intact. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>see also United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir. 2005) (\u201cIt is ... clear that the Supreme Court continues to hold that the Sixth Amendment (as well as due process) does not demand that the mere fact of a prior conviction used as a basis for sentencing enhancement be pleaded in an indictment and submitted to a jury for proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Applying this recidivism exception, we have held that ACCA enhancements are constitutional under <em>Booker. </em>Specifically, we have held that sentencing courts, in addition to considering the fact of prior convictions, can determine as a matter of law whether these convictions meet the statutory definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 283-87 (4th Cir.2005) (finding no Sixth Amendment error when judge, not jury, found that prior convictions were predicates for ACCA enhancement because \u201cfact of prior conviction[s]\u201d includes \u201cessential components\u201d of these convictions, such as date of offense and whether offense meets statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d); <em>Cheek, </em>415 F.3d at 351-53 (upholding constitutionality of ACCA enhancement). Even if Hailey had been sentenced under a mandatory guidelines scheme, he could not demonstrate constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Hailey\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>materials before the court, and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"Axv5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
