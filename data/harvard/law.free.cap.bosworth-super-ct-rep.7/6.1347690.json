Richards, Plaintiff and Appellant <em>v. </em>Robert H. Wescott and Joseph A. Hyatt, Defendants and Respondents.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b12-5\">1. Where an ordinary traveling trunk is delivered as such to expressmen, to be carried by them and left'at a designated railroad passenger depot, and it contains valuable jewelry belonging to a third person, which fact is not disclosed to them, and the trunk and all of its contents, except the jewelry, are delivered, and the jewelry is lost without their fault, they are not liable for it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b12-6\">2. The acceptance of such a trunk, on an application to receive and deliver it, is an undertaking to carry and deliver it, with the articles of personal conve\u201cnience ordinarily carried by travelers that may be contained therein, and nothing more.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b12-8\">3. To hold them responsible in such a case for the safe delivery of jewelry therein, belonging to a third person, and intended by him for sale as merchandize, would operate as a fraud on them, which the law will not sanction, though there may have been no actual intent to defraud,-in not disclosing the contents of the trunk.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b12-9\">(Before Bosworth, Oh.

This case was previously tried, and the proceedings on that trial are reported in <em>2 </em>Bosw. 589. By consent of the parties, the jury on the present trial found as facts, the same facts as were found by the jury on the former trial. The facts' as found, and the proceedings on the trial had subsequently to such finding, are stated in the case as follows, viz :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-13\">1st Ques.

Yes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-5\">2d. Did it at that time contain the jewelry in question ? A. Yes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-6\">3d. Was the trunk and jewelry delivered at the depot in New York? A.

Yes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-9\">6th. Were the contents of the trunk asked for by the defendants, or made known to them by Davis, at -the time of its delivery to them for its transportation? A. No.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-10\">7th. Is it the custom\u2018of the city express companies in general, or of the defendants\u2019 company in particular, to charge for the transportation of articles according to their value ? A. It is when articles are known to be of extra value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-11\">8th. Was the usage or rule in the above particular (if the jury shall find such to have been proved) communicated to Davis before the defendants undertook the transportation of said trunk, or was such usage known to him ? A. It was not communicated to Davis, and we have no proof that he knew it of his own knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-12\">9th. Was the trunk in question a traveler\u2019s triink, in the common meaning of that word ? A., It was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-13\">10th. Was this trunk to be delivered at the passenger depot or at the freight depot, at the city of New York? A. Passenger depot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-14\">11th. If you say that the trunk was not delivered at the depot in New York city, what became of it ? A.

A. It was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-16\">13th. Upon the arrival of the trunk in Buffalo; what were its contents, and was the jewelry in the trunk? A.

If you say, in answer to the last question, that the jewelry was not in the trunk on its arrival at Buffalo, was it lost or abstracted before or after its delivery at the wrong place in the city of New York (such place being the steamboat Isaac Newton, belonging to the People\u2019s Line,) or was it lost or abstracted before the agreement of the defendants to deliver the same in Buffalo? A. After its delivery at the wrong place, but we have no evidence or means of knowing whether lost or abstracted before or after the agreement to deliver the same in Buffalo.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-5\">15th. What was the customary charge for the transportation of a traveler\u2019s trunk from'Brooklyn to New York? A. Twenty-five cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-6\">16th.

As two distinct items.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-7\">llth. Who was the owner of the jewelry in the trunk? A. Mr. Richards, the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-8\">18th. Was the jew\u00e9lry intended for merchandise, or did it constitute a part of a traveler\u2019s equipments or baggage ? A. It was merchandise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-9\">19th. Did the defendants know that Davis had on former occasions carried jewelry in his trunk? A. No.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-10\">The defendants here rested, and their counsel \u25a0 on the above findings of fact, and on the whole case, moved for a non-suit on the following grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-11\"><em>First. </em>No allegation in complaint that trunk was - lost, without fault of the plaintiff, and the proof shows that accident may have happened through fault of plaintiff. Plaintiff\u2019s negligence was, in not telling the carrier that the trunk contained jewelry. It was delivered as a trunk of ordinary clothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-12\"><em>Second. </em>Fraud upon carrier in not disclosing contents of trunk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-13\"><em>Third. </em>A total failure of consideration between parties, no contract to <em>carry </em>jewelry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-14\"><em>Fourth. </em>Contract proved different from that in complaint; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>not a variance, but a total failure of proof. Contract alleged is to carry to city of Buffalo. Proof shows it was to carry to depot, New York. Subsequent agreement to carry to Buffalo not sustained by any consideration, or if there was, then the defendants are liable only as private carriers, and not as common carriers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-5\"><em>Fifth. </em>Contract was with DaVis to take his trunk. No contract with the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-6\"><em>Sixth. </em>That oh the facts the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-7\">And the plaintiff asked that the case go to the jury with the following instruction:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-8\">\u201cIf the jury think there was no intentional fraud practiced by Davis in delivery of the trunk, they must find for the plaintiff.\u201d Which the court refused, but granted the non-suit, and to which plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-9\">The testimony on the second trial was the same as on the first, except that some additional testimony was given by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-10\">Judgment of non-suit having been entered, the plaintiff appealed from it to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b15-11\"><em>R. A. Watkinson, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-12\">I. Plaintiff was entitled to have the case go before the jury, as a new trial had been awarded, and the question involved under the opinion of general term, and as put before the court on second trial, was one <em>o\u00ed fraud. </em>(Zabris<em>kie </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>3 Ker. 332; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Pinner, </em>18 N. Y. 297; <em>Griffin &amp; Buel v. Marquardt, </em>17 N. Y. 30.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-13\">II. The non-suit was erroneous. The first, third, fourth, and fifth grounds are insufficient; and so decided by this court in this case. (2 Bosworth R. 589.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-14\">III. The second is erroneous, because the question of fraud was not set up in the answer.' And it cannot be proven under a mere denial of receipt of goods. Nor can the court infer fraud, and remedy the defect. In a court of law fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>must be proved. (Angell on Carriers, \u00a7 265 ; 1 Parsons on Con. 719; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>King, </em>4 Cowen, 220.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-5\">IV. There cannot be fraud without intent, and acts alone prove intent\u2014which is a question for a jury; and no intent to defraud is shown. Constructive fraud is not applicable' here. (2 Kent, 484; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>8 Metc. 377; <em>Gallatian v. Cunningham, </em>8 Cowen, 370.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-6\">V. It is the duty of the carrier to ask contents. And until asked, it is not the owner\u2019s duty to disclose contents. And the mere packing valuables in a traveler\u2019s trunk is not such an indication of fraud as the law requires to be shown. (2 Kent, 6th ed. 602; Story on Bail. \u00a7 567; <em>Hollister </em>v. <em>Nowlen, </em>19 Wend. 245; 9 Wend. 115.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-7\">VI. Concealment is not <em>per se </em>a fraud, for the law says : The owner need not disclose contents, until asked, and no case goes the length of the application in this case. Carrier must show fraud affirmatively. <em>(Hollister </em>v. <em>Nowlen, </em>19 Wend. 245 ; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Pinner, </em>18 N. Y. R. 295; <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>4 B. &amp; Aid. 21; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>10 Mees. &amp; Welb. 160, 169.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-8\">VII. Defendant is a common carrier, and as such held to the responsibility of an insurer against all except acts of God\u2014if no artifice is used to deceive. <em>(Dorr </em>v. <em>N. J. St. </em>Nav; <em>Co. </em>1 Kern. 485; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>19 Barb. 346.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-9\">VIII. Defendant cannot limit-his liability by custom or notice. (1 Kern. 485.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-10\">IX. The law applicable to carriers of passengers cannot be applied here, it is not dependent on the kind of freight they carry, but it is modified t\u00f3 them, because they are paid only for a passenger and baggage. (1 Parsons on Con. 673; <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>6 Hill, 586.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-11\">X. The third ground taken for non-suit is erroneous, because loss of tim\u00e9 and a suspension of a right, was a good consideration to support second contract. 2 Kent, 6th Ed. 465.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-12\">XI. Carrier is liable if he voluntarily undertakes, whether interested.in means of transportation or not. <em>(Fairchild v. Slocum, </em>19 Wend. 329; 25 Wend. 661; 13 Barb. 361; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>Russell </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>19 Barb. R. 352; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>14 Barb. R. 524.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-5\">XII. Defendant voluntarily, for a good consideration, contracted to convey trunk as first given to him, to Buffalo.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-6\">13. To arrive at the intent to defraud, the whole tenor of Davis\u2019 conduct must be viewed together. ! And it shows no intention to impose on carrier.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b17-7\"><em>II. D. Sedgwick, </em>for Respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-8\">I. This ease is <em>res judicata </em>in this court. The court having determined th\u00e9 law upon the same facts now before it, will not reverse or review its former decision. <em>(Richards </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>2 Bosw. 589.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-9\">II. The non-suit was properly granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-10\">1. The facts having been found by the jury, the necessary result of the application to those facts of the law of the case, as already determined, was a non-suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-11\">2. The non-suit was quite independent of any question of fraud. The court had decided, that the rules governing the liabilities of carriers who transport the luggage of a passenger, as an incident to the conveyance of his person, and who, by the law of the State, are common carriers, in respect to such luggage, govern also the liability of other carriers receiving and conveying such luggage, as such. Under these rules, the carrier receiving a traveler\u2019s trunk, is liable only for such a trunk and its appropriate contents \u2014not for merchandise it may contain; and the traveler\u2019s secret motives do not affect the carrier\u2019s liability. It is his acts, not his thoughts, which produce the injurious consequence, and are alone material.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-12\">In the present case, the merchandise was that of a third party\u2014not of the traveler\u2014who had no interest in it. <em>(Richards </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>2 Bosw. 589, and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-13\">' 3. Assuming the question of fraud to have been necessarily involved, there was still, after the facts had been found, nothing left for the jury. At law as well as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>equity, the question of fraud on a conceded or established state of facts, is one for the court\u2014not the jury. Fraud becomes no longer a question of motive, but a matter of legal intendment. The natural -sequence, not the motive of the act, is the point of inquiry. <em>(Sturtevant </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>9 Johns. 342; <em>Divver v. McLaughlin, </em>2 Wend. 599; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>7 Cowen, 301; <em>Kean </em>v. <em>Newell, </em>2 Missouri, 9; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>1 Conn. 285, 294; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>19 Wend. 181; <em>Dormick v. Reichenback, </em>10 S. and R. 84-90; <em>Rea </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>5 Iredell, 644, 647; <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Fitzhugh, </em>9 Port, 39, 67; <em>Pothill </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>3 Barn. <em>&amp; </em>Aid. 125; <em>Story </em>v. <em>Norwich and Worcester R. R. </em>24 Conn. 94; <em>Edgell </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>5 Seld. 213; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>4 Seld. 79; <em>Cunningham, </em>v. <em>Freeborn, </em>11 Wend. 240.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-5\">4. There was no request on the part of the plaintiff that the case should be left generally to the jury, but merely a request after the facts had been found, and the findings admitted by consent, and after the motion thereon for a non-suit had been made, that the case should go to the jury, coupled with an erroneous instruction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-6\">5. The cause of action stated in the complaint, is unproved in its entire scope and meaning. It is not merely a case of variance: it is a failure of proof. (Code, \u00a7\u00a7 l7l, 142; See 2d sec. of point 1 of defendants on former argument, 2 Bosw. 598.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-7\">6. On the several principles stated under the 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th points for the defendant on the former argument of this case, (2d Bosw. pp. 598, 599, 600,) and the authorities there cited, which principles were sanctioned by this court in their opinion, (2 Bosw. pp. 603-606,) the non-suit was right. The judgment of non-suit should be affirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b18-8\">By the Court. Bosworth, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AD\">\u2014The thing which William P. Davis notified the defendants he desired them to take to the depot of the New York and Erie Railroad, he designated and described as his <em>trunk, </em>which he wished carried to the <em>passenger </em>depot, to be taken by him as such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>to Buffalo. At the same time he ordered a box to be taken to the <em>freight depot.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">This employment was to carry a trunk, described as being a traveler\u2019s trunk, and to carry it so that Davis might have it at the depot, to be taken with him as a traveler\u2019s trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">The trunk itself, and all of its contents, were delivered at a place to which the defendants agreed to forward it, and the plaintiff to receive it; except that portion of the contents which consisted of articles not constituting any part of the usual contents of a traveler\u2019s trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">The plaintiff now seeks to charge the defendants with the value of jewelry which was in the trunk, an article which the defendants were not only not asked to carry, but which, from the terms of the application made to them, they might justly suppose formed no part of the contents of the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-8\">The decision in this case, when it was before the general term, in February, 1858, (2 Bosw. 603-606,) disposes of all questions \"presented by the present appeal. The same evidence was given by the plaintiff, and the same facts were found on the first trial as on the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-9\">On the second trial \u201c the plaintiff asked that the case go to the jnry with the following instruction: \u2018If the jury think there was no intentional fraud practiced by Davis in delivery of the trunk, they must find for the plaintiff;\u2019 which the court refused, but granted the non-suit, and to which plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b19-10\">In <em>Pardee </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>(25 Wend. 462,) Ch. J. Nelson says, \u201cI would not say the plaintiff <em>intended </em>to impose upon the defendant, and under the cover of baggage obtain the transportation of merchandise, free of expense; <em>this is not material. </em>It is enough that such is the practical effect of his conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b19-11\">So in <em>The Great Northern Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>(14 Eng. L. <em>&amp; </em>Eq. 367-370,) <em>Baron Parke </em>says, \u201cWhether this was done with any fraudulent intention it is not material to inquire, for if without any fraud the passenger had so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>conducted himself that the company were not apprised of the nature of what he was carrying, it is the same in effect as if a fraud had been intended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">The defendants, from the application made to them, could only regard this trunk as being the ordinary baggage trunk of a traveler, containing the usual personal conveniences belonging to Davis in that character, and had no reason to suspect that it contained, in addition, jewelry to be sold as merchandise, belonging either to Davis or the plaintiff, or to any other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-8\">We think that <em>Pardee </em>v. Drew, and <em>The Great Northern Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Shepherd, (supra) </em>are decisive against the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, and that he was properly non-suited. '</p>\n<p id=\"b20-9\">j The fact that the defendants were employed to carry the 'trunk only, and not its owner also, can make no difference in respect to the rights of the parties. The deception, in effect, practiced upon the defendants, however honest the actual intent of Davis, is the same in this case as if they had undertaken to carry Davis also.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-10\">It is this practical fraud, in case the defendants were to be held responsible, which prevents liability attaching, and not anything peculiar in the law applicable to passenger carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-11\">The rule is that a defendant is not to be charged, when charging him would sanction and give effect to a fraud, in effect, practiced upon him by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-12\">The judgment should be affirmed with-costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-13\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
