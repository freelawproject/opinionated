Letters testamentary were not granted to her, and she left her surviving the said Stephen B. Hutchings and the said Abraham S. Jones.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-8\">The testator was, at the time of his death, seized of a certain parcel of land, situate in the city of New York, and described in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-9\">On the 10th of October, 1859, Stephen B. Hutchings and Abraham S; Jones, the surviving executors of Osborn, entered into a written contract with the defendants, for the sale to them, and purchase by the latter, of such parcel of land. By the terms of such contract, if the parties of the second part (the purchasers) failed to comply with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>covenant on their part, they were to forfeit $1,000, which was paid down on signing the contract; and if the title should prove defective, such sum was to be returned to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\">\u201c The said surviving executors have, since the first day of February, 1860, the day mentioned in the said agreement. for the completion of the purchase, duly tendered to the said Thomas Baldwin and George Baldwin, a deed for the premises above described, duly executed and acknowledged, and demanded the balance of the money to be paid by the last named parties upon the delivery of the said deed, pursuant to the said agreement.

Thomas Baldwin and George Baldwin, specifically perform their contract aforesaid, and pay to the plaintiffs the remainder of the purchase money of the said property, being the sum of six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>thousand five hundred dollars, with interest from the first day of February, 1860.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">\u201c And it is agreed, that if the court should be of opinion that the said plaintiffs, executors, as aforesaid, have not power and authority to convey the said premises, that then, and in such case, the said court shall give judgment accordingly, and that the sum of one thousand dollars, already paid as part of the said purchase money, shall be repaid to the said' Thomas Baldwin and George Baldwin, and the said contract of purchase by them be declared null and void, and of no force or effect; and that the said parties, plaintiffs and defendants, may respectively have such further or such other relief as to this court may appear proper.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\">The case was properly signed and duly verified.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-7\"><em>E.

Hoffman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3u\">\u2014The authority conferred in this will upon the executors, is not an estate in trust, but a power; an authority to do an act in relation to lands. (1 R. S. 732, \u00a7 74; <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Ropke, </em>5 Sand. 362; <em>Reedy. Underhill, </em>12 Barb. 113; <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>1 Selden, 408.) The power in question, is a general power in trust, (\u00a7 114, [94,] 1 Revised Statutes, 734, article, Powers.) By section 122, [102,] the provisions of the second article of the title from sections 66 to 71, both inclusive, are made applicable to powers in trust, and the grantees of such powers. By section [67,] page 730, \u201cwhen the purposes for which an express trust shall have been created, shall have ceased, the estate of the trustees 'shall also cease.\u201d So when the purposes of a power are accomplished, the power is at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">We are then required to examine the will of the testator with care, to ascertain to what extent and for what purpose he has created and conferred the power; and while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>on the one side, his general language should not be strictly and rigorously construed so-as to admit of no case for its exercise which is not to a demonstration within those purposes ; on the other, if we find that estates and interests fully vested, are to be affected by its execution, we must be scrupulous in extending it, because it would be, in so far, an encroachment upon that absolute right of disposition which attends proprietorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In construing this authority and determining its extent, the intention of the testator in creating it must constitute the guide. <em>Fronty </em>v. Fronty, (1 Bailey\u2019s Eq. Rep. 517 ;) <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Troup, </em>(2 Cowen, 195.) The devisor has, in the first place, given to his wife a clear life estate, in all the remainder of his property, real and personal, after payment of his debts; \u201c she to receive the rents, issues and profits, during her natural life, for her own use.\u201d He has then empowered her to make leases during her life, (with the concurrence of his other acting executors,) so that such leases commence in possession, and be for not more than twenty-one years. This bequest to her was to be in lieu of all dower and other claim upon his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The language of the authority is .absolute and comprehensive ; so much so that we are bound to see clearly, that it is to be restricted by force of other clauses, to certain cases, or for certain purposes; otherwise, it undoubtedly would authorize a sale after, as well as before the death of the widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">It is not enough to restrain it that portions of the will indicate that he contemplated that some of his real estate might remain unsold after her death. He might well expect that the executors might, in exercising a sound discretion, leave portions, if not all, unsold.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The more important clause, is- the one which provides, that \u201c after the sale, my wife shall have the same interest in the proceeds as she had in the property before the sale.\u201d At the first view, this would tend to the conclusion, that the sale was to be during her life. But it admits of the meaning, that if a sale is made either of all the real estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>or of any portion while she lives, such shall be her interest in the avails. It is not sufficient to overrule the comprehensive language of the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">There is another clause of great importance. He directs \u201c that every devise or bequest, shall be considered as vested as personal estate, at his decease, but so as to be subject to any prior life estate executed by this will, and not to bear interest in favor of any party until the time for payment to such party arrives.\u201d This, and other clauses, indicate with sufficient clearness, that he meant and expected that his property should, for the purposes of distribution, be treated as personal estate, and hence tend to construe and define the power .to sell, by which a conversion actually into personalty, would be accomplished, and give it full and absolute effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In <em>Meyrick </em>v. <em>Coutts, </em>(Exch. 1806, cited by Sugden on Powers, vol. 1, page 335,) a devise was to A. the testator\u2019s wife, for life'; and after her decease, a power-to trustees to sell, and pay the money among the children of B., who had an infant child then living. The court held that a sale could not be made \"till after the widow\u2019s decease. Here the power did not arise until her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In <em>Fry v. Fish, </em>(Rolls 5, \u00c1ug. 1811, cited also by Mr. Sugden on Powers, vol. 2, p.463,) amotherhad joined in a recovery and settlement, by which the estates were limited to her for life, then to the husband of her daughter for life, with remainders over to children of the marriage. There was inserted a power of sale at any time during the lives of husband and wife, with their consent, and of the survivor. A sale was made in the lifetime of the mother. It was objected that the power could not be executed until her death; but the purchaser was compelled to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Here the outstanding life estate did not prevent a sale, because the mother had united in the instrument which conferred the power on the trustees with consent of the husband and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">In <em>Moseley </em>v. <em>Hide, </em>(17 Queen\u2019s Bench, 91,) a sale made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>during the life of a wife, when the power was given, to be exercised after her death, was held invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">This also was a case of a plain restriction to a given event, for the exercise of the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The judgment must be for the performance of the contract, payment of the purchase money by the defendants, and conveyance by the plaintiffs, according to the submission, without costs to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
