Rogers, Defendant and Appellant.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b499-7\">1. Where a defendant, hy a valid written guaranty, undertakes, unconditionally, to pay a sum loaned on the security thereof to a third person, on his failure to pay within a stipulated time from the date of the guaranty, and after thirty days\u2019 notice of the principal\u2019s default, it is not essential to a right of action that payment was demanded of the principal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b499-8\">2. It is enough that the principal failed to pay, and that the defendant was notified of the default thirty days before suit brought.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b499-9\">3. Where the complaint, in an action on such a guaranty, alleges a loan on the day of its date, to the person and of the amount thereby authorized and on the security of such guaranty, non-payment of it by the principal and due and proper notice of such failure to the defendant more than thirty days before suit brought, and the answer denies none of these allegations, except by averring that the only notice given \u00f3f such default, and the only demand of payment made of the defendant, are contained in a written notice served on him, which he sets forth, and which states that a note made by said borrower on the day of the date of said guaranty, and for the alleged amount payable to the plaintiff at the time stipulated hy the guaranty, and <em>\u201c </em>secured by him\u201d (the defendant,) is protested for non-payment, and that the plaintiff looks to him for payment thereof, and by also averring that when said notice was served, his guaranty was shown to him, and he was asked if the signature to it was his, to which he assented, and replied <em>\u201c </em>that he did not owe the plaintiff anything;\u201d such answer does not raise a material issue, as it does not allege that the defendant did not understand the notice so served, when served, as a notice of the non-payment of the sum alleged, (and by not being denied,) admitted to have been loaned on the faith and security of said guaranty, and on the day of its date.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b499-10\">4. The indebtedness of the plaintiff to the defendant's principal, in a sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>equal to or greater than the sum loaned, cannot he set-off, or availed of as a counter-claim, by such guarantor in an action against him, the principal not being alleged to be insolvent.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b500-4\">6. In a suit by a plaintiff, with which the defendant has contracted as being a corporate body, the plaintiff cannot be required to prove the fact of its incorporation, merely because the defendant states in his answer that he \u201c is informed and believes\u201d the plaintiff is not a corporation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b500-5\">6. On an appeal from a judgment rendered against a defendant on account of the <em>frivolousness </em>of his answer, the question is, whether the judgment is right on the <em>merits </em>of the case made by the pleadings, and not whether the answer is <em>frivolous.</em></headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b500-6\">(Before Boswoeth, Oh.

This recites that the plaintiff is \u201cah incorporated institution, doing business in the city of New York,\u201d and has* agreed to loan $1,000 to George K. Chase on the execution and delivery of the defendant\u2019s guarantyto become answerable for the repayment thereof, with interest, sixty days from that date, and that the plaintiff has advanced and loaned that sum to Chase simultaneously with the delivery of such guaranty, and by it the defendant promises that if Chase should fail to repay that sum, with interest, within the sixty days, \u201cthat then, and in such case, the defendant will become answerable to the plaintiffs for such repayment, after thirty days\u2019 notice of such default.\u201d The complaint then alleges the making of the loan of $1,000 on the day of the date of the agreement, and simultaneously with the delivery of it to the plaintiffs; the failure of Chase to pay any part of the loan within the sixty days; \u201c due and proper notice \u201d of such default to the defendant more than thirty days before suit brought; demand of payment of Chase, and his refusal to pay anything; due performance of conditions on the part of the plaintiffs, that the $1,000 and interest from February 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>1860, is wholly due and unpaid, and prays judgment therefor. The action was commenced May 18th, 1860.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-5\">The defendant, in his answer,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-6\"><em>First. </em>Avers \u201cthat he is informed and believes that no demand of payment, whatever, was ever made\u201d of Chase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-7\"><em>Second. </em>He alleges that he never received any notice of the default of Chase, and that no demand of payment was ever made of him, except such as are contained in a notice served on him April 9th, 1860, and reading thus, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-8\">\u201cNew York, <em>April </em>9, 1860.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-9\">\u201c Please to take notice that a promissory note made by George K.

That Chase thereby became, and now is, the owner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>whole of said indebtedness, and the plaintiffs now justly owe him that sum by reason of its being so deposited with them and remaining in their hands.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6i\">\u2014The defendant promised, unconditionally, that if Chase failed to pay the loan, with interest, within sixty days from the date of the promise, he would pay it after thirty days\u2019 notice of such default. A demand of the principal need not be made before bringing suit against the defendant. <em>(Mann </em>v. <em>Eckford, </em>15 Wend. 508.) The answer does not deny that <em>Chase </em>failed to pay within the sixty days. <em>(Douglass </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>24 Wend. 48 ; <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Groot, </em>Id. 82 ; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Dann, </em>6 Hill, 543 ; <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>2 Barb. 51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">The complaint alleges, and the answer, by not denying it, admits that the plaintiffs, on the security of the defendant's guaranty, loaned to Chase $1,000 on the 4th of February, 1860, and that on the 9th of April, 1860, the defendant received written notice that Chase had failed to pay his note for the $1,000, and that the plaintiffs looked to him, as such guarantor, for payment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">The answer does not suggest that the note named in the notice was not given for the loan, but, on the contrary, avers that at the time such notice was served, his guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>anty was exhibited to him. And besides, the notice served, states that the note is \u201c'secured\u201d by the defendant. Assuming the note to have been given for the sum loaned, 1 and the answer does not deny it, the notice was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The fact that the plaintiffs were indebted to George K. Chase when this suit was commenced, in a sum exceeding the amount of the note, is not a discharge of the defendant\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The demand in favor of Chase does not belong to the defendant, and he cannot set it off in this action. <em>(La Fargo </em>v. Halsey, 1 Bosw. 171.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The fact that Chase forbade the defendant to perform his contract, neither discharges it, nor affects the defendant\u2019s liability by reason of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The defendant\u2019s written guaranty recites, that \u201cthe East River Bank \u201d is \u201c an incorporated institution,\u201d and the fact \u201cthat he is informed and believes the plaintiffs are not an incorporation,\u201d though averred in his answer, does not amount to a plea \u201cthat the plaintiffs are not a corporation.\u201d (2 R. S. 458, \u00a7 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">If the defendant desired to litigate that question, he should have pleaded the fact expressly. <em>(The Bank of Genesee </em>v. <em>the Patchin </em>Bank, 3 Kern. 309 ; <em>The Union Mu. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Osgood &amp; </em>Allen, 1 Duer, 707.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">The answer does not allege it to be true, in point of fact, that the plaintiffs are not a corporation. It states that the defendant \u201c is informed and believes \u201d that they are not. Proof that he was so informed, and believed the information to be true, would establish the truth of his \u201c fourth \u201d allegation, or head of his answer, but would not subject the plaintiffs to the necessity of proving that his information was erroneous and his belief unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">But the defendant, in his printed points, does not suggest that this part of his answer raises a material issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">The question on this appeal is, whether the judgment is right on the merits; whether the answer contains a <em>defense, </em>by stating new matter constituting one, or by putting material allegations of the complaint at issue, and not whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the answer is <em>frivolous. (Griswold </em>v. Laverty, 12 Leg. Ob. vol. 12, 316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
