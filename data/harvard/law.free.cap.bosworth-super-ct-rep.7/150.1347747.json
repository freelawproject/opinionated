In a suit'brought in a court of this State upon such a judgment, the defendant cannot litigate the question whether the complaint contained in the record of-that judgment states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; nor whether such cause of action arose in this State, and by its laws is one on which no recovery could be had.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b156-8\">3. Uor can such judgment be impeached by proof that it was recovered upon an allegation of misrepresentation and warranty of the quality of merchandise sold by the defendant to the plaintiffs, and proof that before the action in which it was'recovered was commenced, he sued the plaintiffs in a justice\u2019s court of the same State, and recovered a judgment thprein before the trial.of the action against him, for the balance due upon the. contract price of such merchandise.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b156-9\">(Before Hoeemar, Pierreport and Robertsor, J.

That the plaintiffs are liable to the defendant in the full value of the merchandise sold to them by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-7\">The motion was denied, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-8\">The judge found as facts, the facts above stated; and gave judgment for the plaintiffs for the difference between the amounts due on the two judgments. The defendant excepted to the conclusions of the judge, and appealed from the judgment to the general term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-9\">The appeal was submitted without argument, on the fol. lowing points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-10\"><em>P. J. Joackimsen, </em>for Appellant, m</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-11\">The defendant, a merchant in New York, sold to the plaintiffs, doing business in Wisconsin, a quantity of liquors, for $345.53.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-12\">The plaintiffs paid .a portion of the price, and were called on by the' defendant, in person, in Wisconsin, for the balance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-13\">They failing to pay, the defendant brought a suit against them, in Wisconsin, and recovered a judgment for such balance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-14\">The plaintiffs then turned round and sued the defendant in the courts of Wisconsin, for a fraudulent representation as to the quality of the liquors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-15\">And though the plaintiffs had not returned or offered to return the liquors, but had sold them (for what sum does not appear), and though the plaintiffs had not paid the whole price, yet they recovered judgment for the whole amount of the price, with interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-16\">And, on that judgment, this action is brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-17\">The question now is : whether the defendant can escape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>a recovery for the amount of that judgment, deducting only the defendant's recovery for the balance of the price ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-5\">He insists that he can, because:</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-6\">I. The judgment recovered by the plaintiffs in Wisconsin, and on which this action is brought, appears to have been for a matter not actionable in this State. The goods were sold and delivered in this State. It is not alleged that</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-7\"><em>a. </em>There was an express warranty, or</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-8\"><em>b. </em>That the goods delivered were unmerchantable, or</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-9\">c. That the plaintiffs offered to return the goods to the defendant, so as to put all parties back to their original position.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-10\">The judgment thus recovered in Wisconsin, could not, therefore, be the ground of an action in this State, because :</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-11\"><em>First. </em>The courts of this State have jurisdiction only of causes of action recognized by the laws of this State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-12\"><em>Second. </em>The implied promise or debt on the judgment is void, for want of a good consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-13\">II. The, judgment recovered by the defendant against the plaintiffs, in Wisconsin, is an estoppel .to this action, because:</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-14\"><em>a. </em>It was a controversy between the same parties upon a contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-15\"><em>b. </em>It arose out of and related to the same transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-16\">c. Was recovered before a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-17\"><em>d. </em>In a suit in which the defendants (now plaintiffs) were duly served with process, and had a day to be heard in court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-18\">Under such circumstances, the decision of the court upon the same subject matter is conclusive against the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs\u2019 suit in Wisconsin, against the defendant, was brought after the commencement of the suit and before the recovery of the judgment of the defendant against the plaintiffs, and for that reason the defendant\u2019s judgment could not be pleaded or answered in bar of that. suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-19\">III. There is no doubt that the defendant delivered his property, of the value of SSSO.YO, to the plaintiffs, at their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>request, which they never returned, but actually consumed, and for which, if the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in this action is1 enforceable, the defendant has never been paid. This amount must necessarily be allowed to the defendant, and forms a good counterclaim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-5\">IY. The judge, at special term, erred in overruling every proposition of fact or of law insisted on by the defendant. The judgment at special term should be reversed, and judgment ordered for the defendant, and for a balance in his favor, against the plaintiffs, with costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-6\"><em>Mead </em>\u00a7\u25a0 <em>Taft, </em>for Respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-7\">I. The recovery of the judgment, upon which this action was brought, in the State of Wisconsin, and that the court pronouncing it had jurisdiction of the defendant by actual and personal service of process upon him, and by his appearing in and defending the action, are proved by the exemplified copy of the judgment record. (Greenleaf on Evidence, vol. 1, \u00a7 504; <em>Hatcher </em>v. <em>Rocheleau, </em>18 N. Y. R. 86, 90, 94.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-8\">This judgment can only be impeached by showing want of jurisdiction in the court, or fraud; neither of which has been done in this case. <em>(Rocco </em>v. <em>Hackett, 2 </em>Bosworth\u2019s R., p. <em>579; </em>Greenleaf on Evidence, vol. 1, \u00a7 504; <em>Hobson </em>v. <em>Pearce, 2 </em>Kernan\u2019s R., p. 156.) The defendant established no defense to the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-9\">II. The defendant established no other counterclaim Than the one that was allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-10\">The goods spoken of in the third division of the answer were paid for, except the balance for which the judgment was recovered before Justice Hinds, and which was allowed as a counterclaim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-11\">The -goods spoken of in the fourth division, are the same goods that are mentioned in the third. Judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b161-12\">By the Court. Robertson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR\">\u2014The judgment upon which this action is brought, was obtained in a court of a sister <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>State, upon due notice personally served therein upon the defendant, to defend the same. It is now proposed to enquire into the validity of it, collaterally in \u2022 this action, and to assail its foundation by establishing that the cause of action set forth in the complaint in such action-in which the judgment was obtained, was such as could not be sued upon in the courts of this State; in other words, to demur to such complaint. But, as the Constitution of the Federal C-overnment requires full faith and credit to be given in every State to judgments of each State, when jurisdiction has been obtained of the person, the objection is hardly worth noticing. The courts of this State have, it is true, jurisdiction only of causes of action recognized by its laws, but, among them, is a judgment obtained in a sister State. The right of action on a judgment needs neither promise nor consideration to create or support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The second objection seems to me equally frivolous. The judgment obtained by the defendant against the plaintiffs, concluded the plaintiffs on nothing except that they owed the price of goods bought; which is perfectly consistent with the defendant\u2019s being liable for damages for misrepresenting their quality or purity. The plaintiffs were not bound to recoup, and did not, but chose to avail themselves of the right of suing for this wrong. The defendant was probably not prevented from availing himself of the recovery of the judgment by him in Wisconsin, if it had been of any avail for the purpose, in answer to the claim of the plaintiffs against him; notwithstanding the latter was sued upon after his suit was begun and before judgment had been obtained, as he could have' set it up by plea <em>puis </em>darrein, or supplemental answer. At all events, it is too late now, after judgment has been obtained against him. I do not see any great hardship in the defendant\u2019s altogether losing the price of adulterated, articles sold as pure ; but that was a question disposed of by the courts of Wisconsin, with which we have nothing to do, except to enable the parties in whose favor judgment was rendered, to enforce it in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs, to the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
