J.)</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b21-6\">Heard June 8,</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AOJ\">decided June 16, 1860.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-7\">.Appeal by plaintiff from an order granting defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-8\">This suit was brought about the 28th of December, 1857, to recover of the defendant the amount of two notes, one of which was for the sum of $350 and made by one R\u00e9n\u00e9 Masson, and payable the 18th of June, 1854; the other was made by one Lorenzo Salvi, was for the sum of $655.25, and due April 1, 1855. The complaint states that the <em>Masson </em>note was delivered to defendant May 12, &amp;c., and the <em>Salvi </em>note June 5, 1854, to collect, that defendant received them for that purpose; and after having had them a reasonable time for collecting them, they had been demanded of the defendant, who had refused to return either of them or to account for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-9\">The defendant\u2019s answer states that he received the two notes for collection merely, that the makers of them then lived in Mexico, that Masson then was and since has been insolvent; that defendant, with the plaintiff\u2019s assent, was still making efforts to collect the <em>Masson </em>note, that it was still in the possession of defendant\u2019s agent for that purpose, and \u201cif not collected, will, in a few days, be returned to the plaintiff.\u201d That <em>Salvi </em>refused to pay the other note, and left Mexico for Havana, to which place defendant forwarded it to his correspondent, (Sharfenberg,) by the regular government and public mail, with the plaintiff\u2019s sanction, and that it was lost, without fault or negligence on the part of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-10\">The action was tried before Mr. Justice Moncrief and a jury, November 22, 1859. It was proved that defendant, on receiving the notes at New York, (where he resided,) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>sent them to his agent (Mr. Davidson,) in Mexico for collection, and the evidence (which is sufficiently stated in a special term opinion of Bosworth, Ch. J.) tends to show, that the acts of defendant\u2019s agent in the premises were, from time to time, made known to the plaintiff, and that he made no objection to what was done or represented as intended to be done, and that the <em>Salvi </em>note was lost, as stated in defendant\u2019s answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-5\">The judge charged, <em>{inter alia,) </em>that, \u201cas to the <em>Masson </em>note, # # if the plaintiff consented to the defendant\u2019s agent retaining it for collection, the defendant 0is not liable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-6\">And as to the <em>Salvi </em>note, \u201c'that if the plaintiff knew of, and assented to the proceeding to collect that note, by forwarding it to Havana, and it was lost in the mail, the defendant is not liable.\u201d The jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff for $585.65, with interest thereon from June 18, 1854, being $222.52, making in all $808.1*7.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-7\">The plaintiff moved at special term, January 21, 1860, on a case before Bosworth, Ch. J., for a new trial; which motion was granted, for the reasons assigned in the following opinion, viz:</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b22-8\">Bosworth, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agj\">\u2014The judge charged \u201cthat if the plaintiff knew of, and assented to the proceedings to collect that note (the note made by Salvi) by forwarding it to Havana, and it was lost in the mail, the defendant is not liable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">Davidson\u2019s letter of the 19th day of November, 1854, stated that he should forward the \u201cbills on Salvi to Mr. Sharfenberg by next packet.\u201d This letter, on its receipt by the defendant, was shown or read to the plaintiff, and \u201c he made no objection to it.\u201d There was no attempt to contradict or discredit this testimony. The plaintiff by not objecting to this course must be deemed to have assented to it. It is free from doubt, that the plaintiff\u2019s note was so forwarded, and so .lost. Under the instruction of the judge, the defendant was not liable for this note. Its face is $655.25. The other note is but $350, and the verdict is \u201c $586.65, with interest from June 18th, 1854,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>and of course was given either wholly or in part for this note.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">It appears free from contradiction, that Salvi, when the note was presented to him, declared it a forgery, and Davidson so wrote tq the defendant by letter dated August the 19th, 1854, and this, as well as the other letters received by defendant from Davidson, relating to plaintiff\u2019s notes, were either shown or read to the plaintiff, and he made no objection to the course Davidson was pursuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The instructions of the plaintiff to the defendant were \u201c to enforce payment (by Salvi,) if refused, without, however, incurring expenses of consequence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">Or as expressed in defendant's letter of July 22, 1854, \u201c to take all measures that may be -required to enforce payment, and if that can be done without incurring expenses of consequence, and without subjecting you to trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">To this Davidson replies by his letter of the 19th day of August, 1854, that Salvi \u201cpretends that the signature is a forgery. I will consult my lawyer on the subject. But I consider it useless to commence a suit against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-9\">The plaintiff was informed of these facts, and of the views of Davidson, and did not object to what was done, or omitted to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-10\">As the agent was instructed to take only such proceeding as could be had without incurring expenses of consequence, and as Salvi declared the signature a forgery, and as the defendant\u2019s agent thought it useless to sue him, and as the plaintiff was advised of all this, and did not object to it, nor to the note being detained, and sent- subsequently to Havana, after Salvi left Mexico for that place; I think he wholly fails to show any negligence on the part of the defendant, or any disregard of the instructions under which he took the note for collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-11\">The verdict therefore is, in part, if not wholly against the instruction of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-12\">I do not understand the answer as admitting \u201c a demand by the plaintiff of the notes in question, and a refusal by the defendant to return them.\u201d As to the Masson note, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the answer alleges, that defendant\u2019s \u201cagent has, up to the time of the commencement of this suit, with the assent of the plaintiff, been endeavoring to collect said note, and said note is still in his possession for that purpose, but which if not collected, will in a few days be returned to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">As to the <em>Salvi </em>note, it alleges that the course taken to collect it, and the sending of it to Havana, \u201cwas fully known to and sanctioned by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">I have already stated my conclusion that no negligence or disobedience of instructions is proved in respect to the <em>Salvi note.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">It is quite clear, that as to the Masson note, the course to be pursued was left to the discretion of defendant\u2019s agent (Davidson,) and what he did was communicated to the plaintiff, from time to time, and he made no objection to it. There is no evidence that a dollar was collected of Masson or Salvi during this period by any other person, nor is any fact proved tending to show that Davidson did not act discreetly, or in good faith, or that any legal proceedings would presumptively have resulted in collecting either note.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">I think the verdict is not warranted by the evidence, and that as it is contrary to the charge of the judge, a new trial must be granted; the costs of the former trial, and of this motion must abide the event of the suit. The verdict is against the law of the case as declared by the judge. As there was no conflict of evidence as to the plaintiff\u2019s assent to send the Salvi note to Havana, and as to its loss by such transmission, the question whether he was liable for its loss, and for not \"returning it, was one of law. The costs therefore should abide the event. (*7 Gowen Rep. 461.)</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">From the order granting a new trial the plaintiff appealed to the general term.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\"><em>John Townshend, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-10\"><em>Thomas H. </em>Rodman, for Respondent.</p>\n<author id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>By the Court. Hoffman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay\">\u2014The defendant was sought to be charged for not collecting, or for his neglect in not taking proper measures to collect, two notes entrusted to him for collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">The charge of the judge is before us, without exception. The law must be taken as correct, and the jury were bound to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">There were two notes. One, that of Salvi, was .sent to Mexico to the defendant\u2019s agent, presented to <em>Salvi </em>and declared to be a forgery, and he said he would not pay it. Thus far there was not a particle of evidence of such neglect as to charge the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">But the note was sent forward to Havana, to which place Salvi had gone from Mexico, and not directly to New York. It is alleged to have been lost. The judge charged the jury that if that was so, the mere loss of the note would occasion no damage to the plaintiff, who could sue for the amount notwithstanding, and he would not be entitled to any damages in respect to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">The jury must have found the defendant liable for some part of this note. If they did so, and on account of neglect in Mexico, they acted palpably against evidence ; if they did so on account of the transmission to Havana, they acted against the law as delivered to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">Eor these reasons, as well as others stated by the Chief Justice, in an opinion upon granting an order appealed from, we are satisfied that the new trial was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">In regard to the Masson note, the course to be pursued was left to the discretion of the defendant\u2019s agent, and what he did was communicated to the plaintiff, from time to time. The course adopted by the defendant\u2019s agent was unexceptionable. The verdict as to this note, or the part of it included therein, was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-11\">Order affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
