In a suit, by one part owner of a vessel against another part owner, to ' recover the aliquot part of the premium chargable to the latter upon policies effected at his request and covering his interest, it is not a defense that the premium was paid by the negotiable promissory notes of the plaintiff, which have matured, and are outstanding, unpaid.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b400-8\">(Before Woodbuit, Monobiet and Bobebtsoh, J.

Lane, West &amp; Co., to recover from the defendant moneys paid by that firm as ship\u2019s husbands, in 1855 and 1856, to insure defendant\u2019s interest in the schooners <em>Emetine </em>and <em>Kate Stewart. </em>The defendant, in his answer, denies that he authorized the effecting of the insurance, and denies that the plaintiffs\u2019 assignors expended the moneys claimed. The referee found that the defendant authorized the effecting of the insurance, and held that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover a balance, including interest, of $500.83 ; for which sum, he ordered judgment for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-12\">The insurance was effected in the Atlas Mutual Ins. Co. and the Astor Mutual Ins. Co., (among others.) For the premiums payable on the insurances effected for the defendant, Lane, West &amp; Co. gave their negotiable promissory notes, which were accepted as payment by the companies insuring; which notes amount, in all, to $414.34. Of these notes, Lane, West &amp; Co. paid, at maturity, about November 1, 1856, to the amount of $245.22; and the balance, being $169.12, and which matured March 12,1851, hav'e not been paid, and are outstanding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u201cThe defendant offered to prove that Lane, West <em>&amp; </em>Co., had, previously to the issuing of the policies in question, given subscription notes to the Atlas and Astor insurance companies, and that the premiums for these policies were, by their direction, applied' in reduction of the said subscription notes respectively.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-4\">The testimony was excluded by the referee, as immaterial and irrelevant, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-5\">The defendant also offered to prove \u201c that he had owned vessel property for the last ten years, and during that time has not had any insurance on any of his vessel property.\u201d The referee excluded the evidence, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-6\"><em>Benedict, Burr </em>Benedict, for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-7\"><em>Wm.

Moncrief, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZSd\">\u2014It is well settled that one part owner, though he be also managing owner, (ship\u2019s husband,) cannot, by ordering an insurance of a ship without authority from another, charge the latter with any part of the premium paid, unless the other afterwards assent to the insurance. (Abbott on Shipping, 137; <em>French v. Backhouse, </em>5 Burr, 2727 ; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Humphries, </em>2 Starkie, 345 ; 2 Duer on Ins. 200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">The referee found that the defendant did authorize \" insurance to be made upon his interest in the vessels, by Lane, West <em>&amp; </em>Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">The report of a referee, like the verdict of a jury is, as a general rule, conclusive in a case of conflict of evidence. (1 E. D. Smith, 85 ; 3 <em>id. </em>98 ; 4 <em>id. </em>565 ; 3 Corns. 168.) It is, therefore, like such verdict, to be set aside only where the finding is clearly against the weight of evidence; or where, upon the trial, some rule of evidence or principle of law has been violated. (1 E. D. Smith, 85 ; 5 Duer, 216.)</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">The evidence adduced on the part of the plaintiffs warranted the finding of the referee. The witness <em>Lane, </em>states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>expressly, that the defendant requested him to insure his interest in the schooners, and that insurance was effected in accordance with such request. The witness <em>West </em>says, that the defendant asked him if the schooners were insured. The interest of the defendant was insured by Lane, West &amp; Co. And again, during the time Mr. Johnson was owner of the defendant\u2019s present interest in the schooners, (the defendant having bought of him,) the firm of Lane, West <em>&amp; </em>Co., as ship\u2019s husbands, were in the habit of insuring the interest of Johnson, and this fact the defendant knew. The defendant, at the time of purchasing from Johnson, agreed to pay the premium of insurance due to Lane, West <em>&amp; </em>Co., from Johnson. In the bill rendered to the defendant by Lane, West &amp; Co., under date November 6, 1841, (marked Exhibit No. 9,) there is a charge for insurance of the schooner <em>Kate </em>Stewart, for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">This evidence is assailed and contradicted by the defendant alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Neither of the exceptions is well taken; the testimony offered was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The decision and judgment therefore, were correct, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
