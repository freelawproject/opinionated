Webber contends that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because his prior state drug offenses were not drug trafficking offenses under \u00a7 4B1.2. He asserts that he meets the requirements of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because he is actually innocent of being a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 according to <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-22\">Webber\u2019s claim based on an alleged error in applying a sentencing enhancement may not be asserted in this \u00a7 2241 petition because it fails to satisfy the requirements of the savings clause in \u00a7 2255. <em>See Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213-14 (5th Cir.2000). The district court properly dismissed Webber\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-23\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the motion for extension of time to file a brief is DE<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>NIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
