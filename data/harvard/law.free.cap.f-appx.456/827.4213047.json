Jackson was convicted in state court of robbery with a firearm and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">In February 2002 Jackson was charged with robbery with a firearm, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and providing false identification information. Jackson was convicted in Florida state court of robbery with a firearm after a bifurcated third jury trial, and he then pleaded guilty to and was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court sentenced him to life in prison for the robbery conviction and 10 years imprisonment for the firearm possession conviction, with the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-16\">His convictions and sentences were upheld on direct appeal. Jackson then petitioned for postconviction collateral relief in state court, contending that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial because: (1) his counsel did not object to the introduction of the robbery victim\u2019s out-of-court statements about the robber; (2) his counsel used the wrong prior inconsistent statement to impeach a witness\u2019 testimony; and (3) his counsel did not properly object to statements about race that the prosecutor made during closing argument. The state court denied that petition, and its judgment was affirmed on appeal. Jackson then filed a \u00a7 2254 habe-as petition in federal district court, contending that he received ineffective assistance of counsel on the same three grounds he had asserted in the state court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>postconviction collateral proceedings. The district court denied his habeas petition but granted his certificate of appealability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">\u201cWhen examining a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, we review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo, </em>and findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Maharaj v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>432 F.3d 1292, 1308 (11th Cir.2005). We may not grant habeas relief on claims that were previously adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the adjudication resulted in a decision that \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">To prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claims, Jackson must show that (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) the deficiency prejudiced him. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To show prejudice, he \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">At trial the victim of the robbery testified about his out-of-court statements about the clothing the robber had been wearing. He testified that soon after the robbery, police officers took him to a house to see a man they had apprehended. The victim, however, did not identify that man as the robber but instead told police that the man was wearing clothing similar to that of the robber. Jackson\u2019s trial counsel did not object to this part of the victim\u2019s testimony, and Jackson argues that not objecting was deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">In the state collateral proceedings, the court determined that Jackson could not satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong because, even excluding the victim\u2019s testimony about his out-of-court remarks, there was overwhelming evidence of Jackson\u2019s guilt. Some of that evidence showed that (1) moments after the robbery, Jackson fled when police approached him; (2) police caught Jackson about fifteen minutes later hiding in some bushes not far from the location of the robbery; (3) police found the victim\u2019s wallet and other property in Jackson\u2019s clothes or in close proximity to where Jackson was found; (4) Jackson made incriminating statements to the victim and the victim\u2019s friend after he was caught by police; and (5) police found an automatic handgun resembling the one used in the robbery on the roof of the building outside of which Jackson was found. In light of that evidence, the state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong was not at all unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">Jackson contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for using the wrong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>prior inconsistent statement to impeach the testimony of Officer Wing, the police officer who caught Jackson. Part of Jackson\u2019s defense at trial was that evidence in the case could have been manipulated, moved, or planted by the police. The crime scene supervisor testified that she recovered the victim\u2019s wallet from Jackson\u2019s shorts. On cross-examination, Wing testified that he could not recall where the victim\u2019s wallet was found. Jackson\u2019s counsel then referred Wing to his testimony at Jackson\u2019s second trial, where Wing testified that he \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d that he saw a wallet in a baseball cap that was found near the bushes where Jackson was caught. Jackson\u2019s counsel, however, meant to refer Wing to his deposition testimony, where Wing testified that he \u201cdefinitely\u201d remembered seeing a wallet in the baseball cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Jackson has not shown that his counsel\u2019s referral to Wing\u2019s second trial testimony, instead of Wing\u2019s deposition testimony, was prejudicial. The jury heard the thrust of what Jackson\u2019s counsel was trying to establish: that there was conflicting testimony about where the victim\u2019s wallet was found. And Jackson\u2019s counsel reminded the jury of that conflicting testimony during closing argument. In light of the overwhelming evidence against Jackson, there is no reasonable probability that the result of Jackson\u2019s trial would have been different had the jury heard that Wing \u201cdefinitely\u201d remembered seeing a wallet in the baseball cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Finally Jackson contends that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because his counsel did not properly object to two allegedly improper prosecutorial statements about race that were made during closing argument. The record, however, shows that his counsel did object to those statements and that the court overruled those objections. A counsel\u2019s performance is not deficient simply because the court overruled his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-12\">. Jackson's first jury trial ended in a hung jury. <em>Jackson v. State, </em>881 So.2d 711, d712 (Fla. 3d DCA 2004). His second jury trial was bifurcated, and the jury found him guilty of robbery with a firearm. <em>Id. </em>He then pleaded no contest to the firearm possession and false identification charges. <em>Id. </em>An appellate court reversed and remanded for a third trial, the one that gave rise to this habeas case. <em>Id. </em>The record does not tell us what happened to the false identification charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-9\">. The COA did not specify the issues raised for appellate review. A court issuing a COA must \"indicate which specific issue or issues,\u201d if any, warrant a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3). We have held that when a district court fails to enumerate specific issues for appeal, we have discretion to \"either remand to the district court with instructions to enumerate the issues, or we may rule which issues raised by the petitioner warrant a COA.\u201d <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1227-28 (11th Cir.2001). To avoid delaying resolution of this appeal, for the sake of efficiency, and because Jackson and the State have fully briefed the issues, we construe the order granting a COA to cover the three issues Jackson raises in his brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
