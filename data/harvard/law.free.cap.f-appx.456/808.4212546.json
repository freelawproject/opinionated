In this appeal he argues that his due process rights were violated because when fashioning his sentence the court considered a portion of his criminal record that included a charge that was <em>nolle prossed, </em>and a charge that resulted in no action.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">A sentencing court may consider a defendant\u2019s criminal record even when it contains charges that did not result in a conviction. <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949) (holding due process rights were not denied when a sentencing court based its decision to impose a death penalty on information about burglaries for which the defendant had not been convicted). This principle was codified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661: \u201cNo limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d Additionally, the Sentencing Commission expressly incorporated \u00a7 3661 into the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.4 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661). Appellant\u2019s argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
