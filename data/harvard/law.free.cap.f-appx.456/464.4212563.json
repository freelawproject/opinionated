Knight contends that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by interfering with his right to testify in his own behalf at trial, and that the federal district court erred in failing to develop the record as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">As Knight\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim was adjudicated by the state court on its merits, the district court\u2019s review was limited to the record before the state court. <em>See Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1398-1402, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011). Knight\u2019s conclusional and self-serving contentions in the state court are insufficient to carry his burden of showing that the state court\u2019s rejection of this claim was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, or that it resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
