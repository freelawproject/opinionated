He is serving a sentence of eleven to twenty-two years, which term was imposed in 1996 after a jury found him guilty of both third degree murder in the stabbing death of Michael Cramer, and recklessly endangering another person in the stabbing of his wife, Cindy Spuck. Cramer was Cindy Spuck\u2019s former husband. Spuck\u2019s conviction and sentence were upheld on direct appeal, and his numerous applications for postconviction relief have to date been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-26\">In May 2011, Spuck initiated this civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his amended complaint, Spuck alleged that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (\u201cthe Commonwealth\u201d) has unlawfully prohibited him from \u201cre-test[ing] the DNA and Blood Evidence to allow the plaintiff to prove his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>innocence.\u201d Spuck alleged that his \u201cInnocence and Defense Theory is that Mr. Cramer and Mrs. Spuck were struggling and that Mrs. Spuck was raped by Mr. Cramer earlier that night or evening and it was Mrs. Spuck whom [sic] murdered Mr. Cramer, whom [sic] had a .23 alcohol level.\u201d Spuck claimed that the Commonwealth\u2019s denial of DNA testing demonstrates that it is \u201cviolating and continuing to violate the Plaintiff\u2019s ... Fourteenth Amendment Right of Due Process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The District Court dismissed Spuck\u2019s amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The District Court reasoned as follows: \u201cLike the first complaint, the amended complaint alleges error in the state court\u2019s denial of DNA testing, but not a denial of due process. This Court has no jurisdiction to correct mere errors of state law.\u201d Spuck appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Contrary to the reasoning of the District Court, in both his original and amended complaints Spuck explicitly tethered his factual allegations to a due process claim. Nevertheless, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court because it correctly determined that Spuck failed to state a due process claim upon which relief could be granted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">In <em>Skinner v. Switzer, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 179 L.Ed.2d 233 (2011), the Supreme Court of the United States held that a convieted state prisoner may request via \u00a7 1983 the DNA testing of crime-scene evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1298.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The basis for such a request does not derive from any substantive due process right secured by the Constitution\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See id. </em>at 1299 (citing <em>Disk Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, </em>557 U.S. 52, -, 129 S.Ct. 2308, 2322, 174 L.Ed.2d 38 (2009)). Instead, the request must be premised on the violation of a prisoner\u2019s procedural due process rights. However, we have noted that \u201cprocedural due process does not <em>require </em>that a district attorney disclose all potentially exculpatory evidence for post-conviction relief.\u201d <em>Grier, </em>591 F.3d at 678 (emphasis in original). As made clear by <em>Osborne </em>and <em>Skinner, </em>a procedural due process claim will only lie where a State\u2019s procedures for postconviction relief \u2014 and in particular those procedures in place for consideration of DNA-testing requests\u2014 are so flawed as to be \u201cfundamentally unfair or constitutionally inadequate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679; <em>see also Skinner, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1293 (noting that <em>Osborne </em>\u201cleft slim room for the prisoner to show that the governing state law denies him procedural due process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-18\">Liberally construing, and accepting as true, the allegations in Spuck\u2019s amended complaint, as we must, <em>see Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007), it is clear that Spuck has failed to state a viable procedural due process claim based on the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged refusal to conduct DNA testing on evidence from the Cram-er-Spuck crime scene. In particular, we discern no attempt by Spuck to explain how Pennsylvania\u2019s specific procedures for postconviction DNA testing<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are inadequate as a matter of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. Spuck\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and for \u201camending of newly discovered evidence\u201d are denied. Spuck\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-17\">. Spuck\u2019s original complaint was incorrectly labeled on the District Court's docket as a petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-9\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is plenary. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b95-12\">. Summary affirmance is proper when an appeal fails to present a substantial question. <em>See Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 247 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam). We \"may affirm the District Court's judgment on any basis supported by the record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b95-20\">. We held as much prior to <em>Skinner </em>in <em>Grier v. Klem, </em>591 F.3d 672, 678 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b95-22\">. In July 2002, the Pennsylvania legislature amended the State\u2019s Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA) to permit requests for postconvic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tion DNA testing. <em>See Com. v. Williams, </em>587 Pa. 304, 899 A.2d 1060, 1062-63 (2006) (citing 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9543.1). The allegations in Spuck\u2019s amended complaint shed no light on whether the PCRA court considered \u00a7 9543.1 in denying his most recent PCRA petition. Spuck merely alleges that \u201d[t]he motion petition [sic] to test/ retest the blood and DNA evidence was denied ... on April 20, 2011.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
