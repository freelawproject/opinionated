After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">A. Criminal History and Three Prior Deportations</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">A native and citizen of Mexico, Duran-Flores moved to the United States when he was six years old. In 1991, Duran-Flores pled guilty to attempted burglary and was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation. In 1993, while on probation, Duran-Flores was convicted of burglary and sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment. After completing his sentence, Duran-Flores was removed to Mexico in May 2002. In June 2002, Duran-Flores was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in Texas, and in August 2002 he was convicted of illegally reentering the United States. Duran-Flores was removed to Mexico again in December 2002. In 2005, Duran-Flores was convicted of burglary and aggravated assault and in 2006 he again pled guilty to illegally reentering the United States. For the 2006 conviction, Duran-Flores was sentenced to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release. Duran-Flores was removed again on November 13, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-17\">B. Third Illegal-Re-entry Conviction in 2010</p>\n<p id=\"b881-18\">On June 21, 2010, Defendant Duran-Flores was arrested in Georgia for assaulting his brother with a knife. Because he had no permission to re-enter, Duran-Flores was indicted on the present charge of violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2) by illegally re-entering the United States after having been removed. Duran-Flores pled guilty. For violating his supervised release for the 2006 conviction, Duran-Flores was sentenced to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>C. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assigned a total offense level of 21, which included: (1) a base offense level of 8 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a); (2) a sixteen-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because Duran-Flores was removed after a conviction for a crime of violence; and (3) a three-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b) for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Duran-Flores\u2019s 17 criminal history points yielded a criminal history category of VI. Given a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of VI, the PSI calculated a Guidelines range of 77 to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">D. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Duran-Flores did not object to the PSI\u2019s Guidelines calculations. In a sentencing memorandum, Duran-Flores requested a below-Guidelines sentence of 36 months based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Duran-Flores argued that a downward variance was reasonable because his sentence was principally based on the sixteen-level enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1, which was (1) \u201cunsupported by empirical data or cogent explanation\u201d and not based on \u201cany known penal theory,\u201d and (2) inappropriately double counted his prior convictions because they increased both his offense level and his criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Duran-Flores also requested a lesser sentence based on cultural assimilation. Duran-Flores argued that he moved to the United States when he was six years old and had only a limited connection to Mexico and a limited knowledge of Spanish. Although his sentencing memorandum requests a \u201cdeparture\u201d based on cultural assimilation, the memorandum relies exclusively on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and not on the provision providing for a departure under the Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.0 &amp; 1B1.4; <em>United States v. Sanchez-Valencia, 148 </em>F.3d 1273, 1274 (11th Cir.1998) (recognizing that the court may grant a downward departure in illegal reentry cases). To some extent, Duran-Flores was also requesting a downward variance based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">At sentencing, the government summarized Duran-Flores\u2019s criminal history and requested a sentence in the middle of the Guidelines range. Duran-Flores reiterated the arguments from his sentencing memorandum. Duran-Flores further argued that the factors listed in Application Note 8 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 showed that he had culturally assimilated into the United States. Defense counsel argued that Duran-Flores\u2019s cultural assimilation explained \u201cthe propensity to reoffend and it mitigates his conduct. He comes back because he is coming back to home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">After Duran-Flores spoke in allocution, the district court reviewed Duran-Flores\u2019s criminal history and rejected the cultural-assimilation claim, stating: \u201cAs far as cultural ... assimilation, one thing you do when you assimilate into the culture of the country is you follow the laws[,] which you have not done.\u201d The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s Guidelines calculations. Imposing a below-Guidelines sentence of 75 months, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-13\">I have given you a little less than the recommended sentence. I think after considering the factors set out in the sentencing guidelines and in the code section 3553(a), that is a fair and reasonable sentence. I hope it will deter you in the future. I think it punishes you adequately. I have considered all of the factors involved in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-14\">Defense counsel objected to the sentence on \u201creasonableness grounds and for the reasons previously stated.\u201d At the end of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>the hearing, the district court clarified that it was basing the below-Guidelines sentence on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and not on the Guidelines departure for cultural assimilation.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AKV\">A. Downward Departure</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">On appeal, Duran-Flores argues that the district court procedurally erred by rejecting his request for a downward departure based on cultural assimilation. \u201cWe lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a downward departure unless the district court incorrectly believed that it lacked authority to grant the departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Although \u201cit would facilitate review if sentencing judges would state on the record that they believe they have or do not have the authority to depart, ... we have never said that such a statement is required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, unless something in the record indicates otherwise, we assume that the sentencing court understood its authority to depart downward. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">In this case, the record shows that the district court understood its authority to depart but found a departure unwarranted under the facts of the case. Because the district court understood its authority to depart, we decline to review the court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">B. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">Duran-Flores also argues that his 75-month, below-Guidelines sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable because (1) U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) disproportionately increased his offense level, (2) \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) inappropriately double-counted his prior convictions, and (3) the district court failed to consider and weigh the factors relating to cultural assimilation in considering a downward variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence imposed under the advisory Guidelines under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The burden of establishing unreasonableness lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we first must \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">After determining that the sentence is procedurally sound, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given <em>\u00a7 3553(a) </em>factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks and alteration omitted). The district court need not \u201cstate on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or ... discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The record must demonstrate that the district court considered the arguments of the parties and stated reasons for the sentence imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Under the Guidelines, a downward departure on the basis of cultural assimilation is appropriate if (1) \u201cthe defendant formed cultural ties primarily with the United States from having resided continuously in the United States from childhood,\u201d (2) \u201cthose cultural ties provided the primary motivation for the defendant\u2019s illegal reentry or continued presence in the United States,\u201d and (3) \u201ca departure is not likely to increase the risk to the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. (n.8) (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Our review of the record reveals that the district court committed no procedural error in this case. First, although Duran-Flores argues that \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1 )(A)(ii) disproportionately increased his offense level and is not based on empirical data or a \u201ccogent explanation,\u201d \u201cthe absence of empirical evidence is not an independent ground that compels the invalidation of guideline.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 870 (11th Cir.2010). Thus, although the district court could have considered the lack of statistical support for the enhancement in fashioning a sentence, the district court was not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">Second, Duran-Flores\u2019s argument that \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) double-counts his prior convictions is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d 1159, 1161 (11th Cir.1992) (noting that the double counting of prior convictions was permissible because \u201c[t]he criminal history section is designed to punish likely recidivists more severely, while the enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 is designed to deter aliens who have been convicted of a felony from re-entering the United States\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">To the extent Duran-Flores argues that the court procedurally erred in failing to consider the factors for cultural assimilation, the record shows that the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments addressing those factors but determined, in its discretion, that a variance was not warranted. And, in any event, Duran-Flores did not challenge the district court\u2019s Guidelines calculations in the district court, and he does not challenge them on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>As to substantive reasonableness, Duran-Flores fails to show that his 75-month sentence was unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances. The district court noted Duran-Flores\u2019s criminal history, which included several violent offenses, and considered the risk that Duran-Flores would commit future crimes. Furthermore, Duran-Flores committed the present offense while on supervised release for a previous conviction for illegally re-entering the United States. Given Duran-Flores\u2019s persistent violations of the United States\u2019 criminal and immigration laws, the district court did not abuse its discretion in deeming the sentence necessary to deter Duran-Flores from continuing to disregard those laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-8\">. Under \u00a7 3553(a), the court imposes a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court also considers the following factors in determining a sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the Guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity, and the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-7\">. In determining whether a departure based on cultural assimilation is appropriate, the district court should consider the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-8\">(1) the age in childhood at which the defendant began residing continuously in the United States, (2) whether and for how long the defendant attended school in the United States, (3) the duration of the defendant's continued residence in the United States, (4) the duration of the defendant\u2019s presence outside the United States, (5) the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s familial and cultural ties inside the United States, and the nature and extent of such ties outside the United States, (6) the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history, and (7) whether the defendant engaged in additional criminal activity after illegally reentering the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-13\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt.
