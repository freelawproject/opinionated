Forbes alleged that, during examinations, St. Thomas School of Law failed to provide an environment that would best have accommodated Forbes\u2019s post-traumatic stress disorder and, after she failed to satisfy academic requirements, wrongfully denied her petition for readmission. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-16\">St. Thomas placed Forbes on academic probation in January 2007 and notified her that she would be \u201cexcluded\u201d if she failed to \u201cbring [her] cumulative grade point average up to at least a 2.0 by the end of the Spring 2007 semester.\u201d Forbes requested a meeting with John Hernandez, the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs, to request accommodations for Spring examinations because she had experienced panic attacks frequently and had been diagnosed previously with post-traumatic stress disorder. During the meeting, Forbes said that the University of Miami had given her extra time and a separate location to complete her examinations. Dean Hernandez asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>Forbes to submit a document about the accommodations that she had received at the University of Miami, and Forbes submitted a single-page letter from the University of Miami stating that, during Fall 2004, Forbes would receive \u201c[e]xtended time (up to time and a half) for examinations\u201d in a \u201cdistraction-reduced location.\u201d The letter did not define the phrase \u201cdistraction-reduced location.\u201d During the Spring 2007 examinations, St. Thomas granted Forbes the same accommodations she had received at the University of Miami. Forbes requested other accommodations, including extended breaks during her examinations, but Dean Hernandez told Forbes that she would have to meet with another individual to obtain additional accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Forbes failed to meet the minimum cumulative grade point average based on the spring examinations. St. Thomas notified Forbes that she had to appear before the Academic Standing Committee, which would decide whether Forbes could return the following year. Forbes submitted to the committee a petition for conditional readmission. Forbes later submitted to the committee a letter from Dr. Kalsner-Silver stating that Forbes had reported symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, the symptoms had an adverse effect on her academic performance, and \u201cwith proper psychiatric care and ongoing counseling ... Forbes could potentially function more effectively as a law student.\u201d St. Thomas denied Forbes\u2019s petition for readmission.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Forbes filed an amended complaint that St. Thomas had discriminated against her. Forbes complained that St. Thomas failed to accommodate her disorder by failing to provide a private testing room for Spring examinations and refusing to readmit her conditionally to the law school. Forbes alleged that she had not been given the full accommodations she had requested and she had been wrongfully denied readmission because of her disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">St. Thomas moved for summary judgment, which the district court denied, but St. Thomas later filed a renewed motion for summary judgment. St. Thomas attached to its renewed motion a copy of the student handbook for 2006-07, an affidavit from Dean Hernandez about his meetings with Forbes, and affidavits from Peter Kelly and Cecile Dykas. Kelly, the Director of Student Services, stated that he had met with Forbes and knew that she had been dismissed for academic reasons, but Kelly did not know what standards the committee used to evaluate petitions for readmission. Dykas, a member of the committee, stated that decisions to readmit a student are based on set criteria used to determine whether the student can succeed academically and that the committee determined that Forbes failed to satisfy the criteria required for readmission. The Student Handbook for the 2006-07 academic year stated that a student could petition for readmission but that \u201c[n]o petition shall be granted unless the Committee finds that the record (consisting of the petition, documents submitted in connection with it, the petitioner\u2019s law school file and the preponderance of any credible testimony, if any, given at a hearing) affirmatively demonstrates that the student possesses the requisite ability, and that the prior disqualification ... does not include a lack of capacity, to successfully complete the course of study at the Law School.\u201d The Handbook provided that the committee would \u201cconsider several factors, including, but not limited to ... [t]he best interests of the law school as an educational institution, including the maintenance of high standards of academic excellence ... \u201cthe student\u2019s reasonable prospect for success\u201d; \u201c[a]ny evidence of correctable problems or disabilities that might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>have contributed to the student\u2019s academic performance\u201d; and \u201c[t]he extent to which it appears that a petitioner\u2019s previous medical ... concerns ... have been addressed and satisfactorily resolved.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">After an evidentiary hearing at which Forbes and her counsel failed to appear, the district court granted the renewed motion of St. Thomas. The district court explained that it had learned \u201c[o]n the morning of the hearing\u201d that Forbes\u2019s attorney had been suspended from practicing law, but that Forbes\u2019s lack of representation did not prejudice her because the renewed motion had been \u201cfully briefed\u201d and \u201c[t]he result would have been the same either way.\u201d The district court ruled that St. Thomas \u201c[could not] be liable for violating the [Disability Act] or Rehabilitation Act\u201d because it had \u201cpresented] unre-butted evidence ... [that] Forbes never demonstrated that she was statutorily entitled to accommodations in the first place.\u201d The district court found that Forbes \u201cnever provided medical findings about her disability\u201d after being placed on probation and the letter from Dr. Kalsner-Silver in support of readmission merely \u201crecite[d] Forbes\u2019s self-reported symptoms and note[d] the symptoms [were] consistent with a diagnosis of [post-traumatic stress disorder].\u201d Alternatively, the district court ruled that, \u201ceven if Forbes had adequately documented her disability, or shown that she was <em>regarded </em>as disabled, St. Thomas [had] ... presented unrebut-ted evidence that [it] was justified in denying her request for readmission and/or for other relief.\u201d The district court concluded that St. Thomas reasonably accommodated Forbes by balancing her request with the concerns of the school to preserve integrity in testing, ensure fairness, and prepare students for the practice of law. The district court also concluded that St. Thomas \u201cmade a reasoned judgment that [Forbes] fell short of ... [the] criteria\u201d required for readmission.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The district court did not err when it granted summary judgment in favor of St. Thomas. Unlawful discrimination may occur when an entity fails to \u201cmake reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford ... accommodations to individuals with disabilities,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), but there is no genuine dispute that St. Thomas accommodated Forbes\u2019s alleged disability and that those accommodations were reasonable. Dean Hernandez met with Forbes and \u201cprovide[d] accommodations based on the information [he] possesse[d].\u201d <em>Stewart v. Happy Herman\u2019s Cheshire Bridge, Inc., </em>117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir.1997). Forbes argues that she was entitled to a private examination room, but Forbes failed to provide St. Thomas any information that her alleged disability required a private room. Forbes did not complain about taking her Spring 2007 examinations in a room with four classmates and a proctor. Forbes also argues that she was entitled to a conditional readmission, but St. Thomas was entitled to deny Forbes\u2019s petition for readmission after she had failed to satisfy academic standards under the testing conditions that she had requested. <em>See Wood v. President and Trs. of Spring Hill Coll, in the City of Mobile, </em>978 F.2d 1214, 1222-23 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Forbes argues that she presented evidence that her academic unfitness was a pretext for discrimination in the readmission process, but we disagree. Forbes testified that Peter Kelly, the Director of Student Services, said that Forbes was denied readmission because of her disorder, but \u201c \u2018statements by nondecisionmak-ers, or statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process\u2019 at issue will not satisfy [Forbes\u2019s] burden.\u201d <em>Steger v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>318 F.3d 1066, 1079 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 277, 109 S.Ct. 1775, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>1805, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989)). The record is undisputed that Kelly was not a member of the committee that considered Forbes\u2019s petition for readmission.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Forbes argues that she lacked notice and was \u201cnever given the opportunity ... to respond to the ... [renewed] motion\u201d for a summary judgment because her attorney was suspended from the practice of law, but her argument is belied by the record. Forbes was represented by Richard Brown at least through March 22, 2011, when he filed a notice that \u201ceffective February 21, 2011,\u201d his address had changed. St. Thomas served a copy of its renewed motion on Brown in November 2010, and Brown complied with the order of the district court to respond to the renewed motion by January 10, 2011. In his nine-page response, Brown argued that Forbes had a disability and that a genuine factual dispute existed about whether St. Thomas had provided reasonable accommodations for Forbes.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of St. Thomas.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
