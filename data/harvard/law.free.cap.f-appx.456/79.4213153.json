For the following reasons, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-16\">In 1998, Brown was found guilty by a jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania of possession of cocaine base with the intent to distribute and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He was sentenced to 360 months of imprisonment. This Court affirmed his judgment of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-17\">In June 2009, Brown filed a \u201cmotion for adjustment modification of an imposed term of imprisonment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 3582(c), (1), (B) predicated upon another modifying statute 28 U.S.C.[\u00a7 ] 2255.\u201d He claimed that he was (1) wrongly sentenced as a career offender because the predicate convictions upon which his career offender status was based were improperly designated as crimes of violence, <em>see Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>587 F.3d 203 (3d Cir.2009); (2) denied due process as a result of his improper sentencing; and (3) actually innocent of being a career offender. The District Court treated the motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion and denied it as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-18\">Brown filed a timely motion for reconsideration, arguing that the District Court erred in construing his motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion instead of a \u00a7 3582 motion. He was subsequently appointed counsel, who filed a second motion for reconsideration. Counsel appeared to agree with the District Court\u2019s characterization of the motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion, but argued that the motion was, in fact, timely and that, alternatively, relief was available to Brown pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Court denied both motions for reconsideration. Brown timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u201cWhen a \u00a7 S582 motion requests the type of relief that \u00a7 8582 provides for\u2014 that is, when the motion argues that sentencing guidelines have been modified to change the applicable guidelines used in the defendant\u2019s sentencing \u2014 then the motion is rightly construed as a motion to amend sentencing pursuant to \u00a7 3582.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>500 F.3d 486, 490 (6th Cir.2007). However, \u201cwhen a motion titled as a \u00a7 3582 motion otherwise attacks the petitioner\u2019s underlying conviction or sentence, that is an attack on the merits of the case and should be construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id.; Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002) (\u201cMotions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences that are allegedly in violation of the Constitution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The District Court properly viewed Brown\u2019s motion as having been brought pursuant to \u00a7 2255 because the motion attacks his sentence based on an alleged constitutional violation and/or a fundamental miscarriage of justice that occurred during his sentencing. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). Indeed, Brown\u2019s own filings confirm that he is seeking relief under \u00a7 2255 as the \u201cmodifying statue\u201d that would permit the court to reduce his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, Brown\u2019s contentions that he was inappropriately sentenced as a career offender and that his sentence violates the constitution do not provide a basis for relief under \u00a7 3582(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Nor is Brown entitled to pursue his claims through \u00a7 2241. A prisoner may proceed under \u00a7 2241 if \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate of ineffective.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). We have held that \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csafety valve\u201d applies only in rare circumstances, such as when an intervening change in the statute under which the petitioner was convicted renders the petitioner\u2019s conduct non-criminal. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir. 1997). Brown has not satisfied that standard here, as he makes no allegation that he is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted, but instead asserts only that he is \u201cinnocent\u201d of being a career offender. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120-21 (holding that <em>Dorsainvil </em>did not permit petitioner to challenge sentence via \u00a7 2241 based on intervening change in sentencing law).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Brown must obtain a certificate of ap-pealability to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). We decline to grant him one because reasonable jurists would agree that the District Court correctly dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>his motion as time-barred. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 478, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). A one-year statute of limitations applies to \u00a7 2255 motions and begins to run on the latest of four possible dates, the most common being the date on which the movant\u2019s judgment of conviction became final. \u00a7 2255(f)(1). As Brown\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was filed approximately ten years after his judgment of conviction became final, it is clearly untimely under that approach. Furthermore, none of \u00a7 2255(f)\u2019s alternative start dates applies nor is there any apparent basis for equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we decline to issue a certif\u00edcate of appealability with respect to the District Court\u2019s denial of Brown\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and summarily affirm the remaining aspects of the District Court\u2019s rulings. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\">. Brown\u2019s argument to the contrary is based on \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B), which states that, despite \u00a7 3582(c)'s general prohibition against modification of a term of imprisonment, a court is entitled to modify a sentence when \"otherwise expressly permitted by statute.\u201d That \u00a7 2255 is among the statutes expressly permitting modification of a sentence does not permit Brown to circumvent the requirements applicable to \u00a7 2255 motions by referencing the provision through \u00a7 3582. Furthermore, although district courts are generally required to provide notice to a pro se litigant before re-characterizing a motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion, <em>see United States v. Miller, </em>197 F.3d 644, 652 (3d Cir. 1999), it is difficult to say that the District Court engaged in any re-characterization here given Brown's express reliance on \u00a7 2255. Regardless, the District Court did not err in failing provide notice because the \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely, as discussed further below. <em>See United States v. Chew, </em>284 F.3d 468, 471 (3d Cir.2002) (no <em>Miller </em>warning was required where the statute of limitations already barred petitioner from filing a \u00a7 2255 motion at the time of re-characterization).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
