Quintanilla argues that the district court should have downwardly adjusted his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 because he was a \u201clowly courier in the smuggling operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In light of the record as a whole, Quin-tanilla fails to show that the district court\u2019s denial of the adjustment was clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Franklin, </em>561 F.3d 398, 407 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir. 2005). It was Quintanilla who first greeted Eduardo Villar after the ship arrived in the United States. Further, Quintanilla placed a phone call to Ricardo Castillo to complete the deal and consummated the transaction when he gave Villar cash and took possession of the cocaine. Thus, the record supports a finding that Quintanilla was not peripheral to the drug activity at issue. See <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
