Bailey argues that the district court plainly erred when it determined that his prior convictions for assault were crimes of violence (COVs) warranting a 16-point increase in his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). He concedes that because he did not make this objection in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The government and Bailey agree that the record as supplemented on appeal shows that Bailey was convicted of assault in the first degree under New York Penal Law \u00a7 120.10(3) and assault in the second degree under New York Penal Law \u00a7 120.05(4). Although these supplemental documents were never considered by the district court, it is appropriate for us to consider them on appeal. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 479-80 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Bailey argues that neither of these convictions is a COV within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). He contends these two statutes cannot be characterized as COVs because they require proof of recklessness and not intent. The government argues that both of these convictions qualify as the enumerated offense of aggravated assault and that both of them therefore meet the guideline definition of a COV.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">Section 2L 1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) provides for a 16-level increase to a defendant\u2019s base offense level if he was previously deported after being convicted of a felony that is a COV. <em>United States v. Cervantes-Bianco, </em>504 <em>F.Sd </em>576, 578-79 (5th Cir.2007). The application notes define a COV as (1) any of a list of enumerated offenses, including \u201caggravated assault,\u201d or (2) \u201cany other offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1 (B)(iii). This court uses different tests when analyzing whether a particular offense amounts to a COV, and the test used depends on whether the offense is an enumerated one or has the use of physical force as an element. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Sanchez, </em>456 F.3d 479, 481-82 (5th Cir.2006). The definition of a COV is an either/or proposition, and if the statute falls within one of the enumerated offenses, there is no need to determine whether the statute has as an element the use of force. <em>See United States v. Olalde-Hernandez, </em>630 F.3d 372, 374 (5th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">\u201cBecause the guidelines do not define the enumerated offense of aggravated assault, this court applies a common sense approach, defining the enumerated crime by its generic, contemporary meaning.\u201d <em>United States v. Torres-Diaz, </em>438 F.3d 529, 536 (5th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). \u201cOur primary source for the generic contemporary meaning of aggravated assault is the Model Penal Code.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">Utilizing the common sense approach to compare the Model Penal Code to New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>York Penal Law \u00a7 120.10(3), it is apparent that the only appreciable difference between the authorities is that Model Penal Code \u00a7 211.1(2)(a) requires serious \u201cbodily\u201d injury and \u00a7 120.10(3) requires serious \u201cphysical\u201d injury. Both require a heightened standard of recklessness, in the case of the Model Penal Code \u201cunder circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life,\u201d and in the case of the New York statute, \u201cunder circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life.\u201d N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 120.10(3) (McKinney 1990). This slight variation does not prevent a finding of equivalency. <em>See United States v. Rojas-Gutierrez, </em>510 F.3d 545, 549 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201cEven if the fit between the enumerated offense of aggravated assault and the ordinary, contemporary, and common meaning of aggravated assault may not be precise in each and every way, slight imprecision would not preclude our finding a sufficient equivalence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>557 F.3d 200, 205-07 (5th Cir.2009), we undertook a similar comparison between a state assault statute and the Model Penal Code\u2019s definition of \u201caggravated assault.\u201d Ramirez had been previously convicted under a subsection of New Jersey\u2019s aggravated assault statute that provided as follows: \u201cA person is guilty of aggravated assault if he ... [attempts to cause significant bodily injury to another or causes significant bodily injury purposely or knowingly or, under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life recklessly causes such significant bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206 (quoting N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:12-lb(7) (West 2001)). Comparing this statutory definition to the one for \u201caggravated assault\u201d provided in the Model Penal Code, we concluded under a plain error standard of review that the two were sufficiently similar even though the New Jersey statute used the term \u201csignificant bodily injury\u201d while the Model Penal Code used the term \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207. Likewise, in Bailey\u2019s case, the terms \u201cbodily\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d are sufficiently similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The generic, contemporary meaning of the crime of aggravated assault as established by the Model Penal Code is sufficiently similar to the crime of assault in the first degree as proscribed by New York Penal Law \u00a7 120.10(3). Accordingly, it is an \u201cenumerated offense\u201d for purposes of the \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(1) (A) (ii) enhancement, and the district court did not plainly err by imposing the 16-level enhancement based on this conviction. Because the conviction for assault in the first degree qualifies as a COV and therefore is sufficient to impose the 16-level enhancement, we need not determine whether Bailey\u2019s conviction for assault in the second degree also qualifies as a COV. <em>See United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez, </em>625 F.3d 274, 277 (5th Cir. 2010) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
