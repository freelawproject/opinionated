He also claimed that despite his condition, he was forced to perform manual labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">Where an appellant fails to identify error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if he had not appealed. <em>Brink-mann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are afforded liberal construction, even <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief arguments to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993). Gonzales does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that the defendants are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity for any claims raised against them in their official capacities, so he has abandoned the issue on appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 224-25; <em>Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-17\">This court reviews a summary judgment <em>de novo. Nickell v. Beau View of Biloxi, L.L.C., </em>636 F.3d 752, 754 (5th Cir.2011). Gonzales has made no showing of deliberate indifference. The medical records and Gonzales\u2019s recitation of the facts indicate that he was frequently treated for his kidney stone. He has not shown that defendants ignored his complaints, refused treatment, \u201cor engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.\u201d <em>See Johnson v. Treen, </em>759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir.1985). Gonzales\u2019s claim regarding the ineffectiveness of his pain medication exhibits merely a disagreement about his medical treatment, which is insufficient to raise a genuine dispute as to a material fact on a claim of deliberate indifference. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-18\">With respect to his claim that defendants were deliberately indifferent to his need for work restrictions on account of his medical condition, Gonzales does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that \u201csuch actions were beyond the scope of [the defendants\u2019] practice.\u201d Similarly, he does not challenge the determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>that Isbell did not revoke his work-restriction pass on November 20, 2007, but rather it was the result of a clerical error. By failing to challenge the district court\u2019s reasoning, Gonzales has abandoned the issues on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Gonzales asserts that the court abused its discretion by denying his motions for discovery. The record reflects that the defendants provided Gonzales with copies of his medical records for the relevant time period; relevant portions of the University of Texas Medical Branch\u2019s Offender Orientation Handbook; and relevant portions of Gonzales\u2019s grievance records. Gonzales does not demonstrate how the additional discovery would have rebutted the evidence introduced by defendants demonstrating that he received adequate medical care for his condition. Because he fails to show how the additional discovery would have created a genuine dispute as to a material fact on his deliberate-indifference claim, the court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Raby v. Livingston, </em>600 F.3d 552, 561 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Gonzales has failed to show that the summary judgment was in error, so it is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
