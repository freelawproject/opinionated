Lopez-Sanchez argues that the district court erred in finding that he was not entitled to credit against his 140-month sentence for conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, imposed on September 26, 2008, for time he served on his three-year state sentence prior to the imposition of the federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-22\">In reviewing the denial of habeas relief, the district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and issues of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). A federal sentence commences to run on the date that a person is received at the penitentiary or jail for the service of his sentence. <em>Blackshear v. United States, </em>434 F.2d 58, 59 (5th Cir.1970). A defendant is given credit toward his term of imprisonment for any time he spent in official detention pri- or to the commencement of his sentence \u201cthat has not been credited against another sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-23\">There is no dispute that Lopez-Sanchez received 564 days credit on the federal sentence for the period from March 12, 2007, through September 25, 2008. The issue is whether he was entitled to credit on the federal sentence for time he served on the state sentence prior to March 11, 2007, in light of the district court\u2019s imposition of the 140-month federal sentence to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed in the California case. Section 3585(b) does not mandate that he be given credit against his 140-month sentence for that time. Even it intends to do so, a district court does not have the authority under \u00a7 3585(b) to order a federal sentence to run absolutely concurrently with a prior sentence. <em>United States v. Flores, </em>616 F.2d 840, 841 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-24\">To the extent that Lopez-Sanchez argues that he is entitled to the credit on the federal sentence because the district court in essence applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 at sentencing, this argument is unavailing. Although the district court imposed the 140-month sentence to run concurrently with the state sentence, the district court did not expressly refer to \u00a7 5G1.3(b), and Lo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>pez-Sanchez has not argued that either the parties or the presentence report mentioned \u00a7 5G1.3(b). Moreover, the district court did not state in imposing sentence that Lopez-Sanchez should receive credit for the time he had served on the state sentence prior to the imposition of the federal sentence. Although in his reply-brief Lopez-Sanchez argues that the sentencing court found that \u201crelevant conduct existed between the charges\u201d and that the federal conspiracy arose from the state conduct, the only record evidence he cites in support of this assertion is the sentencing court\u2019s statement at sentencing that the three-year state term of imprisonment \u201cwas also out of drug charges,\u201d which does not constitute a finding that the state conduct was considered by the court to be relevant conduct. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.8. Lopez-Sanchez does not point to anything else in the record supporting his assertion that the state offense was considered relevant conduct for purposes of \u00a7 1B1.3; moreover, he does not argue that the state offense formed the basis for an increase in the offense level. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5G1.3(b). The sentencing transcript does not reflect that the district court intended that \u201cany and all time that [Lopez-Sanchez] spent in state prison would be credited against his federal sentence[].\u201d <em>Haynes v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, </em>413 Fed.Appx. 779, 779 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 788, 181 L.Ed.2d 504 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Lopez-Sanchez has failed to show that the district court erred on any point of law or was clearly erroneous in any finding of fact in denying his claim for habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b455-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
