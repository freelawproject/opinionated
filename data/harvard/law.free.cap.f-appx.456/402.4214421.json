The BIA determined that Padilla-Varela was removable from the United States because she was an alien who had committed an aggravated felony. Padilla-Varela maintains that she is entitled to equitable estoppel of removal because delay by and actions of immigration authorities in processing her application for adjustment of status prevented her from obtaining automatic citizenship by operation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is deportable because she has committed an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Padilla-Varela does not dispute the BIA\u2019s determination that she committed an aggravated felony. We review her equitable estoppel claim attacking the BIA\u2019s finding that she is an alien de novo and conclude that it fails. <em>See Robertson-Dewar v. Holder, </em>646 F.3d 226, 229-30 (5th Cir. 2011). Consequently, Padilla-Varela\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
