The IJ concluded that Yakubu was removable as an alien who was convicted of an aggravated felony and a controlled-substance offense, pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i). On appeal, Yakubu argues that he is not removable because he is not an alien, but a U.S. national. After review, we deny Yakubu\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Yakubu was born in Ghana to parents who are not U.S. citizens. In 1996, Yaku-bu entered the United States on an F-l student visa. In April 2000, Yakubu adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen. In January 2003, Yakubu applied for U.S. citizenship. Yakubu\u2019s citizenship application was denied in November 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">In April 2007, Yakubu was convicted of importing heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a), in the Eastern District of New York. The Department of Homeland Security issued a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) charging that Yakubu was removable, pursuant to INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i), for having been convicted of an aggravated felony and a controlled-substance offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">At a merits hearing, Yakubu admitted that he had been convicted of importing heroin, but denied that he was an alien. Yakubu argued that he was a U.S. national because he had been a lawful permanent resident for at least five years and had applied for naturalization. The IJ entered an order of removal finding that Yakubu was removable because he was an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and a controlled substance offense. The IJ rejected Yakubu\u2019s argument that he was a U.S. national because Yakubu did not derive citizenship through his parents and had not made a formal allegiance to the United States through the naturalization process.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">The BIA dismissed Yakubu\u2019s appeal. The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Yakubu had not established he was a U.S. national, noting that birth and naturalization are the only means of acquiring U.S. nationality under the INA. The BIA concluded that Yakubu could not acquire U.S. nationality by taking an oath of allegiance pursuant to an application of citizenship, that Yakubu had not made a formal allegiance to the United States through the naturalization process and that Yakubu had not claimed to derive citizenship through his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Under the INA, the Attorney General\u2019s removal power is limited to \u201cdeportable aliens.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 237(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a). An alien is \u201cany person not a citizen or national of the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(3). A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>person is a \u201cnational of the United States\u201d if he or she is either a U.S. citizen or \u201ca person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(22), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(22). Under the INA\u2019s statutory scheme, a person can become a U.S. national \u201conly by birth in a United States territory or by completing the naturalization process after birth.\u201d <em>Sebastian-Soler v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>409 F.3d 1280, 1286 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Yakubu contends he is a U.S. national by virtue of (1) his prior (denied) application for U.S. citizenship; (2) his intent to become a U.S. citizen; (3) his registration with the Selective Service; (4) his signing of an oath of allegiance as part of his application for naturalization and his Selective Service registration; and (5) his status as a resident of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Yakubu\u2019s argument is foreclosed by our precedent, which concludes that a lawful permanent resident who has applied for naturalization, but has not completed the naturalization process, is not a U.S. national. <em>See Tovar-Alvarez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2005) (petitioner\u2019s naturalization petition not finished processing before removal proceedings began); <em>Sebastian-Soler, </em>409 F.3d at 1285-86 (petitioner\u2019s naturalization petition denied before removal proceedings began). This is particularly true here where Yaku-bu\u2019s application for citizenship was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Further, the naturalization process is not complete until the applicant for citizenship takes an oath of allegiance during a public ceremony before either the Attorney General or a court with proper jurisdiction. <em>Tovar-Alvarez, </em>427 F.3d at 1352; INA \u00a7 356(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1448(a). The fact that an applicant for U.S. citizenship has signed the oath of allegiance during the application process does not confer status as a U.S. national. <em>See Tovar-Alvarez, </em>427 F.3d at 1351-54 (rejecting petitioner\u2019s claim of U.S. nationality where petitioner had signed the oath of allegiance to the United States during a naturalization interview with an INS official); <em>Sebastian-Soler, </em>409 F.3d at 1282-1284 (rejecting petitioner\u2019s claim of U.S. nationality although petitioner had signed the oath of allegiance during a preliminary examination before an INS official).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">It is undisputed that Yakubu\u2019s citizenship application was denied and Yakubu did not complete the naturalization process by swearing an oath of allegiance to the United States at a public ceremony conducted by either a court or the Attorney General. Given that this is the only way Yakubu could have become a U.S. national, Yakubu remains an alien under the INA. Thus, Yakubu properly was subject to removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">. We lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who is removable for having committed an aggravated felony covered in INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), or a controlled substance offense covered in INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B). INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). However, we retain jurisdiction to review questions of law, which includes the threshold issue of whether the petitioner is \u201c(1) an alien; (2) who is removable; (3) based on having committed a disqualifying offense.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Moore v. Ashcroft, </em>251 F.3d 919, 923 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, we have jurisdiction to review whether Yakubu is an alien or a U.S. national. We review questions of law <em>de novo. Nreka v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1368 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b892-7\">. Although Yakubu argues that <em>Sebastian-Sol-er </em>and <em>Tovar-Alvarez </em>conflict with Supreme Court precedent, none of the Supreme Court cases Yakubu cites support his contention that a lawful permanent resident may become a U.S. national within the meaning of the INA without completing the naturalization process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
