Notice has been given to the defendants in error, on the part of the Counsel for the plaintiff in error, of the filing-the bill of exceptions, and there will be no surprise, or prejudice, by the amendment. The practice of this Coitrt in allowing amendments, will he as liberal as the law will authorize, provided the amendment does not prejudice the rights of others, not before the Court. The Counsel moving the amendment, is the Attorney of record of the parties whose names are proposed to be inserted in the writ, as parties, and they will be bound by his act.
