The Court 'below (Wright, J.) decreed that the plaintiffs, Nina O. Demill and Laura O. Demill, daughters of Emily M. Demill, who was a daughter of Henry J.

This is the point decided by the cases of <em>Godfrey vs. Davis, </em>6 <em>Ves. Jr., </em>49, and <em>Devisme vs. Mello, </em>1 <em>Brown C. C., </em>537, and so the whole line of cases relied on by the defendants below. None of them touch the point of this case, as in none of them arose the question of the interest of representatives of a deceased member of the class.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-6\">According to the construction of the defendants, Reid and the Savings Rank, followed by the Court, the use limited to Henry J. Willett\u2019s children was on a double contingency, viz: \u2014 1. Death of John Willett Belt without children, &amp;e.; 2. survival of that event.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-7\">The correctness of this theory can be easily tested. By striking out the first contingency it will be found that the estate becomes a vested one at once; ergo\u2014 there is no second contingency.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-8\">Had there been no children of Henry J. Willett in existence at tire testator\u2019s death, there would have been such, a second contingency, but this would have come to an end the instant a child was born to him, if before the first contingency fell in. <em>Driver vs. Frank, </em>3 <em>M. &amp; S., </em>25, 32, 37; <em>Carver vs. Jackson, </em>4 <em>Peters, </em>1, 90; <em>Doe vs. Provost, </em>4 <em>Johns., </em>61.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>It is to he noticed that Henry J. Willett died in 1811, so that then the class was in one sense ascertained, as of course no children of his could come into existence after that event. It is well settled that the proper construction of a limitation may be changed hy matter <em>ex post facto. </em>6 <em>Gr. Dig., </em>418.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-5\">The construction contended for hy the appellants is in accord with the whole scheme of the will, and carries out the testator\u2019s general intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-6\">The rule that \u201cchildren\u201d shall not include \u201cdescendants of deceased children\u201d is deemed hy the Courts a harsh one, to he avoided at every favorable opportunity for a contrary construction. 4 <em>Kent Com., </em>345, 349, and cases cited. Just as equity will use all ingenuity in construing expressions so as to include all children, although it may he apparent that only those in existence when the will was made were intended. <em>Conn vs. Conn, </em>1 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>214.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-7\">In <em>Prowitt vs. Rodman, </em>37 <em>N. Y., </em>42, Hunt, J., lays down two propositions. 1. That the term \u201cchildren\u201d may include issue, however remote, and will he held so to include whenever the reason of the thing demands it. 2, In case of a contingent future gift to the \u201cchildren\u201d of a first taker, followed hy a limitation over \u2022for want of such, the presumption is in favor of the first taker\u2019s posterity to his remoter descendants in preference to the donee over. <em>Dunlap vs. Shreeve\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, </em>2 <em>Dunlap, </em>340; <em>Taylor vs. Watson, </em>35 <em>Md., </em>519.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-8\">Turning, now, to the will in question, what do we find? First, a devise, and the very one in question, to John Willett Belt for life, with remainder to \u201cthe child or children of the said John Willett Belt, hy him lawfully begotten. \u201d Could language he stronger to limit the testator\u201ds apparent intention to the children only? For certainly J. W. Belt\u2019s grand-children, would, in no sense, have been \u201cchildren hy him lawfully begotten.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>And yet the testator goes on to say: \u201cBut in case the said John Willett Belt should depart this life without leaving\u2019 a child or descendant thereof living at the time of his death, or in case,\u201d &amp;c., then the ultimate remainder to the children of Henry J. Willett follows. This, and the same identical language in the fifth and seventh clauses of the will, shows conclusively that in the mind of the testator even \u201cchildren\u201d hy a man \u201clawfully begotten,\u201d meant all his descendants or \u201cissue.\u201d And yet the testator in mentioning the \u201cchildren\u201d of Henry J. Willett, if possible, widens the signification of the term, by omitting the qualifying words \u201cby him lawfully begotten.\u201d \u201cWords occurring more than once in a will shall be presumed to be used always in the same sense, unless a contrary meaning appear by the context, or unless the words be applied to a different subject. And upon the same principle where the testator uses an additional word or phrase he shall be presumed to have an additional meaning.\u201d <em>Greenleaf, Cruise\u2019s Dig., VI, </em>168.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-6\">Again in the third clause, he provides, that certain property shall go to the wife of his son Charles during the life of his said son, and after his death, to \u201cbecome the-property of the child or children of the said Charles S. Willett by him lawfully begotten, their heirs and as-' signs, if more than one, to be equally divided between them, share and share alike.\u201d And yet can it be doubted, that the testator intended that Charles\u2019 share of his estate should go to his (Charles\u2019) \u201cissue\u201d or \u201cdescendants,\u201d in the absence of \u201cchildren,\u201d precisely in the same manner as the limitations are made to the \u201cdescendants\u201d of Albert Hornsby in the fifth, and of John W. Belt in the sixth and seventh clauses? Suppose one of Charles\u2019 children had predeceased the testator, leaving a child. The case would then be precisely that of <em>Taylor vs. Watson, </em>35 <em>Md., </em>519. The word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u201cchildren\u201d would be construed to mean \u201cissue\u201d and the grand-child would take the share of its deceased parent. Can any other construction then be given to the same word, used in identically the same connection and in reference to the same subject-matter, in the sixth clause? <em>Osborne vs. McTavish, </em>40 Md., 186.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-5\">And in the fourth clause a contingent remainder is given to the children of Henry <em>J. </em>Willett, in practicall3r the same words, showing that the testator recognized no difference between the two kinds of remainders.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-6\">That the testator used the word \u201cchildren\u201d in the comprehensive sense, which has been indicated throughout the will, is further shown by the fact that when he wishes to limit its signification., he uses apt words for the purpose; as in the concluding portion of the fifth clause where he devises certain property to the \u201cchildren, who shall be living at the time of my (his) death,\u201d of said Henry and Charles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-7\">The construction of the appellees would be equivalent to introducing the word \u201csurviving\u201d before \u201cchildren\u201d in the sixth clause. But even where the bequest was to \u201cbe equally divided amongst my surviving children\u201d by name, Judge Parker, in the case of <em>Hansford vs. Elliott, </em>9 <em>Leigh, </em>79, which is quoted with approval in <em>Branson vs. Hill, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>189, said: \u201cThe bequest is to children specifically named. I cannot believe the testator meant to make a tontine among them, and if all but one died before the mother, for that one to take all in exclusion of grand-children or their descendants.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-8\">It is a familiar principle that, \u201cof two modes of construction, that is to be preferred which will prevent a total <em>intestacy.\u201d- </em>\u2014 Jarman\u2019s <em>Rules. </em>Now, using the language of Robinson, J., in <em>Branson vs. Hill, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>190, <em>mutatis mutandis </em>\u201csuppose all the children of Henry had died, leaving children, before the happening of the contingency; if the construction insisted upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>hv the defendants be correct, it would follow that none of them would be entitled to take in remainder. We should thus have a case of intestacy, where <em>it </em>is plain no intestacy was intended. * * * Could a construction be more repugnant to the intention of the testator, wdiich speaks to us from the four corners of the will? \u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-6\"><em>Harry M. Benzinger, </em>and <em>Arthur Geo. Brown, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-7\">The word <em>children </em>in its ordinary and popular signification, means immediate offspring, and such in general is its legal construction. <em>Stump vs. Jordan, </em>54 <em>Md., </em>619, 628 ; 2 <em>Jarman on Wills, (.Randolph &amp; Talcott\u2019s Ed.,) top page </em>690, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-8\">The ordinary, popular and legal sense of the word children embraces only the first generation of offspring, and for it to be extended further, there must either be something in the context showing that a larger signification is intended, or the person using it must know that there is neither then, nor can afterwards be, any person to whom the term can be applied in an appropriate sense. <em>Willis vs. Jenkins, </em>30 <em>Georgia, </em>167.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-9\">The word children, does not ordinarily denote grandchildren, and is never so construed, except in cases where it is indispensably necessary to effectuate the obvious intent of the testator. <em>Sheets, et ux. vs. Grubbs, Ex\u2019r, 4 Metcalf, </em>(Ky.,) 339. Nothing is clearer in the law than that under an ultimate limitation upon a contingency to a class of persons by a clear and certain designation, none but the persons in being at the time when the contingency occurs, and then answering to the description, can take. <em>Godfrey vs. Davis, </em>6 <em>Vesey, Jr., </em>48; <em>Devisme vs. Mello, </em>1 <em>Brown C.

Willett\u2019s grand-children should' be included in the provision made in favor of his children by the sixth item.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-6\">An examination of the unequal and widely different provisions and dispositions of property made in and by the items of the will, from one to nine inclusive, will furnish a sufficient answer to this suggestion, and show that it is entirely fanciful.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-7\">A strenuous effort was made in the Court beloAv to show that the provision referred to in the sixth item is an executory devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-8\">It is believed that a reference to the opinion of the learned Judge of the Circuit Court together with the authorities which are there cited and commented upon by him, will furnish a complete answer to that argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-9\">The provision in question is neither a springing nor a shifting use; nor an executory interest of any kind, but is a contingent remainder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-10\">In <em>Williams on Real Property, </em>it is said, at page 289, marg.: \u201cContingent remainders are future estates, which, as we have seen, were, until recently, continually liable,' in law, until they actually existed <em>as estates, </em>to be destroyed altogether; executory interests, on the other hand, are future estates, which in their nature are indestructible. They arise, AArhen their time comes, as of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>their own inherent strength; they depend not for protection on any prior estates, hut on the contrary, they themselves often put an end to any prior estates which may be subsisting'.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-5\">At page 290, marg.: \u201cExecutory interests created under the Statute of Uses, are called <em>springing or shifting uses.\u201d </em>At page 292, marg.: \u201cFrom the above examples, an idea may be formed of the shifts and devices which can now be effected in settlements of land, by means of springing and shifting uses. By means of a use, a future estate may be made to spring up with certainty at a given time. It may be thought, therefore, that contingent remainders, having until recently been destructible, would never have been made use of in modern conveyancing, but that everything would have been made to assume the shape of an executory interest. This, however, is not the case. For, in many instances, future estates are necessarily required to wait for the regular expiration of those which precede them; and when this is the case, no art or device can prevent such estates from being what they are, contingent remainders.\u201d See also I <em>Feurne on Remainders, </em>373.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-8\">Notwithstanding the unwillingness of the appellants to admit that the provision in question is a contingent remainder, the appellees contend that such it is, and that \u201cno art or device can prevent\u201d it from being a contingent remainder, or make it anything else.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-9\">The disputed provision of the will in the case of <em>Doe d. Herbert vs. Selby, </em>2 <em>Barn. &amp; Cress., </em>926, was to all intents and purposes identical with this, as a comparison will show. That was a case which fell under the class which has been defined as follows: \u201cHowever, we are to remember, that although a fee cannot, in conveyances at common law, be mounted on a fee, yet two or more several contingent fees may be limited merely as substitutes or alternatives, one for the other, and not to interfere; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\u25a0so that one only take effect, and every subsequent limitation by a disposition substituted in the room of the former, if the former should fail of effect.\u201d <em>Fearne, </em>373.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-5\">\u201cTwo or more contingent remainders in fee majr be limited as substitutes or alternatives, one for the other, so that one only take effect, and every subsequent limitation be substituted for the former if it should fail of effect.\u201d <em>Leake, Digest of the Law of Property in Land, </em>338.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-6\">Those principles have been established and applied by this Court, notably in <em>Glagett vs. Worthington, </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>83, 91, 92, 93, and <em>Woollen, Trustee vs. Frick &amp; Golder, Ex\u2019rs, </em>38 <em>Md., </em>428. See also 2 <em>Jarman on Wills, (Randolph &amp; Talcott\u2019s Ed.,) page 489; Waddell vs. Rattew, 5 Rawle, </em>231.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-7\">In this case the first conting'ent remainder was as follows: \u201cAnd from and immediately after the decease of the said John Willett Belt, then in trust, that the said principal estate and property shall go to, and become the property of the child or children of the said John Willett Belt, by him lawfully begotten, if any, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns if more than one, to be equally divided between them as tenants in common. \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-9\">The second, under which the appellants claim .was a substituted, alternative contingent remainder, which was as follows: \u201cBut in case the\u2022 said&lt;&gt; John Willett Belt should depart this life, without leaving a child or descendant thereof, living at the time of his death. \u201d * * * \u201cthen in trust that the said principal estate and property shall go to, and become the property of the children of my said son, Henry J. Willett, their heirs and assigns, to -be equally divided between them as tenants in common. \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-11\">There was a third provision, based upon the imssibility that John Willett Belt might leave a child or descendants living at the time of his death, who might all sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>sequently die under age, and without issue living at the time of his, her or their decease which could only have taken effect as an executory devise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-5\">Therefore, in the nature of the case, and under the authorities cited, only those <em>children </em>of Henry J.

By this clause the testator devised certain real estate to his son, Henry J. Willett, \u201cto hold the same unto the said Henry J. Willett, his heirs, executors and administrators, in trust and confidence nevertheless, and to and for and upon the uses, trusts and purposes following, that is to say: In trust for the use and benefit of my grandson, John Willett Belt, during the term of his natural life, so that he, during that period, be permitted and suffered to have and enjoy the said trust property and premises, and the rents, issues and profits thereof to receive, take and apply to his own use and benefit; and from and immediately after the decease of the said John Willett Belt, then in trust that the said principal estate and property shall go to and become the property of the child or children of the said John Willett Belt, by him lawfully begotten, if any, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, if more than one, to be equally divided between them as tenants in common. But in case the said John Willett Belt should depart this life, without leaving a child or descendant thereof living at the time of his death, or in case he should have a child, children or descendants of the same living at the time of his death, and such child, children, descendant, and descendants should all subsequently depart this life under lawful age, and without issue living at the time of his, her or their decease, then in trust that the said principal estate and property <em>shall go to and become the property of the children of my sa/id son Henry J. Willett, their heirs and assigns, to be equally divided between them as tenants in common. \u2019 \u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The testator died in October, 1860, and his son Henry J. Willett accepted the trust for the benefit of his grand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>son, John Willett Belt, who enjoyed the property during his life, and died in October, 1886, without leaving, a child or descendant thereof living at the time of his death. The son, Henry J. Willett died in August, 1877, and had six children <em>three of ivhom are now living. </em>One died in 1875 intestate and leaving no descendants; another died in the life-time of her father, leaving an only child, who also died in the life-time of the said Henry J. Willett leaving no issue. The other, Mrs. Emily M. Demill died before her father in May, 1874, 'leaving <em>four daughters, </em>her only heirs-at-law, all of whom are now living. Uj)on this state of facts the question is, do these four daughters of Mrs. Demill take the interest in this property which their mother would harm taken had she survived the life tenant, John Willett Belt, or does it all go to the three children of Henry J. Willett who did survive the life tenant?</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">As to the character .of the estates thus created, we have no difficulty. It is a clearly established general rule in the contraction of wills that a limitation which may operate as a remainder shall not be construed an executory devise. Here there is first a life estate given to the grandson, Belt, and upon his death alternative contingent remainders in fee are limited, first, to the child or children of Belt, if he leaves any, which shall attain lawful age, or die before that time leaving issue, and failing this then to the children of the testator\u2019s son Henry. If Belt had left a child who attained the age of twenty-one, or died before that time leaving issue, the fee would have vested in such child or issue, and such vesting would forever have excluded any possible future interest in the children of Henry J. Willett. Their interest took effect only upon the failure of the preceding contingency. There are, therefore, here two contingent fees not limited to take effect the one upon or after the other, but the one to take effect to the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>exclusion of tlie other, and the falling out of the contingencies is to decide which of the two is to take effect. It is a case illustrating the statement made by <em>Fearne, </em>318: \u201cHowever, we are to remember, that although a fee cannot, in conveyances at common law, be mounted on a fee, yet two or more several contingent fees may be limited merely as substitutes or alternatives one for the other, and not to interfere; but so that one only take effect, and every subsequent limitation be a disposition substituted in the room of the former, if the former should fail of effect. Thus in the above cited case of <em>Loddington vs. Kime, </em>it was held, that the first remainder was a contingent remainder in fee to the issue of A, and the remainder to B, was also a contingent fee, not contrary to, or in any degree derogatory from the effect of the former, but by way of' substitution for it. And this sort of alternative limitation, was termed a contingency with a double aspect. For if' A had issue male, the remainder was to vest in that issue in fee; but if A had no issue male, then it was to vest in B, in fee; and these were limitations of which the one was not expectant upon, and to take effect after the other, but were cotemporary; to commence from the same period, not indeed together, but the one to take effect in lieu of the other, if that failed.\u201d Other authorities to the same effect are the cases of' <em>Clagett vs. Worthington, </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>83; <em>Woollen, Trustee vs. Frick and Golder, Ex\u2019rs, </em>38 <em>Md., </em>428; <em>Herbert vs. Selby, 2 Barn. &amp; Cress., </em>927; <em>Waddell vs. Rattew, </em>5 <em>Rawle, </em>231.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">As to the other question there is more difficulty, Mrs. Demill was one of the children of Henry J. Willett, was <em>in esse </em>at the death of John Willett the testator, but died before the happening of the contingency, which made the substituted contingent remainder in fee to the children of John Henry Willett take effect or vest. Did she take an interest which was transmissible to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>children? As a general rule a contingent remainder of inheritance is transmissible to the heirs of the <em>person </em>to whom it is limited, if such person chances to die before the contingency happens. <em>Fearne, </em>364. Chancellor Kent states the rule thus: \u201cIt is settled that all contingent estates of inheritance, as well as springing and executory uses, and possibilities coupled with an interest, <em>where the person to take is certain, </em>are transmissible by descent, and are devisable and assignable.\u201d 4 <em>Kent, </em>262. This doctrine is vigorously criticised <em>by Mr. Bingham </em>in his hook on <em>Descents, {see. </em>6,) hut it has been recognized by this Court in several cases,-and Ave are, of course, bound by those decisions. The rule by its terms applies where the person to take is certain, that is, Avhere an individual is named or definitely described as the party to take when the contingency happens; and of this the case of <em>Hambleton vs. Darrington, </em>36 <em>Md., </em>435, affords an illustration. Of like character are the other Maryland cases to which reference has been made. <em>Snively vs. Beavans, et al., </em>1 <em>Md., </em>208; <em>Buck vs. Lantz, </em>49 <em>Md., </em>\u25a0444. Now does this rule apply to a case where there is a limitation by way of contingent remainder to <em>children </em>as a class, and where there are those of the class answering the description, and capable of taking at the time the contingency happens and the estate arises and becomes vested?</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">A large number of cases have been cited to sustain either side of this proposition, but we do not deem it necessary to refer to them at length, or to discuss the principles, or draw the distinctions on which they rest. We must look to the will before us, and keep in mind certain familiar rules applicable to the construction of all wills. Now the first object the testator had in view in constructing this clause of his will undoubtedly was to provide for his grandson and his children or descendants. This was his primary purpose, and there he sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>posed the property would go. But should it so happen that his grandson should leave no child or descendants, then, and in that event, he said the property should go, not to his own children or his own surviving children, hut \u201cto the children of his son Henry.\u201d He describes those who should. take in that event, as he had a clear right to do, and fixed the time at which the description was to be applied. He had the clear right to do this, and a Court has no right to put other words into his will, or to place upon those he has used any other than their usual and accepted meaning; and clearly not where there is no necessity for doing so. The word \u201cchildren\u201d does not ordinarily denote \u201cgrand-children,\u201d and is not to be s.o construed, unless the will clearly manifests that such was the intention of the testator. It is quite impossible to say in this case that the testator meant that grand-children as well as children of his son should share in the estate when the contingency which he had prescribed fell out. Nor is there any necessity for putting such a construction on his language, for there are children here to take, and in such a case Sir William Grant said, \u201cI never knew an instance where there were children to answer the proper description, that grand-children were permitted to share along with them; although, where there is a total want of children, grand-children have been let in under a liberal construction of the word children. \u201d <em>Orford vs. Churchill, </em>3 <em>Ves. &amp; Bea., </em>69. It seems to us to be clear law, as well as good sense, that in a case like this where there is an ultimate limitation upon a contingency to a <em>class of persons </em>plainly described, and there are persons answering the description <em>in esse </em>when the contingency happens, they alone can take.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The Supreme Court of New Hampshire, in a very well considered case, and after a careful review of the authorities said: \u201cThe result, then, of the authorities, in our opinion, is, that, if there be a bequest to one for life, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>and then to the children of the testator, or the survivors of them, those children will take, who, at the death of the tenant for life, answer the description in the will, to the Exclusion of the representatives of those who are then dead. This, we think, is the rule when the bequest is in these terms and nothing more; subject, of course, to be controlled by a manifestation in the will of a different intention.\u201d <em>Hill vs. Bockingham Bank, </em>45 <em>N. H., </em>270. That case is a much stronger one than this, for there the limitation after the life estate was to the <em>testator\u2019s </em>living or surviving children, and if such words, as \u201cliving,\u201d \u201csurviving\u201d or \u201cremaining\u201d had been used in this will, it might possibly have opened the way for a reference of them to the children of the son living, surviving, or remaining at the death of the testator, which would have let in Mrs. Demill to a share or interest in this property. Again in <em>Turner vs. Withers, </em>23 <em>Md., </em>18, a testator devised property to his son and four daughters for life, to be equally divided between them, and in case his son. or either of his daughters should die leaving children or descendants living at the time of his death, his or her share should go to such child or descendants in fee; but, should either of them die without leaving any children or descendants alive at the time of his or her death, the share of the child so dying \u201cshall be equally divided between my remaining children during the term of their natural lives.\u201d The son died shortly after the testator, without leaving children or descendants, and the four daughters then divided the estate between them. Then, Mary, one of the daughters died <em>leaving children; </em>then Margaret, another daughter, died without leaving children, and the question was, what became of Margaret\u2019s share. The two surviving sisters, children of the testator, claimed the whole of it, while the children of Mary, who were the grand-children of the testator claimed a share of it. The Court held, as here, that the remainder was limited with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>a double aspect; that if Margaret left a child or descendants alive at the time of her death then to them in fee, hut if she left none, (which was the contingency that actually happened,) then the devise was to the remaining children of the testator for life; and in reference to this the Court said: \u201cThe parties taking the remainder take hy purchase as devisees under the will, and must <em>answer the description </em>of the parties named as devisees, and it is clear that no one can take <em>except a child </em>of the testator. The children of Mary do not answer this description, and cannot, claim as devisees.\u201d Bo in this case we hold that no one can take as devisee under this limitation except those who were <em>children </em>of Henry J. Willett at the time the contingency happened, and we find nothing in other parts of the will to warrant the inference that the testator intended any thing else, nor any necessity for putting a different construction on his language.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b215-7\">(Decided 12th June, 1889.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
