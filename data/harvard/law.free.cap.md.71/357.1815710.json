The bill prayed for a specific performance, for a reimbursement of all money expended upon the premises during the occupancy of the complainant, for a receiver to receive the rents and profits of the premises pending the suit* for an injunction, and for general relief. The defendant demurred to the bill.

The exhibits are the contract of renting between Simpson and the complainant, dated the 9th of February, 1885, and the tax bills paid by the latter, which support the averments of the bill in relation thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">As the case is presented we must assume the averments of the bill to be true; and we think there is error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>in the decree appealed from, which denies the plaintiff any relief whatever. As we read this bill, it does not present the case merely of a promise by a father to give land to his son by will, \u2014 an instrument inherently revokable, \u2014 but a case where there was a positive gift by the father to the son of land which the father had laid off and designated as the son's share of his estate in the will which he then executed, and 'exhibited to \u2022 all his children. The son was put in immediate possession by the father, and was thus encouraged to treat the property as his own. He remained in undisturbed possession as owner, by himself and his tenant, from September, 1881, to December, 1888, and during his own occupancy expended at least f1000 of his own money in permanent improvements, with, as may be fairly inferred from the statements of the bill, his father's knowledge and assent. \u2018 The father also had the land transferred on the assessment books from his own name to that of his son, and the latter thereafter paid the taxes thereon. The son made these improvements, and paid the taxes, relying upon the good faith of these assurances of his father that the land was\u2019 to be, and <em>in fact was, </em>his property. Upon this state of case, which, upon the demurrer, must be assumed to be true, we think it clear the complainant is entitled to the injunction prayed for. Neither he nor his tenant can be immediately and unconditionally ousted from possession by the defendant. He is also entitled to compensation for the improvements thus made, and to a decree establishing a lien therefor on the property. Relief to this extent, at least, is clearly authorized by the cases of <em>Shepherd vs. Bevin, et al., </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>32; <em>Haines vs. Haines, </em>4 <em>Md. Ch. Dec., </em>133, and same case on appeal in 6 <em>Md., </em>435; <em>Hardesty vs. Richardson, Ex\u2019r, </em>44 <em>Md., </em>617, and <em>King vs. Thompson, </em>9 <em>Pet., </em>204. Whether, upon the same authorities, he w'ould or would not be entitled to a decree for the immediate con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>veyauce of the land to him hy deed is a question we do not now decide. It may well he, so far as the hill shows, that both parties understood that the legal title should be made hy and derived from the will of the father; and there is no averment that the will executed at the time has been destroyed, or that the father has changed his intentions in this respect, or that he will not eventually carry them out.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b383-8\">(Decided 15th November, 1889.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">There is nothing to show that the son will not ultimately get the title under his father\u2019s will. This question,, therefore, can better he decided after answer and proof. All that we now decide is that, upon the averments of the hill, the son is entitled to relief to the extent indicated. The whole aspect of the case may be changed upon the coming in of the answer and proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\n<em>Decree reversed, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
