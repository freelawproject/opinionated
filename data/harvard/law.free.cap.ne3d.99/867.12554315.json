We conclude that it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Background and Motion Practice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In January 2001, Girtha Butler sustained personal injuries in a motor vehicle accident involving a bus on which she was a passenger. The bus was owned by defendant, New York City Transit Authority. It did not have no-fault coverage and instead was self-insured with respect to that risk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff, Contact Chiropractic, P.C., subsequently provided health services to\n   Butler for the personal injuries she sustained in the accident. Butler assigned to plaintiff her right to recover first-party benefits from the self-insured defendant. To that end, plaintiff submitted its claims, bills, and no-fault verification forms to defendant between March 14, 2001 and August 27, 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 8, 2007, plaintiff commenced this action seeking, among other things, reimbursement for allegedly outstanding invoices. After joining issue, defendant moved for an order to, among other things, dismiss the complaint \"based on [plaintiff's] failure to commence the action within the three-year statute of limitations.\" Defendant contended that the three-year statute of limitations under CPLR 214(2), which applies to actions to recover upon a liability created or imposed by statute, governs this case because defendant was self-insured at the time of the subject accident and therefore had no contract for insurance with respect to that loss, as opposed to CPLR 213(2), which establishes a six-year period of limitations for an action based upon a contractual obligation or liability. Defendant relied upon authority of the Appellate Division, First Department, providing that a self-insured's \"obligation to provide no-fault benefits arises out of the no-fault statute,\" and that \"the three-year statute of limitations as set forth in CPLR 214(2)\" applies to disputes with respect to the payment of such benefits by a self-insured (\n   <em>\n    M.N.

For its part, plaintiff relied upon authority of the Appellate Division, Second Department, providing that an injured person's \"claim for\n   uninsured motorist benefits against a self-insured vehicle owner, while statutorily mandated, remains contractual rather than\n   statutory in nature and, as such, is subject to the six-year statute of limitations\" (\n   <em>\n    Matter of ELRAC, Inc. v.

The court reasoned that \"[n]either self-insured nor governmental status supports a shortened\n   statute of limitations\"; in support of that point, the court noted that the Second Department has applied a six-year statute of limitations to no-fault claims, regardless of whether the prospective payor has an insurance policy or is self-insured (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Suero,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3883992\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/38/544/#p545\">\n    38 A.D.3d at 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3883992\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/38/544/#p545\">\n    831 N.Y.S.2d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant subsequently moved for leave to renew the motion, and the court granted renewal but adhered to the prior determination. In this order, the court acknowledged the \"split of authority\" in the Appellate Division with respect to this statute of limitations question, and deemed controlling the Second Department case law applying a six-year statute of limitations in cases such as this one on the ground that \"no-fault matters ... are arguably contractual in nature, even when dealing with a self-insured entity such as [defendant].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    The Appeals in the Lower Courts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, the Appellate Term affirmed the order determining the motion to renew and applying the six-year statute of limitations to this matter (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055460\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/42/60/\">\n    42 Misc.3d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055460\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/42/60/\">\n    979 N.Y.S.2d 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [App. Term, 2d Dept., 2d, 11th, and 13th Jud.

To the extent a registrant elects to forgo insurance, the alternative form of financial security chosen (be it self-insurance under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 316 or the financial security bond referenced in section 312 ) must satisfy Insurance Law \u00a7 5103, which generally requires the payment of no-fault benefits (minimum amounts of which are specified in 11 NYCRR 65-1.1 ) and which applies its provisions to any contract for insurance that does not meet the demands of that article ( Insurance Law \u00a7 5103[h] ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

The term \"insurer\" is defined in the No-Fault Law as \"the insurance company or the self-insurer, as the case may be\" ( Insurance Law \u00a7 5102[g] ). Although technically a self-insurer, defendant is nonetheless considered the functional equivalent of an \"insurer\" for the\n   purposes of administering no-fault coverage. Indeed, self-insurance is different from insurance only insofar as \"the self-insurer has assumed the risk of personally satisfying any tort judgments against it\" (\n   <em>\n    ELRAC, Inc. v.

But, in this context, the obligation to provide no-fault benefits is\n   <em>\n    functionally\n   </em>\n   the same for insurers and self-insurers.

Giving self-insurers, based on no substantive difference in their obligation to pay, a shorter limitations period than those who obtain insurance policies, leads to arbitrary and inequitable outcomes in the provision of no-fault benefits. Consider the scenario of a private automobile, insured through a policy of insurance, colliding with a public bus,\n   insured through a certificate of self-insurance. The driver of the car and a passenger on the bus suffer relatively minor injuries requiring medical treatment. They both seek payment for first-party medical benefits from those obligated to pay. Under the majority's holding, the injured driver will have six years to file suit based on the failure to pay first-party benefits, but the injured passenger will have only three years. By the mere fortuity that a public bus company is \"self-insured,\" the injured passenger is put at significant disadvantage. From an injured claimant's perspective, however, the right to recover benefits from a self-insurer is no different than the equivalent right under a contract of insurance\n   issued to a private automobile owner (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Country-Wide Ins.

The rule now put forward by the majority raises the troubling appearance that an equally-deserving claimant could be barred from recovering benefits merely because the offending party effectively \"bought\" self-insured status.
