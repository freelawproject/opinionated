This Court reverses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} While aiding the Drug Task Force, Officer Kelly Moran was asked to follow a truck that had just left a suspected drug house. The truck had two occupants: the driver and his passenger, Bramley. Because the truck had an excessively loud muffler, Officer Moran stopped it on that basis and took the driver's and Bramley's information. He relayed their information to the Drug Task Force and learned that the task force was familiar with both of them. As a result, he requested a canine unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} A canine unit responded shortly thereafter. Though the canine expressed some interest in the truck, it did not positively alert. Accordingly, Officer Moran verbally warned the driver about his muffler and told him and Bramley they were free to go. He then proceeded to ask the\n   driver several questions, culminating in a request to search the truck. The driver agreed to the search, and Officer Moran had Bramley exit the truck. Before searching the truck, Officer Moran briefly spoke with Bramley and asked him to consent to a search of his person. Bramley agreed and, when Officer Moran conducted his search, he found crack cocaine in Bramley's pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} A grand jury indicted Bramley on one count of felony possession. Bramley filed a motion to suppress, and the court scheduled the matter for a hearing. Following the hearing, the court granted Bramley's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The State now appeals from the court's suppression ruling and raises a single assignment of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    The trial court erred in granting Appellee Bramley's motion to suppress evidence where the search at issue was conducted during a consensual encounter and with Appellee Bramley's voluntary consent. Even if this court were to find that the interaction in question was continued detention, there was sufficient reasonable suspicion to continue Bramley's detention past the traffic stop and search Bramley's person.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In its assignment of error, the State argues that the trial court erred when it granted Bramley's motion to suppress. The State argues that Bramley voluntarily consented to Officer Moran's search. In the alternative, the State argues that the officer had reasonable suspicion to conduct the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellate review of a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Officer Kelly Moran was assisting the Drug Task Force when they asked him to follow a truck that was leaving a suspected drug house. Officer Moran located the truck, noted that it had an excessively loud muffler, and initiated a stop on that basis. Before approaching the truck, he saw the front seat passenger make furtive movements in the direction of the center console. He then approached and obtained the name of both the driver and the passenger, whom he identified as Bramley. Officer Moran relayed the driver's and Bramley's names to the Drug Task Force and learned that the task force was familiar with both individuals. Consequently, he asked the task force to send a canine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The canine handler led the canine around the truck. Though the canine was \"interested in the truck,\" it did not positively alert. Accordingly, Officer Moran approached the truck, verbally warned the driver about his muffler, and told him he was free to go. Without informing the occupants that the canine had failed to positively alert, the officer then asked the driver if there was a reason the canine was interested in his truck, if there was anything illegal in the truck, or if anyone had recently smoked marijuana in the truck. The driver answered no to each question, but Officer Moran nonetheless asked him for consent to search the truck. The driver \"eventually gave [his consent] after initially refusing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Officer Moran first removed Bramley from the truck. He asked Bramley about the furtive movements he had observed, and Bramley admitted that he had hidden an open container between his seat and the center console. The officer then asked Bramley to consent to a search of his person, and Bramley agreed. Inside Bramley's pants pocket, Officer Moran found a baggie containing crack cocaine. He then handcuffed Bramley, placed him in his cruiser, and searched both the truck and the driver. Officer Moran estimated that 20 minutes elapsed between his initial traffic stop and Bramley's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The trial court determined that Officer Moran lacked a constitutional basis to detain Bramley once the canine failed to positively alert and he verbally warned the driver about his muffler. The court concluded that, at that point, the violation giving rise to the traffic stop had been addressed and Officer Moran lacked reasonable suspicion to support a continued detention. Though Officer Moran told Bramley and the driver they were free to leave, the court determined that the additional questions he asked immediately thereafter gave rise to an illegal detention. The court wrote that \"the specific wording of [the] questions implied, and would lead a reasonable person to believe based on the totality of the circumstances, that the [canine] had in fact alerted on the truck.\" The court further concluded that the consent Bramley gave for a search of his person was involuntary. The court elaborated: \"The overhead lights on Officer Moran's police cruiser were still activated, and by this time, there were multiple other police cruisers at the scene of the traffic stop.\" Because \"[a] reasonable person in Bramley's position would not [have] believe[d] he had the freedom to refuse to answer questions and could in fact [have left],\" the court granted his motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The State argues that Officer Moran did not illegally detain Bramley and that Bramley voluntarily consented to a search of his person. The State notes that Officer Moran told Bramley and the driver they were free to go. It further notes that Officer Moran was the only officer speaking with them and never threatened them, physically touched them, or displayed his weapon. According to the State, a reasonable person in Bramley's position would have felt free to refuse to answer further questions or leave. Consequently, the State argues that his consent was a product of free will rather than compulsion. Alternatively, it argues that Officer Moran's search of Bramley was supported by reasonable suspicion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Upon review, one of the trial court's factual findings is not supported by competent, credible evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5579424\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/110/71/\">\n    110 Ohio St.3d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-3665\">\n    2006-Ohio-3665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=850%20N.E.2d%201168\">\n    850 N.E.2d 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 100. Contrary to the court's finding, there was no testimony that \"there were multiple other police cruisers at the scene of the traffic stop\" when Officer Moran asked Bramley for consent to search his person. Though the canine unit clearly had arrived on scene sometime before the search, no one testified that the canine unit remained on scene once the canine completed its sweep of the truck. Officer Moran was the only witness to testify at the suppression hearing, and he was never asked about the presence of other officers. Consequently, the evidence does not support the trial court's finding on that point, and this Court need not accept it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. McLemore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-2116\">\n    2014-Ohio-2116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20N.E.3d%201186\">\n    10 N.E.3d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25.

The officer acknowledged that he stopped the truck due to an excessively loud muffler and that the canine he called to the scene sniffed the truck and did not alert. At that point, the officer issued the driver a verbal warning for his muffler and informed him that he was free to leave. Officer Moran acknowledged that, had the driver refused to engage with him further, he would have allowed him to leave. Thus, the record evinces that he had accomplished the initial goal of his investigatory stop before he\n   began asking more questions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rackow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-507\">\n    2008-Ohio-507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20351455\">\n    2008 WL 351455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 8.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1614\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Though Officer Moran could briefly extend his seizure to ask the driver questions about the presence of contraband,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1132514\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/80/234/#p241\">\n    80 Ohio St.3d at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=685%20N.E.2d%20762\">\n    685 N.E.2d 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , none of the driver's answers gave rise to reasonable suspicion to search the truck.

The remaining question is whether, despite the unlawful detention, Bramley voluntarily consented to a search of his person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} As noted, \"[v]oluntary consent, determined under the totality of the circumstances, may validate an otherwise illegal detention and search.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinette\n   </em>\n   at 241,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=685%20N.E.2d%20762\">\n    685 N.E.2d 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Officer Moran obtained Bramley's consent to search while he was unlawfully detained, it was the State's burden to show that a reasonable person in his position would have felt he \"had the freedom to refuse to answer further questions and could in fact [have left].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=685%20N.E.2d%20762\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at paragraph three of the syllabus. The trial court concluded that a reasonable person in Bramley's position would not have felt free to leave because (1) the specific wording of Officer Moran's questions to the driver implied that the canine had alerted on the truck, (2) the officer's overhead lights were activated, and (3) there were multiple other police cruisers on scene. The court's analysis is problematic for at least two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The first reason the court's analysis is problematic is that one of the circumstances on which it relied lacks a foundation in the record. As previously noted, there was no evidence that multiple police officers or cruisers were present when Bramley consented to a search of his person. No one asked Officer Moran that question, and he was the only witness to testify at the suppression hearing. Because there was no proof that additional officers were present, the trial court should not have relied on that fact in considering the totality of the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The second reason that the court's analysis is problematic is that it focused extensively on the conversation Officer Moran had with the driver of the truck. The court went into specific detail about the exact wording of the questions Officer Moran posed to the driver and whether he made it appear as if the canine had alerted on the truck. Yet, the issue was whether Bramley voluntarily consented\n   <em>\n    to a search of his person\n   </em>\n   , not whether the driver voluntarily consented\n   <em>\n    to a search of his truck\n   </em>\n   . Officer Moran testified that he asked Bramley to exit the truck after the driver agreed to let him search it. Before conducting any search, Officer Moran asked Bramley about the furtive movements he had seen him make. Bramley then admitted to having stashed an open container in the truck. At that point, Officer Moran asked Bramley to consent to a search of his person, and Bramley agreed. There was no testimony that he\n   hesitated or answered equivocally. Indeed, Officer Moran described Bramley as \"very cooperative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In\n   <em>\n    State v. Starks\n   </em>\n   , an officer conducted a random license plate check and stopped a car in which Starks was a passenger.\n   <em>\n    State v. Starks\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 27347,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-2137\">\n    2015-Ohio-2137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203498649\">\n    2015 WL 3498649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9. The officer collected the driver's and Starks' information and, while he was verifying their identities, a second officer arrived on scene.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203498649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The first officer ultimately discovered that the driver had an outstanding warrant, so the driver was arrested and placed in a cruiser.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203498649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because Starks did not have a valid license, a decision was made to tow the car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Starks exited the car so that the officers could conduct an inventory search.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Before the inventory search occurred, however, one of the officers asked Starks if he had anything illegal on his person.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Starks said no, the officer asked if he could search Starks' person, and Starks agreed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The officer found drugs inside Starks' pockets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Starks later claimed that his consent was involuntary, but this Court concluded otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. We noted that the officer who asked for Starks' consent did so in a non-threatening way and there was no evidence that either officer on scene drew a weapon or made an unlawful showing of authority.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. Consequently, this Court concluded that Starks voluntarily consented to a search of his person.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Although the consent in\n   <em>\n    Starks\n   </em>\n   arose in the context of a lawful detention rather than an unlawful one, this Court finds the case instructive. As in\n   <em>\n    Starks\n   </em>\n   , Bramley had to exit the vehicle in which he was a passenger because the police intended to search the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. As in\n   <em>\n    Starks\n   </em>\n   , Bramley was briefly asked about illegal contraband before agreeing to submit to a search.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Starks\n   </em>\n   , there was no testimony that the officer requesting consent had a threatening demeanor, displayed a weapon, or made an unlawful showing of authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. The testimony was simply that Officer Moran asked for Bramley's consent and Bramley was \"very cooperative\" and agreed. Moreover, not long before the search occurred, Officer Moran had expressly told Bramley's driver he was free to leave. There was no indication in\n   <em>\n    Starks\n   </em>\n   that officers ever told the defendant he was free to leave. Further, at the point Starks consented, his driver had already been formally arrested and a decision had already been made to tow the driver's car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9 -10. This Court found the defendant's consent to be voluntary in spite of the presence of those additional factors, neither of which is present here.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Having reviewed the record, this Court must conclude that a reasonable person in Bramley's position would have felt he \"had the freedom to refuse to answer further questions and could in fact [have left].\"\n   <em>\n    Robinette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1132514\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/80/234/#p241\">\n    80 Ohio St.3d 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=685%20N.E.2d%20762\">\n    685 N.E.2d 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at paragraph three of the syllabus. Even assuming that Officer Moran's questioning made it appear to the driver that he was not free to leave, all of his questions were directed at the driver and pertained to his truck. Officer Moran did not ask Bramley any questions at that time, and he had already told Bramley's driver that he was free to leave.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-3539\">\n    2016-Ohio-3539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20N.E.3d%2033\">\n    67 N.E.3d 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 48. There was no evidence that there were multiple officers on scene and, at the point Officer Moran asked Bramley to submit to a search, he had not even attempted to search the driver. Bramley, therefore, could not have reasonably assumed that he was obligated to submit to a search of his person.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Oberholtz\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 27972,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-8506\">\n    2016-Ohio-8506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207626195\">\n    2016 WL 7626195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11. Moreover, there was no evidence that the wording of Officer\n   Moran's request was impliedly coercive or made consent appear mandatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Officer Moran did not testify to that effect, and Bramley opted not to testify. Accordingly, upon review, the record supports the conclusion that Bramley's decision to consent to a search of his person was an act of free will rather than \"a mere submission to a claim of lawful authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Royer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195479\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/491/#p497\">\n    460 U.S. at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195479\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/491/#p497\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
