After a jury trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff and against defendant, and assessed damages totaling $500,000, which were itemized as follows: (1) past medical expenses, $54,263.70; (2) future medical expenses, $70,000; (3) past pain and suffering, $45,736.30; (4) future pain and suffering, $30,000; (5) past loss of normal life, $100,000; (6) future loss of normal life, $100,000; and (7) disfigurement, $100,000. However, the jury found plaintiff 50% responsible and reduced his total recoverable damages to $250,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 Defendant filed a posttrial motion: (1) seeking a new trial on the ground that the trial court erred in allowing evidence of defendant's internal safety rules and regulations; or (2), in the alternative, seeking a remittitur of the damages that the jury awarded plaintiff for future medical expenses. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant raises the same two claims on this appeal. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 In its appellate brief, plaintiff did not include a statement of facts. The following facts were established at trial and do not appear to be in dispute on appeal. Ill. S.Ct. R. 341(i) (eff. Jan. 1, 2016) (a statement of facts \"need not be included\" in an appellee's brief \"except to the extent that the presentation by the appellant is deemed unsatisfactory\" by the appellee).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 Plaintiff, a 68-year old resident of Fox Lake, Illinois, departed his home early in the morning of Saturday, June 8, 2013, to walk to a nearby McDonald's restaurant. This destination caused him to walk past the Metra station in Fox Lake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 Richard Davis, a Metra employee for 27 years, worked as the ticket agent at the Fox Lake station, where he had been stationed since 1991. On June 8, 2013, the day in question, Davis arrived at the station at 4:35 a.m. and did not initially notice anyone on the platform. However, at 5 a.m., Davis observed a man in a sleeping bag on the platform, who was lying parallel to the train tracks. The tracks are below the platform, but the platform is at ground level. The platform consists of brick pavers and, at some point, the pavers end and merge with the sidewalk, which is made of concrete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 Sometime before 5:30 a.m., Davis exited the station in order to ask the sleeping man to move. Davis walked south, on the brick pavers located on the west side of the tracks. As Davis exited the station, Davis noticed plaintiff, whom Davis had observed walking past the station on other occasions. When Davis reached the man in the sleeping bag, Davis asked him to leave the platform. As the man started to stand up, Davis took a step back and, thereby, bumped into plaintiff who, unknown to Davis, was right behind Davis. It is undisputed that Davis did not look behind him before stepping back. Plaintiff fell to the ground, and Davis and another person helped plaintiff to a nearby bench.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 It was plaintiff's plan to sit for a while and rest. However, after the 10:45 a.m. train came and went, a Metra police officer approached; and eventually an ambulance transported plaintiff to a hospital where he was diagnosed with a fractured hip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 On June 3, 2014, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant alleging that Davis, a Metra employee, breached a duty of care to plaintiff when Davis stepped backward without looking, thereby causing plaintiff to fall. Metra answered and asserted that plaintiff was contributorily negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 10 Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   on September 13, 2016, seeking to bar plaintiff from introducing evidence or argument concerning defendant's internal safety rules. On the day in question, defendant had an employee safety manual entitled \"Safety Rules and General Procedures Manual.\" Rule 1.12 in the manual required defendant's employees to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"be careful to prevent injury to themselves or others. They must be alert and attentive when performing their duties and plan their work to avoid injury.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11 Rule 100.9.3 stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Elevated Places, Stairs, Doors and Elevators: The following requirements when walking on an elevated place, walking on stairs, using a door or riding elevators: Rule Number 1, when walking on engines, cars, scaffolds, or other elevated places, (A) look before you step in any direction.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 In connection with its pretrial motion, defendant argued to the trial court that its internal safety rules were not relevant to plaintiff's claims because the rules were developed for the safety of its employees not for the safety of the general\n   public. The trial court denied defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13 Prior to opening statements on September 14, 2015, defendant renewed its motion seeking to bar plaintiff \"from making any comment * * * that a violation of Metra's * * * rules or internal guidelines constitutes negligence and/or imposes a legal duty on the defendant.\" The trial court denied defendant's motion, stating: \"this is routinely and customarily and properly used to show evidence of negligence in a case. This motion is denied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14 Since most of the facts in this case are undisputed on this appeal, we focus below on the evidence and arguments at trial concerning the two points of contention on appeal: the admission of defendant's safety rules; and the sufficiency of the evidence concerning defendant's future medical expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15 During opening remarks, plaintiff argued, among other things:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"We're here today because we're suing Metra. Rich Davis was an employee of Metra when he broke a safety rule. A railroad company acts through its employees. We know that Metra violated this rule because Rich Davis told us. He'll tell you as well. He'll tell you that he took-he'll tell you that he did not look when he took a step backwards.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16 During the ensuing trial, plaintiff questioned Davis at length about defendant's safety rules. For example, plaintiff asked Davis concerning Rule 100.9.3, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: And when it comes to Rule 100.9.3, 'Elevated Places, Stairs, Doors and Elevators, the rule states: The following requirements when walking on an elevated place, walking on stairs, using a door or riding elevators: Rule Number 1, when walking on engines, cars, scaffolds or other elevated places, (A) look before you step in any direction.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Does that rule apply to you on June 8, 2013?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   DAVIS: I don't know how you can call a platform an elevated structure, sir.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 Plaintiff's counsel continued to ask Davis about this particular rule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: Looking back at Rule 100.9.3, elevated places, stairs, doors and elevators you have already testified I think to the Members of the Jury that a platform is elevated from the tracks and the ballast; isn't that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   DAVIS: I don't know how a platform could be considered an elevated area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: Would you agree, Mr. Davis, that a platform is elevated above the rocks [supporting the tracks]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   DAVIS: Yes, it is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: And would you agree then that it's important in order for someone not to fall off the platform onto the track and ballast and then rock, correct-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   DAVIS: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: -on the track and ballast, that they follow Rule 100.9.3?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: Objection, relevance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: Overruled. You can answer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   DAVIS: It's important, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: With that understanding, would you agree then on June 8, 2013, when you walked out onto the platform that Rule 100.9.3 applied to you, Mr. Davis?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   DAVIS: I honestly don't think it applied to me, no, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: Why not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   DAVIS: Again, it's the argument-I shouldn't say argument, but it's the difference or the disagreement of what an elevated platform-whether a platform is elevated or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   When you get down to the street, it's street level and comes up. So I don't consider that an elevated-it's not my interpretation of that, Counselor.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 18 With respect to plaintiff's injury, Dr. Harpeet Basran, defendant's treating orthopedic surgeon, testified by means of a videotaped evidence deposition. Basran testified that he first examined plaintiff on June 8, 2013, the day of the incident, and that plaintiff's x-ray revealed a fracture of the right hip. Basran testified that he explained plaintiff's options as follows: \"Broadly, it would be surgical versus nonsurgical treatment, and after deciding on surgical management, it was then a discussion of either internal fixation with screws or a replacement or an arthroplasty-type procedure.\" Basran explained: \"Internal fixation involves reducing the fracture and realigning it and placing screws or hardware internally into the bone to help stabilize and hold it in place.\" Basran also explained that an arthroplasty\"involve[s] removing the broken portion of the hip and the portion of the remainder of the femur and replacing that broken piece with a new implant or a new joint replacement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 19 Basran testified that plaintiff decided on internal fixation and Basran performed that procedure on June 9, 2013, the day after the incident. The next date that Basran examined plaintiff was June 27, 2013, when plaintiff reported that \"he was doing well and was having no pain.\" At that time, plaintiff was \"working in an inpatient facility with rehab exercises.\" During the June 27, 2013, examination, Basran found that plaintiff \"had no pain with flexion, extension, rotation or arial loading, and incisions had healed over with no signs of infection and no swelling.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 20 Basran testified that, on June 27, 2013, he ordered x-rays which revealed: \"some collapse and some migration of the hardware coming out and some collapse of the fracture through this area from the time of surgery.\" Basran testified that this was \"[a] bit of concern,\" and he explained to plaintiff the \"importance of taking the pressure off of his right leg, and that it was a critical time and wanted to insure that there was no further collapse or need for further surgeries.\" Basram testified that he examined plaintiff on July 1, 2013, July 23, 2013, and September 3, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 21 Basram testified that, on September 3, 2013, which was almost two months after the incident, plaintiff \"stated that he was doing well and now at home. He had been applying full weight without any assistive devices, without any pain or limitations. He did take narcotic medications on days of therapy * * *.\" Basram discussed using a heel lift, which is \"an insert to make up for a limb length deficiency\" because plaintiff was \"having some collapse or shortening through the fracture leaving his two legs at a different length.\" Later in September, plaintiff requested a wheelchair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 22 Basram testified that he examined plaintiff on November 22, 2013, February 24, 2014, and August 26, 2014, which was over a year after the initial injury. On August 26, 2014, Basram found that plaintiff's \"incisions had healed without infection [and] with no tenderness to any bony prominences and no pain with flexion, extension or arial loading of the hip.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 23 Basram testified that the x-ray taken on August 26, 2014, revealed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"There has been a change from his last x-rays to this x-ray, and I think the easiest way to tell is the amount of\n   hardware that's exposed from the bone. The length of the screw is exactly the same, but more of it is coming out from the outside of the bone which means that the actual break is actually collapsing, and that was my concern that with more prominent hardware his fracture was going on to collapse and become shorter and shorter.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 24 Basram testified that, on August 26, 2014, they \"discussed the collapse and the possibility of hardware removal and replacement, but at that point we had decided to continue with observation.\" Basram examined plaintiff again on July 19, 2016, and August 16, 2016. On August 16, 2016, plaintiff was experiencing more pain and using an assistive device to walk, and the x-rays revealed \"more collapse and more migration of the hardware.\" As a result, Basram recommended surgery \"to have the hardware removed and the joint replaced.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 25 Basram testified that, in his notes for July 19, 2016, and August 16, 2016, he had remarked that plaintiff was using an assistive device but he did not write down whether the device was a wheelchair, walker or cane, and he did not recall which one it was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 26 Basram testified as follows about future medical care:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \"PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: Doctor, do you have an opinion based upon a reasonable degree of medical and surgical certainty whether [plaintiff] will need future medical treatment for his * * * fracture?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   BASRAM: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: What is that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   BASRAM: I believe [plaintiff] is going to require the hardware removal and arthroplasty procedure for his hip.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Basram testified that plaintiff was considering surgery in January 2017, but Basram did not testify about the projected cost of plaintiff's future medical treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 27 Basram testified that plaintiff had also experienced a stroke at some point prior to Basram's initial consultation with plaintiff. With respect to the prior stroke, Basram was asked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"DEFENSE COUNSEL: Doctor, in your treatment of [plaintiff], did you note a previous stroke of 2006?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   BASRAM: I knew that he had a prior stroke on my initial evaluation, but I didn't have the date of it at the time of my consultation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: And in your experience, would a cane be useful as an assistive device for someone who is suffering deficits from a stroke ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   BASRAM: Yes, it can be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL Would it be less effective than a wheelchair?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   BASRAM: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: If [plaintiff] was experiencing left-sided weakness as a result of his stroke, would you think that a wheelchair would be more effective?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   BASRAM: Yes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendant does not raise any issues regarding the stroke on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 28 Defendant called its own medical expert, Dr. Gary Klaud Miller, an orthopedic surgeon, who also testified through a videotaped evidence deposition. When Miller was asked whether, based on his review of the records, plaintiff would require surgery in the future, Miller answered that it was \"possible.\" On cross, Miller admitted that he had been hired at least 12 times in the last five years by defendant to offer medical opinions. Miller also agreed that, based upon his experience and his review of the records, plaintiff's treatment\n   to date had been reasonable and that he had \"no reason to disagree\" with the fall on June 8, 2013, as the cause of plaintiff's fracture. Miller also recalled reading that one of plaintiff's doctors had written in his notes that, prior to the accident, plaintiff \"could walk five to six miles a day.\" Like Basram, Miller also did not discuss future medical costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 29 Prior to the close of evidence, plaintiff's counsel read the following stipulation before the jury concerning past medical expenses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \"PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: Morning. This hereby stipulated and agreed to between the parties for this case that the following medical bills incurred by [plaintiff] were reasonable for [plaintiff's] conditions and that the following are the total bills for each provided listed and the said charges were the usual and customary charges for the type of treatment [plaintiff] received.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Alden Terrace, Anesthesia Associates of Crystal Valley, Centegra Physician Care, Integrated Rehab, Lake McHenry Pathology Associates, McHenry Orthopedics, Dr. Basran and Centegra Hospital McHenry. The grand total of these charges ws $54,263.70.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   According to the table of mortality of evidence, the life expectancy of a person age 67, white male, is 16 years.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 30 Plaintiff then moved into evidence the supporting exhibits, including the \"life tables\" and \"the medical bills summary,\" and the trial court admitted them into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 31 During closing argument, plaintiff argued with respect to medical costs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \"Now, the first category is past medical expenses, and that one is easy, those are the bills, those are what I just read to you. And we know to cover those medical bills, it's going to be $54,263.70.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   We know that [plaintiff] now needs a hip replacement, that the screws in his hip have migrated outside, that the bone has collapsed. Dr. Barsan has recommended a second surgery, Dr. Klaud Miller had nothing to say about it. So the only evidence, what's more probably true than not, is that [plaintiff] needs a second surgery and care. And we ask you for $70,000 to cover that cost.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 32 During closing arguments, plaintiff argued with respect to defendant's safety rules: \"So Mr. Davis admits that he stepped backwards without looking. He admits that he violated that important safety rule which is intended to prevent people from falling, to prevent people from becoming injured. And because of that, we know that [plaintiff] fell.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 33 Over defendant's objection, the trial court agreed to give plaintiff's proposed instructions and verdict forms regarding future medical costs. On appeal, defendant raises no issues with respect to the jury instructions or verdict forms, except to argue that there was no evidence to support the jury's award of future medical costs. For example, defendant objected to \"Verdict Form B,\" which stated in full:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"We, the jury, find for the plaintiff [name] and against the defendant [name] and further find the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   First: Without taking into consideration the question of reduction of damages due to the negligence of [plaintiff], we find that the total amount of damages suffered by [plaintiff] as a proximate result of the occurrence in question is __$, itemized as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [1] Past Medical Expenses: $___\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [2] Future Medical Expenses: $___\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [3] Past Pain and Suffering: $___\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   [4] Future Pain and Suffering: $___\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [5] Past Loss of Normal Life: $___\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [6] Future Loss of Normal Life: $___\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [7] Disfigurement: $___\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Second: Assuming that 100% represents the total combined negligence of all persons whose negligence proximately contributed to the plaintiff's injuries, including [plaintiff] and [defendant's], we find that the percentage of such negligence attributable solely to [plaintiff] is ___(%).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Third: After reducing the total damages sustained by [plaintiff] by the percentage of negligence attributable solely to [plaintiff], we assess [plaintiff's] recoverable damages in the sum of ___$.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The above form was one of the verdict forms tendered by the trial court to the jury, and it was the one returned signed by the jury at the conclusion of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 34 The jury found for plaintiff and against defendant, and found that the total amount of damages suffered by plaintiff was $500,000, itemized as follows: (1) past medical expenses, $54,263.70; (2) future medical expenses, $70,000; (3) past pain and suffering, $45,736.30; (4) future pain and suffering, $30,000; (5) past loss of normal life, $100,000; (6) future loss of normal life, $100,000; and (7) disfigurement, $100,000. As noted, the only line that defendant challenges on this appeal is the second line, which was $70,000 for future medical expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 35 The jury then found that plaintiff was 50% responsible and that, after reducing the total damages by the percentage of negligence attributable to him, his total recoverable damages was $250,000. Since the jury reduced plaintiff's damages by half, the amount disputed on appeal for future medical expenses is only $35,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 36 On October 17, 2016, defendant filed a posttrial motion: (1) seeking a new trial on the ground that the trial court erred in allowing the introduction of evidence on defendant's internal safety rules and regulations; or (2), in the alternative, seeking a remittitur of the damages that the jury awarded plaintiff for future medical care. The trial court denied the motion, and this appeal followed raising the same two claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 37 ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 38 On this appeal, defendant argues: (1) for a new trial, on the ground that the trial court erred in allowing evidence of defendant's internal safety rules and regulations; or (2), in the alternative, for a remittitur of the damages that the jury awarded plaintiff for future medical care.
