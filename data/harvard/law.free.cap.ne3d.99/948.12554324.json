INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} On August 17, 2017, this Court issued a decision reversing the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas' judgment that denied defendant-appellant's, Daniel R. Gibson, motion for recalculation of jail-time credit.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The common pleas court found in denying Gibson's motion that he had \"not alleged\" that the jail-time credit error had not been raised at sentencing so as to avail himself of a statutory postconviction motion authorized by R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii). (Feb. 17, 2017 Jgmt. Entry at 2.) Because Gibson did state facts in his motion to recalculate his jail-time credit that amounted to an assertion that he had not previously raised his claim, we concluded by a 2 to 1 majority that the trial court had erred in deciding that R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii) could not and did not apply to Gibson's motion.\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11-12.

The State argued, and the dissent agreed, that Gibson was required to ab initio submit evidence with his motion for jail-time credit proving that his motion was not barred by res judicata. (Aug. 28, 2017 Mot. for En Banc &amp; to Certify at 5-11.) Specifically, we said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [T]he State argues that R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii) requires Gibson not only to raise the error, but to prove it by supplying a transcript with his motion.[fn. 1] We find no basis for this in the language of the statute. The State would have us interpret the statute so as to create a presumption that such error had been raised at sentencing unless a defendant can produce a transcript that proves otherwise, or else res judicata bars relief. This is not what the statute requires.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [fn. 1] It is conceivable that the State could have provided a transcript or portion thereof with its memorandum opposing Gibson's motion for jail-time credit. It did not do so and instead argues that Gibson should have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Following the suggestion raised in the dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    Gibson,\n   </em>\n   the State now argues that\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   conflicts with\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   in that both adhere to the principle (originally set forth in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ) that the defendant-movant has the burden of establishing that the alleged jail-time credit error was not previously raised at sentencing.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20, citing\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10 ;\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15, citing\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. That principle of law from\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   is correct.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. But to apply it as the State, the dissent in\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   , and now the dissent herein suggests-to require the filing of a transcript ab initio with the motion pursuant to R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii) -is too simplistic an application of\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and is inconsistent with both the statute and case law.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   does not even address that a movant must conclusively rebut res judicata before it is affirmatively raised by the State, only that entitlement to relief must be established.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In criminal cases, res judicata generally bars a defendant from litigating claims in a proceeding subsequent to the direct appeal \"if he or she\n   <em>\n    raised or could have raised\n   </em>\n   the issue at the trial that resulted in that judgment of conviction or on an appeal from that judgment.\" (Emphasis sic.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Res judicata is not specifically addressed in the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure. Thus, to properly assert a claim of res judicata in criminal cases, Crim.R. 57(B) instructs the parties and the courts to \"look to the rules of civil procedure and to the applicable law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Rule 8(C) of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure classifies \"res judicata\" as an \"affirmative defense.\" Ohio criminal case law is consistent with this designation.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, in Ohio civil case law, the Supreme Court has held that \"[i]t is not proper for a court to grant a motion to dismiss based on res judicata, because res judicata is an affirmative defense, and because resolution of a res judicata defense typically requires resort to materials outside the pleadings.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The statute does not by any reading change the State's burden to demonstrate that the affirmative defense of res judicata bars relief. If and when that burden is satisfied, it becomes the movant's burden, as we stated in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , \"to demonstrate that R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii) applies to preclude the application of res judicata.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Simply put, the State bears the burden to demonstrate that res judicata applies before a movant has to prove that it does not apply. In Gibson's case, the State raised res judicata and was required to affirmatively show that Gibson \"\n   <em>\n    raised or could have raised\n   </em>\n   the issue\" of jail-time credit at sentencing. (Emphasis sic.)\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92. This likely would require a transcript-not supplied by Gibson according to judicial fiat as the State would suggest, but rather, supplied by the State to prove its affirmative defense raised. Gibson was not required to prove a negative, since an \"affirmative\" defense requires action by the one asserting it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=704%20N.E.2d%20328\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Our holding in\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   is consistent with our holding in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , which only\n   considered \"the [movant]'s burden to demonstrate\" an entitlement to the statutory exception after already concluding that absent such an exception, res judicata would apply.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Though in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   we also discussed the \"lack of evidence to support [Smith's] motion,\" we did so in the context of evaluating the substantive merits of Smith's request for additional jail-time credit.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   , the trial court dismissed the motion of Gibson's alleged failure to even make the allegation in his motion that the issue of jail-time credit was not previously raised.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court also found Gibson's motion to be barred by the doctrine of res judicata-with no reference to a transcript. The fundamental disagreement of the panel in our review of\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   seems to be whether there is a presumption of res judicata in applying R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii) and/or who must supply the transcript to support his position-the movant or the responding party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 11} At no point in our decision in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   did we hold that a movant must submit evidence with his motion in anticipation that the nonmoving party may assert and properly support an affirmative defense of res judicata.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   in passim. And while R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii) seems to contemplate the application of res judicata, it does not by its terms require the movant, ab initio, to submit evidence to show that res judicata does not apply. Gibson stated in his motion that he was filing pursuant to R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii). Crim.R. 47 requires that a motion \"shall state with particularity the grounds upon which it is made[,] * * * set forth the relief or order sought[, and include] a memorandum containing citations of authority.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Like the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   case on which they rely, neither appellate court in\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   discusses the principal of law that the party asserting the affirmative defense of res judicata carries the burden to establish it, usually requiring materials such as a transcript that are not part of the original motion documents or pleadings. And neither\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   adopts the presumption (sought by the State in\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   ) that jail-time credit errors can be presumed to have been raised at sentencing unless a defendant can produce a transcript that proves otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20, citing\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10 ;\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15, citing\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   are consistent with\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and they are not in conflict with\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   , we simply recognized that before a movant has the burden of showing a statutory exception from res judicata, i.e., that his motion for recalculation of jail-time credit has merit, the party asserting res judicata must demonstrate that the defense applies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 13} We note also that in\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   both criminal defendants had previously filed motions for jail-time credit and not appealed the denial of such motions.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8-11 ;\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3-7.

Generally, this requires reference to documents beyond the motion, such as a transcript of the previous sentencing hearing.\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   rests on the proposition that if the State asserts the affirmative defense of res judicata, it first must demonstrate that the affirmative defense of res judicata applies before a movant is required to submit evidence or demonstrate entitlement to jail-time credit recalculation pursuant to R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii). In\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   , we declined to create a presumption that res judicata applies under R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii), and neither\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   is in conflict with\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   on this proposition of law. Further,\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   involve analyses of res judicata concerning previously filed motions for jail-time credit correction that were not appealed. As such, they are separate from and independent of the legal questions at issue in\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   concerning presumption of res judicata and when a transcript must be submitted as evidence in a proceeding pursuant to R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii), and we declined to require submission of a transcript ab initio with a motion filed pursuant to this statute.

The\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   court makes clear that in order for the moving party to establish the trial court's continuing jurisdiction, the moving party must produce evidence that the alleged error in jail-time credit was \"not previously raised at sentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii), the threshold issue is trial court jurisdiction, not res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

As a result, appellant cannot show whether the issue of his incarceration in the county jail was raised and considered at that time, thereby precluding its consideration in a postconviction motion.

If the\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   court believed that the state had the initial burden to produce evidence that the alleged error in jail-time credit was previously raised at sentencing, the court would not have affirmed the denial of the motion on the basis that \"[t]he record before this court does not have a transcript of the sentencing hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. If the burden of production was on the state, the absence of such evidence would not justify denial of the motion for jail-time credit. Accordingly, I find that the rule of law applied by the Fourth District in\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   conflicts with the rule of law adopted by the majority in\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In denying the motion, the majority attempts to factually distinguish\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   from\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   on the basis that both Guiterres and Johnson \"had previously filed motions for jail-time credit and not appealed the denial of such motions.\" (Majority at \u00b6 13.) However, my reading of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   reveals that this distinction made no difference in either case. Under the rule of law expressed in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   , a motion for additional jail-time credit fails when the moving party fails to produce evidence establishing the trial court's continuing jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20-21 ;\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. Under R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii), the trial court has continuing jurisdiction of a motion for jail-time credit only when the alleged error in jail-time credit was not previously raised at sentencing.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20-21 ;\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. The same rule of law applies to every motion for jail-time credit filed pursuant to R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(iii), whether it is an initial motion or a successive motion. The fact that res judicata was asserted by the court in\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   as an alternative basis for denial of the successive motion for jail-time credit is irrelevant to the issue on which the state seeks certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The issue before this court is whether the rule of law adopted by the majority in\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   conflicts with the rule of law adopted by the courts of appeal in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   . In this instance, the rule of law adopted by the majority in\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   is that the state, not the movant, bears the burden of producing evidence that the alleged error in jail-time credit was not previously raised at sentencing. Under the rule of law adopted in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   , the movant bears the burden of producing evidence that the alleged error in jail-time credit was not previously raised at sentencing. Thus, the rule of law adopted by the majority decision in\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   clearly conflicts with rule of law in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Guiterres\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 26} For the foregoing reasons, I would grant the state's motion to certify a conflict.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
