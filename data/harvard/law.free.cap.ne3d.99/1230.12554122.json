He also appeals his sentence imposed on a community-control violation. Because we determine that the trial court erred in sentencing Smith, we sustain his tenth assignment of error and remand the matter for resentencing. We find no merit in his remaining assignments of error, so we affirm the remainder of the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The 911 Call\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On November 29, 2015, a man called 911 to report a burglary in progress. The caller identified himself by name and stated that he lived upstairs from the apartment being burglarized. He stayed on the phone with dispatch until the police arrived, and he continuously updated dispatch as to what he observed and heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The caller was silently watching the burglary from the hallway upstairs. He told the 911 operator that he had heard the perpetrator break open the door to the apartment and enter. He reported that the perpetrator was running back and forth between the apartment and the laundry room. He then heard the perpetrator slowly creeping up the stairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} He saw the perpetrator who had broken into the apartment and told dispatch that he knew him, and that he had previously broken into the same apartment. The caller heard banging and reported that the perpetrator was fighting with the officers. The 911 operator urged him to calm down and to stay in his apartment. The caller reported that the perpetrator was a crack head and a thief, who had stolen his identification card. He also reported that an upstairs neighbor sold and delivered drugs that he kept in his car. Before hanging up the phone, he told the operator that he would be willing to file a police report and go to court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Arrest\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Sergeant Robert Godbey and Officer Travis Moyers arrived on the scene three minutes after the call was made. They were aware of the burglary in progress. As Godbey approached the door to the apartment building, Smith opened the door from the inside. Godbey testified that he immediately recognized Smith and saw a large bag of marijuana sticking out of his hoodie pocket. After addressing Smith by name, he reached for Smith's arm, and Smith pulled away. Both officers then struggled with Smith. While they were struggling, the bag of marijuana fell to the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The struggle moved into a first-floor apartment, and Smith began to empty his pockets and throw cocaine and handfuls of marijuana in the apartment. After struggling for a few minutes, the officers were able to handcuff and arrest Smith. They searched him and recovered property\n   that was later identified by the victim, Brandon Mattress, as items belonging to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Preliminary Court Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Smith was indicted for burglary, trafficking in cocaine, possession of cocaine, possession of marijuana, and tampering with evidence. Smith's counsel filed a motion to suppress arguing that the officers did not have reasonable suspicion to stop Smith as he was leaving the apartment building. The motion was overruled, and the trial was scheduled for two weeks later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In the meantime, Smith filed a pro se motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion for a mistrial. Smith's counsel filed a motion to withdraw on the basis that his relationship with Smith was \"irretrievably broken.\" The court scheduled a hearing on the motion to withdraw, and Smith informed the court he did not want new counsel and wanted his current counsel to continue to represent him. Counsel withdrew his motion and the pending pro se motions. Eleven days later, the trial court put on an entry allowing Smith's counsel to withdraw and appointing new counsel to represent Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Smith filed additional pro se motions including a motion for an independent laboratory analysis, requesting that a fingerprint analysis be performed on the plastic bags that contained the drugs, and a motion to dismiss, alleging numerous flaws in the proceeding, including a speedy-trial violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} His new counsel requested two continuances and another suppression hearing based on new evidence. The court granted counsel's requests, and the case was set for a second motion-to-suppress hearing. At the second motion-to-suppress hearing, counsel informed the court that Smith had drafted a motion to remove him as counsel but had not yet filed it. No reasons were given in support of the motion, and the trial court overruled it. The court asked counsel if he wanted to adopt and argue Smith's pro se motion to dismiss. Counsel declined, and the court overruled the motion. The second motion to suppress was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Smith's trial was scheduled the same day, and a visiting judge presided over the trial. Prior to trial, Smith asked the visiting judge to rule on the pro se motions he had filed. When counsel again explained that Smith had drafted a motion to appoint new counsel, Smith clarified that he only wanted to address the speedy-trial issue and the motion for fingerprint analysis. His counsel told the court the request for fingerprint analysis was without merit, and that he could not argue the motion. The court asked the prosecutor and Smith's counsel to review the docket to determine whether there was a speedy-trial issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The following day, the prosecutor and Smith's counsel assured the court that time had not expired. They explained that time was tolled by all of the continuances, except one, which were requested by Smith, by the appointment of new counsel and by the motions to suppress. The case proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Jury Trial\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The state presented five witnesses. Michael Mattress testified that he lived in the apartment that was burglarized with his brother Brandon. Brandon Mattress testified that he sold convenience items, such as soft drinks, alcohol, chips, and cigarettes, from the apartment and from a small school bus that he converted into a store. He only accepted cash and kept it in a cashbox.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On the night of the burglary, Brandon was driving a friend to her job downtown, when he received a call from an upstairs neighbor, Donald Hodge. Hodge informed him that someone had broken\n   into his apartment. While Brandon was driving home, Hodge continued to call him and update him on the burglary. Brandon picked up his brother Michael, and they met the police in the apartment. Brandon testified that the carton of cigarettes, bottles of alcohol, and the three rubber-banded, labeled stacks of money recovered from Smith belonged to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Wendy Pugh testified that she lived with her aunt in the same building in a ground-floor apartment. As she was going outside to find her aunt, she saw Smith coming down the stairs. Smith had been friends with her oldest son. She spoke briefly with Smith, and saw the officers enter the building then struggle with Smith. She went back into her apartment at the request of the officers. Suddenly, the front door burst open, and the struggle moved into her living room. She testified that she saw Smith throw the bag of marijuana, a carton of cigarettes, and the cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Officer Moyers testified that based on his experience and training, the cocaine was in bulk packaging, which was commonly used by drug dealers. He also discussed the struggle with Smith and confirmed that Smith was throwing the drugs when they were struggling in the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Sergeant Godbey also testified. In describing the struggle, Godbey explained that Smith \"was attempting to pull things out of his pocket and tampering with our evidence * * *.\" Godbey also testified that he had 23 years of police experience and had investigated thousands of crack-cocaine cases. Based on his experience and training, the large amount of cocaine indicated that it was for distribution because a personal-use amount would be about the size of a pea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} While Godbey testified, the state played the 911 call for the jury and provided transcripts for the jury to follow along. Smith stipulated to the admissibility of the 911 call and requested that the transcript of the call be admitted into evidence. After Godbey testified, the state rested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Smith called his sole witness, Donald Hodge. Hodge testified that he lived in the upstairs apartment. On the night of the burglary, Smith had come to his apartment looking for his uncle. Hodge invited him in for a few moments. Shortly after Smith left, Hodge heard the commotion downstairs. Hodge did not see a bag of marijuana in Smith's pocket. But Hodge did see a bag of marijuana on the floor by the entrance to the apartment building after the situation became calm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 20} On cross-examination, Hodge denied calling Brandon Mattress and telling him about the burglary. Hodge stated that he called Brandon to tell him that the police were in his apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The state recalled Brandon as a rebuttal witness. Over objection, Brandon testified that Hodge called him three times on the night of the burglary. The first time, Hodge told him that Smith had broken into his apartment. Hodge next called him to tell him the police had arrived. Hodge then called to report that Smith was fighting with the officers and marijuana was all over the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The jury returned a verdict finding Smith guilty of all charges. The court sentenced Smith to one year on the community-control violation in the case numbered B-1406013. The court sentenced Smith to seven years on count 1, burglary, nine years on count 2, trafficking in cocaine, nine years on count 3, possession of cocaine, 11 months on count 4, possession of marijuana, and 30 months on count 5, tampering with evidence. The court ordered counts 2, 3, 4, and 5 to be served concurrently with each other and consecutively to count 1, and for the aggregate\n   sentence to be served consecutively to the sentence in the case numbered B-1406013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Overruling of the Motion to Suppress\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In his first assignment of error, Smith contends that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress. He argues that his immediate detention was done without reasonable suspicion or probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. We must accept the trial court's findings of fact as true if competent, credible evidence supports them. Next, we must independently determine whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.\n   <em>\n    State v.

As he approached the front door, Godbey saw Smith attempting to leave the building. Godbey testified that he immediately saw a large bag of marijuana sticking out of Smith's pocket. After personally witnessing a criminal offense, Godbey had probable cause to arrest Smith. Once Smith was arrested, the officers were allowed to conduct a search incident to that lawful arrest. Accordingly, we overrule Smith's first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Denial of the Motion to Appoint New Counsel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In his second assignment of error, Smith argues that the trial court erred by denying his request for new counsel. The decision whether to appoint new counsel is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Summerlin\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

When his appointed attorney brought the issue to the court's attention, Smith did not state any reasons to support the motion, and the trial court denied the motion. Later that day, counsel again raised the issue to the visiting judge. When provided the opportunity, Smith chose not to address the motion or put forth any grounds for the request. Instead, he informed the court that he wanted to address the motion for a fingerprint analysis and the speedy-trial issue. Accordingly, there was no further discussion regarding the appointment of new counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Because Smith failed to articulate a basis for the motion when given two\n   opportunities to do so, it cannot be said that Smith demonstrated good cause to support the motion. Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion, and overrule the second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Rulings on the Pro Se Motions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Smith asserts that the trial court erred by failing to rule on his pro se motions. Specifically, he claims the trial court never ruled on his motion for an independent laboratory analysis to determine whether the cocaine was accurately weighed and his motion to dismiss based upon a speedy-trial violation. Initially, we observe that Smith filed his motions pro se, even though at all times throughout the proceedings below he was represented by court-appointed counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In Ohio, trial courts need not address pro se motions when the defendant is represented by counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, Brandon testified that that he lived in the apartment, he had been there earlier but left to take a friend to work, and it was very likely that he could have been home at the time of the burglary. The jury was entitled to believe Brandon's testimony, so Smith's conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence and was supported by sufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Next, he argues the state failed to prove the cocaine was intended for sale or resale. Both officers testified that the amount of cocaine was inconsistent with personal use and indicated trafficking. Moyer testified that the cocaine was bulk packaged, typical packaging for trafficking. Finally, Godbey testified that a personal use amount is the size of a pea and costs $50. The amount that Smith was transporting had a street value of a few thousand dollars. Both officers testified based on their experience. Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the state, we conclude that the state proved the cocaine was intended for sale or resale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Finally, Smith claims the evidence was insufficient to prove Smith intended to hinder an investigation because the bags containing drugs either fell out of his pocket or were torn during the struggle. Three witnesses, Pugh, Moyer, and Godbey, testified that Smith threw a bag of cocaine and a bag of marijuana that spilled all over the apartment. Godbey also testified that he saw Smith rip the bag of cocaine and throw it across the room. He also saw Smith rip the marijuana and disperse the marijuana around the apartment. Moyer and Smith testified that they attempted to collect all of the spilled drugs, and Godbey testified that they could not recover all of it. All of this testimony was more than sufficient evidence to support his tampering conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Therefore, we overrule Smith's ninth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sentencing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 65} In his final assignment of error, Smith contends the trial court erred in sentencing him for burglary, trafficking in cocaine, possession of cocaine, possession of marihuana, tampering with evidence, and on the community-control violation. First, he argues that the trial court erred by imposing multiple sentences for allied offenses. The state concedes the error. Accordingly, we vacate the sentences for possession of cocaine and trafficking in cocaine, and remand the cause so that the state may elect which offense to pursue for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Smith also claims the trial court erred in sentencing him because the record does not support the sentence.

This court will only modify or vacate a sentence under R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) if it clearly and convincingly finds that either the record does not support the mandatory sentencing findings or the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, the record shows that the trial court made the required findings, announced them at the sentencing hearing, and incorporated them into the sentencing entry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, the trial court did not err in imposing consecutive sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 68} Next, he argues the court failed to consider the principles and purposes of sentencing pursuant to R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. While a trial court is required to consider the purposes and principles of sentencing, it need not make specific findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Hendrix\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-150194 and C-150200,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-2697\">\n    2016-Ohio-2697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201685794\">\n    2016 WL 1685794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 51. We can presume from a silent record that the trial court considered the appropriate factors unless the defendant affirmatively shows that the court has failed to do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201685794\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Smith does not make any showing that the court failed to consider the statutory factors, and the trial court expressly stated it had considered the statutory factors. Therefore, Smith failed to demonstrate that the sentences were clearly and convincing contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 69} Smith contends the court failed to inform him of the requirement to submit to DNA testing and the penalties for any failure. However, this court has held that the statute does not confer any substantive rights on the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150488,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-4548\">\n    2016-Ohio-4548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203460843\">\n    2016 WL 3460843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5-6. Therefore, the court's failure to notify Smith about DNA testing was harmless and did not prejudice him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 70} Accordingly, we sustain that part of Smith's assignment of error challenging the multiple sentences for allied offenses and remand the cause for a new sentencing hearing, and overrule the remainder of the assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 71} We vacate Smith's sentence in part, and we remand the cause for a new sentencing hearing on the allied offenses of possession of cocaine and trafficking in cocaine so that the state may elect which offense to pursue for resentencing. The trial court's judgement is affirmed in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Judgment affirmed in part, sentence vacated in part, and cause remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Myers and Miller, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
