Zein, individually and as trustee of the Araam Revocable Trust, has filed a complaint for a writ of prohibition. Zein seeks to prevent the respondent, Judge Deena R. Calabrese, from entering an order of sheriff's sale with regard to real property that is the subject of a foreclosure action in\n   <em>\n    Park View Fed. Sav. Bank v. Zein\n   </em>\n   , Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-14-832518. Judge Calabrese has filed a motion for summary judgment. For the following reasons, we grant Judge Russo's motion for summary judgment and decline to issue a writ of prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    THE FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The following facts, that are pertinent to this original action, are gleaned from the complaint for a writ of prohibition, Judge Calabrese's motion for summary judgment, and the various briefs filed by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On July 3, 2012, Park View Federal Savings Bank filed a foreclosure action against Zein. On June 20, 2013, CitiFinancial, Inc. and the treasurer of Cuyahoga County were added as defendants. On May 4, 2015, Woods Cove III, L.L.C. was granted leave to intervene and file an answer with cross-claims in the foreclosure action. The cross-claims of Woods Cove were based upon its purchase of outstanding real estate tax lien certificates B203-1-1459 and S2014-2-891.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On February 15, 2017, a magistrate's decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law was journalized. The magistrate's decision provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   This case was submitted to the Magistrate and heard upon the Complaint and Motions for Default Judgment and Summary Judgment of Plaintiff, Park View Federal Savings Bank (\"Plaintiff\"), the Motion to Substitute Plaintiff to the First National Bank of Pennsylvania, the Answers of Defendants Fatima Y. Zein, individually, Fatima Y. Zein, Trustee of The Araam Revocable Trust, CitiFinancial,\n   Inc., the Cuyahoga County Treasurer, and the answer and cross claim of Defendant Woods Cover III, LLC Defendants Fatima Y. Zein and Fatima Y. Zein, Trustee of the Araam Revocable Trust Motion to Vacate Judgment and Motion to Stay Proceedings in Execution plus various other motions listed on the docket and the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   After hearing on Defendants Fatima Y. Zein and Fatima Y. Zein, Trustee of the Araam Revocable Trust Motion to Vacate Judgment and Motion to Stay Proceedings In Execution, the Court issued an order vacating the prior Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure issued on 01/08/2014. This Magistrate Decision is issued to include the interests of Defendants CitiFinancial and Woods Cove III, LLC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The Magistrate finds that there is due Defendant Woods Cove III, LLC the amounts owed on the tax certificates attached to its answer and crossclaim and any additional tax certificates it acquires from the Treasurer prior to the date of Sheriffs sale. While unascertainable at this time, the exact amount owed to the tax certificate holder on its liens will be ascertainable at the time of the sale, which amount is valid and subsisting lien.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Magistrate's Decision of Feb. 15, 2017, p. 1-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On March 1, 2017, Zein filed objections to the magistrate's decision of February 15, 2017. On May 17, 2017, Judge Calabrese overruled Zein's objections and adopted the magistrate's decision. Zein did not file an appeal from the judgment that overruled her objections to the magistrate's decision. On June 30, 2017, Judge Calabrese issued a \"praecipe of pluries order of sale with reappraisal\" instructing the Cuyahoga County Sheriff to sell at sheriff's sale the real property that was the subject of the foreclosure in C.P. No. CV-12-786327. On July 12, 2017, Zein filed her complaint for a writ of prohibition and request for an alternative writ of prohibition. On July 14, 2017, this court granted Zein's request for alternative writ and stayed the sale of Zein's real property pending disposition of the complaint for a writ of prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Zein, through her complaint for a writ of prohibition, seeks to prevent Judge Calabrese from issuing an order that requires the Cuyahoga County Sheriff to appraise and sell the real property that is the subject of the foreclosure in Case No. CV-12-786327. Zein argues that Judge Calabrese's order of foreclosure was not a final order that allowed for the sale of the real property, because the exact amounts due on Woods Cove's tax lien certificates were not fully ascertained within the magistrate's decision or the order of Judge Calabrese that adopted the magistrate's decision. Zein specifically argues that Judge Calabrese is patently and unambiguously without jurisdiction to issue the pluries order of sale to the Cuyahoga County sheriff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 7} A writ of prohibition is designed to prevent a tribunal from proceeding in a matter in which it is not authorized to hear and determine, or in which it seeks to usurp or exercise jurisdiction with which it has not been invested by law.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

This latter jurisdictional category involves consideration of the rights of the parties.

Judge Calabrese, as an elected judge of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, possesses the basic subject-matter jurisdiction to preside over the foreclosure action as presently being litigated in Case No. CV-12-786327.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2305.01, 2323.07 and Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Sections (A) and (B).

The order of foreclosure determines the extent of each lienholder's interest, sets forth the priority of the liens, and determines the other rights and responsibilities of each party in the action. On appeal from the order of foreclosure, the parties may challenge the court's decision to grant the decree of foreclosure. Once the order of foreclosure is final and the appeals process has been completed, all rights and responsibilities of the parties have been determined and can no longer be challenged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The confirmation process is an ancillary one in which the issues present are limited to whether the sale proceedings conformed to law. Because of this limited nature of the confirmation proceedings, the parties have a limited right to appeal the confirmation.\n   <em>\n    For example, on appeal of the order confirming the sale, the parties may challenge the confirmation of the sale itself, including computation of the final total owed by the mortgagor, accrued interest, and actual amounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections, appraisals, property protection, and maintenance.\n   </em>\n   The issues appealed from confirmation are wholly distinct from the issues appealed from the order of foreclosure. In other words, if the parties appeal the confirmation proceedings, they do not get a second bite of the apple, but a first bite of a different fruit.

We disagree. Whether an order is appealable merely relates to this court's jurisdiction to review it at that time; the fact that the order was not appealable does not render it a nullity. Therefore, regardless of whether the order could have been appealed, the August 2006 order still stands as a valid order from which the property was properly sold at sheriff's sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Accordingly, we grant Judge Calabrese's motion for summary judgment.
