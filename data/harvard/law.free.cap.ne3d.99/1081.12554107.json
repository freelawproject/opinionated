(\"Heinen's\"), on Brosnan's claims for negligence and nuisance. Brosnan's wife, Mary Brosnan, appeals the derivative loss of consortium claim. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On August 6, 2013, at approximately 10:15 a.m., 71-year-old Brosnan was walking toward the entrance of the Heinen's grocery store located in Bainbridge Township, Ohio (\"store\") when he tripped and fell over a raised portion of concrete located in the parking lot near the entrance. At the time of the incident, Brosnan suffered from a detached retina\n   in his right eye, causing limited peripheral vision. After the incident, Brosnan suffered from complete blindness in the right eye.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Heinen's refers to the raised area as a curb while Brosnan refers to the area as a tail. For purposes of this case, it is identified as the \"edge.\" Heinen's position is that: (1) the edge is a curb and no defect exists; (2) Brosnan was familiar with the lot and visited weekly; (3) the lighting was sufficient; (4) the traffic was typical; and (5) the edge was open and obvious. Brosnan admitted that he was aware of the existence of the edge because there were similar areas in the parking lot, but he was not paying attention to where he was walking because he was watching for traffic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Brosnan further describes the edge as a \"concrete tail\" measuring \"slightly more than two inches in height,\" located near the store entrance at Ohio State Highway Route 306. The edge once served as an \"architectural landscaping feature.\" Brosnan denies that the edge was open and obvious due to the: (1) lack of yellow cautionary paint; (2) shadows caused by the angle of sunlight and the building; (3) presence of a speed bump and/or planter impeding visibility of the edge; and (4) distraction caused by vehicles entering and exiting from Route 306 across the access area to the store from the parking lot. Brosnan contends that these circumstances posed a reasonably foreseeable risk of harm to pedestrians navigating the driveway because the edge was not discernible, served no purpose, and created a tripping hazard for patrons focused on avoiding oncoming traffic near the entrance of the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Brosnan filed suit on July 28, 2015, against Heinen's and John Doe placeholders who were dismissed after discovery. Heinen's moved for summary judgment on August 1, 2016, that was stayed pending the filing of an answer and the completion of discovery. Brosnan opposed the motion for summary judgment on September 13, 2016, discovery was completed with leave of court, and the trial court granted summary judgment on November 16, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court determined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [I]n construing the evidence in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, [the court] finds that reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion, that the curb in Heinen's parking [lot] on which plaintiff tripped and fell was open and obvious and that there is no evidence of a defective or unsafe condition in the parking lot that caused plaintiff's fall. Plaintiff's argument that the fact that he was looking out for traffic in the parking lot at the time of his fall constitutes an attendant circumstance fails because he testified that the traffic in the parking lot at the time was not out of the ordinary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's deposition transcript pages, 54-55, 70-71, and\n   <em>\n    Bounds v.

The edge paralleled a portion of the perimeter aligning the two lanes of traffic providing ingress and egress to the store parking area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 36} There is no dispute that Brosnan was required to cross the edge to access the store. The weather was bright and\n   sunny, and Brosnan alleged the edge blended with the concrete. Brosnan claimed that he did not expect the edge to be there as it served no purpose. Brosnan argues that Heinen's should have painted the edge yellow to make it visible, and points to the Heinen's location in Pepper Pike, which employs yellow painted dividers and curbs, to demonstrate Heinen's knowledge that such areas should be differentiated from the asphalt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 37} The trial court below determined that: (1) the edge was open and obvious, (2) there was no evidence that a defective or unsafe condition in the parking lot caused the fall; and (3) the traffic in the parking lot was not any different than a customer would normally encounter.

The trial court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Bounds\n   </em>\n   is appropriate. The evidence does not rebut the trial court's conclusions that: the edge was open and obvious; there was no evidence that a defective or unsafe condition in the parking lot caused the fall; and the traffic in the parking lot was no different than a customer would normally encounter. These conclusions are bolstered by Brosnan's admission that he was very familiar with the parking lot conditions, visited the store often, and that he was paying attention to the traffic and not the edge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 41} We find that the assigned errors in this case lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 42} The trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, A.J., and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   TIM McCORMACK, J., CONCUR\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Heinen's accepted a proposal to resurface the lot in May 2013, but work did not commence until September 2013, after the incident.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
