This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Mr. Huguley and Jasmine Williams had been in a romantic relationship, lived in an apartment together, and had a child together. Ms. Williams spent the day and night of June 22, 2015 with a friend and co-worker, D.D. When the two returned the next morning, Mr. Huguley was packing up the belongings in the apartment. D.D. and Ms. Williams were scheduled to work that night, so D.D. planned to stay at the apartment as she often did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Mr. Huguley and Ms. Williams began to argue. After that, Mr. Huguley's and D.D.'s stories diverge as to exactly what transpired. They do, however, agree that Mr. Huguley stabbed Ms. Williams, stabbed himself, and fled the apartment. Mr. Huguley claims that Ms. Williams stabbed him first and that he acted in self-defense. Ms. Williams died as a result of her stab wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Mr. Huguley was apprehended five weeks later. He was indicted for one count of aggravated murder, two counts of murder, two counts of felonious assault, and one count of domestic violence. Following a jury trial, Mr. Huguley was acquitted of aggravated murder and found guilty of the remaining counts. The trial court merged the offenses, and sentenced Mr. Huguley to a term of 15 years to life for murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Mr. Huguley appeals raising four assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DENYING DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS AS THE APPELLANT INVOKED HIS RIGHT TO COUNSEL BEFORE GIVING A STATEMENT TO POLICE[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In his first assignment of error, Mr. Huguley argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because, after he was in police custody, he requested and was denied counsel.

Detective Bell asked him if he knew why he was there and then proceeded to open an envelope containing a kit for collecting a DNA sample. Detective Bell presented Mr. Huguley with a voluntary consent form for the sample. Mr. Huguley responded, \"Can I deny this until I see my lawyer?\" Detective Bell then indicated that Mr. Huguley's DNA might already be in the system or they could get a search warrant for it. After that, Mr. Huguley signed the consent form. On cross-examination, Detective Bell agreed that Mr. Huguley was in custody and \"[t]he word 'lawyer' c[a]me[ ] out of his mouth.\" From this, Mr. Huguley appears to conclude that he invoked his right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The mere use of the word \"lawyer\" does not amount to an unambiguous request for counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raber\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19 (listing various statements or questions containing the word \"lawyer\" or \"attorney\" that have been held not to amount to an unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The trial court correctly found that Mr. Huguley \"did not make an unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel.\" Rather, he \"merely inquired if he could defer consent to the DNA collection until after he spoke to an attorney.\" Mr. Huguley's question was insufficient to invoke his right to counsel.

When determining the appropriate sanction, a trial court should consider the following three factors: \"(1) whether the failure to disclose was a willful violation of Crim.R. 16, (2) whether foreknowledge of the undisclosed material would have benefited the accused in the preparation of a defense, and (3) whether the accused was prejudiced.\"\n   <em>\n    Darmond\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} On the second day of trial in the instant matter, the State provided the defense with a disc of information that had been extracted from the victim's phone. The State explained that the phone had been sent to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (\"BCI\") the year before. BCI had initially reported that they were unable to retrieve the information on the phone, but they referenced a chip that could be removed. The assistant prosecutor was not aware that any additional analysis had been conducted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The detective who had been handling that aspect of the case retired, and there was no notation indicating that an additional analysis was being conducted. The week before the trial started, an officer who was transporting items from BCI to the police department was given the disc with the extracted information. That officer placed the disc in the mailbox of the detective who had replaced the one who retired. That detective was on vacation at the time. Upon his return from vacation, he discovered the disc and the assistant prosecutor was notified. The assistant prosecutor immediately copied the disc, provided the copy to defense counsel, and informed the trial court of the situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 21} At that point, neither side had reviewed the information on the disc. The trial court postponed the testimony of D.D., and noted that they were not scheduled to be in court the following day, thus, providing the parties an opportunity to review the disc. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial arguing there might be exculpatory evidence on the disc. The trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 22} When the matter reconvened, the parties had gone through some, but not all, of the information contained on the disc. Defense counsel suggested that neither side should be able to use the contents of the disc. The State agreed not to use it in its case in chief, but requested to be able to use it in cross-examination and rebuttal if necessary. Defense counsel again requested a mistrial. The State suggested that the testimony of certain witnesses, who the parties agreed the information on the disc did not concern, go forward and then, that the parties be given the weekend to further review the contents of the disc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The Court found, and the defense does not dispute, that the violation in this case was not willful or in bad faith. The Court further found that there was a sanction \"less drastic than dismissal [that] will ensure that the defendant is fairly tried.\" The Court concluded that \"the appropriate remedy [was] a continuance of a day or two before the phone could be used.\" That ruling was made on a Thursday, two witnesses testified that day, no proceedings were had on Friday, and the matter proceeded again on Monday. Defense counsel renewed its motion for mistrial, but it was again denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Upon review, this Court concludes that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Papadelis\n   </em>\n   , a trial court is to \"impose the least severe sanction that is consistent with the purpose of\n   the rules of discovery.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1827878\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/32/1/#p3\">\n    32 Ohio St.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=511%20N.E.2d%201138\">\n    511 N.E.2d 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at paragraph two of the syllabus. Upon learning of the disc, the State promptly made it available to the defense. The trial court then provided for a continuance and reordering of witnesses in order that the information on the disc could be reviewed, and thereby allowing the parties an opportunity to further prepare in light of the information contained on the disc. Finally, Mr. Huguley has not argued, much less demonstrated, how he was prejudiced by the trial court's decision to grant a continuance rather than a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Mr. Huguley's second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT FAILED TO DECLARE A MISTRIAL FOR JUROR MISCONDUCT[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In his third assignment of error, Mr. Huguley argues that the trial court erred by not removing the jury foreperson or declaring a mistrial.

The trial court took the juror's notes from him. \"[B]ased on his answers to the questions,\" the State did not object to him continuing as a juror. One attorney for the defendant stated that \"[he] would have to agree with the State.\" The other attorney for the defendant stated, \"if the State is not finding a problem, the defense is not finding it a problem.\" He concluded that he had \"assess[ed] [the foreperson] [and] listen[ed] to his explanation\" and made the \"tactical decision [ ] to leave him on [the jury.]\" He further explained, \"it's a proper decision for Mr. Huguley to have this jury render its verdict\" and \"tactically it would probably be to the State's advantage to be in retrial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Consequently, Mr. Huguley did not forfeit this alleged error by failing to object.

At that time, he was packing up their belongings and she became upset. During the ensuing argument, he ran out to her car to look for a cell phone, but he did not find it there. Ms. Williams also ran out to the car. According to Mr. Huguley, when they returned to the apartment, Ms. Williams went to the bedroom and he went to the kitchen. He testified that, as he was getting a beer out of the refrigerator, he \"felt a sharp pinch to [his] back and neck area.\" When he turned around, Ms. Williams stabbed him in the chest. He \"believe[d] she was trying to hurt [him] pretty bad.\" Mr. Huguley testified that he \"grabbed her neck and * * * arm,\" \"[p]ush[ed] her back,\" and \"pulled [the knife] out of her hands.\" He further testified that after he \"grabbed the knife, then [he] stabbed her.\" He then stabbed himself in the neck and fled the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Mr. Huguley admitted that the knife was his, but believed that Ms. Williams had retrieved it from her car. He explained that, approximately one month earlier, Ms. Williams had removed all the knives from the apartment because he \"told her [that he was] going to cut [him]self again.\" He further explained that he had a prior history of cutting himself when he was depressed and that Ms. Williams was aware of that history. Although Mr. Huguley admitted that he managed to disarm Ms. Williams, he felt she was still \"[a] threat\" even after he had the knife. He explained that she was fighting with him and she was strong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 39} According to Mr. Huguley, D.D. was outside when the stabbing started. He could not remember if she got involved later or if he had done anything to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 40} By contrast, D.D. testified that she was in the living room. She heard Mr. Huguley and Ms. Williams arguing in the bathroom and bedroom. She testified that Mr. Huguley and Ms. Williams ran out of the apartment to Ms. Williams' car. They continued to argue when they returned to the apartment. She saw Mr. Huguley pull a long, folding type knife from his pocket and start stabbing Ms. Williams. D.D. testified that she tried to help Ms. Williams, but Mr. Huguley pushed her and she ended up hitting the door. She stated that Mr. Huguley stabbed himself in the neck, stabbed Ms. Williams some more, and fled the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Dr. Dorothy Dean performed Ms. Williams' autopsy. She testified that Ms. Williams' death was caused by multiple stab wounds to her chest, which penetrated her lungs and heart. Dr. Dean also noted minor injuries to Ms. Williams' hands, a stab wound on her back near her left shoulder and one to her right thigh. She explained that it was not unusual for a stabbing victim to have injuries to the hands because \"a lot of times people fighting for their life get injuries to their hands.\" She further testified that the bone and cartilage of one of Ms. Williams' ribs was injured. When discussing that injury, she stated that \"it takes a lot of force to break the skin and bone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 42} According to the autopsy report, Ms. Williams was 5'6? tall and weighed 167 pounds. In comparison, Mr. Huguley testified that he was 6'7? tall and weighed 250 pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Sergeant John Mostar testified that he took pictures of Mr. Huguley on the day he was arrested. The pictures show \"scarring\" or \"markings\" on Mr. Huguley's arms, hands, chest, and the front and sides of his neck. There was no scarring or markings observed on Mr. Huguley's back or the back of his neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 44} When Mr. Huguley was shown the pictures, he stated that some of the wounds were from Ms. Williams and \"like a couple of them\" were self-inflicted. He denied that any in the chest area were self-inflicted. When cross-examined about the lack of wounds to his back, Mr. Huguley explained, \"[i]t felt like she was stabbing me in the back, but it was in the neck.\" He admitted that the wounds to the front of his neck were self-inflicted, but had difficulty remembering on which side of the neck Ms. Williams stabbed him. As the pictures were shown to him on the stand, he first thought the left was the side on which she stabbed him, but later corrected himself indicating she had stabbed him on the right side. He agreed that a picture of the right side showed four wounds and testified that she did \"[a]ll those\" and \"[s]he was quick[ ].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Evidence and testimony was also presented regarding the location of the blood in the apartment. Detective Sandra Ridgeway-Williams testified that \"there was a lot of blood\" in the apartment, but none in the kitchen. Sergeant Timothy McLeod acknowledged on cross-examination that his report of investigation indicated that there was \"blood in the area by the kitchen.\" Pictures taken of the crime scene show blood in the living room and by the door of the apartment. There is also blood on the living room carpet near the kitchen, but none on the linoleum in the kitchen itself. Sergeant McLeod conceded that, because the blood in that area was not tested, he could not tell whose blood it was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 46} In the end, each side pointed out inconsistencies and questioned the credibility of the other side's witnesses. For instance, the defense questioned D.D. regarding differences between what she told the police on scene compared to what she told them at the station three days later. On cross-examination, D.D. also admitted that she and Ms. Williams were mad at Mr. Huguley the day before Ms. Williams' death. The State, likewise, questioned Mr. Huguley regarding inconsistencies or missing details between what he initially told the police and his in-court testimony. The State also questioned Mr. Huguley's credibility beyond what happened immediately leading up to Ms. Williams' death. For instance, Mr. Huguley admitted that he \"made [ ] up\" a story that he was crying over difficulties in his relationship with Ms. Williams in order to convince a relative to speak to Ms. Williams about the relationship. On the other side, the defense suggested that the blood on the carpet near the kitchen should have been tested as it might have been Mr. Huguley's blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 47} As the Ohio Supreme Court has noted, \"the weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of facts.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Summit No. 23104,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-238\">\n    2007-Ohio-238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20162828\">\n    2007 WL 162828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Upon review, this Court cannot say that the jury lost its way in finding that Mr. Huguley failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he acted in self-defense. While there were some inconsistencies in the State's case, there were also inconsistencies in Mr. Huguley's version of the events. Under Mr. Huguley's version of the events, Ms. Williams was the initial aggressor and he believed he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm, thus justifying his use of deadly force. But, even under Mr. Huguley's version of the events, at the point in time that he stabbed Ms. Williams, she no longer had a weapon because he had taken the knife from her. Although Mr. Huguley testified that he still considered\n   Ms. Williams \"[a] threat,\" the jury was free to disbelieve that testimony or find it objectively unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Keil\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist. Richland No. 16CA28,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-593\">\n    2017-Ohio-593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20677070\">\n    2017 WL 677070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 42 (\"threat ended when [the other party] was disarmed\"). In addition to the fact that Mr. Huguley had disarmed Ms. Williams, the jury was presented evidence that Mr. Huguley was taller and weighed more than Ms. Williams, and that Mr. Huguley pushed D.D. out of the way when she attempted to aid Ms. Williams. Regarding the failure to test the blood on the carpet near the kitchen, the presence of Mr. Huguley's blood in that area would at most support that Ms. Williams may have been the initial aggressor. The jury, who heard the witnesses first hand, was still free to \"reject[ ] [Mr. Huguley's] contention that he had a bona fide belief that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1821067\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/22/281/#p284\">\n    22 Ohio St.3d at 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=490%20N.E.2d%20893\">\n    490 N.E.2d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[T]his Court will not reverse a conviction where the jury chose to believe the testimony of the State's witnesses over that of the defendant's.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
