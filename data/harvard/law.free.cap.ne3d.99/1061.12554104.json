In some cases, it may be true that a parent's assertion of the effect of a denial of custody to a relative on her residual parenting rights will confer standing. However, the assertion of injury to a parent's residual parenting rights cannot be redressed where the requested relief is to award custody to a relative who did not appeal the denial of her or his custody petition. Therefore, we hold that a parent has no standing to appeal an award of permanent custody and a denial of a relative's custody petition where the parent does not challenge the termination of her parental rights and the relative did not appeal the denial of her custody petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In this case, mother no longer seeks custody of the children, and neither does the aunt whom mother puts forth as a candidate for custody.

Here, the children do not challenge the termination of their mother's parental rights. They concede that, upon finding that mother was not interested in reunification, the juvenile court was left with only two options: granting permanent custody to HCJFS or to the aunt who had filed a petition for custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Relying on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Z.H.\n   </em>\n   , the children argue that their appeal should not be dismissed because they have standing to challenge the grant of permanent custody to HCJFS. In\n   <em>\n    Z.H.\n   </em>\n   , we held that a child in a permanent-custody proceeding has standing to appeal the termination of his parent's parental rights, recognizing that the child has a legal interest in being cared for by his natural parents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204755282\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In that case, both the child and his mother challenged the termination of the mother's parental rights, not the denial of custody to a relative. We recognized that the child had standing to appeal because, unlike the appellants in\n   <em>\n    A.W.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    T.W.\n   </em>\n   , the child was asserting his own injury from termination of his mother's parental rights (the right to be raised by his parents), not those of a nonappealing relative, and his mother likewise contested the termination of her own parental rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.

Where, as here, the parent does not contest termination of her parental rights and does not seek custody, and where the only interested relative has not appealed the denial of custody, we find the children's injury could not be redressed by this court if we were to reverse the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Z.H.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.

R.C. 2151.01\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 20} A child who is the subject of a juvenile court action is a party thereto. Juv.R. 2(Y). And the majority recognizes that \"children clearly have an interest in their custody.\" Liberally interpreted and construed, \"in a family environment\" includes, at a minimum, being cared for by an aunt, uncle, grandparent, adult-sibling or other close relative. Recognizing the children's standing to appeal this matter in which they participated as parties below would \"provide judicial procedures * * * in which the parties are assured of a fair hearing, and their * * * rights are recognized and enforced.\" R.C. 2151.01(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 21} I disagree with the majority's conclusion that the children are attempting to assert the rights of their aunt. They are not. They are seeking to further via appeal their right to be heard regarding their placement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"705669\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/101/398/\">\n    101 Ohio St.3d 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-1500\">\n    2004-Ohio-1500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=805%20N.E.2d%201110\">\n    805 N.E.2d 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that a child is a party to a permanent custody proceeding and is entitled to counsel under certain circumstances). This is the exact conclusion we reached in\n   <em>\n    Z.H.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Z.H.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6 (\"In other words, appellants in those cases were attempting to assert someone else's injury as the basis for their appeals. Here, Z.H. is asserting his own injury.\"). The children should be permitted to assert their own injury. The cases\n   <em>\n    Z.H.\n   </em>\n   distinguished were cases where parents whose rights had been terminated attempted to argue that the children should have been placed with someone else-like mother attempted here.\n   <em>\n    Z.H.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Unlike a parent, a child's interest in her own placement could never be extinguished. The child is always interested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 22} I also disagree with the majority's conclusion that the children's alleged injury is not redressable by this court, thereby depriving us of jurisdiction. The aunt petitioned for legal custody below. Granted, she has not appealed. But we do not know what this means. The majority presumes that the aunt is no longer interested in having legal custody of the children. Maybe. But maybe she can't afford counsel, doesn't know how to proceed pro se, and is relying on the children's appointed counsel. We simply don't know whether she remains interested. However, this concern goes to our choice of remedy. It does not act to bar the children's right to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 23} If we were to hear this case on the merits, and decide in favor of the children that they should have been placed in the legal custody of their aunt, we could vacate the judgment and remand for a new hearing. The aunt would have the opportunity to petition again. Or if we were convinced that a full hearing would not be needed, we could remand with instructions to order custody be given to the aunt so long as she consents. The point being: perceived difficulty in fashioning a remedy isn't reason to deny appellate standing so long as some remedy is available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Small twists to these facts show the conundrum caused by this holding. Suppose custody had been granted to the aunt, and the children appealed arguing the aunt is abusive and seeking the remedy of being placed with a grandmother who never petitioned for them. Would we\n   conclude that we couldn't hear their appeal?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 25} What if the aunt attempted to appeal here, but did so untimely? Would that indication of interest be sufficient to grant standing to the children? What if the aunt filed an amicus brief in support of the children? We could not then say that we were uncertain of the aunt's wishes. Yet, this isn't how standing is traditionally determined. The children have standing in their own right as we recognized in\n   <em>\n    Z.H.\n   </em>\n   Their standing is not contingent on an adult's standing. We should decide this matter on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Instead, we are left with the troubling holding that children who are unquestionably parties to the juvenile court proceeding can't assert their own interests on appeal. I would apply\n   <em>\n    Z.H.\n   </em>\n   to hold that the children have standing to appeal-not merely derivative standing if an adult also appeals. I agree with the majority's holding that mother lacks independent standing to appeal because she is not asserting her own injury, but I would allow her brief to be considered as an amicus curiae brief in support of the children. I would then decide the case on the merits.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
