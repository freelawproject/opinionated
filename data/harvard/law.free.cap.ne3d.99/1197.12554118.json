In April 2015, the trial court granted the defendant's motion for an independent psychiatric assessment of the brothers. The record indicates that the findings \"were not favorable to the defense.\" Colon subsequently pled guilty to three counts of sexual battery in violation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(2), i.e., felonies of the third degree, and the remaining counts were dismissed. The trial court subsequently determined that Colon had committed \"the worst form of the offense,\" and sentenced him to three consecutive five-year terms of incarceration on each count, and also designated that he is a Tier III sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On direct appeal, Colon challenged the imposition of consecutive sentences and court costs, and also argued that R.C. 2907.03(A)(2) is unconstitutional. This court affirmed the conviction and sentence, reversed the and remanded for resentencing on court costs only, and declined to address the constitutionality of R.C. 2907.03(A)(2) because this challenge was not first raised in the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

He maintained that his trial counsel did not warn him of the constitutional defects of R.C. 2907.03(A)(2), and that it impermissibly prohibits some individuals \"from consenting to sexual conduct even though they were willing to participate in such conduct\" and prevents impaired persons such as the victims from \"reproducing unless married.\" He also complained that there is a \"substantial question as to whether either of the victims in this case are impaired\" under R.C. 2907.03(A)(2). The trial court denied Colon's motion without a hearing. Colon filed a motion for reconsideration that was also denied, and Colon now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Motion to Vacate\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On appeal, Colon complains that the trial court erred in denying his motion to vacate his guilty plea without holding a hearing because he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel in entering the plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Under Crim.R. 32.1, a defendant who seeks to withdraw a plea of guilty after the imposition of sentence has the burden of establishing the existence of manifest injustice. A manifest injustice is a fundamental flaw in the proceedings that results in a miscarriage of justice or is inconsistent with the requirements of due process.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In a similar case, the court concluded that the defendant lacked standing to assert such a challenge since he is not asserting his own constitutional rights, but the rights of impaired individuals such as his victims, and he is not in a special relationship or a relationship of confidence or advocacy with them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   While there is some evidence which respondents claim support a defense of consent, it was the victim herself who reported the sexual battery and testified against the respondents at the bond hearing. Based on the foregoing we can hardly say that the victim could be looking to the respondents to assert her right of privacy. Similarly, the impact of such litigation on third party interests, namely the right of all minors to engage in consensual sexual activity, is not vindicated in a criminal prosecution where the minor victim is maintaining a lack of consent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Therefore, we hold that the respondents had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of section 800.04, Florida Statutes (1989), on the asserted ground of the right of sexual privacy of the minor victim. We also note that this is consistent with the holding of other courts who have addressed this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferris v.

Likewise, we hold that R.C. 2907.03 does not violate due process or equal protection insofar as it prohibits an offender from taking unconscionable advantage of the victim by engaging in sexual conduct when he knows that the other person's ability to appraise the nature of or control their conduct is substantially impaired. Accordingly, we reject Colon's facial due process and equal protection challenges to R.C. 2907.03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} We recognize that the Ohio Supreme Court recently held that R.C. 2907.03(A)(13), which makes peace officers strictly liable for sexual conduct with anyone under the age of 18 when the offender is more than two years older, is unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    State v. Mole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280465\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/149/215/\">\n    149 Ohio St. 3d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280465\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/149/215/\">\n    2016-Ohio-5124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20N.E.3d%20368\">\n    74 N.E.3d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Mole\n   </em>\n   court concluded that under the language of R.C. 2907.03(A)(13), \"[p]eace officers are\n   liable under the statute even if they did not use their status as peace officers to identify potential victims and abuse them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43. Therefore, the court held that the classification of peace officers is not rationally related to the government interest in protecting minors from sexual coercion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56. As is relevant herein, however, the court noted that the General Assembly had chosen to enumerate \"specific situations where an offender might take unconscionable advantage of a victim,\" in promulgating R.C. 2907.03(A), and that is exactly the situation presented in this matter. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Mole\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from this matter because the instant offense involves R.C. 2907.03(A)(2), which requires that the offender acted \"knowingly,\" i.e., knows that the other person's ability to appraise the nature of or control the other person's own conduct is substantially impaired. Conversely, Mole's convictions under R.C. 2907.03(A)(13) imposed strict liability with no mens rea element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In accordance with all of the foregoing, we are unable to conclude that Colon's guilty plea was the result of deficient performance. The first required showing under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   has not been established. Therefore the claim of ineffectiveness of counsel failed as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Moreover, since the claim of ineffectiveness of counsel was not meritorious, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Colon's postsentence motion to vacate his guilty pleas. Additionally, the court was not required to hold a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The assigned error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   TIM McCORMACK, P.J., and MELODY J. STEWART, J., CONCUR\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Colon's motion to vacate his guilty plea, filed February 12, 2016, was filed while his direct appeal was pending, so the trial court had no jurisdiction to consider this motion.\n    <em>\n     State v. Leach\n    </em>\n    , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 84794,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005-Ohio-1870\">\n     2005-Ohio-1870\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20927002\">\n     2005 WL 927002\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 16-18. The motion to vacate was denied, and on July 18, 2016, following the completion of his direct appeal, Colon filed a motion for reconsideration. Herein, he appeals from the trial court's denial of his motion for reconsideration. We conclude that the trial court's denial of the February 2016 motion does not bar Colon's claims on reconsideration.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
