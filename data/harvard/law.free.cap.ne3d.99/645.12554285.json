But is reversal necessary when the violation resulted directly from the defendant's affirmative actions at trial?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this case, defense counsel expressly agreed to the trial court's constitutionally-defective procedure for removing and replacing a juror after deliberations had begun, ultimately compromising the defendant's right to an impartial jury.

He was tried a second time for murder along with eight drug-related charges. Just under two hours after the jury had begun its deliberations, one of the jurors-Juror 12-sent a note to the court requesting to be excused from service because she \"[could] not agree quickl[y] on the charges [or] come to a decision on the charges.\" Appellant's App. Vol. IV, p.64. Counsel from both sides then met with the trial judge in chambers and off the record to discuss what to do. Returning to open court, defense counsel and the State's attorney both agreed to replace Juror 12 with the second alternate juror if the jury had yet to reach a verdict on any count.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Durden's lawyer expressed a preference for keeping Juror 12 if the panel had \"reached verdicts on some of the counts.\" Tr. Vol. IV, p.177. The court, after commenting that Juror 12 was \"subverting the integrity of the process,\" stated that \"in a situation like this we all have to agree.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 177-78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   With consent from defense counsel and the State's attorney, the court then summoned the jury foreman, who-after acknowledging, without elaboration, Juror 12's request to withdraw-stated that the jury had agreed on six drug counts but was \"waiting to do\" the murder charge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 177-79. The court then instructed the foreman not to discuss his testimony with the other jurors. After consulting with his client, Durden's lawyer informed the court that they were \"not opposed to having [Juror 12] excused, being replaced by the second alternate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180. The judge asked whether defense counsel had \"any caveats\" or special instructions for the jury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180-81. Defense counsel declined, replying that he \"[could]n't think of anything\" and \"that's why there's an alternate, I guess.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 181. To clarify the procedure, the judge then asked whether he should simply \"go in there\" to excuse Juror 12, thank her for her service, and then instruct the alternate to participate in deliberations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"I think the less traumatic it is the better,\" defense counsel replied, \"I prefer it that way.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 181-82. \"I kind of needed your permission if I'm not doing it on the record,\" the judge stated, seeking assurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182. \"Yes,\" defense counsel replied affirmatively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Then that's what we'll do,\" the judge responded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court then replaced Juror 12 with the second alternate. When the foreperson asked whether \"they were supposed to go over the counts on which they'd already reached a verdict,\" the court responded that \"you are the jury. You decide that.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 184. The jury then resumed its deliberations, ultimately finding Durden guilty on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Durden appealed his murder conviction, arguing that, despite his acquiescence, the court's procedure violated his constitutional right to an impartial jury, thus resulting in reversible error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Durden specifically faulted the court for (1) failing to interview\n   Juror 12 to determine the grounds for her removal; (2) arbitrarily designating the second alternate juror in lieu of the first alternate, contrary to Indiana Trial Rule 47(B) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) neglecting to admonish the remaining jurors to avoid any prejudicial effect removal may have had on further deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Our Court of Appeals reversed Durden's conviction, finding Juror 12's removal \"unjustified\" and thus \"structural error\" under\n   <em>\n    Riggs v.
