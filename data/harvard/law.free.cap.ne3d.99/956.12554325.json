(collectively \"Woods Cove\"), and Cuyahoga County Treasurer Christopher Murray's (\"Treasurer\"), motions to dismiss Stewart's second amended class action complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief and for damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} For the reasons that follow, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Stewart filed his second amended class action complaint for declaratory judgment, permanent injunction, writ of mandamus, and for damages (\"second amended complaint\") against Woods Cove and the Treasurer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   His claims concern Ohio's tax certificate legislation, R.C. 5721.30 through 5721.46, and specifically, the provisions that permit the Treasurer to sell tax certificates for real properties to third-party investors like Woods Cove. Stewart brought his claims on behalf of \"all persons in the State of Ohio whose property tax delinquencies have been certified by [the] Treasurer, and whose certificates were sold to [Woods Cove] by agreement with the Treasurer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} According to Stewart, from April 20, 2012 through May 10, 2013, and from September 9, 2013 through September 9, 2014, Woods Cove \"was the exclusive purchaser of tax lien certificates from the Treasurer\" pursuant to two tax certificate purchase/sale agreements. Stewart attached a copy of the tax certificate purchase/sale agreements to his second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Stewart claimed that during the stated time period the Treasurer sold tax lien certificates to Woods Cove for the properties owned by Stewart, Patton, and Brazil. Stewart attached the applicable tax certificates to his second amended complaint. Stewart further alleged that the delinquent property tax certificates sold to Woods Cove pursuant to the tax certificate purchase/sale agreements \"were disproportionately comprised of properties located in communities having significantly higher concentrations of racial minority populations than Cuyahoga County as a whole.\" He also asserted that Woods Cove entered into agreements with taxpayers for repayment under the tax lien certificates that resulted in interest rates in excess of the 18 percent limit imposed by the tax certificate statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} As a result of the Treasurer and Woods Cove's agreements and their conduct related to the agreements, Stewart alleged that he was subject to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) tax policy effectively legislated ad hoc by the executive branch of government and private entities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (2) the unconstitutional taking of properties for private benefit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (3) the denial of equal protection of law based upon the Treasurer's racial selection of properties being sold to third-party investors like Woods Cove;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (4) the deprivation of due process because the Treasurer delegates the required notice of redemption rights under the tax certificate statute to third-party investors like Woods Cove;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (5) unfair, deceptive, and unconscionable practices as a result of the tax lien certificate purchasers' negotiations of repayment agreements with interest and fees in excess of statutory amounts; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (6) unlawful and discriminatory credit practices because of the disproportionate effect upon racial minorities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 7} As such, Stewart's second amended complaint sought a declaratory judgment that the tax lien statute was unconstitutional pursuant to the Takings Cause, Article I, Section 19 of the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and the Nondelegation Clause, Article II, Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution and Article I, Section 1 of the United States Constitution. He also requested a declaratory judgment that the tax certificate sale/purchase agreements were unconstitutional pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause, Article I, Section 2 of the Ohio Constitution, the Due Process Clause, Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and in violation of Ohio's competitive bidding statute, R.C. 307.86. Stewart further alleged causes of action under 42 U.S.C. 1983, the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, the Ohio Civil Rights statute, and the Truth in Lending Act, and he sought a writ of mandamus compelling the Treasurer to exercise his authority under the tax certificate statute in compliance with the constitutional and statutory guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In response to the second amended complaint, Woods Cove filed a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Woods Cove argued that Stewart's claims should be dismissed because they failed to present a \"real controversy or justiciable issue between the parties.\" Specifically, Woods Cove claimed that Stewart's challenges to R.C. Chapter 5721 and the tax certificate sale/purchase agreements were not ripe for review because the allegations simply stated that Woods Cove \"purchased tax certificates regarding their properties\" and failed to allege that Stewart had \"actually been deprived of [his] property.\" Woods Cove also argued that the second amended complaint should be dismissed because Stewart failed to serve a copy upon the attorney general; he failed to properly allege a violation under 42 U.S.C. 1983 ; he lacked standing to pursue claims under the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act and Civil Rights Act; the mandamus action was improperly disguised as a claim for declaratory judgment and injunction; and he failed to properly allege a claim under the Truth in Lending Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The Treasurer also filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, which joined in and incorporated the motion to dismiss filed by Woods Cove. The Treasurer further argued that Stewart's claims under the Ohio Constitution failed because there is no private right of action for such claims, and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Stewart failed to name the attorney general as a party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Stewart filed oppositions to the motions to dismiss, arguing that his claims presented a justiciable controversy. Stewart claimed that the validity of the forfeiture provision of the tax certificate statute was ripe for review because when the Treasurer sold the tax certificates to Woods Cove, a final decision \"was reached\" with respect to the properties. Stewart also argued that the Treasurer's discretion to \"arbitrarily select from among parcels\" to sell and to be subjected\n   to \"increased interest and additional costs and fees * * * is in fact full, entire, complete, and absolute.\" And Stewart asserted that he properly alleged claims for declaratory judgment and violations under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and the Truth in Lending Act; that any procedural defect to serve the attorney general was curable; and that he had standing to assert claims under the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act and the Ohio Civil Rights Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} After considering the motions to dismiss, the trial court granted Woods Cove and the Treasurer's motions to dismiss stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Motion to dismiss of Defendant Cuyahoga County Treasurer W. Christopher Murray II, filed 05/26/2016, is granted. Motion to dismiss of Defendants Woods Cove II, LLC and Woods Cove III, LLC, filed 05/25/02016, is granted. While plaintiffs are parties who have properties encumbered by tax certificate liens, they have not lost their properties to tax certificate forfeiture orders recently. All of these constitutional arguments raised by plaintiffs can be raised if a foreclosure case is filed against these plaintiffs. The court agrees with the defendants['] argument that the plaintiffs' claims are premature. Until a tax foreclosure complaint is filed by a tax certificate holder, like Woods Cove II, III, or IV, the injury or harm to the property owner's interests seems speculative and premature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 12} It is from this judgment that Stewart appeals. He asserts the following two assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1. The trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss of defendant-appellee W. Christopher Murray II, Cuyahoga County Treasurer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   2. The trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss of defendants-appellees Woods Cove II, L.L.C. and Woods Cove III, L.L.C.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Therefore, we will consider both assignments of error together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Stewart argues that the trial court improperly determined that his claims were not ripe for adjudication because foreclosure actions had not been filed. In support of this argument, Stewart claims that the trial court failed to exclude evidence outside of the complaint and failed to provide notice to the parties that it was going to consider such evidence and, thus, the trial court improperly treated the motions to dismiss as motions for summary judgment. Stewart also argues that the sale of the tax certificate, and not the initiation of foreclosure actions, gave rise to the adjudicability of the claims asserted in his second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Woods Cove and the Treasurer, however, argue that the trial court properly granted their motions to dismiss because Stewart's claims were not ripe for adjudication because he failed to allege that the properties had been foreclosed upon or forfeited under the tax certificate. According to Woods Cove and the Treasurer, the mere allegation that the Treasurer had sold tax certificates for the properties was insufficient to trigger a real and justiciable controversy.

Not only does Stewart make specific constitutional and statutory challenges to the tax certificate statute and the tax certificate sale/purchase agreements, but he also claims that he has been damaged by them. For example, Stewart alleged that property owners, like Brazil, Patton, and others similarly situated, suffered harm when Woods Cove purchased the tax certificates from the Treasurer because the property owners were subjected to an increased interest rate of more than 18 percent if they wanted to redeem their properties. And, according to Stewart's second amended complaint, the manner in which the Treasurer sold the tax certificates to Woods Cove was racially disproportionate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Taking the allegations in the seconded amended complaint as true and construing all reasonable inferences drawn from those allegations in favor of Stewart as we are required to do, we find that it does not appear beyond doubt that Stewart can prove no set of facts entitling him to the relief requested. We cannot say, at this stage of the litigation, that Stewart's claims are premature, speculative, or barred by the ripeness doctrine. We, however, are not commenting on the merits of Stewart's claims. Rather, given the liberal pleading standard and disfavoring of motions to dismiss, we hold that the trial court erred in granting Woods Cove and the Treasurer's motions to dismiss the second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 25} We further find that the trial court improperly considered factual evidence not before it when ruling on the motions to dismiss. Specifically, in its judgment, the trial court stated that \"[w]hile plaintiffs are parties who have properties encumbered by tax certificate liens, they have not lost their properties to tax certificate forfeiture orders recently.\" It then based its determination of the ripeness of Stewart's claims on the factual issue of whether foreclosure actions had been brought against the property owners. Thus, without notice to the parties, the trial court effectively considered factual issues outside the pleadings and improperly determined that no foreclosure actions had been brought against the properties, thereby justifying the dismissal of Stewart's second amended complaint. We find it reversible error for the trial court to have considered extraneous factual matters outside the pleadings without notification to the parties of its intention to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Stewart's first and second assignments of error are sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Judgment reversed and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   PATRICIA ANN BLACKMON, J., CONCURS;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, A.J., DISSENTS WITH SEPARATE OPINION\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Stewart filed an original complaint and a first amended complaint.

It is apparent that the trial court's conclusion that no foreclosure had yet been filed against appellants was based solely upon appellants' failure to assert in any of their three filed complaints that foreclosure actions had been filed against them. A review of the record demonstrates that appellees did not attach any evidentiary materials to their motions to dismiss; they merely pointed out that appellants' alleged harm was contingent because the complaint did not allege any foreclosure, and that the complaint therefore failed to present a justiciable or real controversy. Appellants' argument on appeal that the trial court impermissibly considered evidence outside the pleadings is nothing more than an attempt to recast their own pleading deficiency as the trial court's error, an argument the majority accepts, apparently without reference to the record. Interestingly, it is\n   <em>\n    appellants\n   </em>\n   who impermissibly sought to supplement the record on appeal by attaching new materials that were not part of the trial court record to their appellate brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Second, even assuming, as the majority concludes, that appellants' claims were not premature (a conclusion with which I disagree), I would find that the trial court properly granted appellees' motions to dismiss because independent, alternative grounds supported dismissal of their claims. These grounds were argued by the Treasurer and Woods Cove in their respective motions to dismiss, and in their briefs on appeal. Appellants do not address any of these issues on appeal, thereby abandoning any argument against them (the only argument raised by appellants is that their claims were not premature), and the majority does not address any of these alternative bases for dismissal in its opinion, even though its conclusion that appellants' claims were not premature does not render the other bases for dismissal argued by appellees moot. Because we may affirm on other grounds than those reached by the trial court, I would find, as explained below, that the trial court properly granted appellees' motions to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellants did not set forth any factual allegations to assert its legal conclusion that a sale of delinquent and unpaid property taxes constitutes a final decision to constitute an unlawful taking, nor do they (or the majority) cite to a single case that supports this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Most importantly, however, in their brief in opposition to Woods Cove's motion to dismiss, appellants conceded that the Treasurer's purported \"final decision\" to sell the tax certificates is not final at all. Specifically, appellants admitted that after the Treasurer sells the tax certificate, \"\n   <em>\n    absent some independent intervening affirmative act\n   </em>\n   , such as the election of a property owner to redeem, or the purchase of a foreclosed property at sheriff's auction by a third party, the property is subject to the forfeiture provision of the tax certificate statute.\" (Emphasis added.) Because, as appellants admitted, the property owner can avoid foreclosure at numerous points during the foreclosure process (e.g., by entering into a payment plan, by paying their delinquent taxes, by redeeming the property)-any of which appellants concede is an intervening event that breaks the causal connection between the sale of the tax certificate and the foreclosure-the Treasurer's sale of the tax certificates cannot constitute a final decision for purposes of a takings claim. Moreover, appellants' assertion that the Treasurer's sale of tax certificates is a final decision ignores the plain language of the statute, which allows the Treasurer to void the sale of a tax certificate for \"any reason.\" R.C. 5721.34. Without a \"final decision,\" appellants failed to adequately plead a takings claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Furthermore, appellants make no claim in the complaint that they sought and were denied compensation under Ohio\n   law for the alleged unlawful taking of their property-an essential element of a takings claim. In Ohio, a property owner alleging a physical or regulatory taking must file a mandamus action in state court to compel public authorities to institute appropriation proceedings. Until the state appropriation proceedings are complete and the property owner has been denied just compensation, there is no constitutional injury, and a Takings Clause claim is not ripe.\n   <em>\n    Cornerstone Developers, Ltd. v.
