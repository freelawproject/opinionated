GALLAGHER, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Roosevelt Chandler appeals his convictions for two counts of felonious assault, each accompanied with a three-year gun specification, and his resulting eight-year sentence. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The victim and his girlfriend shared an apartment within a two-building complex. The two buildings faced each other, with a shared parking lot in front of both buildings and an outdoor, common area in between. Chandler lived in an apartment directly across from the victim. The victim was in the parking lot while his stepdaughter was in the common area. According to the victim, Chandler's wife became irate at the noise caused by the victim's stepdaughter and other children, and Mrs. Chandler began verbally harassing the stepdaughter through the window of her apartment. The victim confronted Mrs. Chandler through the open window, and the two became verbally combative. The victim's girlfriend convinced him to walk away, and the altercation ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} According to Mrs. Chandler, she kindly asked the children to move away from the open window, and the victim suddenly appeared, verbally assaulted her, and threatened to kill her. In the process, the victim crawled halfway into the window, displacing the screen in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} There is no evidence that the victim was armed or supported the alleged threats against Mrs. Chandler with any type of weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Approximately three to eight minutes later, Chandler returned to the apartment and Mrs. Chandler related what had occurred. Chandler, who was carrying a loaded revolver in his pocket, pulled out the weapon and went outside to confront the victim. Words were exchanged, and either Chandler opened fire on the victim without provocation or Chandler believed the victim was reaching for a weapon and began shooting. The jury believed the victim's version of events. Regardless, during the shooting, Chandler reloaded the firearm at least once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In addition to the victim being shot, a seven-year-old child, who also lived in the apartment complex, was grazed by an errant bullet fired from Chandler's gun. It is undisputed that no other person fired any shots. The child victim was playing with the victim's stepdaughter before the altercation at Mrs. Chandler's window, and when the shooting started, the young child victim's mother called for her to come home. The child victim tried to run back to her apartment, but by the time she did so, the child victim had been grazed by a\n   bullet on the back of her thigh. The treating paramedic confirmed that the wound resembled those caused by bullets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Chandler testified at trial. He claimed he acted in self-defense because he believed that the victim was reaching for a weapon during their verbal confrontation. The jury was accordingly instructed. The trial court, however, refused to provide the jury with additional instructions on self-defense of another or the Castle Doctrine under R.C. 2901.05(B) -Chandler claimed his wife remained in danger from the earlier confrontation. The jury convicted Chandler for the felonious assault of the victim and the young child victim, both with accompanying three-year firearm specifications. This appeal timely followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The second, third, and fifth assignments of error are overruled. Chandler claims that the trial court erred by allowing the state to admit evidence of prior instances in which Chandler had altercations with weapons that were confiscated by police officers, in violation of Evid.R. 404(B). The trial court, however, denied the state's pretrial request to admit those prior acts as substantive evidence under Evid.R. 404(B). In denying the state's motion, the trial court indicated that if Chandler were to testify, the specific instances of conduct may be admissible as impeachment evidence depending on Chandler's answers to questions asked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1662555\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/77/293/#p299\">\n    77 Ohio App.3d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 299,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=602%20N.E.2d%20278\">\n    602 N.E.2d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12th Dist.1991) (witness's credibility may be impeached through the intrinsic means of cross-examination under Evid.R. 608(B) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Chandler does not challenge, nor even discuss, that ruling. Further, the state presented no substantive evidence of the prior conduct and did not attempt to introduce extrinsic evidence challenging Chandler's credibility. The specific instances of conduct evidence being challenged on appeal were introduced through the state's cross-examination of Chandler. The intrinsic, impeachment evidence was volunteered without objection and through Chandler's narrative-style answers to leading questions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of the record, we decline to address the assigned error as presented, which challenges the introduction of substantive evidence under Evid.R. 404(B), evidence specifically precluded. App.R. 16(A)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Chandler also claims his eight-year, aggregate sentence should be reversed as being excessive. We cannot even entertain that notion. According to the trial court and the state, the eight-year sentence is the statutory minimum in this case, a proposition not contested by Chandler. Tr. 1254:14-24. Chandler was convicted of two counts of felonious assault, each with a three-year firearm specification under R.C. 2941.145 that must be served consecutive to each other under R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g) and the underlying sentence under R.C. 2929.14(C)(1)(a).\n   <em>\n    State v.

Colloquially, the two specifications are typically differentiated by the resulting prison terms. The trial court concluded that those references were inappropriate at trial because the jury is generally precluded from considering the length of the sentences when determining guilt.\n   <em>\n    State v. Santiago\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Lorain No. 01CA007798,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%20388901\">\n    2002 WL 388901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15. Chandler contends that labeling the specifications without regard to the mandatory prison terms was per se error. Chandler, however, failed to offer any authority to support his argument as required under App.R. 16(A)(7). An appellate court has no responsibility to provide legal support for a party's argument. In light of the limited arguments presented and the general proposition of law that supports the trial court's decision, we overrule Chandler's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In the first assignment of error, Chandler claims the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on self-defense of another or the Castle Doctrine under R.C. 2901.05(B). According to Chandler, he reasonably believed his wife remained in imminent danger while the victim stood in the parking lot, or in the alternative and even though Chandler was in the common area of the apartment complex, he was entitled to the presumption under R.C. 2901.05(B) commonly known as the Castle Doctrine. We find no error with the jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} A trial court is provided the discretion to determine whether the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to require an instruction.\n   <em>\n    State v. Fulmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805154\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/117/319/\">\n    117 Ohio St.3d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-936\">\n    2008-Ohio-936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=883%20N.E.2d%201052\">\n    883 N.E.2d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 72. Jury instructions must be viewed as a whole to determine whether they contain prejudicial error.\n   <em>\n    State v. Fields\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6709239\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/13/433/#p436\">\n    13 Ohio App.3d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 436,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=469%20N.E.2d%20939\">\n    469 N.E.2d 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Dist.1984). In this case, there is no evidence to support an instruction on the defense of another or the Castle Doctrine as established under R.C. 2901.05(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Under R.C. 2901.05(B)(1), it can be presumed that a person acted in self-defense or defense of another, \"if the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the person using the defensive force.\" That presumption, however, does not apply \"if the person against whom the defensive force is used has a right to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.\" R.C. 2901.05(B)(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Even if we accepted Chandler's claim that he had a right to assert the defense in the common area of the apartment complex, which we do only for the sake of discussion, Chandler's claim cuts both ways. If Chandler is given the benefit of every legal doubt about the applicability of R.C. 2901.05(B)(1), he would not be entitled to the statutory presumption of having acted in self-defense. In order to apply the presumption, it would have to be determined that the common area of the apartment complex is included within the definition of \"residence\" under the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=469%20N.E.2d%20939\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If that assumption were made, the fact that the victim lived in the same complex necessarily means that the victim was shot in his \"residence\" as defined by Chandler. It would then follow that the presumption does not statutorily apply because the person against whom the defensive force was used, the victim, was a lawful \"resident\" of the apartment complex under Chandler's theory. R.C. 2901.05(B)(2)(a). Chandler's argument is self-defeating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} With respect to the self-defense of another jury instruction, defense of another is similar to a self-defense\n   claim, but the person claiming self-defense stands in the shoes of the person whom he is aiding.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although that is a possibility, the child victim's mother testified that the wound occurred during the shooting, and the responding paramedic indicated the wound resembled one caused by a bullet. The young child victim was also treated for that type of wound. The state presented sufficient evidence connecting the child victim's injury to Chandler's knowingly firing a handgun at the victim when the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In addition, Chandler admitted that he had purposely shot the victim, but claimed the intentional shooting was justified.

Essentially, Chandler is asking this court to believe his version of events and ignore the evidence from every other witness. The jury did not find Chandler credible, and Chandler has not demonstrated that the other witnesses lacked credibility.
