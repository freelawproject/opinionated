The trial court committed reversible error by wrongly determining that purely economic damages are not recoverable under Ohio's cause of action for breach of implied warranty in tort and/or negligent design not sounding in product liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   V. The trial court committed reversible error by failing to grant Plaintiff-Appellant leave to amend her Complaint pursuant to Ohio Civil Procedure Rule 15(A), to cure any perceived pleading deficiencies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Having reviewed the record and pertinent law, we affirm the trial court's judgment. The apposite facts follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In May 2014, Michelson bought a 2009 Volkswagen CC Sport (\"the Vehicle\") in Cuyahoga County from an unnamed seller. In December 2016, when the Vehicle had approximately 90,000 miles on it, the timing chain system failed, requiring replacement of the engine at a cost of more than $7,000. On March 2, 2017, Michelson filed a complaint against Volkswagen alleging: 1) unfair and/or deceptive acts in violation of R.C. 1345.02(A) ; 2) deceptive trade practices in violation of R.C. 4165.02 ; and 3) design or manufacturing defects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The gist of Michelson's lawsuit, as evidenced by her complaint, her brief in opposition to Volkswagen's motion to dismiss, and her appellate briefs, is that \"the Volkswagen Defendants manufactured and distributed a vehicle that they knew, or reasonably should have known, has serious manufacturing and design defects, including a defective timing chain system in the engine that makes the car highly unsafe * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On May 31, 2017, the court granted Volkswagen's motion to dismiss under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. It is from this order that Michelson appeals. We address Michelson's assigned errors together when necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review- Civ.R. 12(B)(6) Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Our standard of review on a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss is de novo. A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is procedural and tests the sufficiency of the complaint.

Additionally, evidence in the record shows that the Vehicle was at least seven years old and had approximately 90,000 miles on it when the engine failed. Furthermore, Michelson does not allege that the Vehicle was covered under warranty, and Michelson made no allegation that Volkswagen failed to repair it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In\n   <em>\n    Curl v.

Michelson asserted none of these claims in her complaint. Upon review, we find that Michelson's claim is not the type envisioned under the CSPA. Therefore, accepting all factual allegations as true, we find that Michelson has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under the CSPA, and the trial court properly dismissed this claim pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Deceptive Trade Practices Act\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 16} This court has held that \"[t]he Ohio Deceptive Trade Practices Act is substantially similar to the federal Lanham Act, and it generally regulates trademarks, unfair competition, and false advertising.\"\n   <em>\n    Dawson v.

In following\n   <em>\n    Dawson,\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   we find that Michelson cannot, as a matter of law, bring a claim against Volkswagen under\n   R.C. Chapter 4165. Therefore, Michelson can prove no set of facts entitling her to relief under this claim, and the court properly dismissed it under Civ.R. 12(B)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Product Liability; Design or Manufacturing Defects\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In Michelson's third claim, she alleges that Volkswagen \"manufactured, designed, distributed and/or sold the CC Sport with a Timing Chain System that was defective. The Timing Chain System Defect is a design and/or manufacturing defect.\" The language Michelson used sounds like a strict liability or defective product claim. However, Michelson further alleges that Volkswagen's conduct was \"negligent * * *[,] intentional, fraudulent and willful * * *.\" Negligence claims are separate and distinct from intentional tort claims, and a plain reading of Michelson's third claim shows that she alleges both. Despite being inconsistent and confusing, in the interests of justice, we review three possible legal theories that Michelson may (or may not) have intended in her third cause of action. We are mindful that, under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), we must accept all factual allegations as true. We are not, however, required to accept legal conclusions as true nor are we required to decipher a deficient complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Statutory Product Liability\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On appeal, Michelson argues that her third cause of action is not a product liability claim, despite that the language used in her complaint mirrors the language used in R.C. 2307.75, which governs when a product is defective for the purpose of product liability claims. Although it appears that Michelson intended to allege a product liability claim here, her claim must fail as a matter of law for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 19} R.C. 2307.71(A)(13) states, in part, that a product liability claim\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   means a claim or cause of action * * * that seeks to recover compensatory damages from a manufacturer or supplier for death, physical injury to person, emotional distress, or physical damage to property other than the product in question, that allegedly arose from any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (a) The design, formulation, production, construction, creation, assembly, rebuilding, testing, or marketing of that product;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (b) Any warning or instruction, or lack of warning or instruction, associated with that product;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (c) Any failure of that product to conform to any relevant representation or warranty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In her complaint, Michelson alleged $7,000 in damages to the Vehicle and $200 in damages for the replacement rental car cost. We find that, as a matter of law, Michelson did not allege damages that are recoverable under R.C. 2307.71 ; therefore, she failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted for product liability.\n   <em>\n    LaPuma v.

Assuming, for argument's sake,\n   that Michelson is claiming breach of an implied warranty in tort, we find that she has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 22} To succeed on a breach of implied warranty claim, a plaintiff must allege and prove \"by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) there was, in fact, a defect in the product manufactured and sold by the defendant; (2) such defect existed at the time the product left the hands of the defendant; and (3) the defect was the direct and proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries or loss.\"\n   <em>\n    State Auto Mut.

Specifically, Michelson's sole allegation regarding the second element of a breach of implied warranty claim is as follows: \"Unbeknownst to Ms. Michelson, when she purchased the CC Sport, and when that Vehicle left Defendants' hands, there was a significant manufacturing and/or design defect in the Vehicle's timing chain system * * *.\" In looking at the complaint-and only at the complaint, as we must-Michelson alleged that she purchased a 2009 automobile in 2014.

While a complaint attacked by a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, Gallo's obligation to provide the grounds of her entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.

Accordingly, the court did not err by dismissing Michelson's third cause of action, because it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Michelson's assigned errors one, two, three, and four are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Leave to Amend Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 30} On appeal, Michelson asks this court to grant her \"leave to amend her Complaint to address any perceived pleading deficiencies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Upon review of the docket, we find that Michelson did not file a motion for leave to amend her complaint. Rather, the last sentence in the conclusion of her brief in opposition to Volkswagen's motion to dismiss states as follows: \"In the alternative, if the Court finds that additional particularity is required, then in the interest of fairness and justice, Ms. Michelson requests that the Court grant her leave to file an amended complaint within thirty (30) days of the Court's ruling.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 32} At the time Michelson filed her brief in opposition to Volkswagen's motion to dismiss, she did not need leave of court to amend her complaint under Civ.R. 15(A). \"A party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within * * * twenty-eight days after service of a motion under Civ.R. 12(B) * * *.\" According to the trial court's docket, Volkswagen filed its motion to dismiss on May 3, 2017, and Michelson filed her brief in opposition on May 24, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Michelson did not file an amended complaint, nor did she file a motion for leave upon which the court could rule. Furthermore, to this day, Michelson has not alleged or otherwise put the court on notice of any new facts which would entitle her to relief under the causes of action she pled in her complaint. On appeal, Michelson argues that \"since any amendment would simply be to address supposed\n   pleading defects, and not to change any claims, there would be no new matters to support.\" However, as discussed throughout this opinion, the claims in Michelson's complaint fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 34} No matter the labels Michelson applies nor the conclusions she reaches, the essence of her claims is that a car manufacturer knowingly produced defective vehicles, one of which she bought secondhand. Michelson does not allege that the Vehicle was under warranty, which would be an obvious theory of recovery. Michelson also does not allege breach of contract, Ohio's Lemon Law, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, the Used Motor Vehicle Trade Regulation Rule,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   or fraud. These would also be potential theories of recovery for a defective automobile. None of this is to say that Volkswagen did or did not manufacture a defective product. Rather, our holding is limited to finding that, as pled in her complaint, Michelson fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Accordingly, we cannot say that the court erred by dismissing Michelson's complaint, and her fifth and final assigned error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   TIM McCORMACK, P.J., and KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, J., CONCUR\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    As will be discussed later in this opinion, the legal theory upon which Michelson's \"Count Three\" is based is disputed by the parties. A plain reading of \"Count Three\" leads this court to believe that Michelson is alleging a design or manufacturing defect sounding in product liability. Volkswagen agrees with this assessment. Michelson, however, argues on appeal that her third cause of action sounds in either \"implied warranty\" or \"negligent design.\" In an abundance of caution, this court will address all three legal theories.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    We are aware that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio has held that \"an individual consumer does have standing to sue under the ODTPA * * *.\"\n    <em>\n     Schumacher v.
