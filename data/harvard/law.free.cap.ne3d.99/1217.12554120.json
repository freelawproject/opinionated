For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On April 29, 1993, Durant pleaded guilty to one count of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02 and one count of aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2923.02 and 2911.01. Both counts stem from an incident that occurred on November 19, 1992. Durant, then 19 years old, came upon his 28-year-old victim while she was jogging in Forest Hills Park. Intending to rob the victim, Durant produced a weapon and led her to a secluded area. Durant took the victim's rings, ordered her to remove her clothes, and then raped her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On June 15, 1993, the trial court sentenced Durant to a maximum of 25 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On August 2, 2016, in preparation for Durant's release, the trial court conducted an H.B. 180 hearing. As a result of that hearing, Durant was classified as a sexual predator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Durant now appeals, arguing in two assignments of error that the trial court erred in classifying him as a sexual predator. Specifically, Durant argues that (1) the trial court did not address the likelihood that he would reoffend, and (2) the state failed to prove by clear and convincing\n   evidence that Durant is likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Law and Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Former R.C. 2950.01 et seq., codified under H.B. 180 and popularly known as \"Megan's Law,\" created three classifications for sexual offenders: sexually oriented offender, habitual sex offender, and sexual predator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   former R.C. 2950.09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The sexual predator classification attaches automatically in those cases where an offender is convicted of a violent sexually oriented offense and a specification alleging that he or she is a sexually violent predator.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because the civil manifest weight of the evidence affords the lower court more deference than the criminal standard, the trial court's determination will not be disturbed where it was supported by some competent, credible evidence.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Durant first argues that his sexual predator classification is invalid because the trial court made that determination without making the required finding that he was likely to commit a future sex offense. When describing a \"model\" sexual offender classification hearing, the Ohio Supreme Court stated that \"the trial court should consider the factors listed in R.C. 2950.09(B)(2), and should discuss on the record the particular evidence and factors upon which it relies in making its determination regarding the likelihood of recidivism.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In light of the definition of sexual predator, a trial court's discussion of the statutory factors need not include an explicit statement that the offender is likely to reoffend. Such a statement is redundant where the trial court determines that an individual is properly classified as a sexual predator.\n   <em>\n    Blake-Taylor,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100419,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-3495\">\n    2014-Ohio-3495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203953990\">\n    2014 WL 3953990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Durant next argues that the state was unable to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses. In support of this assignment of error, Durant discusses factors that weigh against recidivism, including his age at the time of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} \"[T]he trial court should discuss on the record the particular evidence and factors upon which it relies in making its determination regarding the likelihood of recidivism.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, the factors Durant attempts to present in mitigation were heard and fully considered by the trial court during the classification hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Based on a thorough review of the classification hearing, we find that the record includes a discussion of the relevant statutory factors, as well as multiple factors that support the trial court's classification of Durant as a sexual predator. The trial court heard testimony regarding the Static-99, an actuarial instrument that assigns point values to certain objective factors and produces an assessment of the likelihood that an individual will reoffend. In its discussion of the Static-99, the trial court considered Durant's age, relationship history, relationship to the victim, among other factors. Durant scored a \"5\" on the Static-99, which places him at a \"moderate/high\" risk of reoffending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The trial court also heard testimony regarding the nature of the underlying\n   sexual offense, Durant's past behavioral problems, the degree to which he participated in and completed sexual offender programming, and his disciplinary history while incarcerated. While Durant has completed some sex-offender treatment while incarcerated, he stopped attending a comprehensive sex offender program after three months, without explanation and against the advice of staff and other inmates in the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Based upon a holistic view of the evidence presented in the classification hearing, the trial court's determination was based on competent and credible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Durant's assignments of error are overruled, and his sexual predator classification is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   FRANK D. CELEBREZZE, JR., J., CONCURS;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   EILEEN A. GALLAGHER, P.J., DISSENTS (WITH SEPARATE OPINION ATTACHED)\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-35\">\n   EILEEN A. GALLAGHER, P.J., DISSENTING:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 21} For the following reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion. Because I find that the state failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Durant is \"likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses,\" I would reverse the trial court's finding that he qualifies as a sexual predator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The psychiatric report prepared by Michael Caso identified four risk factors for recidivism applicable to Durant: (1) his victim was unrelated, (2) he had prior criminal offenses, (3) he had never married or been in a cohabitating relationship for more than two years and (4) he failed to complete sex offender treatment. I find the third factor to be inapplicable to Durant because he committed the present offense at the age of 19. To penalize him for not establishing a cohabitating relationship at the age of 17 is patently absurd. I find the fourth factor equally inapplicable. Although the record reflects that Durant failed to complete all potential sex offender treatment programs offered to him during his prison term, he did complete two separate programs in 1997 and 2013. In fact, the record from Durant's completed sex offender education program in 1997 reflects that he admitted to his offending behavior, appeared to have an improved understanding of the behavior and appeared to have increased victim empathy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Conversely, the factors applicable to Durant that were identified as mitigating against recidivism are numerous: (1) no prior sexual offenses, (2) no sexual preference for children, (3) no male children victims, (4) no deviant sexual preferences, (5) no substance abuse problems, (6) older than 35 years of age at the time of release and (7) does not present traits or behaviors associated with antisocial personality disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Furthermore, I find the majority's reliance upon Durant's Static-99 score to be misplaced. On the modernized Static-99R, which was updated to appropriately factor in an offender's age at the time of his release from prison, Durant scored a \"4,\" placing him into the category of \"low-moderate\" risk for re-offending. However, Durant's score included one point for failing to have established a two-year continuous, cohabitating relationship. As I addressed above, I find this factor inapplicable to an individual who, in order to avoid being penalized, would have had to begin a cohabitating relationship before he or she reached the age of majority. Removing this penalty from Durant's Static-99R would reduce his score to a \"3\" and place him into the \"low-moderate\" category for risk of re-offending. Caso testified\n   that an individual with a score of \"3\" on the Static-99R had a 6.6 percent chance of re-offending within five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 25} On these facts I cannot say that the trial court's conclusion that Durant qualifies as a sexual predator is supported by competent, credible evidence in the record. I would reverse.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
