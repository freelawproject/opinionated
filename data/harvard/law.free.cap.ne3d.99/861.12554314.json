At level three, a police officer is authorized to forcibly stop and detain an individual where the officer has reasonable suspicion that the particular individual was involved in a felony or misdemeanor (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 185,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=581%20N.Y.S.2d%20619\">\n    581 N.Y.S.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=590%20N.E.2d%20204\">\n    590 N.E.2d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Reasonableness, in turn, \"depends on a balance between the public interest and the individual's right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180104\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/106/#p109\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   [citation and internal quotation marks omitted] ). The \"familiar threshold standard\" employed in a Fourth Amendment analysis-probable cause-\"has roots that are deep in our history\"; its use \"reflects the benefit of extensive experience accommodating the factors relevant to the 'reasonableness' requirement of the Fourth Amendment,\" and provides the \"simplicity and clarity necessary to the implementation of a workable rule\" (\n   <em>\n    Dunaway v.

The difference between level one and level two, for instance, is a \"subtle\" one, often based on \"intangibles\" discernable \"only to the eyes of a trained police officer\"; the two levels are \"so close in meaning\" that \"courts have struggled\" to differentiate them, and their legal significance can \"become obscured\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 185, 188, 191,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=581%20N.Y.S.2d%20619\">\n    581 N.Y.S.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=590%20N.E.2d%20204\">\n    590 N.E.2d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). For example, a question regarding the ownership of a bag has been labelled a level-two inquiry (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 193,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=581%20N.Y.S.2d%20619\">\n    581 N.Y.S.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=590%20N.E.2d%20204\">\n    590 N.E.2d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Evidently, the\n   <em>\n    De Bour\n   </em>\n   sliding scale generates \"such confusion and uncertainty that neither police nor courts can ascertain with any degree of confidence precisely what it takes to meet any of these standards\" ( 4 LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.4 [e] ).\n   The \"hyper-stringent\" rule of\n   <em>\n    De Bour\n   </em>\n   also serves as a barrier to legitimate, effective, and minimally-intrusive law enforcement practices designed to detect and ward off threats at their earliest stages (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

In particular, the Fourth Amendment recognizes that \"a policeman who lacks the precise level of information necessary for probable cause to arrest\" is not required to \"simply shrug his shoulders and allow a crime to occur or a criminal to escape\" (\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

The stop occurred on a highway, and there was traffic that night. Initially, the Trooper noticed that the rear of defendant's vehicle was \"sagging excessively,\" indicating that a \"heavy object\" was in the back of the car or the trunk. After approaching the vehicle, the Trooper-who was alone-found three individuals in the vehicle: a male driver (defendant), a male passenger in the front seat, and a male passenger in the back seat. The Trooper also observed a number of large nylon bags piled on the back seat and floor of the car. He could not see \"every square inch\" of the bags, but the Trooper noticed that they had \"sharp edges protruding from the inner wall[s]\" as if \"some type of hard objects\" were inside. All of the occupants in the vehicle displayed an \"overly nervous\" demeanor, and the passengers were \"making a point not to make any eye contact.\" The Trooper asked defendant where he was going-a level-one request for information-and defendant responded that he had been visiting family in Ohio for a few days. The Trooper, who had 13\n   years of experience with the New York State Police and had made \"several hundred\" drug arrests, believed that \"some type of illegal activity\" was occurring-namely, that defendant was illegally transporting \"cash\" or \"some type of narcotics.\"\n   The Trooper's next question, which concerned the contents of the nylon bags, forms the basis of this appeal. The Appellate Division majority, reversing County Court, determined that \"the Trooper's initial inquiry concerning the contents of the bags constituted a level two common-law inquiry, which required a founded suspicion of criminality that was not present at the time\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

By contrast, the two dissenting Justices believed that \"the Trooper followed up with ... an additional appropriate level one question, i.e., whether defendant's luggage was in the bags, which were numerous, were in plain view, and looked unusual based upon the sharp edges protruding through the nylon fabric\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12293348\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/152/1222/#p1223\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12293348\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/152/1222/#p1223\">\n    at 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12293348\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/152/1222/#p1223\">\n    59 N.Y.S.3d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [Winslow and Scudder, JJ., dissenting] ).

The Trooper's questioning was neither \"extended\" nor \"accusatory\" (\n   <em>\n    Hollman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4424157\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/79/181/#p184\">\n    79 N.Y.2d at 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=581%20N.Y.S.2d%20619\">\n    581 N.Y.S.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=590%20N.E.2d%20204\">\n    590 N.E.2d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); rather, the inquiry at issue was one of the Trooper's preliminary questions and was directly related to his observations-the bags were in plain view. Even if \"unsettling,\" the inquiry was \"nonthreatening\" and \"lacking in harassment or intimidation\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 189, 191, 192,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=581%20N.Y.S.2d%20619\">\n    581 N.Y.S.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=590%20N.E.2d%20204\">\n    590 N.E.2d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In addition, the Trooper's observations of the vehicle, its occupants, and its contents generated ample suspicion, and the Trooper's extensive experience related to illegal contraband allowed him to appreciate the circumstances in a manner that may have been \"evident only to the eyes of a trained police officer\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 191,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=581%20N.Y.S.2d%20619\">\n    581 N.Y.S.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=590%20N.E.2d%20204\">\n    590 N.E.2d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); defendant was behaving nervously and \"carrying something\" that, viewed\n   through the Trooper's eyes, appeared \"unusual\"-a large number of sharp-edged bags in the sagging rear of the vehicle. Even under our established\n   <em>\n    De Bour\n   </em>\n   standard, the Trooper \"can ask about\" that (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=590%20N.E.2d%20204\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4370602\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/47/911/#p912\">\n    47 N.Y.2d at 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=419%20N.Y.S.2d%20495\">\n    419 N.Y.S.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=393%20N.E.2d%20489\">\n    393 N.E.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   More fundamentally, I disagree with the Appellate Division's failure to account for the inherent differences between traffic stops and street encounters. When the Trooper stopped defendant's vehicle, he was alone, on a dark road, unaware of who or what he would find in the car; as in most traffic stops, he was \"particularly vulnerable\" (\n   <em>\n    Long,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203160\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/1032/#p1047\">\n    463 U.S. at 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203160\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/1032/#p1047\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Upon approaching the vehicle on the side of the highway, with traffic\n   passing by, the Trooper found three male\n   occupants, including one passenger seated next to the large nylon bags. Standing by the driver's side window, the Trooper could observe some but not all of the occupants' movements and surroundings. Under those circumstances, the Trooper's inquiry into the contents of the bags was a prudent \"precautionary measure to afford [him] a degree of protection\" (\n   <em>\n    Mimms,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180104\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/106/#p109\">\n    434 U.S. at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180104\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/434/106/#p109\">\n    98 S.Ct. 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).
