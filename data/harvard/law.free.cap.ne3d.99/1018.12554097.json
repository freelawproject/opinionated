The \"Heather Glen Subdivision Declaration of Covenants, Easements, Restrictions, and Assessment Lien\" [\"Declaration\"] was filed on August 30, 1996, and applied to Lots 1 through 22. Two months later, an amendment was recorded which changed the name from \"Heather Glen Homeowners' Association\" to \"Heather Lake Association.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 25, 1997, a second amendment to the Declaration was recorded which added Lots 23 through 58 to the property subject to the Declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On June 27, 2001, appellants took title to Lot 37 located at 1967 Glenhurst Drive, Lancaster, Ohio. At that time, Article I, Section 2(e) of the Declaration stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Vehicle. The Board may promulgate regulations restricting the parking of automobiles, inoperable vehicles, trucks, boats, and recreational vehicles on the Lots and Common Areas and, to the extent not prohibited by law, the streets within the subdivision, and may enforce such regulations or restrictions by levying fines or enforcement charges, having such vehicles towed away, or taking other such actions as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellee asserted in the trial court that pursuant to the Declaration, the Association adopted a Design Review Manual for Single Family Residential Development on May 12, 2001 (\"Design Review Manual\"), regulating parking of \"Vehicles, Trailers, Boats, Commercial Vehicles and Motor Homes.\" The Design Review Manual states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   No commercial vehicle may be parked, stored, or temporarily kept on any Lot or Reserve, except when there temporarily to service existing improvements or to be used in connection with the construction of improvements in Heather Lake. * * * *. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Trustees shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to determine whether or not a particular vehicle type, or any particular vehicle is authorized. * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The Design Review Manual was not recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The Bylaws of Heather Lake Association (\"Bylaws\") were first recorded on March 30, 2015. The recorded Bylaws are silent on any parking restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} From October 2013 through January 2014 appellee sent letters to appellants complaining about parking of vehicles at appellants' residence. Appellants admit their vehicle is a commercial vehicle which is parked on their lot outside the garage multiple days each week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellee filed suit on December 23, 2015 seeking injunctive relief against appellants for alleged violations of the Association's parking restrictions. Appellee also sought reasonable costs and attorney fees. Appellants answered on January 27, 2016 and filed an amended answer on February 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Pursuant to an Entry filed June 2, 2017, the trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment and denied appellants' motion for summary judgment. On June 28, 2017, the trial court entered a consent judgment entry awarding reasonable attorney fees and costs against appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellants now appeal from the trial court's judgment entries of June 2 and June 28, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellants raise one assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"THE DEFENDANTS/APPELLANTS, DAVID AND KIMBERLEE BILLITER (\"BILLITERS\"), FOR THEIR ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR, STATE THAT THE ENTRY OF JUNE 2, 2017 (\"ENTRY\") WHICH WAS MADE INTO A FINAL APPEALABLE ORDER THROUGH THE CONSENT ENTRY OF JUNE 28, 2017 IS ERRONEOUS IN THE FOLLOWING RESPECTS: A) THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING HEATHER LAKE ASSOCIATION'S (\"ASSOCIATION\") MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 18} We refer to Civ.R. 56(C) in reviewing a motion for summary judgment which provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   * * * *. Summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. * * * *. A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from such evidence or stipulation and only from the evidence or stipulation, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, such party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in the party's favor. * * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The moving party bears the initial responsibility of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, and identifying those portions of the record before the trial court, which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact on a material element of the nonmoving party's claim.\n   <em>\n    Dresher v.

While\n   <em>\n    Gottlieb\n   </em>\n   does not involve a homeowners' association, the case in analogous in that the condominium association had a declaration and bylaws applicable to all condominium owners which allowed the association to promulgate additional rules and regulations. In that case, Gottlieb argued that even if the association had the power to promulgate the rules, those rules did not apply to him because he was not on notice of them. The Court found, however, that Gottlieb had constructive notice of the rules when he purchased the property because when an association records its declaration,\n   it becomes public record and a purchaser is deemed to have constructive notice of its contents.
