Jaros, Jr., challenges the denial of injunctive and declaratory relief under counts IV and V of his amended complaint against defendants, the Village of Downers Grove (Village); Susan Farley; League of Women Voters of Downers Grove, Woodridge, and Lisle; and certain Village officials. The underlying substantive question is whether the Village council had authority to remove plaintiff from the board of trustees for the Downers Grove public library prior to the expiration of his six-year term. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 The following facts are undisputed. The Village is a home-rule unit under article VII, section 6(a), of the Illinois Constitution ( Ill. Const. 1970, art. VII, \u00a7 6 (a) ). The Village has a commission form of government consisting of an elected mayor and an elected council. See Downers Grove Municipal Code \u00a7 2.10 (amended May 3, 2011). The Village also has appointed offices, including manager, clerk, treasurer, and attorney. See generally Downers Grove Municipal Code, ch. 2 (amended Dec. 15, 2015) (\"Administration\"). Also part of the Village's government are various commissions and boards, one of which is the library board of trustees (Village library board). See Downers Grove Municipal Code \u00a7 2.53 (amended Oct. 21, 2014). The Village library board oversees the Downers Grove public library (Village library), which was established pursuant to the Illinois Local Library Act (Library Act) ( 75 ILCS 5/1-0.1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (West 2016) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 In August 2015, plaintiff was appointed to the Village library board for a six-year term by the Village council pursuant to its appointment power under section 4-2 of the Library Act ( 75 ILCS 5/4-2 (West 2016) ) and section 2.53(a) of the Village code (Downers Grove Municipal Code \u00a7 2.53(a) (amended Oct. 21, 2014) ). Complementing the appointment power in section 2.53(a) of the Village code is section 2.53.1(d), which permits the Village council \"to remove any member of a board or commission where such member is appointed by the Village council\" (Downers Grove Municipal Code \u00a7 2.53.1(d) (amended June 5, 2007) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 On September 5, 2017, plaintiff filed a seven-count complaint against defendants. Plaintiff also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. Plaintiff sought to bar the Village council from voting-as it planned that evening-on a resolution to remove plaintiff from the Village library board. Following a hearing, the trial court denied the request for injunctive relief as premature. That evening, the Village council adopted Resolution No. 2017-66, removing plaintiff from the Village library board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 The next day, September 6, 2017, plaintiff filed his seven-count amended complaint. The only counts at issue in this appeal are counts IV and V. Count IV sought a declaratory judgment that the removal authorization in section 2.53.1(d) of the Village code exceeded the Village's home-rule powers. Count V sought an injunction\n   barring plaintiff's removal from the Village library board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 Plaintiff also filed an amended motion for a preliminary injunction. Plaintiff made two main arguments. First, he contended that the Village library is a unit of government separate from the Village. Consequently, removal of a Village library board trustee by the Village (through its council) is not a \"power [or] * * * function pertaining to\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   [ (the Village's) ] government and affairs\" (emphasis added) ( Ill. Const. 1970, art. VII, \u00a7 6 (a) ) and so does not fall within the Village's home-rule powers. Second, since a home-rule unit requires an authorizing referendum in order to \"alter or repeal a form of government provided by law\" ( Ill. Const. 1970, art. VII, \u00a7 6 (f) ), and since the truncation of a library trustee's statutory six-year term (see 75 ILCS 5/4-2 (West 2016) ) is such an alteration or repeal, the Village was required to pass such a referendum, which it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 At the hearing on the motion, plaintiff added a third contention, based on section 2.53.1(b) of the Village code and section 4-4 of the Library Act, entitled \"Vacancies\" ( 75 ILCS 5/4-4 (West 2016) ). Section 2.53.1(b) states that, \"[w]here removal from a board or commission is governed by statute, such statute shall control.\" Downers Grove Municipal Code \u00a7 2.53.1(b) (amended June 5, 2007). Plaintiff construed section 4-4 as a statute governing removal, and he argued that his removal contravened the section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9 In its oral ruling on the motion for injunctive relief, the trial court applied the three-part test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Schillerstrom Homes, Inc. v. City of Naperville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"29946\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/198/281/#p289\">\n    198 Ill. 2d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 289-90,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=260%20Ill.%20Dec.%20835\">\n    260 Ill.Dec. 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=762%20N.E.2d%20494\">\n    762 N.E.2d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), for judging whether a home-rule unit has acted within the scope of its constitutional powers. (The supreme court has since reduced the test to two parts. See\n   <em>\n    Palm v. 2800 Lake Shore Drive Condominium Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20IL%20110505\">\n    2013 IL 110505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 36,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=370%20Ill.%20Dec.%20299\">\n    370 Ill.Dec. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=988%20N.E.2d%2075\">\n    988 N.E.2d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Denying the motion, the court reasoned that (1) \"the removal of library trustees * * * relates to the government and affairs of [the Village]\"; (2) the Library Act is \"silent * * * concerning removal of library trustees\"; and (3) the \"General Assembly [has] not preempted use of the home rule powers in this area.\" The court further determined that the Village library is not a separate unit of government, given that the Village council appoints library trustees ( 75 ILCS 5/4-2 (West 2016) ) and collects the tax for the library ( 75 ILCS 5/3-5 (West 2016) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 10 Although the court did not expressly address plaintiff's argument based on section 4-4 of the Library Act, the court remarked that section 4-4 was not a \"removal statute.\" Finding no likelihood of success on the merits, the court denied plaintiff's request for injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11 The court then\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   addressed count IV (declaratory judgment) of the amended complaint. The court noted that its denial of injunctive relief was tantamount to a judgment declaring that section 2.53.1(d) of the Village code, authorizing the Village council to remove members of the library board, was within the Village's home-rule powers. The court found, relative to the declaratory judgment, that there was no just reason for delaying enforcement or appeal. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 304(a) (eff. Mar. 8, 2016) (allowing appeal of \"a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the parties or claims * * * if the trial court has made an express written finding that there is no just reason for delaying either enforcement or appeal or both\"). The denial of injunctive relief under count V was immediately appealable as of right, without a special finding. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 307(a) (eff. July 1,\n   2017) (appeal of \"an interlocutory order * * * granting, modifying, refusing, dissolving, or refusing to dissolve or modify an injunction\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 12 Plaintiff appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 13 II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 14 Plaintiff challenges the trial court's denial of his request for a preliminary injunction and the court's associated declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 15 The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a determination on the merits of the case.\n   <em>\n    City of Kankakee v. Department of Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20IL%20App%20%283d%29%20120599\">\n    2013 IL App (3d) 120599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=370%20Ill.%20Dec.%20525\">\n    370 Ill.Dec. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=988%20N.E.2d%20723\">\n    988 N.E.2d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A party seeking a preliminary injunction has the burden to establish the following elements: (1) he has a clearly ascertainable right in need of protection; (2) he will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction does not issue; (3) he has no adequate remedy at law; and (4) there is a likelihood of success on the merits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=988%20N.E.2d%20723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the trial court did not hear evidence or make findings of fact on the motion for a preliminary injunction, but based its ruling purely on its interpretation of ordinances and statutes, our review is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .

We set aside for the moment his argument that the Village exceeded its constitutional home-rule powers in removing plaintiff from the library board, and we address first his argument that the removal was invalid on the independent ground that it \"violated the terms of [the Village's] own ordinance,\" specifically section 2.53.1 of the Village code. Section 2.53.1 states in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"\n   <strong>\n    Section 2.53.1. Removal of members to boards and commissions.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (a) Members of any board or commission serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority and may be removed as provided in this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Where removal from a board or commission is governed by statute, such statute shall control.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (c) The Mayor shall have the authority to remove any member of a board or commission where such member is appointed by the Mayor, or appointed jointly by the Mayor and Village Manager.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (d) The Village Council, by a vote of not less than four (4) members, shall have the authority to remove any member of a board or commission where such member is appointed by the Village Council; appointed by the Mayor with concurrence of the Village Council, or appointed by the Village Manager with the concurrence of the Village Council.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (e) The Village Manager shall have the authority to remove any member of a board or commission where such member is appointed by the Village Manager.\" (Emphasis added.) Downers Grove Municipal Code \u00a7 2.53.1 (amended June 5, 2007).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Citing subsection (b), plaintiff suggests that the removal of library board trustees is indeed \"governed by statute,\" namely section 4-4 of the Library Act. Before setting forth section 4-4, we briefly explain how public libraries and their governing boards are established under the Library Act. The Library Act provides a process by which a city, village, or unincorporated town or township can form a public library.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   See 75 ILCS 5/1-2, 2-1, 2-2 (West 2016). A city may establish a public library simply by action of the corporate authorities. 75 ILCS 5/2-1 (West 2016). In villages and unincorporated towns or townships, a library may be established only by election. 75 ILCS 5/2-2 (West 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 17 Article 4 of the Library Act ( 75 ILCS 5/4-1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (West 2016) ) prescribes the establishment of library boards of trustees and the selection of members. Section 4-1 ( 75 ILCS 5/4-1 (West 2016) ) states that, once the corporate authorities in a city establish a library, \"the mayor shall, with the approval of the city council,\" appoint a board of trustees. In an unincorporated town or township, or in a village not under the commission form of government, trustees are elected. 75 ILCS 5/4-3, 4-3.1 (West 2016). In a village under the commission form of government, such as the Village,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"the village council at its first regular meeting following the election establishing a public library, shall appoint a board of library trustees of 6 members who are village residents, 2 to hold until the first regular meeting of the next succeeding fiscal year, 2 to hold for one year thereafter and 2 to hold for 2 years thereafter. The respective successors of the initial appointees shall be appointed for 6 year terms and shall serve until their successors are appointed and qualified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Any board may provide by resolution that the term of its trustees shall be 4 years. If the board adopts such a resolution, then at the time the next appointments are made, one trustee shall be appointed for a 2 year term.\" 75 ILCS 5/4-2 (West 2016).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 18 The only provision in article 4, or elsewhere in the Library Act, that refers to the removal of trustees is section 4-1.1 ( 75 ILCS 5/4-1.1 (West 2016) ). That section is entitled \"Term of office; removal,\" and its subsection (b) provides that, in a city, \"[t]he mayor may remove any trustee in the manner provided in Section 3.1-35-10 of the Illinois Municipal Code [ (Municipal Code) ( 65 ILCS 5/3.1-35-10 (West 2016) ) ].\" 75 ILCS 5/4-1.1(b) (West 2016). Section 3.1-35-10 of the Municipal Code specifies procedures for a mayor or president to \"remove any officer appointed by the mayor or president under this Code.\" 65 ILCS 5/3.1-35-10 (West 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 19 We return to section 4-4 of the Library Act, the provision on which plaintiff relies. Section 4-4 specifies when a vacancy is to be declared in a library board of trustees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Vacancies shall be declared in the office of trustee by the board when the elected or appointed trustee declines or is unable to serve, or is absent without cause from all regular board meetings for a period of one year, or is convicted of a misdemeanor for failing, neglecting, or refusing to discharge any duty imposed upon a trustee by this Act, or becomes a nonresident of the city, village, incorporated town, or township, or who fails to pay the library taxes levied by the corporate authorities. Vacancies shall also be declared in the office of trustee by the board when, at the election of the first board of library trustees or at any subsequent election, there are not sufficient trustees elected to fill an entire board of 7 trustees.\" 75 ILCS 5/4-4 (West 2016).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Section 4-4 proceeds to give directions for the filling of vacancies, depending on the unit of government involved. In a city or a village under the commission form of government, like the village, a vacancy \"shall be reported to the mayor or president and be filled in like manner as original appointments\" ( 75 ILCS 5/4-4 (West 2016) ), which, in the case of the Village, would be\n   appointment by the Village council ( 75 ILCS 5/4-2 (West 2016) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 20 Plaintiff suggests that section 4-4 governs the \"removal\" of library trustees, such that, by operation of section 2.53.1(b), the Village's authority to remove library trustees is limited to the situations specified in section 4-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 21 The goal in interpreting a statute or ordinance is to ascertain the intent of the legislative body.\n   <em>\n    Henderson Square Condominium Ass'n v.

The best indicator of that intent is the language used, which must be given its plain and ordinary meaning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20N.E.3d%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 22 Section 2.53.1(a) of the Village code states that the \"[m]embers of any board or commission serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority and may be removed as provided in this section.\" Downers Grove Municipal Code \u00a7 2.53.1(b) (amended June 6, 2007). Section 2.53.1(d) provides that, by a vote of at least four members, the Village council may remove any board member or commissioner that the council appointed. Removal is left to the discretion of the Village council-subject to subsection (b), which states that \"[w]here removal from a board or commission is governed by statute, such statute shall control.\" Downers Grove Municipal Code \u00a7 2.53.1(b) (amended June 6, 2007). Plaintiff views section 4-4 of the Library Act as just such a constraint on the Village council's discretion to remove board members or commissioners. Plaintiff is mistaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 23 Section 4-4 specifies situations in which a vacancy in a library board of trustees arises by operation of law; when those circumstances arise, a vacancy must be declared. Plaintiff would have us read an implied limitation into section 4-4. There is at best an implied limitation on when vacancies\n   <em>\n    must be\n   </em>\n   declared. Section 4-4 does not speak at all to discretionary removal or to the creation of vacancies in situations other than those listed. From elsewhere in article 4, we can infer that the legislature was intentionally silent in section 4-4 as to the matter of discretionary removal. For instance, section 4-1.1(b) authorizes the mayor of a city to remove a library trustee. If this provision is not superfluous, as we must presume (\n   <em>\n    Moore v. Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3597890\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/219/470/#p488\">\n    219 Ill. 2d 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=302%20Ill.%20Dec.%20451\">\n    302 Ill.Dec. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=848%20N.E.2d%201015\">\n    848 N.E.2d 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) ), then the power of removal in section 4-1.1(b) extends beyond the scenarios listed in section 4-4. Also in operation here is the canon that, \"when the legislature uses certain language in one part of a statute and different language in another, [the] court will presume that different results were intended.\"\n   <em>\n    Caveney v. Bower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"974980\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/207/82/#p90\">\n    207 Ill. 2d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=278%20Ill.%20Dec.%201\">\n    278 Ill.Dec. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=797%20N.E.2d%20596\">\n    797 N.E.2d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). Sections 4-1.1(b) and 4-4 together establish that the legislature intended in section 4-4 to specify certain vacancies arising\n   <em>\n    ipso jure\n   </em>\n   and not to address the matter of discretionary removal. Since section 4-4 is not properly construed as a limitation on the discretionary removal of library trustees, it does not limit such removal as authorized by section 2.53.1(d) of the Village code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 24 We turn to plaintiff's argument that the removal authorization provided by section 2.53.1(d) of the Village code exceeds the Village's home-rule powers as applied to library trustees. Article VII, section 6(a), of the Illinois Constitution provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"Except as limited by this Section, a home rule unit may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs including, but not limited to, the power to regulate for the protection of the public health, safety, morals and welfare; to license; to tax,\n   and to incur debt.\" Ill. Const. 1970, art. VII, \u00a7 6 (a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Home-rule authority is limited not only by the internal conditions in section 6 (a) (the power or function must pertain to the government and affairs of the home-rule unit) but also by external limitations appearing elsewhere in section 6 (\"Except as limited by this Section\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) ). We address first plaintiff's claim that section 2.53.1(d) exceeds the limitations expressed in section 6 (f) ( Ill. Const. 1970, art. VII, \u00a7 6 (f) ). Section 6 (f) states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"A home rule unit shall have the power subject to approval by referendum to adopt, alter or repeal a form of government provided by law * * *. A home rule municipality shall have the power to provide for its officers, their manner of selection and terms of office only as approved by referendum or as otherwise provided by law.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 25 There is no dispute that the Village passed no referendum to permit the removal of library board trustees. In our view, none was required. Neither limitation in section 6 (f) applies here. \"Form of government\" as referenced in the first limitation \"involves the election of municipal governing boards and the relationship between the legislative and executive branches of government.\"\n   <em>\n    Peters v.

The starting point for the court in\n   <em>\n    Gill II\n   </em>\n   was that Rockford had general home-rule authority over the Rockford library; the issue was whether the legislature had expressly curtailed that authority. The Rockford library and the Village library were created under the same statute; hence we are compelled by\n   <em>\n    Gill II\n   </em>\n   to start from the premise that the Village has home-rule authority over the Village library. As noted, plaintiff does not dispute that control over a local library board is a function pertaining to local government and affairs, even if the State has its own potential interest in the subject. The remaining question is whether the legislature has preempted home-rule authority in that area. Plaintiff makes no attempt to show preemption, and we note that the Library Act manifests no express intention to limit the home-rule authority of a municipality over a local library created within its boundaries. We recognize that the Library Act contains no provision for discretionary removal of trustees except in cities ( 75 ILCS 5/4-1.1 (West 2016) ), but mere implication by the legislature is not sufficient to limit home-rule powers.
