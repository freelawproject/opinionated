He raises two assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. Appellant's convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. Appellant was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Finding no merit to his appeal, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted Patterson for one count of gross sexual imposition, with a sexually violent predator specification, and one count of kidnapping, with a sexual motivation specification and a sexually violent predator specification. Police arrested Patterson on May 26, 2016, following a report that he molested an eight-year-old child, D.D., while babysitting him on April 16, 2016. Patterson pleaded not guilty to both counts and elected for a bench trial, where the following evidence was presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On May 25, 2016, D.N. was babysitting B.T.'s and Z.T.'s children at B.T.'s house. D.N. testified that, as he was cooking dinner, he overheard D.D., one of B.T.'s children, discussing sexually explicit things with another child. Alarmed, D.N. demanded to know what D.D. was talking about. D.D. told D.N. that Patterson had touched his private parts while babysitting D.D., C.J., and a number of other children at B.T.'s house on April 16, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} D.N. testified that he immediately tried calling D.D.'s grandmother, C.T., who actually showed up at the house a few moments later. After D.N. told C.T. what D.D. said, C.T. testified that she spoke to D.D., who repeated the story he told to D.N. Becoming extremely upset, C.T. walked over to Patterson's mother's house, where Patterson was staying. After having her knocks go unanswered, C.T. testified that she called B.T. and Z.T., telling them to come to B.T.'s house immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} C.T. testified that while she and D.N. waited for B.T. and Z.T. to arrive, she called and spoke to M.S., her cousin, on the phone asking her to come to the house. Around the same time, B.T.'s cousin, M.J., happened to stop by the house, during which time she also spoke to D.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   and learned about the allegations against Patterson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Once B.T. and Z.T. arrived and learned what was going on, Z.T. spoke to D.D. and became enraged. Z.T. and C.T. testified that the adults discussed whether to call the police or go get Patterson themselves. C.T. testified that amidst this discussion, she independently decided to call the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} C.T. testified that the first police department she was able to successfully contact was the Cleveland Metropolitan Housing Authority (\"CMHA\"). Dispatched to the scene for a report of unattended children, CMHA Officer Dustin Kubiak testified that he arrived to discover that the report actually concerned a sexual offense against a child. Following protocol, Officer Kubiak alerted the Cleveland Police Department (\"CPD\"), which handles sexual offenses. While waiting for the CPD to arrive, Officer Kubiak testified that he spoke with C.T. and one of the aunts on scene and, based on those conversations, went across the street to Patterson's mother's house and requested that Patterson come outside. While Officer Kubiak detained Patterson and escorted him to his patrol car, C.T. testified that Patterson looked at her and said, \"I told them to tell those kids to leave me alone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Eventually, CPD arrived on the scene, took statements from most of the adults present, and placed Patterson under arrest. CPD was unable to take an initial statement from D.D., who was sleeping at the time. CPD subsequently transferred Patterson to jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Over the next two days, police interviewed Patterson twice, thoroughly questioning him about his involvement with B.T., Z.T., and their children and the allegations against him. At the beginning of both interviews, Patterson signed a form waiving his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and spoke freely to detectives during most of the two interviews. At some point during the second interview, Patterson expressed that he wanted to speak to an attorney. Despite Patterson's request, the detectives continued to ask Patterson questions, which he continued to answer. Patterson's trial counsel did not file a motion to suppress any statements made during either interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Prior to trial, the trial court held a competency hearing for both D.D. and C.J., who were allegedly in the room when Patterson touched D.D. and is the daughter of M.J. The court found both children to be competent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} At trial, the state called D.N., C.T., M.S., and Z.T., who all recounted fairly consistent versions of the events described above. Specifically, they all testified that when they individually spoke to D.D., his accounts to each of them were consistent. The state also called D.D. to testify. D.D. testified that on April 16, 2016, he was watching a movie with his cousins at B.T.'s house when Patterson entered the room naked. According to D.D., Patterson removed D.D.'s shirt and shorts and then squeezed his private parts. D.D. also testified that later that evening, he awoke to find Patterson threatening him with an extension cord and telling him not to tell anyone what happened. The state additionally called Officer Kubiak from CMHA, Officer Hess from CPD, and Detective Vowell from CPD's Sex Crimes and Child Abuse Unit. Those witnesses corroborated the events on May 25-26, 2016, and Detective Vowell discussed his interviews with Patterson subsequent to his arrest. Patterson's trial counsel thoroughly cross-examined the state's witnesses, but did not call any witnesses on behalf of Patterson. C.J. was not called to testify by either the state or Patterson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The trial court found Patterson guilty on both counts in the indictment and\n   sentenced him to 20 years to life in prison, ordered him to pay the costs and expenses of the case, and found him to be a Tier III sex offender/child offender registrant. It is from this judgment that Patterson now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In his first assignment of error, Patterson argues that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Unlike sufficiency of the evidence, a challenge to the manifest weight of the evidence attacks the credibility of the evidence presented.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because it is a broader review, a reviewing court may determine that a judgment of a trial court is sustained by sufficient evidence, but nevertheless conclude that the judgment is against the weight of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20N.E.2d%20541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that case, the appellant argued that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence because \"the victim, the sole eyewitness to the events, gave conflicting information to police officers at the time of the incident.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. Even though the victim's testimony contained a number of inconsistencies from his earlier statements-such as when the appellant pulled the gun, whether or not the victim had a gun on his person, and where the victim obtained a gun-we found those inconsistencies to be \"minor and understandable in light of the fact that [the victim] had just been robbed at gunpoint and shot three times.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Likewise, the court in\n   <em>\n    Malone\n   </em>\n   rejected a manifest weight of the evidence claim based on inconsistencies in the victim's testimony.\n   <em>\n    State v. Malone\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. Franklin No. 98AP-278, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 5647, *9 (Dec. 1, 1998). In that case, the appellant cited to the eight-year-old victim's conflicting answers when responding to questions about whether her pants were on or off when the defendant touched her private parts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. Despite those conflicting answers, the court affirmed the appellant's conviction for gross sexual imposition, noting that \"the alleged inconsistencies fail to cast such doubt on the victim's testimony as to render the verdict against the manifest weight of the evidence, especially because [the victim's] statements generally, though not completely, were consistent regarding the act of sexual contact with defendant's penis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Similar to\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Malone\n   </em>\n   , Patterson fails to show any meaningful inconsistencies establishing that his convictions are the exceptional case for which a reversal under a manifest weight of the evidence claim exists. D.D.'s statements concerning the events on April 16, 2016, were largely consistent. The only arguable inconsistency that Patterson and his counsel continuously stressed at trial-D.D.'s failure to mention Patterson's threatening of him with the extension cord after the assault-was more akin to a detail innocently omitted rather than an inconsistent statement. In fact, during his testimony, Detective Vowell testified that child victims typically omit details in their first interviews with family members and police officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The record indicates that Patterson agreed with his trial counsel's decision. Further, contrary to Patterson's assertions, the state's disclosure did not indicate that C.J. would have \"testified that nothing unusual occurred on April 16, 2016[,]\" but instead that she did not \"see anything happen with defendant\" and D.D. In other words, C.J.'s testimony was not definitive evidence of Patterson's innocence, and Patterson does not specifically identify any other record-based evidence to support his argument that he would have been acquitted had C.J. testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Even if Patterson sufficiently argued that C.J.'s testimony would have affected the outcome of the case-which he has not, whether this argument is meritorious is not for us to decide on direct appeal. Because Patterson failed to make an offer of proof concerning C.J.'s unheard testimony, the record does not contain any indication of what C.J. would have testified to. As such, his ineffectiveness argument concerning C.J. relies on evidence that is\n   outside the record, and Patterson should pursue his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel through a petition for postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Patterson's second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   EILEEN T.
