BOYLE, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, Nikolaos Tsirikos-Karapanos, (\"appellant\") appeals from a judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment to defendants-appellees, Ford Motor Company (\"Ford\") and Valley Ford Truck, Inc. (\"VFT\"). In his sole assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the appellees was in error because there exists genuine issues of material facts and, thus, the trial court could not grant summary judgment as a matter of law. Finding no merit to appellant's appeal, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant leased a new 2014 Ford Explorer from VFT on September 28, 2013. Almost two years later, on July 14, 2015, appellant brought the vehicle to VFT to fix a cowl leak near the windshield that allowed water to seep into the vehicle. According to its invoice, VFT replaced and\n   tested the cowl seal, removed and replaced the floor mats and carpets, and cleaned and removed mold from the wire harnesses under the dashboard. After VFT completed those repairs, appellant left in the vehicle. Because those repairs were covered by warranty, VFT did not charge appellant for those services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} According to appellant, the vehicle continued to smell of mold and mildew despite those repairs. Appellant, however, did not return the vehicle to VFT to address the issue. Instead, on September 15, 2015, appellant contacted Ford, informed it that the vehicle still smelled of mold and mildew, and requested that it replace the vehicle. Ford denied appellant's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} As a result, on November 21, 2015, appellant filed a complaint in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas against VFT and Ford. Appellant's complaint contained six causes of action, including a violation of Ohio's Products Liability Act, breaches of warranty, violations of the Consumer Sales Practices Act, and an award for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Both VFT and Ford subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing that appellant failed to establish the requisite elements for his claims. The trial court granted the appellees' motions for summary judgment. It is from this judgment that appellant appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In his sole assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in awarding the appellees summary judgment for all six causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} An appellate court reviews a trial court's decision to grant summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Appellant did not depose an official or employee of Ford or VFT, and he did not set forth any documents or statements by Ford certifying an agency relationship.

The trial court awarded the manufacturer summary judgment. On appeal, the court found that the appellants failed to present sufficient evidence that the manufacturer actually made false representations. As a result, the court affirmed the trial court's granting of summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Temple\n   </em>\n   at 267-268.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Here, as already discussed above, appellant sets forth no proof-besides his uncorroborated, self-serving statements and references to an expert report stricken from the record and photographs improperly submitted in support of his motion in opposition to summary judgment-that VFT's representations that the vehicle was mold free were false or not in accord with the facts. In other words, even if VFT actually made the representations that appellant alleges in his appellate brief, appellant has failed to show that those representations were actually untrue-he has not sufficiently shown that mold actually existed in the vehicle after VFT serviced and returned the vehicle and represented that it was free of mold. As we stated before, while a self-serving affidavit may serve as competent evidence to overcome summary judgment, the affidavit must be made on personal knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Telecom Acquisition Corp.

For the same reasons set forth above, we find that the appellees did not breach a warranty because, again, appellant has failed to prove the existence of a defect. Appellant has not sufficiently proven a deceptive practice or false representation made by either appellee, which is required to sustain a claim under the Consumer Sales Practices Act. Therefore, the trial court's grant of summary judgment was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

In response, Ford and VFT argue that appellant failed to present evidence of actual malice to support his punitive damages claim. Based on our foregoing analysis and conclusion that summary judgment for appellant's underlying claims was proper, however, we find it unnecessary to determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists as to the question of actual malice and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 43} R.C. 2315.21, captioned \"Punitive or exemplary damages,\" states that \"punitive or exemplary damages are not recoverable from a defendant in question in a tort action unless * * * [t]he actions or omissions of that defendant demonstrate malice[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calmes v.
