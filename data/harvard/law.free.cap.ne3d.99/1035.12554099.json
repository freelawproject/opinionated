The principal witness for the prosecution was Buffie Patterson, the other occupant of the office space, who had installed the security camera in question. Patterson testified that she was the primary tenant for the office space, which included a common area and two individual offices. Appellant sublet one of the individual offices from her. Because a personal relationship between the two of them had ended badly some time before, there was some ongoing tension between Patterson and appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Patterson testified that she considered the reception area to be common space to which both would have access but that she had no right to access appellant's private office nor he to access hers. On June 22, 2016, Patterson had a security company install a surveillance camera in her private office and another in the common\n   area. She stated she did so because appellant had accused her of infringing on his office space and possessions, and Patterson wanted to be able to refute any future allegations of this sort. In connection with this testimony, the prosecution presented as an exhibit an invoice from Lincoln Technology, which installed the camera equipment at a total price of $586.35, including $300 for the two cameras.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On June 24, 2016, two days after installing the security cameras, Patterson noted that some filing cabinets in the common area had been moved and replaced with a couch owned by appellant. A note on the couch said \"I dare anyone to touch my stuff again.\" (Tr. at 101.) On this occasion, Patterson also noticed that the camera in the common area had been blinded by turning it toward the wall. Patterson turned the camera back to cover the common office and commenced to take pictures of the situation. As she did so, appellant came out of his office, brushed past her, stepped up on his couch, and pulled the security camera from the ceiling. He threw it to the floor in her private office, where it shattered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} After the situation calmed down, Patterson called Lincoln Technology, which was unable to reinstall the camera because of damage to the wires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Jenifer Rutherford testified for the prosecution as an eyewitness to the confrontation. She was friendly with Patterson and also knew appellant, who had introduced them. Rutherford and her nephew were helping Patterson move some boxes on the day in question. Rutherford confirmed that initially the camera was pointed toward the wall, and Patterson attempted to move it. Appellant then came out of his office, yanked the camera from the wall, and threw it on the floor where it broke into pieces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Officer Kevin Smith of the Columbus Division of Police testified that on June 24, 2016, he was on routine patrol and responded to a reported disturbance at 750 East Long Street in Columbus. He intervened in a dispute between a landlord, whom he identified as Patterson, and her tenant, whom he identified as appellant. When Smith spoke with appellant at the scene, appellant stated that he had taken the camera out of the ceiling and put it on a desk without breaking it. Smith did observe the camera lying on the floor in pieces at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant testified in his own defense. He confirmed that the office consisted of two private offices and a common area. He felt that Patterson had no right under the lease to install a camera in the common area. As an exhibit, appellant introduced a copy of the lease between himself and Patterson's company, providing for quiet enjoyment of the premises by the tenant without encumbrance or hindrance from the landlord. Appellant testified that he reoriented the camera against the wall to preserve the security and confidentiality of his own office and deemed it an invasion of his right of privacy as a tenant when she again pointed it at his office door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On cross-examination, appellant admitted that the lease did not expressly prohibit Patterson from installing the camera in the common area. He also admitted that the lease did not give him the right to tamper with or disturb Patterson's property or remove the camera. He admitted to moving the camera so that it faced toward the wall. He stated that after removing the camera from its mounting without causing any breakage, he attempted to hand it to Patterson, who backed up and would not take it. Because appellant was not allowed in Patterson's office, he tossed the camera into her office and walked back into his own. When he did so, the camera came\n   apart in two pieces. When a technician came to reinstall the camera, appellant told him not to do so, and appellant stated that if the technician had reinstalled the camera, appellant would have again removed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The state submitted as an exhibit video recordings from the two cameras, including the one in the common area and the one in Patterson's office. The video from the camera in the common area shows Patterson adjusting the camera so that it scans the common area, rather than facing the wall. Appellant is seen walking by Patterson toward the camera. When he reaches the camera, it ceases recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The video from the camera in Patterson's private office shows Rutherford and her nephew sitting inside the office with the door to the common area open. An object is seen being thrown into the office and splitting into two pieces when it hits the floor. A still shot from the video shows Patterson pointing at the camera parts on her office floor while a police officer stands in the background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} After closing arguments, the trial court provided the following jury instruction as the jury took the case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   As to the charge of criminal mischief, you may consider all of the evidence before you, including the lease agreement between [appellant] and Buffie Patterson. If you determine, after your review of the evidence, that Buffie Patterson had no legal right to install the camera in question in the location it was placed, and only if you determine that this prohibition existed in the lease, you may consider whether [appellant] has a defense to the charge of criminal mischief and only the charge of criminal mischief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Tr. at 253.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellant presents two arguments to establish the insufficiency of the evidence at trial. He first argues that a mistake of fact negates the mens rea necessary to support conviction for the crime of criminal mischief. In the alternative, he argues that his action in destroying the camera was self-help to abate a nuisance and therefore privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 18} R.C. 2909.07(A) defines the offense of criminal mischief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   No person shall:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (1) Without privilege to do so, knowingly move, deface, damage, destroy, or otherwise improperly tamper with * * * the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (a) The property of another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Appellant first argues that a mistake of fact negates the element of \"knowingly\" and prevents conviction on the offense. Appellant argues that he believed that he had a right under the lease to remove the intrusive camera. Appellant does not argue on appeal that the evidence was lacking regarding the other elements of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 20} R.C. 2901.22(B) states that \"[a] person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature.\" With respect to the required mental state of \"knowingly,\" mistake of fact is an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We can therefore address the mistake-of-fact defense only in the context of the manifest weight standard\n   under appellant's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellant then argues that his actions were not \"without privilege\" under R.C. 2909.07(A)(1) because he had the right to exercise self-help in abating the nuisance constituted by the cameras. Appellant presents no authority for the proposition that Ohio recognizes abatement of a nuisance as a defense to criminal mischief, and one Ohio court has rejected the defense in a burglary case: \" 'Self-help' replevin is not an affirmative defense to burglary.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Sims\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. No. 54278,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1988%20WL%20118581\">\n    1988 WL 118581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Nov. 3, 1988). If we look to foreign cases for guidance, at least one state specifically rejects this concept, the defense in a crime similar to the one before us.\n   <em>\n    Barstow v. State\n   </em>\n   , Texas Crim.App. No. 03-10-00142-CR, 2011 Tex.App. LEXIS 3236 (Apr. 27, 2011) (\"[T]o the extent that Barstow is arguing that he had a right under 'the common law' to 'abate the nuisance' * * *, this argument is without merit. Even if we were to assume * * * a nuisance as that term is defined, abating a nuisance is not recognized in the penal code as a defense to criminal mischief. Thus, it is not a valid defense to the commission of the offense.\"). Others seem to contemplate it with reservations, such as prior notice or warning before undertaking self-help.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The existence of a \"knowing\" state of mind as an element of a criminal offense \"is to be determined from all the attendant facts and circumstances available.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The jury could conclude from the language of the lease and the testimony regarding the cameras in the common office area that these simply did not establish a nuisance redressable through self-help. Under a sufficiency standard, therefore, the evidence, if believed, could support the requisite mens rea. For the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant's first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Second Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 23} We now turn to appellant's second assignment of error. In contrast to our review of sufficiency-of-the-evidence issues, when presented with a manifest-weight challenge, we must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\n   <em>\n    Thompkins\n   </em>\n   at 387,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20N.E.2d%20541\">\n    678 N.E.2d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nor can our sua sponte review of the record disclose any such deficiency. The state presented sufficient evidence as to each element of the offense: Patterson testified that she owned the camera, that it was installed in the common area of the office, and that appellant removed and damaged the camera without her permission. Rutherford testified in support of these essential facts. Appellant's own testimony contradicted little except the degree of damage to the camera. Although appellant contests whether the camera was broken, he does not otherwise dispute the circumstances under which he removed the camera from the ceiling, nor that the camera did not belong to him and in fact belonged to Patterson. Because there is conflicting evidence on whether the camera was damaged in the process, the jury was free to believe Patterson's account that the camera was shattered and could not be repaired and disbelieve appellant's testimony that it was not in fact damaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 27} We thus consider only the mens rea element under appellant's proposed mistake-of-fact defense. Mistake of fact may negate a showing of mens rea where there is a requirement that the defendant acted \"knowingly.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Snowden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6711557\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/7/358/#p363\">\n    7 Ohio App.3d 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 363,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=455%20N.E.2d%201058\">\n    455 N.E.2d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Dist.1982) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, however, appellant does not dispute the essential conduct giving rise to the offense, nor the context in which it occurred but, instead, asserts that he had the right to so act and subjectively believed that his actions were legal.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As such, appellant's arguments actually assert a mistake of law rather than a mistake of fact. The case is distinguishable from the situation in\n   <em>\n    Snowden\n   </em>\n   , in which the defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that factual circumstances supported his actions. Mistake of law is not a defense in Ohio.\n   <em>\n    State v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Based on the foregoing, we find that appellant's conviction is supported both by the manifest weight of the evidence and sufficient evidence to support conviction as a matter of law.
