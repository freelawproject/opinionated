Both judgments stem from a 2014 lawsuit filed by appellee, Brian Goodell, against Shawn Pasquale and Motorists, arising out of injuries Goodell suffered when he was allegedly struck by a truck he was servicing for his employer, Wylie &amp; Sons, after the truck was put into gear by Pasquale. Goodell asserted he was negligently injured by Pasquale and Goodell's loss was covered under Motorists policies issued to Wylie &amp; Sons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In its September 15, 2016 judgment, the trial court found Goodell's claims were excluded from coverage under a commercial general liability policy, but not under a business automobile policy, and granted in part and denied in part summary judgment to Motorists. Because Goodell had not moved for summary judgment, the court continued the case. Goodell immediately moved for summary judgment and on November 17, 2016, the trial court granted summary judgment to Goodell finding he was entitled to coverage under the auto policy and the company's umbrella policy.

In Goodell's first complaint, he contended that he was an \"insured\" under the uninsured/underinsured motorist and/or medical payments provisions and that Pasquale was on the premises of Wylie &amp; Sons with the permission of the owners, managers, and operators of the premises. In its answer, Motorists denied this allegation \"in the manner and form alleged,\" and answered only that Pasquale was performing work on company vehicles, but not the one which caused harm to\n   Goodell. Both parties sought summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In his motion, Goodell asserted Pasquale was an insured under the general liability and umbrella policy because he was a \"volunteer employee.\" Under the terms of the Motorists policy, \"employee\" is defined in the general liability and auto policies simply as follows: \" 'Employee' includes a 'leased worker.' 'Employee' does not include a 'temporary worker.' \" Attached to Goodell's motion was his affidavit wherein he attested that Pasquale is a friend of Thomas Wylie and he allowed Pasquale to be present in the shop on a daily basis and to operate Wylie &amp; Sons' trucks, including the one which Pasquale operated while Goodell was performing maintenance on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Motorists argued in its motion only that the policies excluded coverage for injuries for bodily injury which arose out of and in the course of Goodell's employment. Attached to Motorists' motion was the affidavit of Thomas Wylie who attested that Goodell was injured in the course and scope of his employment by a vehicle owned by Wylie &amp; Sons and he had received workers' compensation for his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} However, before the summary judgment motions were ruled upon, Goodell voluntarily dismissed his claims against Motorists without prejudice. The trial court granted default judgment against Pasquale and awarded Goodell damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Goodell filed a supplemental complaint against Motorists, pursuant to R.C. 3929.06, to recover the judgment rendered against Pasquale. Goodell asserted Pasquale was insured under both the general liability and auto policies because he was on the premises with the permission and acting as a \"volunteer worker.\" Motorists answered admitting only that Wylie &amp; Sons was the \"named insured\" and asserted that the claim was barred by the exclusions. Motorists neither admitted nor denied that Pasquale was a \"volunteer worker\" or an \"insured.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Motorists moved for summary judgment arguing coverage was barred under the workers' compensation exclusion and the employer's liability exclusion. Motorists also asserted that it was undisputed that both Goodell and Pasquale were \"acting within the course and scope of their respective employment activities with Wylie &amp; Sons.\" Attached to the motion was the same previously-filed Wylie's affidavit that did not address Pasquale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Goodell filed a memorandum in opposition arguing Pasquale was a \"voluntary worker\" under the general liability policy and an \"insured\" under the auto policy because he was permitted to be on the premises and use the company's trucks. Goodell argued the employer liability exclusion is not applicable as the exclusion applies only to the insured's employees and Goodell is not Pasquale's employee. Goodell also disputed that Pasquale was not a co-employee. Goodell argued the only evidence in the case was that Pasquale was a frequent, permissive user of the company trucks. Goodell attached a second affidavit to his reply memorandum attesting Pasquale was not an employee of Wylie &amp; Sons, but worked on the company's property mainly on his own customers' vehicles and sporadically did repair work on company vehicles as an independent contractor charging Wylie for each job. Goodell further attested that when customers complained to Wylie about Pasquale, he would tell those customers that Pasquale was not his employee; Wylie argued with Pasquale about the complaints; and Wylie had nothing to do with Pasquale's work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In its reply brief, Motorists argued there is no evidence that Pasquale\n   was a \"volunteer worker.\" Alternatively, Motorists argued, that even if Pasquale was a \"volunteer worker,\" he is not an \"insured\" under the general liability policy because even a voluntary worker is specifically excluded as an insured if he causes a work-related bodily injury to a co-employee while in the course of his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On September 15, 2016, the trial court granted summary judgment to Motorists in part. The trial court concluded Pasquale was not an insured under the general liability policy because there was no evidence presented that he was a \"volunteer worker\" for Wylie &amp; Sons. The only evidence before the court were Goodell's two affidavits. Therefore, the only evidence before the court was that Pasquale was a friend of Tom Wylie, he had permission to be on the premises and operate company vehicles, and Pasquale was not an employee of Wylie &amp; Sons. While Motorists asserted in its motion that Pasquale was \"acting within the course and scope of [his] employment activities,\" there was no evidence to support this assertion and the assertion itself does not clearly establish Pasquale was an actual employee of Wylie &amp; Sons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Irrespective of whether Pasquale was a \"volunteer worker\" or not, the trial court further concluded that the general liability policy specifically excluded Pasquale as an insured because he caused bodily injury to an employee in the course and scope of the employee's employment. Therefore, the trial court granted summary judgment to Motorists regarding the general liability policy. Goodell did not challenge this finding on appeal and coverage under the general liability policy is not an issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Regarding the auto policy, however, the court found that the \"insured\" under that policy could be either the \"name insured\" on the declarations page or anyone who uses a covered vehicle of the insured with permission, irrespective of the person's employment status. The trial court further determined the policy unambiguously provides that Pasquale is a separate \"insured\" and that none of the exclusions applied to Pasquale because he was not Goodell's employer. The court noted the second appellate district came to the same conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Motorists Ins. Cos. v. BFI Waste Management\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"138638\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/133/368/\">\n    133 Ohio App.3d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=728%20N.E.2d%2031\">\n    728 N.E.2d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Dist.1999). The court also found that because Pasquale was an insured under the auto policy, he was also covered by the umbrella policy as a separate insured. The trial court denied summary judgment to Motorists as to the auto policy. Motorists appealed from this judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Goodell was granted leave to move for summary judgment asserting coverage under the auto and umbrella policies. Motorists' motion for leave to renew its prior motion for summary judgment was eventually denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Motorists opposed Goodell's motion summary judgment arguing the fellow employee exclusion also excluded coverage under the auto policy. This exclusion bars coverage for bodily injury to a fellow employee arising out of and in the course of the fellow employee's employment. Motorists attached to its memorandum, a new Wylie affidavit wherein he attested Pasquale was \"acting as an employee\" at the time of the accident, \"was paid hourly,\" and was working 40-50 hours per week at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Goodell filed a reply opposing consideration of new arguments and moved to strike the new Wylie affidavit arguing the issue of Pasquale's employment status could not be reconsidered and, alternatively, that the new affidavit was conclusory and unsupported by factual evidence presented in Goodell's second affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 23} On November 17, 2016, the trial court granted summary judgment to Goodell. The trial court found that while Wylie attested that Pasquale was an employee working 40-50 hours per week at the time of the accident, he did not provide any supporting documents. In light of Goodell's second affidavit that Pasquale was not an employee and only used the shop to repair vehicles for his customers, the trial court found Wylie's bald contradictory affidavit, which did not include supporting documentation, did not give rise to a genuine question of material fact when such documentation was readily available. The trial court concluded Motorists had not met its burden of demonstrating the exclusion applied to the facts of this case. The trial court found both Motorists' motion for leave to renew its motion for summary judgment and Goodell's motion to strike Wylie's second affidavit as moot. The trial court granted summary judgment to Goodell and found Motorists was liable to pay the judgment rendered against Pasquale. Motorists appealed from this judgment also.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 24} On appeal from the second judgment, Motorists argues it had presented a sufficient question of fact as to whether Pasquale was an employee of Wylie &amp; Sons. We agree with the trial court's conclusion that the second Wylie affidavit was insufficient to defeat the grant of summary judgment to Goodell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Motorists' arguments relating to Pasquale's status changed over the course of this case. It first admitted only that Pasquale was permitted to work on company vehicles at the company shop while Goodell sought to classify Pasquale as a \"volunteer\" employee based on facts attested to in Goodell's first affidavit. While Motorists later asserted in its first motion for summary judgment that Pasquale was a \"co-employee,\" and two exclusions barred recovery, Motorists did not submit any evidence of Pasquale's employment status. Goodell, however, presented evidence (through Goodell's second affidavit) that Pasquale was at the shop on a daily basis, used company trucks with Wylie's permission, and was not a co-employee. Motorists continued to argue there was no evidence that Pasquale was a \"volunteer employee.\" It was not until after Goodell filed his second motion for summary judgment (based on the trial court's denial of summary judgment to Motorists and its finding of coverage under the auto and umbrella policies) that Motorists presented evidence that Pasquale was acting as an hourly-paid employee at the time of the accident by means of Wylie's second affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Motorists argues this case is distinguishable from prior cases where a baldly-contradictory affidavit was not considered sufficient evidence to overcome summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Kott Ents., Ltd. v.

Motorists asserts that because Goodell has argued Pasquale was a \"volunteer worker\" and attested that Pasquale was on the premises daily and performed some work for Wylie &amp; Sons, the second Wylie affidavit was not contradictory and only further supported the fact that Pasquale was an employee. We disagree. We find the second Wylie affidavit was contradictory to the prior evidence in the record, which consisted only of the admissions, Goodell's two affidavits, and Wylie's first affidavit. An assertion that Pasquale was a volunteer employee or an independent contractor is not the equivalent of the assertion he was a co-employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Motorists also argues Wylie's second affidavit was at least sufficient to demonstrate there was a genuine issue of a\n   material fact to warrant a trial. We disagree. Even in his second affidavit, we note that Wylie attested only that Pasquale \"acted as an employee\" at the time of the accident and was being paid on an hourly basis. The affidavit did not include readily-available documentary evidence to support the assertion that Pasquale was an actual employee. We conclude that the second Wylie affidavit, in light of the other evidence, did not conclusively state Pasquale was an employee. Therefore, we conclude that the second Wylie affidavit, even if were admissible, does not raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding as to whether Pasquale was a co-employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Therefore, we find Motorists' second assignment of error not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error No. 3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In its third assignment of error, Motorists argues the trial court erred by denying Motorists' renewed motion for summary judgment based upon the fellow employee exclusion and the Wylie affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The substance of this argument is that the trial court should have considered Wylie's second affidavit, an issue already addressed under Motorists' second assignment of error and rejected.

In the case before us, the employee of the named insured sued only the tortfeasor who is separately insured under the employer's auto policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 38} A court's role on summary judgment is merely to apply the unambiguous insurance provisions as written, irrespective of the purpose behind including workers' compensation and employer liability\n   exclusions. Motorists' arguments are premised on a reading of the policy that presumes that the named insured, Wylie &amp; Sons, was the only possible insured under the policy. The auto policy before us clearly names Pasquale as an insured. We also agree with the trial court that the plain language of the entire auto policy, including the severability clause and exclusions, provides that coverage is barred under the policy only when an injured employee sues his employer. Pasquale, the \"insured,\" is not Goodell's employer and, therefore is not subject to the workers' compensation statutes and Goodell's injuries did not arise out of the insured's (Pasquale's) business. Therefore, we agree with the trial court that the plain language of the auto policy provides that neither exclusion applies to Pasquale's liability.

Motorists does not cite any case in support of its argument and we reject it. The workers' compensation exclusion applies to an insured who could be held \"liable\" under the workers' compensation law to participate in the workers' compensation system. That exclusion does not apply to Pasquale. R.C. 4123.931 gives the statutory subrogee (the administrator of the bureau or certain employers) the right to recover settlements or judgments an employee received from a third-party tortfeasor. That right is derived from the right of the injured employee to recover damages from the tortfeasor and his insurer, not from any liability of the tortfeasor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Third, Motorists argues the employer liability exclusion applies even if Pasquale is the insured because it excludes coverage for employees injured in the course and scope of their employment. We disagree with this argument because the language of the exclusion requires the injured party to be in the course and scope of his employment of the\n   <em>\n    insured\n   </em>\n   . In this case the insured is Pasquale, not Wylie &amp; Sons. While it is undisputed that Goodell was injured while he was working for Wylie &amp; Sons, the exclusion only bars recovery by employees of the insured, Pasquale. Therefore, the exclusion is not triggered in this case.

Each insured is considered individually as to whether the exclusion applies and the language clearly\n   applies the exclusions to Wylie &amp; Sons but not Pasquale because he is not Goodell's employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Motorists argues the result of this application is that greater coverage is provided for an omnibus insured than the named insured who purchased the policy. We disagree. Ohio has a compulsory contribution system to compensate injured workers which requires employers must maintain workers' compensation insurance, R.C. Chapter 4123, and, therefore, the named insured need not separately insure against injury to employees under a commercial general liability policy. However, Wylie &amp; Sons also obtained an automobile policy to cover potential liability arising out of the use of a company vehicle by any person permitted to use the vehicle. Motorists drafted the policy language of the policy so that it permitted Goodell to recover perhaps more than if had he been injured by a fellow employee. We cannot alter the clear language of the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Therefore, we conclude that Motorists' first assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Having found that the trial court did not commit error prejudicial to Motorists and that substantial justice has been done, the judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.
