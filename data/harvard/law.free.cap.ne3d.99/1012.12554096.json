Settles (\"Settles\"), appeals the February 28, 2017 judgment entry of the Seneca County Court of Common Pleas dismissing his petition for post-conviction relief. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 1997, Settles was convicted of murder with a firearm specification and sentenced to \"an indefinite term of fifteen (15) years to life as to the charge of MURDER and a term of three (3) years as a mandatory and consecutive term * * * due to the defendant having a firearm.\" (Doc.

In that direct appeal, we affirmed the judgment of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On August 8, 2016, Settles filed a \"Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 2953.21.\" (Doc. No. 235). In his \"petition,\" Settles requested \"vacating the sentence imposed\" by the trial court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). As grounds for the requested relief, Settles alleged that his \"Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment Right [sic] to freedom from cruel and unusual punishment as guaranteed under the Ohio and United States Constitutions\" were denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). Additionally, Settles stated as a ground for relief that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The State, treating Settles' petition as a petition for post-conviction relief, filed its memorandum in opposition to Settles' petition on September 6, 2016. (Doc. No. 238). On September 16, 2016, Settles filed his reply to the State's memorandum in opposition to his petition. (Doc. No. 239).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Treating Settles' petition as a petition for post-conviction relief, the trial court dismissed Settles' petition on February 28, 2017. (Doc. No. 241).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On March 27, 2017, Settles filed a notice of appeal. (Doc. No. 242). He raises three assignments of error for our review.

Since Settles' petition was filed in his criminal case and cited R.C. 2953.21 -Ohio's post-conviction-relief statute-the State and the trial court treated Settles' petition as a petition for post-conviction relief.

Settles' ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel allegations pertain to matters that occurred at or before trial. Settles offers no argument that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the alleged ineffectiveness of his trial counsel-that is, Settles makes no argument that he was unaware of those facts or unable to learn of them from reasonable diligence. Rather, those facts were available to him at the time of trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Russell\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.
