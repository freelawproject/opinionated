It is the Court that establishes the legal standard defining the \"objectively reasonable official.\" Here, in light of the irrefutable evidence provided by the video inside the police station, this Court has no hesitancy in ruling as matter of law that no reasonable police officer would have understood their conduct to have violated constitutional norms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The blurry video outside the police station presents a different situation.

Moreover, it would have been utterly out of character and counter productive for Keefe and Cooper to have spent hours entreating, cajoling, and gently guiding Winfield out of the police station to then, having achieved their goal, roughly to have shoved her into the family car.
