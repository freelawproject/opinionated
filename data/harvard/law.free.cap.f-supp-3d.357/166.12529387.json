One of the keys to ensuring that a public school district provides an appropriate education is the proper\n   <em>\n    evaluation\n   </em>\n   over time of the child's disabilities. The IDEA requires schools to conduct a range of comprehensive and periodic evaluations for each disabled child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   But parents don't always agree with the results of evaluations that a school may conduct. And so the IDEA allows for parents under certain circumstances to request that the school pay for an outside expert to conduct what is known as an \"independent educational evaluation\" (or, in IDEA-acronym-speak, an \"IEE\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case raises important questions about the right to a publicly funded IEE. In light of federal regulations that place limits on the scope of this right and when it must be asserted, I reach two conclusions that lead me to grant judgment in favor of the defendant Trumbull Board of Education and against plaintiff student D.S. and his parents who have filed this action on his behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   First, I conclude that a parent's statement of disagreement with a limited assessment\n   does not entitle a parent to insist that the school district pay for an IEE to conduct additional testing or assessments beyond the scope of the assessment with which the parent has disagreed. Therefore, I conclude that the Hearing Officer in this case properly declined to require the Trumbull Board of Education to pay for a wide range of testing and assessments that were requested by the parents of D.S. and that were beyond the scope of the Functional Behavior Assessment with which the parents disagreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Second, in light of the general two-year time limitation that the IDEA imposes on a parent's right to seek a due process hearing when the parent believes that a school district has violated the student's rights under the IDEA, I conclude that a parent who seeks the benefit of a publicly funded IEE must lodge a disagreement and set in motion the parent's right to a due process hearing within two years of the school evaluation that the parent disputes. Therefore, I conclude that to the extent that the parents of D.S. now seek to re-frame their claim to be about their disagreement with a prior evaluation by the school district that took place more than two years before their request for a publicly funded IEE, the parents waited too long to seek to dispute this prior evaluation. In light of all these conclusions, I will grant the defendant Trumbull Board of Education's motion for summary judgment and deny plaintiff D.S.'s cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before reviewing the facts involving D.S. and the dispute with the Trumbull school district, I will describe the relevant and somewhat complex legal framework. Beyond describing the IDEA in general, my focus will be on the important but limited role under the IDEA for independent educational evaluations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The IDEA and the right to an independent educational evaluation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The IDEA requires public school districts to provide disabled children with a free and appropriate education (commonly referred to as a \"FAPE\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Endrew F. ex rel.

Doc. # 46 at 10 (\u00b6 14), 11 (\u00b6 2). Therefore, the Hearing Officer further granted the parents' request for an IEE at public expense for a psychosocial assessment and to an independent BASC as part of this IEE.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.502\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 14).

After all, the right to a publicly funded IEE turns on the parents' disagreement with an evaluation that was actually done, not a parent's disagreement with an evaluation that was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   done. The IEE regulation's requirement that there be a disagreement with an existing evaluation would be meaningless if a parent could lodge a \"disagreement\" with any particular evaluation as no more than a device to demand a publicly funded IEE for testing beyond the intended or proper scope of the evaluation with which the parents purportedly disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This interpretation is reinforced by the language of the IEE regulation that allows a school district to file for a due process hearing so that it may show to the satisfaction of a hearing officer \"that its evaluation is appropriate.\" \u00a7 300.502(b)(2). If a parent were entitled to demand an IEE to evaluate aspects of a child's disabilities that were not intended to be measured by the testing that was actually performed by the agency, then this provision of the regulation would be pointless, because the school district could scarcely hope to prove that its \"evaluation\" was \"appropriate\" if its adequacy is to be measured against goals outside the very scope of what the evaluation is designed and intended to measure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Thus, for example, if the school district conducts an assessment to measure a student's eyesight (and assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that this limited testing constitutes an \"evaluation\" for purposes of the IDEA), a\n   parent may \"disagree\" with the test results and request an independent eye exam at public expense. The parent, however, may not use the occasion of the school's decision to conduct an eye exam to demand that the public pay for a panoply of neurological, occupational, and behavioral evaluations by independent specialists. The words of the regulation that condition the right to a publicly funded IEE are not reasonably interpreted to create such a virtually limitless right. And if parents had such free-ranging rights to impose financial obligations on schools every time that a school district conducts a limited assessment of a disabled child, then schools would understandably be reluctant to conduct any interim testing or assessment beyond the bare statutory minimum for fear of significant financial liability from parental demands for publicly funded IIEs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The parents insist that the broad range of additional testing they proposed was all relevant to the FBA conducted by the school, because the proposed testing could shed light on some aspect of D.S.'s behavior. Doc. # 28-1 at 34-48. But the parents do not show that these additional assessments were within the scope of what is intended to be measured by a functional behavior assessment, and I otherwise defer to the school district's and Hearing Officer's conclusion that carefully concluded that some of what the parents requested was within the proper scope of the FBA but that most of it was not. \"The district court's determination of the persuasiveness of an administrative finding must also be colored by an acute awareness of institutional competence and role.\"\n   <em>\n    M.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902560\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/217/#p226\">\n    685 F.3d at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   It bears repeating that the issue here is not the right of parents to have an independent evaluation conducted of their child. It is the right of parents to have it provided at public expense. As the IEE regulation makes clear,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 300.502(b)(3) &amp; (c), parents are free to fund their own independent evaluation and to bring the results to the attention of the school district in the formulation of an individualized educational program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, if the parents here were correct that they have a right to demand a publicly financed IEE for additional testing and assessments that are unrelated to a disagreement with an evaluation that the school district has performed, this would undermine the basic statutory scheme of the IDEA for the conduct of evaluations. The IDEA contemplates that a school district will have an opportunity in the first instance to conduct its own evaluations (subject of course to the consent of the parents as IEP team members) and that only then, if the parents disagree with the evaluation, should a school face the prospect of either having to pay for an independent evaluation or having to defend its evaluation as appropriate at a due process hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Of course, if a school district refuses to conduct an evaluation that the parent requests,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.303\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (providing for right of parent to request a reevaluation), then a parent is free to file for a due process hearing to insist that the school district's failure to conduct a reevaluation as requested by the parent is inconsistent with the student's IEP or the school district's overall duty to provide a free and appropriate education.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott ex rel.

Because the record does not disclose any grounds to suggest that the parents would not or should not have known of grounds to disagree with the triennial evaluation of October 2014 soon after its completion, the IDEA's internal statute of limitations precludes the parents from basing their claim of disagreement on the triennial evaluation of October 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The parents insist that \"the IDEA permits parents to request an IEE any number of years - even 100 years - after the Board's last evaluation of the Student.\" Doc. # 45 at 7. Maybe so. But the relevant issue is that the IDEA imposes a two-year limit on when a complaint for a due process hearing must be filed. If the parents disagreed with the triennial evaluation of October 2014, they should have timely stated any such disagreement and pursued any due process hearing for any denial of an IEE at public expense within two years of the triennial evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   I reject as inconsistent with common sense and the statutory scheme the parents' argument that they could wait however many years or decades they wished to lodge their disagreement with the triennial evaluation and then wait yet two more years before seeking a due process review of the school's denial of a publicly financed IEE. This rule would do nothing for the child and redound only to the benefit of perpetuating pointless litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The parents further contend that any statute of limitations in the IDEA is not the proper one to apply to an IEE request in Connecticut. They argue that the IDEA statute of limitations applies only if there is no applicable state law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.511\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), and that \"Connecticut has a state law that\n   <em>\n    arguably\n   </em>\n   applies, G.S. \u00a7 10-76-h.\" Doc. # 45 at 8 (emphasis\n   added);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2010-76\">\n    Conn.

Moreover, the federal IDEA regulations require that, in order to displace the federal two-year rule, the State must have no less than an \"explicit time limitation\" to request a due process hearing,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.511\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Despite the parents' equivocal claim that the Connecticut statute \"arguably\" applies, the Connecticut statute does not\n   <em>\n    explicitly\n   </em>\n   regulate the time to seek a due process hearing for a violation of rights relating to the failure to provide a publicly financed IEE. Connecticut regulations otherwise make clear that the provisions of the IDEA govern when a Connecticut parent may obtain an IEE at public expense. Regulations for Connecticut State Agencies (\"R.C.S.A.\") \u00a7 10-76d-a (\"A parent shall be permitted to obtain an independent educational evaluation,\n   <em>\n    in accordance with the provisions of the IDEA.\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   At oral argument, the parents insisted that any IEE request is\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   timely because evaluations are inherently open-ended and continuous, such that every single school day-in some ethereal sense-constitutes a new \"evaluation\" with which a parent might decide to lodge a disagreement. This argument runs contrary to the IDEA's specialized regulatory definition of the term \"evaluation,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.15\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as contrary to the terms of the IEE regulation that reference evaluations as discrete occurrences that the school district has \"obtained\" and \"conducts.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.502\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) &amp; (b)(5).
