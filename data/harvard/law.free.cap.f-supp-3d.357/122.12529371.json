They move to dismiss the Third Claim for Relief: Aiding and Abetting General Laws Chapter 93 \u00a7 12 and 69 and Chapter 93A \u00a7 2 and 11, the Fourth Claim for Relief: Unjust enrichment, and the Tenth Claim for Relief: Tortious aiding and abetting, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 and 12 (b) (6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   TelexFree, Inc. (\"TelexFree\") was a pyramid scheme that operated from February 2012 until April 2014. It involved approximately two million participants worldwide, nearly one million of whom suffered financial loss. Several Plaintiffs filed actions in District Courts across the United States seeking to recover their losses against dozens of defendants, ranging from financial service providers, payment processing companies (such as ProPay, the moving party,) and the principals of the fraudulent scheme employed by, or otherwise involved with TelexFree. As the actions involved common questions of fact, the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation joined the actions into a multi-district litigation in order to transfer all actions to the District of Massachusetts for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ProPay is a financial service provider which processed the electronic transfer of funds from participants to TelexFree. In October 2012, ProPay agreed to accept TelexFree as a customer and began processing transactions on their behalf. This relationship continued until January 2014 and during that time ProPay processed millions of dollars in incoming membership fees for the benefit of TelexFree. The Second Consolidated Amended (\"SCAC\") complaints alleges that \"in the course of providing services to TelexFree, ProPay directly communicated with fellow defendant payment processing service companies, Base Commerce and GPG regarding the inherent risks and concerns of TelexFree.\" (SCAC \u00b6 870) More particularly the complaint alleges that ProPay sent an email to Defendant Hughes, the President of Base Commerce (which was also servicing TelexFree) which identified TelexFree as an extremely high-risk client and indicated that no United States bank or processor would be willing to take on TelexFree as a client given this risk.

Similarly, the\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   court was not deciding whether a party could aid and abet a C. 93A claim, but whether a party could aid and abet statutory violations of M.G.L.

That court held one could not aid and abet C. 149 and 151B violations because the legislature \"could have specifically provided for aiding and abetting liability in G.L.C. 149 \u00a7 148B and chose not to.\"\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201758301\">\n    Supra at *8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Chapter 93A, which is based upon the Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1) ), also does not specifically mention a separate aiding and abetting cause of action. \"A defendant acting with knowledge of deception who either directly participates in that deception or has the authority to control the deceptive practice of another, but allows the deception to proceed, engages,\n   <em>\n    through its own actions\n   </em>\n   , in a deceptive act or practice that causes harm to consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

Second, the cases where courts in this district have held that parties may incur liability under Chapters 93 and 93A specifically refer to the \"breach of fiduciary duty\", and not Section 69, which covers illegal multi-level distribution company's actions. Accordingly, I find that there is no separate cause of action under the facts of this case for Aiding and Abetting M.G.L. C. 93 \u00a7 12 and 69, and C. 93A \u00a7 2 and 11 and grant Defendant's Motion as to the Third Claim for Relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    The Fourth Claim for Relief: Unjust Enrichment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Fourth Claim for Relief of the SCAC alleges that \"Plaintiffs and the putative class conferred a benefit upon the defendants by furnishing funds, directly or indirectly to defendants who accepted them without protest and retained and benefited from them.\" (SCAC at \u00b6 1038). The Complaint does not break down these allegations against specific payment processing companies, and instead makes omnibus allegations, such as \"... each of the defendants chose to enhance fees for providing services to TelexFree's suspicious and unlawful enterprise.\" (SCAC \u00b6 326), \"TelexFree could not have successfully carried out its lawful enterprise or shelter it's [sic] ill-gotten gains without the integral assistance of ... payment processing companies.\" (SCAC at \u00b6 313).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To state a claim for unjust enrichment the Plaintiff must demonstrate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   1) a benefit conferred on the Defendant by the Plaintiff;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   2) an appreciation or knowledge of the benefit by the Defendant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   3) the acceptance or retention of the benefit by the Defendant under circumstances which make acceptance or retention inequitable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Assuming arguendo\n   </em>\n   that these fees were for payment processing services, it was TelexFree, not the Plaintiffs, which conferred the alleged benefit on the Defendants. Therefore, only TelexFree would have standing to assert a claim relating to the alleged benefit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The parties agree that TelexFree established an illegal Ponzi scheme and thus committed a relevant underlying tort. The Court begins its analysis by examining the allegation that the Defendant either actively participated in and/or substantially assisted in TelexFree's tortious and fraudulent scheme. Participation that is not active, (i.e. passive) does not constitute aiding and abetting\"). Similarly, mere assistance, less than substantial, also fails to meet the relevant threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   I find that the Plaintiffs allegation in the SCAC are sufficient to withstand the Defendant's Motion on the knowledge requirement. The complaint sets forth allegations that ProPay had constructive, if not actual knowledge of TelexFree's fraud. Under Massachusetts law tortious aiding and abetting occurs only when a Defendant actually knows that a tort is being committed and actively participates in, or substantially assists the commission of that tort.\n   <em>\n    Go-best Assets Ltd., v.

In that email to the Defendant Hughes, the President of Base Commerce, another payment processing company, ProPay characterized TelexFree as an extremely high risk client and indicated that no United States bank or processor would be willing to take on TelexFree as a client given this risk...\" (SCAC \u00b6 871). The Defendant points out that what the email in fact says, is that no U.S. bank or processing company \"will accept your business given that you are on month five of the Visa charge back monitoring program.\" Whichever inferences may be warranted from this email does not change the fact that this is evidence of the actual knowledge requirement as to ProPay.
