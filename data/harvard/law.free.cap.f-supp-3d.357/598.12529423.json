Hood, Senior U.S. District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants Kenneth and Lora Hatton move to amend or correct their Answer and Counterclaim against Plaintiff Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company. [DE 14]. The Hattons seek to add The Roark Agency, LLC, (\"Roark\" or \"Agency\") to the action as a third-party plaintiff, claiming that Roark is an indispensable party. [See DE 14 at 1, Pg ID 105]. Contemporaneously, the Hattons move to dismiss the matter for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because adding Roark as a third-party plaintiff will destroy complete diversity of citizenship between the parties. [DE 15]. Alternatively, notwithstanding the Court's decision on adding Roark as a party, the Hattons argue that the Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over this matter because they claim Nationwide's lawsuit constitutes procedural fencing to gain jurisdiction in federal court and that the relevant considerations counsel against the exercise of federal jurisdiction in this matter. [DE 15 at 4-7, Pg ID 115-18]. Thus, that Hattons assert that this federal case should be dismissed and heard in state court. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In response, Nationwide asserts that the Hattons' Motions are nothing more than attempts to destroy federal diversity jurisdiction. [DE 18 at 2, Pg ID 126]. In support of this contention, Nationwide argues that Roark is not an indispensable party, that if Roark is joined, it should be joined as a third-party defendant, and that this Court should exercise jurisdiction in this matter under the Declaratory Judgment Act. [DE 18]. The Hattons tendered a consolidated reply, making this matter ripe for review. [DE 19].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Here, the Hattons have failed to establish that the Roark Agency is an indispensable party, so the Hattons' Motion to Correct or Amend the Answer to Complaint and Counterclaim [DE 14] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . But because the relevant factors and considerations weigh against exercising federal jurisdiction in this matter and because the state court is a more practical and efficient forum for resolution of this action, the Hattons' Motion to Dismiss [DE 15] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    PART\n   </strong>\n   and this action is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or around October 30, 2017, the Defendants, Kenneth and Lora Hatton, applied for a dwelling insurance policy to insure real property they owned at 121 East High Street in Mount Sterling, Kentucky. [DE 1-2]. On December 8, 2017, the insured property was damaged by a fire. As a result, the Hattons made a claim for coverage under the Nationwide policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Subsequently, at Nationwide's request, the Hattons submitted separate examinations under oath (\"EUOs\") on March 15, 2018. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 18-1; DE 18-2]. Then, on July 19, 2018, counsel for Nationwide sent a letter to counsel for the Hattons indicating that Nationwide believed that coverage was unavailable to the Hattons due to misrepresentations made on the insurance application. [DE 15-1 at 1, Pg ID 120]. Additionally, the letter indicated that in lieu of immediately denying coverage, Nationwide had decided to file a declaratory judgment action to obtain a declaration of its rights and liabilities before proceeding. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the same day that it sent the letter, Nationwide filed this declaratory judgment action in federal court. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 1]. According to Nationwide, the Hattons made material misrepresentations when applying for the Nationwide policy, which entitles Nationwide to deny coverage pursuant to the terms of the insurance policy and K.R.S. \u00a7 304.14-110. [DE 1 at 4-6, Pg ID 4-6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In their Answer, the Hattons filed a counterclaim for breach of contract against Nationwide. [DE 9]. Additionally, the Hattons argue that their EUO testimony is inconclusive and that material issues of genuine fact exist pertaining to whether misrepresentations were made during the application process and whether the EUOs are relevant evidence. [DE 19 at 1-8, Pg Id 482-89]. Additionally, the Hattons assert that an employee of the Roark Agency completed the application for insurance on the Hattons' behalf. [DE 15]. As such, the Hattons argue that the Agency is an indispensable party in this matter because the Agency is responsible for any material misrepresentations contained in the insurance application. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a result, the Hattons move for leave to amend their Answer to assert counterclaims for breach of contract and negligence against the Roark Agency as a third-party plaintiff and a new counterclaim of estoppel against Nationwide. [DE 14]. The Hattons simultaneously move to dismiss this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. [DE 15]. Nationwide filed a combined response [DE 18], and the Hattons tendered a combined reply [DE 19], making this matter ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

But in\n   <em>\n    High Croft\n   </em>\n   , the court's analysis focused exclusively on the\n   <em>\n    Rule 19(b) factors\n   </em>\n   that are relevant at the third stage of the Rule 19 mandatory joinder analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    High Croft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7391287\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/714/1190/\">\n    714 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1192 ; Fed.

Here, while there are factual issues pertaining to the relevance of the Hattons statements in the EUOs and the culpability of Roark for any misrepresentations made on the insurance application, the Roark Agency need not be a party to the action to allow the Court to address these factual issues, declare the rights and obligations of Nationwide, and address the Hattons' counterclaim by considering whether a material misrepresentation was made when the Hattons applied for insurance coverage with Nationwide that will prevent Nationwide from denying coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Of course, the factual circumstances surrounding Roark's assistance with the acquisition of the insurance policy may be relevant in this matter. For instance, employees of the Roark Agency may be important witnesses in this matter and some of the factual circumstances may be intertwined. Still, while the joinder of Roark\n   may be convenient and more efficient, the fact that Roark assisted with the acquisition of the insurance policy does not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   that Roark be joined in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Still, the possibility of future litigation against a potential party does not mandate joinder; Rule 19(a)(1)(A) is concerned only with existing parties.\n   <em>\n    Sch.

The Hattons\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have a claim for breach of contract or negligence against Roark and Nationwide\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have a right of indemnity against Roark. Still, this potential for future litigation does not mean that this Court cannot provide complete relief among the existing parties on the discrete issue of coverage under the insurance policy. The fact that Roark may have some liability in this matter does not necessitate joinder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laethem Equip. Co. v.

For example, the Hattons' proposed breach of contract counterclaim against Roark states, \"In the event Nationwide is found not to owe coverage to the Defendants under the Policy, the Agency has breached their contract with the Defendants.\" [DE 14-1 at 3, Pg ID 109]. Similarly, the Hattons' proposed negligence counterclaim contains similar language that is contingent upon the outcome in this lawsuit. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. In this action, the discrete relief requested by Nationwide, a declaration of Nationwide's rights and liabilities under the insurance policy, may be resolved without Roark being added as a party to this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In sum, the Court may declare Nationwide's obligations under the policy and determine whether Nationwide breached the insurance policy without the joinder of the Roark Agency. Thus, the Hattons have failed to demonstrate that complete relief cannot be granted without the joinder of Roark in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    (c) Will Disposing of the Action in Roark's Absence Impair the Agency's Ability to Protect its Interest or Subject an Existing Party to Incurring Double, Multiple, or Inconsistent Obligations?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Second, the Hattons have similarly failed to demonstrate that the Roark Agency claims an interest that is so situated that disposing of the action in the agency's absence may impair or impede the Roark's ability to protect the interest or may leave an existing party subject to incurring double, multiple, or inconsistent obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Here, the Hattons' entire argument pertaining to the possibility for inconsistent judgments relies on direct citations from the\n   <em>\n    High Croft\n   </em>\n   decision. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 15 at 3-4, Pg ID 114-15]. The Hattons' argument seems to be that the\n   <em>\n    High Croft\n   </em>\n   court got it right in a similar case and, as a result, this Court should also find that Roark is an indispensable party due to the potential for inconsistent judgments. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4131449\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/485/39/#p44\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ]. Frankly, that is not sufficient to demonstrate that Roark is an indispensable party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To meet their burden of demonstrating that Roark is an indispensable party, the Hattons must do more than provide quotations from a single persuasive case. While there appear to be legitimate concerns about the potential for parallel litigation and inconsistent judgments in this matter, the Court cannot determine whether Roark is an indispensable party without more flesh on the bones of the Hattons'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   argument. Here, the Hattons have cited no binding authority to support their argument that Roark is an indispensable party due to the potential for inconsistent obligations. Furthermore, the Hattons have provided few facts specific to this case that demonstrate that Roark's ability to defend its interest will be impaired or that one of the existing parties will be subjected to multiple or inconsistent obligations as a result of this action proceeding in federal court. As such, the Hattons have failed to demonstrate that Roark must be joined in this action pursuant to Rule 19(a)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    (d) Conclusion on Adding the Roark Agency as an Indispensable Party\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In conclusion, the Hattons have failed to demonstrate that the Court may not accord complete relief in this declaratory judgment action among the existing parties without the joinder of the Roark Agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1)(A). Additionally, the Hattons have failed to demonstrate that the agency has an interest in the action that is so situated that disposing of the action in the Roark's absence will impede the agency from protecting its interests or that will lead to a substantial risk of the agency incurring double, multiple, or inconsistent obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1)(B). As a result, the Roark Agency is not a required party pursuant to Rule 19(a)(1) and this action may proceed without joinder of the Agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Lastly, having found that Roark is not a required party, the Court need not consider the second and third steps in the Rule 19 analysis. The second and third steps are contingent upon the Court concluding that the Agency is a required party in this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Soberay Mach. &amp; Equip.

As a result, seeing as the Roark Agency is not an indispensable party that must be joined in this matter and that joinder of Roark would destroy diversity of citizenship, the Hattons' Motion to Amend their Answer and Counterclaim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exercise of Jurisdiction Pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Alternatively, even if the Roark Agency is not an indispensable party, the Hattons still urge the Court to dismiss this declaratory judgment action. The Hattons argue that Nationwide's declaratory judgment action in federal court constitutes procedural fencing and that, even if this Court has subject matter jurisdiction, the matter is best litigated in state court. Ultimately, because the relevant factors and considerations weigh against the exercise of federal jurisdiction in this case for the reasons that follow, the action is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) The Declaratory Judgment Act and Federal Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Declaratory Judgment Act provides that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction ... any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.

As such, adopting the same approach that the court employed in\n   <em>\n    Grange Mutual\n   </em>\n   here, the first factor weighs against the exercise of federal jurisdiction because it is unclear whether a judgment in this action will settle the ultimate controversy\n   and there is a very real possibility that additional litigation will be necessary in state court, notwithstanding the judgment in the federal declaratory action. But the second factor weighs in favor of the exercise of federal jurisdiction because a decision on the rights and obligations of Nationwide under the insurance policy will settle the discrete issue between the two parties in this action pertaining to coverage under the Nationwide policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Factor Three: Procedural Fencing or a Race for Res Judicata\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The third factor seeks to prevent litigants from using declaratory judgment actions to gain a favorable forum in the federal courts. The Hattons cite numerous cases to support their contention that procedural fencing occurred in this case, claiming that if they had filed a claim for coverage in state court against Nationwide and Roark that Nationwide would have been unable to remove the action to federal court due to a lack of complete diversity. Here, the Hattons argue that \"the concern is that the declaratory judgment action not be used to allow the 'natural defendant' to preempt the 'natural plaintiff's' choice of forum and that the action not be used to force the natural plaintiff to race to the courthouse rather than come to the negotiation table.\"\n   <em>\n    Liberty Mut.

As such, the third factor weighs against exercising federal jurisdiction in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   First, the Hattons are correct that if they had filed a proper action in state court as the plaintiff against Nationwide and Roark as defendants, that Roark's presence in the action would destroy complete diversity of citizenship. Nationwide argues that Roark would only be added to the state court action to prevent the case from being removed to federal court, amounting to fraudulent joinder. But a fraudulent joinder analysis is not relevant here because this case was not removed to federal court but was filed in federal court by Nationwide in the first instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, if the Hattons had filed the action in state court in the first instance, and asserted claims against Nationwide and Roark, removal would be unavailable to Nationwide barring fraudulent joinder of Roark. Thus, it appears that Nationwide filed this action in federal court for the purpose of procedural fencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Second, while an insurer filing an action for a declaration of its rights in federal court is not unusual, courts have found that procedural irregularities with the filing of declaratory actions can indicate that an action was filed for the purpose of procedural fencing or forum shopping. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Bohms\n   </em>\n   , the Defendant served the insurer with a legally required civil remedy notice to give the insurance company\n   notice of a potential litigant's forthcoming bad faith lawsuit as required by Florida law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203268608\">\n    2011 WL 3268608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.

App'x 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 725-26 (6th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In this case, the fact that this declaratory action was filed on the same day that Nationwide sent correspondence to the Hattons stating that Nationwide believed that coverage was unavailable under the policy indicates that Nationwide made a strategic decision to race to the courthouse to seek a federal forum. Counsel for Nationwide sent a letter to counsel for the Hattons dated July 19, 2018, stating that Nationwide believed that coverage was unavailable under the policy due to material misrepresentations that were made on the insurance application. [DE 15-1 at 1-2, Pg ID 120-21]. The same day, Nationwide filed this declaratory judgment action in federal court. [DE 1]. Thus, it appears that Nationwide, the natural defendant in an insurance coverage dispute like this one, made a strategic decision to immediately file this declaratory action in federal court to avail itself of the federal forum and beat the Hattons, the natural plaintiffs, to the punch and preempt the Hattons' choice of forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Third, and finally, there is a legitimate concern about a race to res judicata in this matter. Nothing prevents the Hattons from filing a parallel action in state court. Such a filing, however, would create a classic race to judgment for the purpose of res judicata and would potentially result in inconsistent judgments between the federal and state courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As a result, the third factor weighs against the exercise of federal jurisdiction in this declaratory action. If the Hattons, the natural plaintiffs, had filed suit in state court naming Roark as a co-defendant, then removal would not be available due to a lack of complete diversity, suggesting that Nationwide filed this action for the purpose of procedural fencing. Additionally, while courts have been \"reluctant to impute an improper motive ... where there is no evidence of such in the record,\"\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/#p557\">\n    513 F.3d at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the fact that Nationwide filed this declaratory action in federal court on the same day that it sent the Hattons a letter indicating that Nationwide believed that it did not owe coverage under the policy suggests that Nationwide made a strategic decision to race to the courthouse to avail itself of a federal forum before the Hattons could file suit in state court. Finally, an identical action for declaratory relief may be filed in state court, creating a real possibility that a parallel state court action in this matter will result in a race to res judicata that may result in inconsistent judgments. In sum, the third factor weighs against the exercise of jurisdiction in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    (c) Factor Four: Friction Between State and Federal Courts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Sixth Circuit has weighed three sub-factors when considering whether a declaratory judgment action will cause friction between state and federal courts: (1) whether the underlying factual issues are important to an informed resolution of the case; (2) whether the state trial court is in a better position than the federal\n   court to evaluate those factual issues; and (3) whether there is a close nexus between the underlying factual and legal issues and state law and/or public policy, or whether federal common or statutory law dictates a resolution of the declaratory judgment action.\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale Ins.

The Sixth Circuit has interpreted the first sub-factor to focus on \"whether the state court's resolution of the factual issues in the case is necessary for the district court's resolution of the declaratory judgment action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/#p557\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Usually, declaring the rights and obligations of an insurance company under the terms of an insurance policy requires a close reading of the policy itself and the application of that policy to the facts based on settled principles of state law; but the issues here are slightly more complex. Whether a material misrepresentation was made during the insurance application process is the primary question, but it is not the only question that has been presented in this action. If a material misrepresentation was made, there is also the factual question of who is responsible for making the misrepresentation. As such, the application of agency law principles under Kentucky law will likely be necessary for an ultimate resolution in this matter to determine whether Nationwide shares any responsibility for any material misrepresentation made through its agent, the Roark Agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Additionally, there are other factual disputes in this action, in addition to the potential liability of Roark, that distinguish this case from others where federal courts have exercised jurisdiction. For instance, there is a dispute over the relevance of factual statements that were made by the Hattons during the EUOs and the extent to which these statements may be treated as evidence. [DE 19 at 1-2, Pg ID 482-83]. Furthermore, there are factual issues regarding the role of the Roark agency in procuring the insurance policy, including whether Roark discussed and reviewed the application with the Hattons. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3, Pg ID 483-84]. There are factual questions pertaining to the relevance, if any, of questions contained in a related Agribusiness Insurance Application. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, Pg ID 484]. Finally, there are fact questions regarding certain terms that were included in the application and what misrepresentations were made, if any, in the application based on the meaning of these terms. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, Pg ID 485].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Ultimately, if this case continues in federal court, it is possible, perhaps even likely, that the Hattons will file a parallel action in state court raising issues identical to those raised here. A parallel action in the state court would require making factual findings that may conflict with the factual findings made in the federal court action. This type of race to judgment or potential for inconsistent judgments may increase friction between the federal and state courts and should be avoided if possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Still, the question under this sub-factor is not necessarily whether a judgment will conflict with the judgment in an underlying state court case, but rather, \"whether the state court's resolution of the factual issues in the case is\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   for the district court's resolution of the declaratory judgment action.\"\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale Ins.

Here, while the state court may be in the best\n   position to resolve this issue, it is not\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   that this matter be decided in state court. Federal courts regularly apply state law to resolve insurance coverage disputes when sitting in diversity. Additionally, assuming that Roark is not an indispensable party and that subject matter jurisdiction is proper in this Court, neither party has alleged that this matter cannot be resolved in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   On this issue, this case is similar to other cases where this Court has exercised federal jurisdiction in a declaratory action.

Of course, there is a compelling argument that these factual issues are best resolved in state court as opposed to federal court (see the discussion below), but that isn't the relevant consideration for this sub-factor. Here, the federal court may resolve the factual issues raised without the necessity of resolution of any factual issues in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The second sub-factor focuses on whether the state court or federal court is in a better position to resolve the issue. Insurance companies are regulated by the states and, as such, state courts are generally in a better position to resolve insurance coverage disputes.\n   <em>\n    Grange Mut. Cas.

But resolution of this matter will also likely involve application of state agency law and consideration of the relevance and evidentiary value of the EUOs, which while perhaps not novel, complicate the legal analysis. Thus, on the one hand, this issue involves complex issues of state law that are not necessarily unsettled or novel and could be applied by the federal court in this matter. Still, this case involves more complex application of state law than simply whether a material misrepresentation was made on an application for insurance, which arguably\n   places the state court in the\n   <em>\n    best\n   </em>\n   position to resolve the factual and legal issues in this matter. As a result, the second sub-factor could go either way and is neutral on whether the exercise of federal jurisdiction is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, the third sub-factor weighs against the exercise of federal jurisdiction in this matter because the issues presented here implicate important state policies. As the Sixth Circuit has recognized, \"states are in a better position to resolve insurance disputes because they are more familiar with state law, they regulate the insurance companies for the benefit of their citizens, and are best situated to identify and enforce the policies underlying those regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Grange Mut.

Of course, federal courts are not unfit to resolve insurance coverage disputes. Still, since this action exclusively involves state law, the third sub-factor weighs against the exercise of federal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Here, the first sub-factor weighs in favor of exercising federal jurisdiction because there are no underlying factual issues that must necessarily be resolved in a state court. The second sub-factor is neutral because, while there are no novel legal issues arising under state law here, the legal issues are complex, and the state court is arguably in the best position to resolve those issues. Finally, the third sub-factor weighs against the exercise of federal court jurisdiction because insurance coverage disputes implicate important state law interests and resolution of this matter requires the exclusive application of substantive state law. In sum, balancing the sub-factors indicates that the fourth factor could go either way and is neutral on whether the federal court should exercise jurisdiction in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    (d) Factor Five: Availability of an Alternative Remedy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   While Nationwide was not required to wait on the Hattons to pursue their rights by filing a lawsuit or initiating a settlement action, Nationwide could have sought identical declaratory relief in state court pursuant to K.R.S. \u00a7 418.040.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Ct. App. 2016) (appeal from declaratory judgment action filed by insurance company for declaration of its rights and obligations under an insurance policy). Nationwide defends its choice to file in federal court in the first instance by stating that \"Nationwide filed this action to obtain a declaration of its rights and liabilities before proceeding with a course of conduct for which it might be held liable.\" [DE 18 at 19, Pg ID 143]. Additionally, Nationwide asserts that it should not have to wait on until the Hattons decide to bring suit. [Id.]. Fair enough, but that doesn't explain why this declaratory action was filed in federal court or argue that an alternative remedy is unavailable. The substantive rule of decision in this case will arise entirely under state law, an identical declaratory remedy is available to Nationwide under in state court, and there is no indication that filing this action in state court will have result in a delayed adjudication of Nationwide's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Sixth Circuit has also provided inconsistent advice on whether the state court remedy must be more effective than a federal declaratory action or simply provide an alternative remedy for the purposes of this factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/#p557\">\n    513 F.3d at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Regardless, there is no indication that Nationwide will be prejudiced in any way by pursuing its rights in a declaratory action in state court or that a state court action will result in any delay for Nationwide to receive a declaration of its rights. Additionally, any action in state\n   court will apply the same substantive law that would be applied in the federal court diversity action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Ultimately, state courts are more than capable of resolving insurance coverage issues, like the one in this case. In fact, state courts are in the best position to resolve disputes that arise solely under state law. As such, litigating this matter is state court is clearly an alternative remedy to litigating this matter in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    (e) Balancing the Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Admittedly, the inconsistent application of the relevant factors by federal courts, paired with the splits of authority among panels of the Sixth Circuit on the proper application of the first, second, and fifth factors, make it difficult for litigants and the Court to determine whether federal jurisdiction should be exercised in a declaratory judgment action. It is particularly difficult in an admittedly close and complex case like this one. Still, at risk of sounding clich\u00e9, the Court must play the hand it was dealt and do its best to interpret the current state of the law. To that end, the Court must engage in a detailed and fact-intensive analysis and rely on the \"unique and substantial\" discretion granted to it by the Declaratory Judgment Act.\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/#p557\">\n    513 F.3d at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Here, as was previously discussed, most of the factors weigh against the exercise of federal court jurisdiction and in favor of dismissal. While the second factor weighs in favor of federal jurisdiction because the Court may settle the discrete issue of insurance coverage between the parties, there is a real possibility that the Court will be unable to resolve the ultimate, underlying dispute regarding the culpability of the Roark Agency for any material misrepresentation made on the application, meaning the first factor weighs against federal jurisdiction. Litigating this matter in state court will allow the entire matter, including any counterclaims or crossclaims against the Roark Agency, to be resolved in one court, which will \"promote[ ] efficiency, build[ ] trust in the legal system, and allow[ ] [the] parties to preserve resources.\"\n   <em>\n    Grange Mut. Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759058\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/565/779/#p786\">\n    565 F.Supp.2d at 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the third factor weighs against the exercise of federal jurisdiction because it appears that Nationwide's decision to file this declaratory action in state court on the same day that its attorney sent a letter to counsel for the Hattons informing them that they believed they were not obligated to provide coverage under the policy indicates that Nationwide made a strategic decision to race to the federal courthouse to file this declaratory action to preempt the Hattons' choice of forum. The fourth factor is neutral and could go either way. Finally, since the state court provides an alternate remedy through which Nationwide may seek a declaration of its rights under the policy, the fifth factor weighs against the exercise of jurisdiction. In sum, three of the five factors weigh against the exercise of federal court jurisdiction in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Still, the Court need not simply count the factors mechanically and go with the majority because there are practical considerations that also support declining to exercise jurisdiction. This matter is a routine insurance coverage dispute that will be resolved under the substantive law of the State of Kentucky. Because subject matter jurisdiction exists, this matter may proceed in federal court. Still, the Hattons attempt to assert two counterclaims against the Roark Agency, a Kentucky agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   If this action proceeds in federal court, it is possible that the Hattons will file a parallel action in state court that raises identical issues so that they may present their counterclaims against Roark in a single\n   action. As a result, there is a very real possibility of a race to judgment between the two actions that may result in inconsistent judgments. Furthermore, even if a parallel state action is not filed, it is possible that resolution of the insurance coverage dispute in federal court will still leave open the question of the culpability of the Roark Agency for any material misrepresentation in the insurance application. This possibility for additional or parallel litigation is inefficient and will be costly for all parties involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Alternatively, the state court may decide every issue, including any counterclaims and crossclaims involving the Roark Agency, and there is no indication that litigating in state court will cause Nationwide any prejudice or result in a delayed declaration of Nationwide's rights. Finally, while federal courts routinely apply state law in diversity actions like this one, the state court is in a better position to interpret and apply state law to the facts in this matter. Thus, from the perspective of practicality and efficiency, the state court is the better forum for this insurance coverage dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Moreover, the current absence of a parallel state court action, while relevant, is not dispositive. The Hattons are correct that numerous federal courts have declined to exercise jurisdiction in declaratory judgment actions when there was no parallel or underlying state court action filed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur.
