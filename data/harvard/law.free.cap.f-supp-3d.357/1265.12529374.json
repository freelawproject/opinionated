(Doc. 13-1 at 892; Doc. 15-1 at 1; Doc 14-1 at 4.) Knox was covered under a group policy of disability insurance issued by Defendant as part of RCRC's employee welfare benefit plan. (Doc. 15-1 at 1; Doc. 14-1 at 1.) The insurance plan provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Disability\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Disabled\n   </em>\n   mean that because of an Injury or Sickness, a significant change in Your mental or physical functional capacity has occurred in which:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   a) during the Elimination Period, You are prevented from performing at least one of the Material Duties of Your Regular Occupation on a part-time or full-time basis; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   b) after the Elimination Period, You are:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1. prevented from performing at least one of the Material Duties of Your Regular Occupation on a part-time or full-time basis; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   2. unable to generate Current Earnings which exceed 99% of Your Basic Monthly Earnings due to that same Injury or Sickness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   After a Monthly Benefit has been paid for 2 years,\n   <em>\n    Disability\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Disabled\n   </em>\n   mean You are unable to perform all of\n   the Material Duties of any Gainful Occupation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Disability is determined relative to Your ability or inability to work.

Sickness includes the donation of an organ in a non-experimental organ transplant procedure. (Doc. 13-1 at 130-133.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Prior to working for RCRC, Knox served as a senior pastor in Houston, TX and was also appointed by President Obama to serve as a member of the Advisory Council for the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. (Doc. 13-1 at 389-90.) He holds a Master's Degree in Divinity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 389. As CEO of RCRC, his \"regular occupation,\" Knox was responsible for implementing many of the goals of RCRC and managing key components of the organization, including its financial and funding programs, board relations and leadership, and public relations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152. Knox was \"integral in the fundraising, policy advocacy, national communications, and leadership and coordination of a diverse national board of directors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Knox worked as \"a fundraiser, educator, public speaker, conference leader, lobbyist and pastor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 390. Knox's occupation required him to travel frequently, approximately two to three weeks per month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To reduce costs, he sometimes traveled on multi-leg trips lasting several hours each way.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He traveled to Washington D.C. about thirty times each year for meetings and to testify before Congress, when he would often take trains and walk significant distances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He would carry educational materials and handouts in his luggage which often weighed more than twenty-five pounds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He would stand for hours when speaking with legislators, lobbyists, congressional staff, and the media.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He would give television and radio interviews about twice per month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   His position required excellent communication and public speaking skills, as well as strong analytical and cognitive abilities.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   He conducted trainings which could last two to three days each, served as a visiting minister at churches and synagogues once a month, attended rallies once a month, and often performed outreach services in other communities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It was normal for Knox to work ten to twelve-hour workdays.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He worked in an office about ten days per month, where he performed administrative tasks such as preparing and reviewing documents and speaking with board members and staff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 391.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Knox was diagnosed with HIV in 1986 and has received numerous treatment regimens over the years. (Doc. 13-1 at 327.) Knox has had AIDS for many years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He was able to work and function at a high capacity until approximately 2014 when he was diagnosed with essential tremors and also began having memory and anxiety problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Knox also was diagnosed with hypertension and has had depression since his teenage years, which had generally been managed by medication. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 327 &amp; 559.) After the onset of his hand and head tremors, Knox began experiencing cognitive and emotional difficulties, including increased irritability, increased depression, memory problems, sleep disturbances and insomnia, and difficulty concentrating and speaking. (Doc. 13-1 at 559-60.) Knox took a medical leave of absence beginning on November 15, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 559. In February 2016, Knox submitted a Short-Term Disability Claim Form to Defendant indicating that his disability began on January 28, 2016 and that he was first treated on January 28, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90. Dr. Mahmoud Mustafa listed Knox's sickness as HIV dementia and his symptoms as difficulty concentrating, poor memory, and poor comprehension.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94. Defendant paid Knox short-term disability benefits through the maximum duration of eleven weeks through April 27, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Meanwhile, on April 21, 2016, RCRC sent a Staff Performance Evaluation of Harry Knox to United for the period of January 2014 to June 2015. (Doc. 13-1 at 892). The evaluation was dated July 9, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Knox was rated with mostly 3s and 4s out of 5 and received positive and negative comments-negative comments included concerns that RCRC was \"not making significant or measurable progress\" in 2014, \"a need to improve routine communications\" in 2014, \"concerns about financial reporting,\" and concerns about \"conflicts between CEO and staff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 892-97. Knox stated during a neuropsychological evaluation that problems arose at work in 2013 when he \"hired a group of people who did not work well together\" and then had to fire those people and hire a new group of people.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 723. Staff then \"questioned his decision-making ability and memory issues\" and \"basically demanded that he leave.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Knox's employment was terminated on May 31, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As to the extent and cause of Knox's ailments, the facts are contested. While some people observed significant illness and cognitive decline in Knox, others found that he appeared to function normally. This could be because Knox \"has good days and bad days.\" (Doc. 13-1 at 724.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Two independent consultants to RCRC from August 2014 to December 2015 provided a declaration detailing their observations of Knox's performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 265.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   They state that while in 2014 Knox was \"a quiet yet charismatic leader, with creative ideas for the future of the organization, and a knack for seeing strategic opportunities,\" in 2015 he experienced a complete decline such that he could no longer serve as CEO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They state that in 2015, they observed Knox's memory and cognition deteriorate such that he forgot meetings and conversations, flew to Cleveland instead of Washington D.C. for an in-person meeting, and could no longer understand, let alone explain, RCRC's finances and programs to board members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He became \"easily disoriented and confused\" and even fainted on the way to at least two meetings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He would forget decisions that he had previously made and \"became less able to communicate his thoughts clearly.\" Id at 266. The consultants describe Knox's decline as \"heartbreaking\" and recommended that he take a medical leave \"as a graceful pathway to stepping down as CEO.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   There are other objective indicators that Knox's HIV had progressed by the time of his alleged disability. While a healthy person has a CD4 (T-cell count) of 500 cells/mm to 1,600 cells/mm, Knox's CD4 count was below 200 cells/mm at least since late 2015 despite taking anti-viral medications. (Doc. 13-1 at 204, 367-8, 373, 377.) Similarly, while a viral load count above 20 copies/ml indicates viral infection, Knox's viral load count in January 2016 was 584 copies/ml. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 372.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Nonetheless, Knox's health appeared to vary in 2016. At his January 28, 2016 appointment, Knox complained of depression, insomnia, that he had been \"really sick\" for 48 hours per week for the last six weeks, that he was coughing and sneezing a lot but was not sure if it was weather changes or allergies, and that movement made his symptoms worse. (Doc. 13-1 at 354.) Knox also inquired about going on long-term disability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Mustafa examined Knox and concluded that Knox had no nasal discharge or throat inflammation, that he had full range of motion, that his motor functions were normal and of full expected strength with no tremor, that his speech and comprehension were normal, that his recent and remote memory were intact, and that he had good judgment and ordered thought processes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 356. Dr. Mustafa found that Knox's HIV was \"stable\" and that he suffered from an \"unspecified mental disorder due to known physiological condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 358. In May and November 2015, Dr. Mustafa also found that Knox's HIV was \"stable\" and did not diagnose any specific cognitive disorder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 361 &amp; 363. However, in recommending that United place Knox on short-term disability, Dr. Mustafa stated that he had diagnosed Knox with HIV dementia in January 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Thereafter, in April 2016, Knox stated that he could drive and perform daily activities like gardening and housekeeping.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 723, 948. In June 2016, during a neuropsychological evaluation with United-retained Dr. DeFillipis, Knox stated that he went on medical leave in October 2015 due, at least in part, to his husband's spinal injury. (Doc. 13-1 at 723.) Knox's husband is \"almost fully disabled\" and has been out of work since 2007.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 726. The loss of Knox's income \"has been devastating.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 269. Dr. DeFillipis found that Knox \"did not present as being particularly depressed or anxious\" and \"[t]here was no indication of a thought disorder.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 727. Knox provided a transcript of an interview he had done on oral history which he thought showed his difficulty answering questions, but Dr. DeFillipis \"did not see any obvious signs\" that Knox had difficulty answering questions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. DeFillipis performed a number of tests on Knox and concluded that Knox was \"overreporting his cognitive and psychological problems, and there may be some conscious\n   embellishment of these symptoms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 728. In other areas, Dr. DeFillipis concluded that Knox performed well overall, had a \"high average IQ,\" did not have a memory or attention impairment, and that his mild weakness in processing speed was likely \"related to factors other than neurological issues .... most likely emotional issues and possibly the examinee's belief that he is cognitively impaired.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 732. Dr. DeFillipis also observed a mild tremor in Knox's left hand during the Finger Tapping Test, such that the test was stopped after four trials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 802. Dr. DeFelippis opined that Knox \"believes he is far more impaired than he actually is\" and that his perceived impairments were likely due to the problems he encountered in his last job and \"inability to maintain his position as a pastor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 734. Dr. DeFillipis did not see any evidence that Knox suffered from HIV dementia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. DeFillipis concluded that Knox may benefit from psychotherapy but that therapy would not be necessary to perform the tasks of his previous work position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On July 18, 2016, United denied Knox's application for long-term disability benefits, concluding that based on the documents provided by Defendant, physicians, and RCRC, Knox was not disabled and not entitled to long-term disability benefits. (Doc. 13-1 at 753-757.) United noted that it had asked Dr. Mustafa to provide any agreement or rebuttal to Dr. DeFillipis' report, but Dr. Mustafa did not respond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 755, 790. Knox appealed the denial in January 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1007-1009.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Knox obtained additional reports and documents to support his appeal. Nurse Practitioner Lori Tomlinson who had been managing Knox's AIDS in Georgia since May 2016 wrote that three months after giving Knox anti-viral medications, his CD4 count remained at 125, which was \"clinical evidence of significant disease progression.\" (Doc. 13-1 at 198.) Ms. Tomlinson wrote that Knox \"remains immunocompromised\" and that his appearance and walk are that of a much older man, that he needs a cane to walk, and that he appears as someone who is \"very fragile.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She has consistently observed his arm and hands tremor as someone with Parkinon's disease and has also observed clinical signs of cognitive decline consistent with AIDS-related dementia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She observed that his speech was slow, he could not remember words, often lost his train of thought, and could not remember recently prescribed medication even with the help of his partner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She opined that he could not perform any job that required mental acuity and that his immune system was so depleted that he was \"at high risk for infection which for him could prove fatal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 199. She found Knox's presentation credible and \"consistent with his advanced AIDS disease process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Similarly, a vocational expert's report prepared in April 2017 opined that Knox's limitations \"will preclude work in his usual occupation or any other occupation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 394.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Dr. Eisa, who became Knox's treating neurologist in Georgia, found that Knox suffered from a \"mild cognitive impairment\" which would interfere with his ability to perform his job. (Doc. 13-1 at 411.) Dr. Eisa also found that Knox had an abnormal brain MRI which indicated that his hippocampus had atrophied to \"just 52% of normal size,\" consistent with AIDS-related dementia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Eisa said this would affect his memory and cognitive functioning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Eisa also observed lesions on Knox's brain which would cause tremors and affect Knox's motor skills, and that the increase in lesions showed \"that his disease is progressing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 412. Dr. Eisa concluded that Knox's \"reported symptoms and impairments are genuine,\" that Knox was \"unable to work through an 8 hour day in any capacity on a reasonable\n   basis,\" and that his condition was \"likely to deteriorate over time consistent with the known disease process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 413.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") and its medical consultant, Dr. Schiff, concluded that Knox had cognitive decline due, at least in part, to his subcortical HIV dementia and that his MRI scan was abnormal and indicated disease progression. (Doc. 13-1 at 422-23.) Dr. Schiff described Knox's impairment of Symptomatic HIV as \"severe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 423.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Similarly, Knox's husband, C. Michael Bozeman, describes a severe decline in Knox's abilities as of 2017. (Doc. 13-1 at 268.) Although Bozeman was severely injured in a car wreck in 2007, he states that the roles have been reversed and he now takes care of Knox.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bozeman writes that Knox can no longer remember names, telephone numbers, or the car door combination though they have owned the car for years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He writes that Knox is not allowed to drive because he gets lost easily in the small town they moved to in South Georgia to be near their families.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Knox no longer attends church, will not go to stores alone, often forgets his wallet and keys, and has to be encouraged to eat, bathe, and get out of bed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 268-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   United also received another neuropsychological report dated December 5, 2016 which indicated \"impairment in the areas of visual and sustained attention, fine motor speed, and complex problem-solving.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1007-1008. United concluded that Knox was disabled beginning December 5, 2016 due to those observed cognitive deficits, but that he could perform the requirements of a sedentary occupation and would only need restrictions from prolonged standing or walking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1007. United concluded that because his cognitive deficits were not detailed or apparent prior to that date, he was not continuously disabled since the time he asserted his disability began in January 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   United noted that MRI results did not support a diagnosis of dementia and that Dr. Stoute did not see evidence showing hippocampal atrophy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   United concluded that the denial of Knox's claim for long-term disability benefits should, therefore, be upheld.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   United informed Knox's attorney on June 8, 2017 that the denial was upheld.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Pursuant to the insurance plan, Knox was disabled if:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (1) because of a Sickness, \"a significant change in [his] mental or physical functional capacity\" occurred, such that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (2) during the Elimination Period, he was \"prevented from performing at least one of the Material Duties of [his] Regular Occupation on a part-time or full-time basis;\" and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (3) after the Elimination Period, he was also \"prevented from performing at least one of the Material Duties of Your Regular Occupation on a part-time or full-time basis; and unable to generate Current Earnings which exceed 99% of [his] Basic Monthly Earnings\" due to that same Sickness. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 13-1 at 130.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As to the first prong, the Court is persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence that Knox suffered a significant change in his mental and physical functional capacity because of his HIV/AIDS. The evidence is undisputed that Knox had HIV and that his CD4 and viral counts were so\n   significantly different from that of a healthy person that his health was severely impacted at least by the time he claimed his disability began in January 2016. (Doc. 13-1 at 204, 367-8, 372-73, 377.) Dr. Mustafa also noted specific physical and mental decline during 2015, which included: \"impaired attention\" in March 2015 and depression and inability to make decisions in May 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 361-62, 365. The declaration of consultants who worked directly with him in the two years before he was fired was demonstrative: Knox had clearly suffered such a significant deterioration of his physical and mental capacity that he would literally faint while walking to meetings and be confounded by basic information essential to his job.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 265.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court must next determine whether Knox was unable to perform at least one of the Material Duties of his Regular Occupation during and after the Elimination Period. The Elimination Period is, in this case, the 90 days after he applied for short-term disability on January 28, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 13-1 at 111.) The Court finds persuasive the conclusions of Vocational Expert Dian Haller (Doc. 382-97) and finds that Knox's regular occupation consisted of managing the organization and fundraising, which required complex intellectual analysis, strong problem-solving skills, public speaking, mild physical demands, and fine motor skills.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 125; 391-394. The physical limitations alone rendered Knox \"not capable of performing the material duties\" of his job, and combined with the cognitive impairments, \"preclude[d] work in his usual occupation or any other occupation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 394.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although United argues that Knox's mental status exams were normal until December 2016 (Doc. 15-1 at 29-31), the record shows otherwise. While it is not entirely clear how well Knox previously responded to his anti-viral medications, by 2015, Knox's body was resistant to the medication as his CD4 count remained low throughout 2015, 2016, and into 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 198, 327, 329, 335, 338-39, 342, 355, 359, 363. This, along with his other symptoms, were consistent with significantly progressive degeneration from AIDS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 198-99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The mental challenges Dr. Mustafa noted in the first half of 2015 persisted during and after the elimination period. By the fall of 2015, the consultants who had previously admired Knox's work recommended that Knox go on short-term medical leave and eventually step down.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 266. There is little evidence of Knox's condition in the first three months of 2016 because Knox was on leave and then moved to Georgia. However, that Dr. Mustafa did not describe specific symptoms of cognitive deterioration in Knox's final two appointments is not determinative- Dr. Mustafa in fact stated that Knox had a \"mental disorder due to known physiological condition,\" which could certainly be interpreted consistently with his express diagnosis in January 2016 that Knox had HIV dementia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 353, 358, 94. Then, in May 2016, Knox met with Ms. Tomlinson for AIDS management and described similar, ongoing symptoms, including fatigue, anxiety, depression, weakness, and short-term memory loss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 328.

The subsequent MRIs on July 12, 2016 and October 4, 2016 clearly showed abnormalities on Knox's brain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 411. Several doctors observed lesions, or \"white matter,\" on Knox's brain representing microvascular ischemia which could contribute to memory loss and cognitive decline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 388, 411, 562, 572. The MRIs revealed \"disease progression\" and new lesions over time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although Dr. DeFillipis opined that Knox perceived himself to be more disabled than he actually was,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   numerous doctors and experts found Knox's presentation credible and concluded that he was genuinely suffering from AIDS-related dementia, e.g., Dr. Mustafa, Dr. Eisa, Ms. Tomlinson (and Dr. Saurina), Vocational Expert Haller, Dr. Sass, Dr. Yasin, and Dr. Schiff (along with the SSA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 198, 384-88, 394-97;\n   <em>\n    Otero v.

Sass and Yasin. (Doc. 13-1 at 557-75, 1007.) The seventeen-page report detailed a host of cognitive and physical limitations: low average motor function in right hand and mildly impaired in left hand, tremor in hands and head, sustained visual attention not within normal limits, ability to problem-solve mildly to moderately impaired, severe depression, mild to severe anxiety, emotional and physical symptoms consistent with a longstanding diagnosis and management of HIV, and confusion with verbal memory abilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 565-573. The report indicated that there was no apparent symptom exaggeration and was valid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 566, 571. Drs. Sass and Yasin concluded that while it was possible that Knox suffered from HIV-related dementia and/or microvascular ischemic changes of the brain because his symptoms of depression, tremors, and decreased cognitive functioning were consistent with those disorders, they diagnosed Knox with \"Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder,\" Major Depressive Disorder, and HIV Infection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 572-73. They stated that given his decreased cognitive functioning, emotional distress, and essential tremor, Knox could not likely return to his prior occupation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 573-74. Although United persistently argues that \"plaintiff's condition had changed by November 2016,\" the Court is unpersuaded, based on the record, that a degenerative disease like AIDS suddenly manifested into a disability in November 2016 but at no time prior.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 13-1 at 413.) The report was consistent with a November 22, 2016 evaluation indicating that Knox's physical demand level was \"below sedentary to disabled.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 384. The report was consistent with Dr. Eisa's June 2016 opinion that Knox's tremors were so bad that he could not eat and his July 19, 2016 conclusion that Knox \"definitely has cognitive decline.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 385. It was consistent with Dr. Mustafa's diagnosis of \"unspecified mental disorder\" in January 2016 and symptoms of poor memory and poor concentration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60, 94. In fact, the report was consistent with Knox's husband's and coworkers' observations and his own repeated complaints of memory loss, difficulties with comprehension and communication, and overall physical and cognitive deterioration in 2015 and 2016 such that he was unable to continue working as CEO of RCRC in January 2016. Finally, no one disputes and the record further shows, that Knox was unable to generate current earnings after the elimination period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 130. Accordingly, the Court finds on\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review that United's decision that Knox was not disabled was wrong. The Court concludes that Knox was disabled during and after the elimination period as defined in United's insurance policy and is due long-term disability benefits pursuant to that policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Horton v.

However, Defendant argues that the case must be remanded because it was not able to determine whether Plaintiff was disabled from \"any gainful occupation\" after the initial twenty-four months of his disability and nor able to determine if disability benefits should be capped based on its policy pertaining to mental disorders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 17 at 18-19.) Defendant cites as authority another order issued in the Middle District of Georgia where the district judge ordered defendant to pay the \"own\n   occupation\" benefits and remanded to defendant to determine whether plaintiff was disabled from \"any occupation,\" tolling any applicable statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

Not only does no doctor state that Knox suffered a stroke, but the record shows that Knox's tremors and numbness had occurred most often in his left hand before the summer of 2016.
