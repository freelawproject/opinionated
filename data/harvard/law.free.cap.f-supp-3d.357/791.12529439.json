BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In September 2011, Valero Energy Corporation (\"Valero\") purchased an oil refinery (\"the Refinery\") in Meraux, Louisiana from Murphy, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (\"APA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-2. The following year, on July 22, 2012, a fire occurred at the Refinery's Crude Unit, causing extensive structural damage. After investigating the matter, Valero concluded that the fire was caused by various acts and omissions that Murphy had committed prior to the APA's closing. In November of that same year, the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), informed Valero that it would seek to impose penalties on Valero for violations of the Clean Air Act based on the July fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In December 2012, Valero sent Murphy a letter demanding that Murphy indemnify Valero for the full amount of damages it had sustained (and would sustain in the future) in connection with the July fire, including any EPA penalties related to that fire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-4, p. 4. In that same letter, Valero described various additional violations of environmental law that its investigation had uncovered, accusing Murphy of having made material misrepresentations or omissions about those violations to Valero during the sale of the Refinery, and demanding that Murphy indemnify it for the various damages and penalties that it had suffered (or expected to suffer) as a result.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7. The letter's demands were explicitly premised on the APA's indemnity provision,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 3, which states in relevant part that Murphy will indemnify Valero for \"any and all damage, loss and expense ... actually suffered by [Valero] to the extent arising out of: (i) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty; ... or (iii) any Retained Liability,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-2, p. 85, \u00a7 13.02(a);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 30, \u00a7 2.04(f) (defining \"Retained Liabilities\" to include \"the Retained Environmental Liabilities,\" which are defined in \u00a7 1.01(a) to include a wide variety of \"liabilities and obligations arising under Environmental Law to the extent arising from the ownership or operation of [the Refinery] prior to Closing....\"). Valero's letter concluded by informing Murphy that it expected its total indemnification claims to exceed $ 52,000,000, demanding a response within ten business days, and threatening to file a lawsuit before the end of 2012 unless an agreement to toll the statute of limitations could be reached before then.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-4, p. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Murphy promptly notified its insurer, Liberty, of Valero's claims against it, and asked Liberty to provide Murphy a defense under the commercial general liability (\"CGL\") policy that Murphy had purchased from it (\"the Policy\"). Liberty declined to do so, contending that it had no duty under the Policy to defend Murphy\n   against Valero's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-7, pp. 1, 30-33. At a general level, Liberty's justifications were twofold. First, no lawsuit had actually been filed yet. Second, and regardless of the first, the policy did not provide coverage for this type of claim. Murphy disagreed with both justifications, and continued apprising Liberty of developments in its negotiations with Valero over the next several years, as the two oil companies attempted to resolve their dispute outside of court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docs. 30-9, 30-10, 30-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ultimately, Murphy and Valero were unable to resolve their dispute, and on February 7, 2017, Valero filed a one-count complaint against Murphy for breach of contract in New York state court (\"the New York Lawsuit\"), claiming damages in excess of $ 25,000,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-3. Murphy again requested a defense from Liberty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-8. In November 2017, Liberty again refused, denying that it had any duty to provide one. So the following year, Murphy filed the instant lawsuit against Liberty in this Court, seeking a declaratory judgment and damages for breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1. Among other things, Murphy's Complaint asks this Court to declare that the Policy requires Liberty to provide Murphy a defense against Valero.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The Complaint also asks this Court to order Liberty to pay for that defense and to reimburse Murphy for the defense costs that Murphy has already incurred.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Murphy and Liberty have filed cross-motions for summary judgment against each other. Those motions have been extensively briefed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Note 1,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and on December 18, 2018, this Court received oral argument on them. Both motions are now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

However, there is also an exception to this exclusion, stating that \"[t]his exclusion does not apply to liability for damages: (1) [t]hat the insured would have in the absence of the contract or agreement; or (2) [a]ssumed in a contract or agreement that is an 'insured contract', provided the 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' occurs subsequent to the execution of the contract or agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Murphy contends that although technically Valero's claim against it is a claim for breach of contract, in substance it is really just a tort liability that Murphy would have in the absence of the APA's limitation-of-liability clause (which requires Valero to bring any and all of its Refinery claims against Murphy as contract actions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-2, pp. 89-90, \u00a7 13.08). Therefore, Murphy argues, there is a possibility of coverage under the Policy's \"absence of the contract\" exception, and Liberty accordingly has a duty to defend Murphy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Both parties have identified three Arkansas Supreme Court cases that govern the core issues here:\n   <em>\n    Unigard Sec.

The answer probably lies in\n   <em>\n    Columbia\n   </em>\n   's procedural posture. A group of homeowners sued a company called Arkansas Infrastructure, Inc. (\"Al\") for breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6791916\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/491/135/\">\n    2016 Ark. 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6791916\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/491/135/\">\n    491 S.W.3d at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The homeowners had hired Al to construct foundation pads in accordance with an engineering firm's designs and specifications, but Al allegedly failed to follow those designs\n   and specifications, resulting in extensive damage to the foundations and structures that were subsequently erected on the pads.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 137-38. Al's insurer under its CGL policy initially provided a defense in that case, but also filed a separate lawsuit in federal court, seeking a determination of whether the policy provided coverage for liability in the underlying lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 138. The federal court eventually certified two questions to the Arkansas Supreme Court regarding the policy's exclusions and definition of \"occurrence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 137, 138. That certified case was\n   <em>\n    Columbia.\n   </em>\n   But then after accepting certification, the Arkansas Supreme Court declined to answer either certified question, holding that they were \"moot\" because the policy provided no coverage for contract liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 137. In doing so, the\n   <em>\n    Columbia\n   </em>\n   court not only issued a ruling that was inconsistent with the certifying federal court's prior ruling that there was a duty to defend (and therefore at least the possibility of coverage),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 143 (Danielson, J., dissenting), but it answered a question it had not been asked, on the basis of an inadequate record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 134 (Danielson, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This Court is unable to reconcile the reasoning and holdings of\n   <em>\n    Fidelity\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Columbia.\n   </em>\n   The former case explicitly looked to an exception to an exclusion to find the possibility of coverage in a CGL policy for a contractual liability. The latter case explicitly held that CGL policies can never cover contractual liabilities, regardless of what exceptions to exclusions they may contain. This Court can only conclude that if the Arkansas Supreme Court were confronted with the instant issues (on a complete record), it would simply have to explicitly overrule either\n   <em>\n    Fidelity\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Columbia.\n   </em>\n   Since this Court must pick between them, it will accept\n   <em>\n    Fidelity\n   </em>\n   and reject\n   <em>\n    Columbia\n   </em>\n   for two reasons. One reason is that,\n   <em>\n    Fidelity\n   </em>\n   , unlike\n   <em>\n    Columbia\n   </em>\n   , was issued on the basis of a complete record and on a question that was properly before it. The other reason is that,\n   <em>\n    Fidelity\n   </em>\n   , unlike\n   <em>\n    Columbia\n   </em>\n   , is consistent with the following two common-sense and well-established propositions under Arkansas law. First, an insurance policy should be interpreted in a way that gives meaningful effect to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of its provisions (including its exclusions and exceptions).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

And second, if an insurance policy says in an exception to an exclusion that it provides coverage for certain kinds of contracts, then that insurance policy\n   <em>\n    means\n   </em>\n   that it provides coverage for certain kinds of contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Unigard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1604799\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/331/211/\">\n    331 Ark. at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1604799\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/331/211/\">\n    962 S.W.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The provisions of an insurance contract are to be interpreted by the court in the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms and cannot be construed to contain a different meaning.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   But this does not mean Murphy wins.

Indeed, the\n   <em>\n    Fidelity\n   </em>\n   court explicitly distinguished its case from\n   <em>\n    Unigard\n   </em>\n   on those grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1155529\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/353/834/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1155529\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/353/834/\">\n    at 843-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1155529\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/353/834/\">\n    120 S.W.3d 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But as already mentioned, Murphy does not contend that its APA with Valero is an \"insured contract.\" And\n   <em>\n    Fidelity\n   </em>\n   had nothing to say about the particular type of exception on which Murphy is presently hanging its hat: the aforementioned \"absence of the contract\" exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This Court finds the instant facts strongly analogous to those in\n   <em>\n    Unigard.\n   </em>\n   True, the instant case involves a\n   <em>\n    sale\n   </em>\n   of land from Murphy to Valero while\n   <em>\n    Unigard\n   </em>\n   involved the return of\n   <em>\n    leased\n   </em>\n   land from Murphy to Blakely. But the gravamen of the claims on which Blakely prevailed is essentially identical to those which Valero is presently prosecuting: that Murphy provided property to the aggrieved party that was in much worse condition than Murphy falsely represented it to be, and that Murphy breached contractual obligations in doing so. As in\n   <em>\n    Unigard\n   </em>\n   , Valero's claims do not arise from the\n   property damage itself, but rather from Murphy's alleged false representations and alleged failure to honor its promise to provide Valero property that met certain agreed-to standards of regulatory compliance and good condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The big difference between the instant case and\n   <em>\n    Unigard\n   </em>\n   is that the instant Policy contains an exclusion stating that it \"does not apply to ... 'property damage' for which [Murphy] is obligated to pay damages by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract or agreement,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-5, p. 22, \u00a7 I.2(b), and an exception to that exclusion for \"liability for damages ... [t]hat [Murphy] would have in the absence of the contract or agreement,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1155529\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/353/834/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 l.2(b)(1). Per\n   <em>\n    Fidelity\n   </em>\n   , these provisions certainly must be taken into account and interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the rest of the Policy. But they do not operate to\n   <em>\n    expand\n   </em>\n   coverage beyond what it would have been if there were no exclusions at all; exceptions to exclusions simply \"have the effect of restoring coverage that would otherwise have been lost via the exclusion, in much the same way that a double negative is a positive.\" 17A COUCH ON INSURANCE \u00a7 254:13 (3d ed. Dec. 2018 Update).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whatever the Policy means by \"liability for damages ... that [Murphy] would have in the absence of the contract or agreement,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is not referring to anything that would not have qualified in the first place as liability for \"property damage\" that \"is caused by an 'occurrence.' \" And per\n   <em>\n    Unigard\n   </em>\n   , the types of claims that Valero is making against Murphy do not so qualify, because they are not premised on property damage; rather, they are premised on damages arising from false representations and from failures to deliver what was bargained for.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At any rate, and even setting\n   <em>\n    Unigard\n   </em>\n   aside, the \"absence of a contract\" exception's language plainly is not describing Valera's claims. To whom would Murphy have been liable for property damage in the absence of the APA? To itself? Certainly not to Valero, since the APA is the vehicle through which Valero obtained the Refinery in the first place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   And although Murphy can make a fair argument that the EPA might have imposed regulatory penalties\n   on it even in the absence of the APA, this misses the more fundamental point that regulatory penalties are regulatory penalties-not \"sums that [Murphy] becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ... 'property damage.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-5, p. 21, \u00a7 I.1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Simply put, whether one comes at the matter from\n   <em>\n    Columbia\n   </em>\n   , from\n   <em>\n    Unigard\n   </em>\n   , or from\n   <em>\n    Fidelity\n   </em>\n   and the plain language of the claimed exception, there is no possibility of coverage under the Policy for Valero's claims against Murphy. And the conclusion is the same regardless of whether one considers Valero's claims as formulated in its December 2012 demand letter or as formulated in the complaint initiating its New York Lawsuit. Those documents' gravamen and theories of liability are identical.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-3\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30-4.

It seems to the Court that by this request, Murphy is essentially asking it to assume the absence not of the entire contract, but rather only of the APA's indemnity and limitation-of-liability clauses. But this is inconsistent with the plain language of the exclusion and exception at hand. The Policy excludes coverage for obligations to pay property damages that are incurred \"by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract or agreement.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 30-5, p. 22, \u00a7 l.2(b).
