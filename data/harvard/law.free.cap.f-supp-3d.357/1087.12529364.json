These motions present one main issue: whether, under Washington state law, the parties' insurance contract contains an enforceable appraisal provision or an unenforceable binding arbitration provision. Defendants argue the provision at issue here requires appraisal, this requirement is enforceable, and the Court must dismiss the complaint because it fails to allege Plaintiff complied with this requirement. Plaintiff argues the provision at issue here requires binding arbitration, this requirement is unenforceable, and the Court must grant partial summary judgment declaring this requirement void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court held a hearing on these motions on January 8, 2019.

According to the\n   <em>\n    James River\n   </em>\n   court, \"this phrase demonstrates the legislature's intent to protect the right of policyholders to bring an original 'action against the insurer' in the courts of this state.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20P.3d%20118\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the\n   <em>\n    James River\n   </em>\n   court reasoned, \"the limited 'jurisdiction' provided in [an action reviewing an arbitration award], would frustrate the legislature's intent because ... binding arbitration agreements deprive our state's courts of the jurisdiction they would normally possess in an original action by depriving them of the jurisdiction to review the\n   <em>\n    substance\n   </em>\n   of the dispute between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20P.3d%20118\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the\n   <em>\n    James River\n   </em>\n   court held \" RCW 48.18.200 prohibits binding arbitration agreements in insurance contracts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20P.3d%20118\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court is bound by\n   <em>\n    James River\n   </em>\n   's holding and reasoning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The appraisal provision involved in\n   <em>\n    Keesling\n   </em>\n   is similar to the one here.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20P.2d%20622\">\n    520 P.2d at 623-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 8-1 at 12. But here, the provision includes the following additional language that raises the specter of binding arbitration: \"If there is damage or loss to your aircraft and we cannot agree with you on the amount of the loss, we\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   use the following procedure to\n   <em>\n    settle\n   </em>\n   the disagreement: ... [e]ither you or we can request in writing that the dispute be submitted to\n   <em>\n    arbitration\n   </em>\n   ....\" ECF No. 8-1 at 12 (emphasis added). Like the provision involved in\n   <em>\n    James River\n   </em>\n   , the above-quoted language deprives Washington state courts of original jurisdiction over the substance of the parties' insurance dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=292%20P.3d%20118\">\n    292 P.3d at 120, 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike the provision involved in\n   <em>\n    Keesling\n   </em>\n   , the above-quoted language is self-executing because it establishes a mandatory settlement procedure that is triggered when a disagreement arises over the amount of loss, that decisively ends the dispute while foreclosing state courts' authority and control over its ultimate disposition, and that functions as a prerequisite to any possible legal action in state courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20P.2d%20622\">\n    520 P.2d at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The provision here is problematic because it requires more than a mere advisory appraisal process. Indeed, the provision compels a form of binding arbitration that includes appraisal to guide the mandatory settlement procedure. Under that procedure, Washington state courts' involvement is limited to the time period after an appraisal award has already been made and is limited to deciding whether the appraisal award should be accepted as conclusive or rejected as the product of mistake, arbitrary or capricious action, or fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this way, the provision deprives\n   state courts of original jurisdiction over the substance of the underlying insurance claim. Considering all, the Court concludes the provision at issue here is an unenforceable binding arbitration provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff states an adequate claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because the provision at issue here is void and unenforceable under state law, Plaintiff need not allege it complied with that provision. Therefore, Plaintiff states an adequate claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

But Defendants have failed to identify specific facts establishing a genuine dispute of material fact for trial.
