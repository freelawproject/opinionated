Ocwen's Handling of Plaintiffs' HAMP Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2007, Plaintiffs financed their joint purchase of a condominium with a thirty-year $ 151,050 note secured by a mortgage. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 24; Doc. 11-1 at 2-3. Although both Plaintiffs were on the title and signed the mortgage agreement, only Saika signed the note. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 6; Doc. 11-1 at 2, 14. In 2013, Ocwen became Plaintiffs' loan servicer. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6 7. Plaintiffs authorized Ocwen to automatically debit their bank account $ 690.17 every two weeks, which resulted in payments some $ 200.00 more per month than their monthly mortgage obligation, then $ 1,180.34.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After Saika was laid off in 2014, she and Shakibai applied to Ocwen for a loan modification. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13. On December 3, 2014, Ocwen sent Plaintiffs a TPP agreement, which required them to make four monthly trial period payments of $ 627.62 in January, February, March, and April 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. Because the monthly TPP payments were much less than their existing mortgage payments, Plaintiffs asked Ocwen about the automatic biweekly $ 690.17 debit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. Ocwen responded that Plaintiffs did not need to do anything for the automatic debit to be changed to reflect the TPP payment amount.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 19 at 2. But instead of adjusting the automatic debit to reflect the TPP payment amount, Ocwen debited $ 690.17 on December 8, 2014, and then $ 685.20 (changed to reflect an escrow adjustment that reduced the pre-TPP monthly payment to $ 1,170.40) every two weeks thereafter. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 19-20. As a result, Plaintiffs paid the entire amount required by the TPP (and then some) by January 20, 2015; despite this, the biweekly $ 685.20 debits continued throughout (and beyond) the four-month TPP period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 20, 27. Indeed, Plaintiffs remained current on their pre-TPP monthly mortgage payments throughout the modification process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 26, 2015, Ocwen informed Plaintiffs that they were eligible for a \"Home Affordable Modification.\" Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6 21. Enclosed with Ocwen's letter was a \"Modification Agreement\" addressed only to Saika.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 17 (listing only Saika as a \"Borrower\"). The Modification Agreement contemplated several adjustments to the loan: the principal balance would become $ 127,006.77; the interest rate would fall from 6.5% to 2% until April 2020 and thereafter would not exceed 3.625%; the maturity date was extended to June 1, 2051; and the monthly payment, effective May 1, 2015, would be $ 627.02.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23-25;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 18. The Modification Agreement required all persons on the title or the Loan Documents-a term defined to include the mortgage agreement and the note,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 17-to sign and return the Agreement, and provided that Ocwen would not be bound to the Agreement if that requirement was not satisfied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 17-19, 22. The Agreement further provided that the loan would not be modified until Saika received a copy countersigned by Ocwen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Saika returned the Modification Agreement to Ocwen on February 9, 2015 with only her signature, and Ocwen never countersigned. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 42;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 21-22. Instead, Ocwen continued to automatically debit $ 685.20 biweekly from Plaintiffs' bank account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. When Plaintiffs inquired about halting the automatic debit, Ocwen responded that doing so would prevent approval of the loan modification and instructed them to keep the debit in place.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, 40. In April 2015, without notifying Plaintiffs, Ocwen began placing their mortgage payments in a suspense account rather than crediting them toward the loan balance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 49. Under the mortgage agreement, Ocwen could hold payments in a suspense account only if the payments were \"insufficient to bring the loan current.\" Doc. 11-1 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In late April 2015, even though Plaintiffs remained current on their loan payments, Ocwen sent Plaintiffs a delinquency notice and a letter informing them that their April 2015 loan payment was outstanding. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. Ocwen continued to send Plaintiffs monthly statements and delinquency notices that did not reflect the modified loan terms or Plaintiffs' automatic payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. Ocwen also represented the loan as delinquent to credit reporting agencies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition to inquiring about the automatic debit, Plaintiffs repeatedly wrote Ocwen to ask about the status of their account and of the loan modification. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6 36. Ocwen assured Plaintiffs that it was working to update their account to reflect the terms of the Modification Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. But on October 13, 2015, Ocwen sent Plaintiffs a letter denying the modification on the grounds that the \"loan had been reinstated\" and that therefore they no longer \"appear[ed] to be in need of modification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 41-42. Following Plaintiffs' request for further information, Ocwen wrote on December 4, 2015 that because \"the account remained current or in good standing during and after the TPP, Ocwen was unable to complete the permanent modification of the account with [Fannie Mae].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 46-47. According to Ocwen, Fannie Mae did not allow modification of mortgage loans with \"less than a full three (3) full [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] month delinquency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. Although Ocwen initially held mortgage payments made after January 2015 in a suspense account, making the account appear delinquent, on June 12, 2015 it applied the balance of the suspense account, $ 7,029.71, to bring the loan current, which (according to Ocwen) led Fannie Mae to deny modification because the account appeared current.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 49-51. Ocwen notified Plaintiffs in a second October 13, 2015 letter that, effective November 1, 2015, it would transfer servicing of the loan to Nationstar Mortgage, LLC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Despite having told Plaintiffs on October 13, 2015 that their loan had been reinstated, Ocwen sent Plaintiffs a delinquency notice October 23, 2015 describing the account as delinquent since February 2, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42, 44-45. The notice listed $ 1,170.40 owing for May 2015 and $ 1,164.93-which had become Plaintiffs' monthly payment following another escrow adjustment effective June 1, 2015-owing\n   for each month from June through October 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 39, 44. In December 2015, Ocwen admitted to Plaintiffs that on October 15, 2015, it moved all payments they made since February 1, 2015, totaling $ 10,444.79, from the loan account to a suspense account, but stated that it could no longer make any adjustments to the account because servicing rights had been transferred to Nationstar.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47, 51-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Despite Plaintiffs' efforts to resolve their delinquency and pursue a loan modification, Nationstar brought a foreclosure suit in October 2016. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 53-56; Doc. 11-2. A default judgment of foreclosure and sale was entered in May 2017. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6 59; Doc. 19-1 at \u00b6 2. After Plaintiffs' unsuccessful attempt to vacate the default, Saika filed for bankruptcy and Plaintiffs ultimately entered into a TPP and loan modification agreement (effective November 1, 2017) with Nationstar. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 61, 64-65; Doc. 11-2 at 9-10. Under that agreement, Plaintiffs' new principal balance was $ 146,848.34, with a 4% interest rate, resulting in monthly payments of $ 613.74 through the new maturity date of November 1, 2057. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 66-67. After executing the modification agreement, Nationstar dismissed the foreclosure suit and the court vacated the default judgment, Doc. 19-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, but not before Plaintiffs retained an attorney and paid expenses in connection with the bankruptcy petition, Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 57, 62-63; Doc. 19-1 at \u00b6 4. Plaintiffs were also assessed attorney fees that their condominium association incurred as a defendant in the foreclosure suit. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6 58; Doc. 11-2 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs bring two state law claims, alleging that: (1) Ocwen breached the Modification Agreement by failing to implement the loan modification contemplated by the Agreement; and (2) Ocwen engaged in unfair practices in violation of the ICFA after they applied for a modification. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 70-86. In seeking dismissal, Ocwen argues that the Modification Agreement is not an enforceable contract, that the ICFA claim alleges only breach of contract, and that its conduct did not proximately cause Plaintiffs' alleged injuries. Doc. 11 at 9-15. (At the motion hearing, Doc. 23, Ocwen withdrew a preclusion argument based on the foreclosure judgment, Doc. 11 at 5-9, so that argument will not be addressed.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Breach of Contract Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As noted, Plaintiffs allege that Ocwen breached the Modification Agreement by failing to implement the terms of the Agreement after Saika signed and returned it to Ocwen. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 70-76. Under Illinois law, a breach-of-contract plaintiff must allege: \"(1) the existence of a valid and enforceable contract; (2) substantial performance by the plaintiff; (3) breach of contract by the defendant; and (4) resultant injury to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Avila v.

Yet by continuing to debit Plaintiffs the pre-TPP biweekly payment and warning that halting the automatic debit would imperil their loan modification request, Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, 40, Ocwen undermined the TPP's role in the HAMP-providing an affordable bridge between the preexisting and modified loan terms-and violated HAMP directives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corvello v.

Indeed, Fannie Mae's HAMP servicing guidelines mandated that TPP payments be more affordable than the payments that had led the borrower to the brink of foreclosure: \"For mortgage loans where the servicer has determined that the borrower's monthly payment is in imminent default, the payment during the [TPP] must be less than the contractual monthly payment in effect prior to the [TPP].\" Fannie Mae,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 456.

Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17, 25, 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Ocwen made matters worse by telling Plaintiffs that their HAMP modification had been denied\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   they followed its instructions to maintain the pre-TPP biweekly debits and thereby remained current on their pre-TPP payment obligations. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6 47 (alleging that Ocwen explained that because \"the account remained current of in good standing during and after the TPP, Ocwen was unable to complete the permanent modification of the account with the investor of the loan ... Fannie Mae\"). And that denial is suspect even on its own terms, as Fannie Mae's HAMP servicing guidelines allow loan modifications where, as here, an account is current.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fannie Mae,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 395, 451 (noting that accounts may be \"current\" but also in \"imminent default\"). But rather than notify Plaintiffs that remaining current on their pre-TPP loan payments might jeopardize their eligibility for a modification, Ocwen encouraged the automatic biweekly debits for months after the TPP was complete, stretching Plaintiffs financially while (ironically) weakening their case for a modification. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 27, 30. Additionally, by forcing Plaintiffs to pay more per month than was required under both the TPP and the pre-TPP mortgage, and then declining a modification, Ocwen inflicted substantial injury for ICFA unfairness purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516373\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/992/#p1002\">\n    885 F.3d at 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Newman also has alleged substantial injury [because] MetLife induced her to pay a premium ... at a rate greater than she would otherwise have paid [absent the misrepresentation].\");\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=266%20Ill.%20Dec.%20879\">\n    266 Ill.Dec. 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=775%20N.E.2d%20951\">\n    775 N.E.2d at 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a consumer \"compelled to pay an unreasonable amount ... in excess of what she [had] ... agreed to pay\" suffered \"substantial harm\" under the ICFA) (describing\n   <em>\n    Ekl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=165%20Ill.%20Dec.%20760\">\n    165 Ill.Dec. 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 585 N.E.2d at 163 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Given the breadth and depth of their factual allegations, Plaintiffs have pleaded unfair conduct.

At best, Ocwen's argument addresses injuries arising\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the default judgment entered in May 2017; the conduct resulting in that judgment and the subsequent bankruptcy could not have caused injuries that Plaintiffs already had suffered, including months of excess loan payments, runarounds, and delays that at least contributed to the initiation of foreclosure proceedings and Plaintiffs' ultimate entry into modified loan terms less favorable than those that would have been available from Ocwen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Camasta v.
