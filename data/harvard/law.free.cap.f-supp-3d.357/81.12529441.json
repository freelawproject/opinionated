In early 2013, a private\n   school hired Lee Kennedy Co., Inc. (\"LKC\"), a construction contractor, to construct their new gymnasium. LKC hired a subcontractor to construct the gymnasium floor. However, the subcontractor's workmanship allegedly resulted in deficiencies with the floor that LKC ultimately corrected. LKC now brings this suit against Arch Insurance Company (\"Arch\") claiming entitlement to coverage under the Arch Contractor Controlled Insurance Program policy (\"the Policy\") for the costs LKC incurred to fix the floor deficiencies caused by the subcontractor's work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Arch's\n   <em>\n    Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   [# 25] seeks summary judgment on both the breach of contract (Count I) and declaratory judgment (Count III) claims, and LKC's\n   <em>\n    Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   [# 32] seeks summary judgment on the declaratory judgment claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Arch's\n   <em>\n    Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   [# 25] is ALLOWED and LKC's\n   <em>\n    Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   [# 32] is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.

That section excludes from coverage \" '[b]odily injury' or 'property damage' for which the insured is obligated to pay damages by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract or agreement.\" O'Donnell Aff.

In sum, this court finds no ambiguity in the Policy language and enforces the contract according to its express terms, which provides no coverage for contract liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    2. Adjudication as a Threshold Condition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nor can LKC establish that coverage for the costs it incurred in repairing the gymnasium floor in the absence of the contract, as it cannot show that it in the absence of the contract it has \"\n   <em>\n    become\n   </em>\n   legally obligated to pay [those costs] as damages\" (emphasis added). Because LKC fixed the Project's defective flooring without \"any adjudication of [LKC's] liability in any civil or arbitration proceedings, or even the entry into a settlement agreement with the School,\" LKC cannot establish that it was legally obligated to pay the amounts (but for the contract) and therefore cannot force Arch to cover the voluntary payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Two recent cases cited by Arch undermine LKC's contrary argument. In\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit held that a third-party's demand letter to the appellant was not the functional equivalent of a suit and did not trigger appellee's duty to defend.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12171750\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/37/#p42\">\n    843 F.3d at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One year later, in\n   <em>\n    Salvati\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit reviewed the language of an insurance policy in which the insurance company agreed to \"pay on behalf of any Insured those sums in excess of the Primary Insurance that any Insured becomes\n   legally obligated to pay as damages.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276723\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/40/#p45\">\n    855 F.3d at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After the appellant reached a settlement with the defendants and their primary insurers, the appellant sought to recover the amounts exceeding the primary policy limits from the defendants' excess insurer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276723\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/40/#p45\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276723\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/40/#p45\">\n    . at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Whereas an insurer's obligation to defend is measured by the allegations of the underlying complaint, a duty to indemnify \"arises only after the insured's liability has been established and is between the insurer and the insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson v. Citation Ins.

The duty to indemnify must be \"determined by the facts, which are usually established at trial\" or from a settlement.\n   <em>\n    Travelers Ins. Co. v. Waltham Indus. Labs.

Mass. 2015) (\"[A] declaratory judgment is not yet ripe for consideration regarding the duty to indemnify where, as here, the underlying action has not determined liability or adjudicated factual disputes.\"). Collectively, these cases stand for the general proposition that a contractual obligation to defend or indemnify must be preceded by a formal adjudication to determine liability and/or damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Without a formal adjudication of the facts, an insurance company is left without a process to determine whether indemnification is required and if so, the proper amount to reimburse the insured. Such is the case here: when Kenvo failed to properly install the flooring, the Architect sent to LKC a \"Letter of Non-Compliance,\" which required specific performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O'Donnell Aff. Ex. O at 2 [# 28-15]; Health Aff. Ex. 2 at 2 [# 34-3]. LKC performed accordingly. During the remediation process, LKC noted that the school also requested a design change in the flooring in addition to LKC fixing Kenvo's work. O'Donnell Aff. Ex. Q at 2 [# 28-17]. Although LKC reported to Arch that there would be discussions with the Winsor School regarding the school paying a portion of the design change and repair, there is no evidence before this court that suggests that the Architect, the Winsor School, or Kenvo agreed to pay a portion of the design change. Without formal adjudication of the costs, Arch has no way of ascertaining what remedial work should be covered under the Policy, if any, and what financial costs LKC may have unilaterally agreed to assume.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   III.
