The Court of Appeals opined that \"[a]lthough a description of fasteners only appears in the 'finished goods kit' scope exclusion, the 'finished goods kit' language informs what may constitute a fastener in the context of the scope of the antidumping duty order as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1279.\n   <em>\n    Meridian III\n   </em>\n   also held that Commerce correctly had concluded in the Final Scope Ruling that the Type B handles were not excluded from the Orders by operation of the finished goods kit exclusion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1281.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although it reversed the holding in\n   <em>\n    Meridian I\n   </em>\n   as to the general scope language and, accordingly, vacated the judgment in\n   <em>\n    Meridian II\n   </em>\n   sustaining the Remand Redetermination,\n   <em>\n    Meridian III\n   </em>\n   did not hold that the Final Scope Ruling necessarily was in accordance with law. Specifically, the Court of Appeals did not sustain the Department's determination in the Final Scope Ruling that the finished merchandise exclusion did not apply to the Type B handles. As the Court of Appeals explained: \"Because it is unclear from the record before Commerce and the statements made by Meridian's counsel in its reply brief and at oral argument before this court whether the Type B handles are fully and permanently assembled at the time of entry, we remand for Commerce to clarify this point.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1281-82 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The uncertainty the Court of Appeals identified as to whether the Type B handles are imported in assembled or unassembled form is understandable, in particular because the Final Scope Ruling itself can be read to be inconsistent on this issue. At one place in the document, Commerce stated that \"the record is undisputed that the aluminum extrusion parts are not fully and permanently assembled with non-aluminum extrusion parts at the time of entry.\"\n   <em>\n    Final Scope Ruling\n   </em>\n   13. Because Commerce made this statement in describing \"Meridian's products,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , it is possible, but not certain, that Commerce intended to describe not only the Types A and C handles, which consist entirely of a\n   fabricated aluminum extrusion, but also the Type B handles, which do not. Nevertheless, in the next paragraph Commerce, again referring to all three types, referred to \"the fact that the products at issue are ready for use 'as is' at the time of importation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This statement indicates that Commerce may have considered the Type B handles to have been imported in assembled form. The Court of Appeals was aware of this inconsistency as it appeared in the Final Scope Ruling, and elsewhere in the record, and expressly cited the statement in the Scope Ruling Request describing a Type B handle as \"an assembly of the middle handle bar extrusion piece plus two plastic injection molded end caps at each end.\"\n   <em>\n    Meridian III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516922\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/1272/\">\n    890 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1281 n.8 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The finding in the Final Scope Ruling that \"the aluminum extrusion parts are not fully and permanently assembled with non-aluminum extrusion parts at the time of entry\" was the reason Commerce gave for concluding that Meridian's handles, including the Type B handles, did not qualify for the finished merchandise exclusion.\n   <em>\n    Final Scope Ruling\n   </em>\n   13. As the Court of Appeals implicitly recognized, this rationale cannot suffice if the Type B handles are fully and permanently assembled at the time of entry. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Meridian III\n   </em>\n   directed that \"[i]f Commerce determines that the Type B handles are imported unassembled, then its original scope ruling controls and the inquiry ends\" and that \"[i]f Commerce determines the Type B handles are imported fully and permanently assembled, then we direct Commerce to address the question of whether the Type B handles are excluded from the scope of the antidumping and countervailing duty order as 'finished merchandise.' \"\n   <em>\n    Meridian III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516922\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/1272/\">\n    890 F.3d at 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court addresses each of these possibilities below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Should Commerce determine, based on substantial record evidence, that the Type B handles are entered in fully assembled form, then it must determine the applicability of the finished merchandise exclusion to the Type B handles in conformity with\n   <em>\n    Meridian III\n   </em>\n   (as that decision requires), but it also must do so in conformity with another decision of the Court of Appeals. A precedential decision, issued the day after\n   <em>\n    Meridian III\n   </em>\n   , interpreted the scope language of these same Orders in considering an appliance door handle that is highly similar to the Type B handle. In this subsequent opinion, the Court of Appeals held that \"[w]ith respect to the exclusions from the Order's scope ... the exception for fasteners unambiguously applies only to the finished goods kit exclusion and not to the finished merchandise exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Whirlpool Corp. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516925\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/1302/#p1311\">\n    890 F.3d 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1311 (Fed.

The fasteners exception in the finished goods kit exclusion \"informs what may constitute a fastener in the context of the scope of the antidumping duty order as a whole\" when the question is whether a good falls within the general scope language, i.e., the language apart from the specific exclusions.\n   <em>\n    Meridian III\n   </em>\n   , 890 F.3d at 1279. But the fasteners exception properly may not be construed to limit the applicability of the finished merchandise exclusion.\n   <em>\n    Whirlpool\n   </em>\n   , 890 F.3d at 1311. Therefore, in order to comply with the holding of\n   <em>\n    Whirlpool\n   </em>\n   , Commerce may not reach a determination that the finished merchandise exclusion is inapplicable on the ground that some or all of the non-aluminum-extrusion components of a Type B handle are considered by Commerce to fall within the meaning of\n   the term \"fasteners.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whirlpool\n   </em>\n   , 890 F.3d at 1311 &amp; n.4. Rather, as required by the express terms of the finished merchandise exclusion, Commerce must determine that the Type B handles are not within the scope of the Orders if they are found to be \"finished merchandise containing aluminum extrusions as parts that are fully and permanently assembled and completed at the time of entry.\"\n   <em>\n    AD\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   , 76 Fed. Reg. at 30,651 ;\n   <em>\n    CVD\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   , 76 Fed. Reg. at 30,654.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Should Commerce validly determine, based on substantial record evidence, that the Type B handles are entered in unassembled form, the \"original scope ruling controls.\"\n   <em>\n    Meridian III\n   </em>\n   , 890 F.3d at 1282. But in that event, another issue requires clarification. The court considers the Final Scope Ruling to be unclear as to whether Commerce would consider the entire unassembled Type B handle, or only the extruded aluminum center component, to be merchandise that is subject to the Orders. If Commerce concludes that the Type B handles are entered in unassembled form, it must clarify this point in its new redetermination and in doing so must address the scope language providing that \"[t]he scope does not include the non-aluminum extrusion components of subassemblies or subject kits.\"\n   <em>\n    AD\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   , 76 Fed. Reg. at 30,651 ;\n   <em>\n    CVD\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   , 76 Fed. Reg. at 30,654.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The same lack of clarity would affect the Final Scope Ruling even if the Type B handle were considered to be in assembled form at the time of entry yet somehow still be considered by Commerce to be within the scope of the Orders. Should Commerce decide in its new redetermination that the Type B handle is in assembled form at the time of entry yet is still within the scope of the Orders, Commerce in explaining such a decision would need to clarify whether it is the extruded aluminum component or the entire handle that Commerce considers to fall within the scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION AND ORDER III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In conformity with the mandate of the Court of Appeals, upon consideration of all papers and proceedings had herein, and upon due deliberation, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Department's March 2016 Remand Redetermination be, and hereby is, vacated; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce shall file, within ninety (90) days of the date of this Opinion and Order, a new determination upon remand (\"Second Remand Redetermination\") that determines, according to substantial evidence on the administrative record, whether Meridian's Type B handles are fully and permanently assembled at the time of entry; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that if Commerce determines, based on substantial evidence on the administrative record, that the Type B handles are fully and permanently assembled at the time of entry, it shall determine whether the Type B handles qualify for the \"finished merchandise\" exclusion, shall do so consistently with the holdings of\n   <em>\n    Meridian III\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Whirlpool\n   </em>\n   , and shall provide an explanation of its reasoning; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that if Commerce determines, based on substantial evidence on the administrative record, that the Type B handles are in unassembled form at the time of entry, or if it otherwise determines that the Type B handles are within the scope of the Orders, it shall determine whether the Type B handles in the entirety, or only their extruded aluminum components, are within the scope of the Orders; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that plaintiff, plaintiff-intervenor, and defendant-intervenor may file comments on the Second Remand Redetermination within thirty (30) days from\n   the date on which the Second Remand Redetermination is filed; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that defendant may file a response to the comments within fifteen (15) days from the date on which the last comment is filed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The scope language in both orders is essentially the same.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Aluminum Extrusions from the People's Republic of China: Antidumping Duty Order\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C650\">\n     76 Fed.
