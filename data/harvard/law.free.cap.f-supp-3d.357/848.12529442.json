ROSE, JUDGE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, [ECF Nos. 33; 35]. The parties requested a hearing on their motions, but the Court finds that the issues can be resolved without it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LR 7(c). The parties' motions have been fully submitted and are ready for a decision. For the reasons set out below, the motions are DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Rockwell Collins, Inc. (the \"Company\") is a publicly owned company that produces communication and aviation electronic solutions for both commercial and government applications. [ECF No. 35-1 \u00b6 1].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant hired Plaintiff Jennifer\n   Holladay as an assembly operator at its Coralville, Iowa, plant on May 29, 2007, where she was employed until her termination on July 21, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2; [ECF No. 34-1 \u00b6 52]. While employed with the Company, Plaintiff was a member of the collective bargaining unit at the Coralville plant represented by Local Union No. 1634 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (\"Local 1634\"). [ECF No. 35-1 \u00b6 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant and Local 1634 were parties to a collective bargaining agreement (the \"CBA\") effective from May 4, 2013, through May 4, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Article XX of the CBA governs leaves of absence. It states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   All leaves of absence shall be requested in writing and approved or disapproved in writing by the COMPANY. A request for leave of absence in writing is required for all absenteeism extending beyond three (3) consecutive days. Except as stated below, leaves of absences for sudden and unforeseen illness or accident, shall be granted automatically to seniority employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Section 1.\n    <em>\n     Illness or Accident\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : Employees who are absent because of unforeseen illness or accident must apply for formal leave in writing as soon as practical.... Adequate proof must be presented by the employee, or a member of the employee's family on his/her behalf, that it was physically impossible for the employee to contact the COMPANY for consideration of a leave of absence or no automatic leave may be assumed and the employee shall be deemed to be absent without authorization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Any employee, who is known to be ill, supported by satisfactory evidence, will be granted a [medical leave of absence] automatically, provided he/she complied with the above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [ECF No. 36 at 5]. The excerpt of the CBA in the record does not state the consequences of failing to follow the procedures in Article XX. Likewise, the excerpt does not explain what constitutes \"[a]dequate proof\" that an employee could not contact the Company, the form of written leave for approval, or how to determine whether a request for leave has been made \"as soon as practical.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties submitted several of Defendant's business records detailing policies that appear to, collectively, set out Defendant's leave of absence policy. The \"Coralville Operations Attendance Policy\" states that \"[a]bsences beyond 3 consecutive working days without an approved leave of absence are considered a voluntary quit (AWOL).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. In the case of unforeseen medical absences, a \"Medical Absences-Roles &amp; Responsibilities\" policy instructs employees to: (1) \"[n]otify your\n   facilitator of your absence\"; (2) \"[p]rovide a doctor's statement with the length of absence to your facilitator for proper coding of absence\"; and (3) \"[i]f you are unable to return to work on the 4th day, a doctor's statement is required by the beginning of the 4th day.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. For medical absences exceeding three consecutive days, employees must \"[c]ontact Health Services to initiate a medical leave of absence (MLOA).... A doctor's statement or completed Accident &amp; Sickness [form]... must be received by Health Services or your facilitator by the beginning of the fourth day to excuse your absence and initiate your medical leave.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The parties agree these two policies were in place at the Coralville facility during the relevant time, but Plaintiff argues the evidence in the record is insufficient to determine whether Defendant actually followed these policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 37-2 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a member of Local 1634 (a \"Collective Bargaining Employee\") Holladay received and assented to a \"Medical Leave of Absence Checklist.\" [ECF No. 35-1 \u00b6 7]. For medical absences exceeding three consecutive days, Collective Bargaining Employees are instructed to \"[c]ontact your Health Services ... and provide a medical statement ... from your physician no later than the start of your shift on the fourth day.... Failure to comply will result in you being AWOL (Absent without Leave), and will be terminated.\" [ECF No. 36 at 13]. The medical statement must contain: (1) the nature of the illness or injury; (2) the name of the employee's health care provider; (3) the date and time the employee last worked; (4) the expected date of return (if known); and (5) the name of the employee's supervisor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The checklist stresses that \"[p]hone calls are appreciated and are a courtesy, but not considered an approved leave of absence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This point is further emphasized in a summary of the checklist, which states that a Collective Bargaining Employee \"calling into their Manager or Health Services is NOT considered an Approved Medical Leave of Absence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. It adds, \"if a [Collective Bargaining Employee] does NOT have the proper medical leave of absence statement from their Doctor to Health Services by the start of the employee's shift on the 4th day, the employee is considered AWOL ... and will be terminated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Charles Holder, the business manager of Local 1634, testified in a deposition that the policy set out in the Medical Leave of Absence Checklist was consistently followed at the Coralville Plant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff took leave under the Family Medical and Leave Act (\"FMLA\" or \"the Act\") in 2012 and 2015 for her own serious health condition. [ECF No. 35-1 \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 18-19]. She also took approved FMLA leave in 2014 to care for one of her parents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b616-17. On June 20, 2016, Plaintiff submitted to Defendant an \"FMLA Request Form\" for her own serious health condition. [ECF No. 36 at 19-21]. She described the condition as \"recurrent migraines which are sporadic,\" and indicated that the dates on which she would require leave were unknown.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. On June 29, 2016, Plaintiff submitted to Defendant a \"Certification of Health Care Provider for Employee's Serious Health Condition\" in support of her request for FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-26. Plaintiff's physician, Dr. Ann Soenen, completed the certification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. Dr. Soenen described Plaintiff's condition as \"intractable migraines\" and indicated she would \"need to attend follow-up treatment appointments or work part-time or on a reduced schedule.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25. She estimated that this reduced schedule would consist of one or two hours per day, one day per week, from June 16, 2016, through December 16, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. Dr. Soenen also estimated that, over the subsequent six months, Plaintiff would suffer\n   from flare-ups two-to-three times per month, and would be incapacitated for one-to-two days per episode.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant approved Plaintiff's FMLA request in an \"FMLA Designation Notice\" dated June 29, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. The notice approved Plaintiff for intermittent FMLA leave for her migraines for \"1 to 2 hours per day for 6 months and for flare ups 2 to 3 times per month; up to 2 days in duration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Designation Notice instructed Plaintiff that \"[i]f you are approved for flare ups, you must designate your leave as FMLA or [sic] any time you call in, otherwise your absences may count against the absence/attendance policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It also stated, \"[i]f the absence(s) will be greater than 3 consecutive days regarding your own health condition, a medical leave of absence is required.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Once the Company provides an employee with a Designation Notice that his or her FMLA leave is approved, that employee may identify an absence as FMLA leave by submitting a \"Family Medical Leave Absence Identification Form\" (\"FMLA Absence Form\") to his or her supervisor. [ECF No. 35-1 \u00b6 26]. On that form, the employee lists the appropriate absence code, the date of the absence, and the amount of hours that should be treated as FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 36 at 31]. The FMLA Absence Form states that it should be completed and returned to the employee's supervisor for processing \"within 2 business days of your return or receiving your designation letter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant states that its \"sole requirement\" for designating an absence as FMLA leave is the submission of the FMLA Absence Form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 39 at 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   From June 30, 2016, through July 15, 2016, Plaintiff was absent for all or part of eight work days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 35-1 \u00b6 35]. She took FMLA leave on June 30 (two hours), July 5 (eight hours), July 13 (eight hours) and July 14 (eight hours).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Other absences during this period included one full vacation day and two full sick days for a non-FMLA-related illness.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff was absent from work beginning Monday, July 18, 2016, and continuing through July 21, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. The parties agree that, on each of those days, Plaintiff left a voicemail in the early morning for her supervisor, Kathy Kooyman, to report her absence from work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 37-2 \u00b6 36]. However, the parties disagree as to any other details Plaintiff provided in those voicemails. In her deposition, Plaintiff testified that she said in her July 21 voicemail, \"I had a migraine and I would not be in that day.\" [ECF No. 36 at 100-01]. In a subsequent affidavit, Plaintiff repeated her assertion as to the content of the July 21 voicemail, but added that \"[o]f the voicemails I left between July 18 and July 20, I recall having specifically mentioned my migraine in one or two of the messages.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   According to Defendant, Plaintiff never specified migraines, and only stated she would be absent due to either an \"illness\" or \"doctor's visits.\" [ECF No. 35-1 \u00b6 36]. Kooyman testified in a deposition that she \"write[s] down in a steno book when somebody calls in and what they leave.\" [ECF No. 36 at 115]. In connection with Plaintiff's\n   absences on July 18-21, Kooyman wrote, \"ill/out,\" \"ill out,\" \"DR,\" and \"DR,\" respectively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63. Plaintiff disagrees that these notes are determinative as to what Plaintiff said in the voicemails. Plaintiff observes that Kooyman testified during her deposition that she would write down what employees say in the voicemails \"without too much description.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115. When asked directly if Plaintiff mentioned \"migraine or headache at all\" in the voicemails, Kooyman testified that she did not recall.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   By the scheduled start of her shift at 6:00 a.m. on July 21, Plaintiff had not submitted a doctor's note for her absences on July 18-21. [ECF No. 35-1 \u00b6 39]. At 7:35 a.m. on July 21, Plaintiff called the Company's Health Services Department and spoke to Nurse Kerry Much.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Plaintiff asked Much if she could wait to submit a doctor's note for her absences until the next day, but Much advised her that a note was due \"now.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At 9:25 a.m. that morning, Defendant's Health Services Department received doctor's notes regarding Plaintiff's absences on July 18-21.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. One note indicated that Plaintiff was seen for treatment on July 18, and stated that she could return to work on either July 19 or July 20. [ECF No. 36 at 62]. The second note, signed by Dr. Soenen, asked that Plaintiff be excused from work on July 20 and July 21 \"due to illness,\" and stated that she could return to work on July 22.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61. Neither note specified the illness for which Plaintiff missed work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Meanwhile, at approximately 8:00 a.m., Kooyman contacted Alisha Pedersen, a labor and employee relations specialist with Defendant's Human Resources Department. [ECF No. 35-1 \u00b6 43]. Kooyman told Pedersen that Plaintiff had been absent three consecutive days and had not submitted a doctor's note prior to the start of her shift on the fourth day of absence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pederson passed this information on to Charles Holder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After submitting her doctor's notes, Plaintiff called Kooyman.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff inquired on the call about her job status but did not state on the call that she intended to designate her absences on July 18-21 as FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-48. Plaintiff denies that she asked about her job status during that call, but does not deny that she failed on the call to state an intention to designate her absences as FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 37-2 \u00b6\u00b6 47-48].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Later on July 21, Pedersen sent an email to Amy Clefisch, an employee relations manager at the Company, and Mike Miller, a human resources business partner, informing them of Plaintiff's absences on July 18-21 and her failure to submit a doctor's note by the start of her shift on July 21.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 36 at 41]. She recommended that Plaintiff be terminated based on Article XX of the CBA and the Coralville Operations Attendance Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Clefisch and Miller approved the proposed termination later that afternoon.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. It is undisputed that, prior to Plaintiff's termination, Pedersen, Clefisch, and Miller were unaware of the June 29,\n   2016 Designation Notice granting Plaintiff intermittent FMLA leave for her migraines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 38-1 \u00b6\u00b6 28-51].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Later that day, Pederson and Holder called Plaintiff to notify her that her employment was terminated because \"she did not follow established procedures regarding medical absences and attendance.\" [ECF No. 35-1 \u00b6 49]. Defendant also alleges that at no point on the call did Plaintiff say her absences on July 18-21 qualified as FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. Plaintiff disputes this fact, noting that Holder testified during his deposition that he did not remember if Plaintiff \"was asked for any explanation\" on the call \"or if she volunteered one.\" [ECF No. 36 at 85]. Plaintiff received a termination letter dated July 21, 2016, which explained, \"Per Article XII Section 5 Termination of the IBEW 1634 contract with Rockwell Collins, your seniority and employment shall terminate if an employee is absent beyond three (3) consecutive working days without an approved leave of absence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. The letter said that Plaintiff was absent on July 18 and failed to report to work at the start of her shift on July 21.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The record does not include a copy of Article XII of the CBA, nor do the parties discuss in their briefs the relevance of this provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On July 22, 2016, Local 1634 filed a grievance on Plaintiff's behalf. [ECF No. 35-1 \u00b6 52]. Defendant denied the grievance that same day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. The denial, prepared by Kooyman, stated that Plaintiff was terminated for violating Article XX of the CBA, the Medical Absences-Roles and Responsibilities policy, and the Coralville Operations Attendance Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 36 at 35]. The union did not appeal the denial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 36 at 35].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on October 19, 2017, by filing suit in the Iowa District Court for Johnson County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 1-1]. Plaintiff asserted that Defendant interfered with her rights under the FMLA and, separately, retaliated against her for taking FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. Defendant removed to this Court on November 22, 2017. [ECF No. 1]. On April 11, 2018, the Court denied Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 22]. Thereafter, the parties stipulated that Plaintiff's claim \"is a claim of interference with her substantive rights by denying the exercise of or attempt to exercise her rights under the [FMLA].\" [ECF No. 30]. The parties completed discovery and filed the instant motions. Defendant seeks summary judgment in its favor on the merits, thus concluding this case. Plaintiff seeks summary judgment on the issue of Defendant's liability only, thus limiting any subsequent trial to the issue of Plaintiff's damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF Nos. 33 at 2; 34 at 14].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II.

Although that may be the case for absences of up to three consecutive days, Plaintiff's June 29, 2016 FMLA Designation Notice states, \"[i]f the absence(s) will be greater than 3 consecutive days regarding your own health condition, a medical leave of absence is\n   <em>\n    required.\n   </em>\n   \" [ECF No. 36 at 27] (emphasis added).

Thus, a doctor's note is a condition of receiving FMLA leave for absences of four or more consecutive days. Similarly, Defendant states that its \"sole requirement for designating [Plaintiff's] absence as intermittent FMLA leave was her submission of an [FMLA Absence Form].\" [ECF No. 39 at 4]. But if the absence exceeded three consecutive days,\n   Plaintiff needed to submit a doctor's note in order to remain employed long enough to submit the FMLA Absence Form. Indeed, Defendant does not specify when precisely Plaintiff should have submitted her form in light of her swift termination from the Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Thus, to the extent Plaintiff otherwise provided notice of her need for FMLA leave-and the Court has already found there is a genuine factual dispute as to this issue-Defendant was required to give her at least fifteen calendar days to comply with a request for a doctor's note.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.308\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant's requirement that Plaintiff submit a doctor's note by the start of her shift on the fourth consecutive day of absence clearly conflicts with this standard and violates FMLA regulations.

Defendant does not assert that Plaintiff violated any other of Defendant's notice or procedural requirements for granting leave. Therefore, if Plaintiff stated in her voicemails to Kooyman on July 18-21 that she was to be absent on account of her migraines, that notice would not be deficient for her failure to submit a doctor's note by the start of her shift on July 21.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Even if the doctor's note element of Defendant's leave of absence policy cannot be viewed as a recertification request, uncertainty remains as to the interaction between FMLA leave and Defendant's leave of absence policy.

First, Defendant argues that the notice was inadequate because \"the period of absence-four consecutive days-significantly differed from the absences authorized in her Certification and the intermittent FMLA leave she had previously taken pursuant to this Certification.\" [ECF No. 38 at 10]. Plaintiff's certification stated that she would need a\n   reduced schedule of one or two hours per day, one day per week, for a period of six months; and that she would suffer from flare-ups two-to-three times per month, for one-to-two days per episode.

The Court disagrees with Defendant that\n   <em>\n    Chappell\n   </em>\n   should be extended to cover situations where the duration of an employee's absence, rather than the reason therefore, conflicts with the certification. FMLA regulations prescribe the redress available to employers in such situations and offer an example that is substantially similar to the facts of this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (a) 30-day rule. An employer may request recertification no more than every 30 days and only in connection with an absence by the employee, unless paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section apply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (c) Less than 30 days.

For example, if a medical certification stated that an employee would need leave for one to two days when the employee suffered a migraine headache and the employee's absences for his or her last two migraines lasted four days each, then the increased duration of absence might constitute a significant change in circumstances allowing the employer to request a recertification in less than 30 days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.308\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (c). The regulations thus contemplate that, when an employee seeks FMLA leave at a frequency, or for a duration, that is inconsistent with his or her certification, the employer may seek recertification.

The\n   <em>\n    Ballato\n   </em>\n   court found that the defendant was not liable for FMLA interference because the plaintiff \"was not fired [on the day he sought FMLA leave]\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   he still had the responsibility to clarify the situation, request FMLA leave, or show up for his subsequent shifts.\"\n   <em>\n    Ballato\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755984\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/768/#p772\">\n    676 F.3d at 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Further, the plaintiff could have avoided those actions altogether by showing up for his subsequent shifts. In contrast, adverse employment action had already been triggered under Defendant's leave of absence policy by the start of Plaintiff's shift on July 21. It is true that the Eighth Circuit observed that the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Ballato\n   </em>\n   failed \"to contest the [termination] decision or otherwise inquire why he had been unable to request his FMLA leave\" after receiving a termination letter, but this observation cannot be separated from the broader circumstances of that case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755984\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/768/#p772\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755984\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/768/#p772\">\n    at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But one of the Eighth Circuit's key findings in reaching its decision in\n   <em>\n    Bacon\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the instant case. The Eighth Circuit's holding was premised, in part, on the fact that the call-in policy at issue was permissible under FMLA regulations allowing an employer to \"require an employee on FMLA leave to report periodically on the employee's status and intent to return to work.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5742203\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/711/#p715\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5742203\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/711/#p715\">\n    at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.309\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2008) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other courts have premised similar decisions on the permissibility of the policies giving rise to an employee's termination.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Callison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1594182\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/430/117/#p121\">\n    430 F.3d at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that there was no interference with FMLA rights where the employee was required to follow an employer's call-in policy, in part because the policy did not conflict with substantive provisions of the FMLA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In contrast, and as already discussed, Defendant's leave of absence policy conflicts with the FMLA's recertification regulations to the extent Plaintiff notified Kooyman in her voicemails that her absences were due to migraines. Thus, like the notice issue, the issue of Defendant's unrelated reason for terminating Plaintiff turns on the content of Plaintiff's July 18-21 voicemails. If Plaintiff attributed her absences to migraines, Defendant's leave of absence policy impermissibly required\n   Plaintiff to provide a doctor's note sooner than the fifteen day-period prescribed by the FMLA regulations. In that case, Defendant cannot rely on the policy as an unrelated basis for Plaintiff's termination. If, however, Plaintiff did not cite her migraines in the voicemails, the undisputed evidence in the record shows Defendant terminated Plaintiff on the basis of its leave of absence policy, not Plaintiff's exercise of her rights under the FMLA. Notably in this regard, the record shows-and the parties do not dispute-that when the relevant individuals decided to terminate Plaintiff's employment with the Company, they were unaware that she had been approved for intermittent FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 38-1 \u00b6\u00b6 28-51].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   A factual dispute remains as to the content of Plaintiff's July 18-21 voicemails.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, [ECF Nos. 33; 35] are DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The facts are derived from the parties' joint appendix of materials submitted in support of their motions, along with their respective statements of material facts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    To this and numerous other facts asserted by Defendant in its statements of material facts, [ECF Nos. 35-1; 38-2], Plaintiff responded by stating \"Plaintiff disputes the contention there is a material fact to admit or deny. This fact has no relevance to [Plaintiff's] entitlement to FMLA benefits, Rockwell's denial of those benefits, or a lawful reason for termination while attempting to utilize FMLA leave.\"\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , [ECF No. 37-2 \u00b6 1]. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)(1) provides that \"[a] party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by\" either citing to materials in the record, showing that the materials cited by an adverse party do not \"establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\" A party may also \"object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). This provision, however, is concerned with the admissibility of evidence that purportedly supports a fact, not the fact itself. Thus, Rule 56(c) focuses on whether particular facts are disputed; it does not allow a party to challenge a fact on the grounds of its relevance, except where the underlying evidence is inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 402. The Court does not find Plaintiff's general reference to a fact's relevance to be a challenge to the admissibility of the underlying evidence. \"If a party ... fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the court may ... consider the fact undisputed for the purposes of the motion.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2). The Court finds that, where Plaintiff provided only the answer excerpted above to Defendant's asserted facts, Plaintiff failed to properly address those facts under Rule 56(c). As a consequence, the Court will treat those facts as undisputed for the purposes of the parties' motions for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Defendant points out that Plaintiff did not submit her FMLA Absence Form for her July 5 absence until July 11.
