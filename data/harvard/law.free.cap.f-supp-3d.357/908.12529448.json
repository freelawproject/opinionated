For reasons explained below, the motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 1, 2016, Plaintiff Jesse Jiles was involved in an automobile accident with Defendant Scott Stafford, who at the time was driving a truck owned by\n   Defendant Schuster Co. Plaintiff originally brought this action in Missouri state court, asserting claims of negligence, negligent entrustment, and negligent hiring and supervision. (Doc. # 1-1, pp. 2-7). The case was then removed to this Court on the basis of diversity. (Doc. # 1, p. 1). In their Amended Joint and Separate Answer, Defendants assert as an affirmative defense that \"[p]ursuant to [Mo. Rev. Stat.] \u00a7 303.390, Plaintiff was an uninsured motorist at the time of the accident and is therefore barred from collecting non-economic damages from the insured.\" (Doc. # 22, \u00b6 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants now move for partial summary judgment, invoking\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20303.390\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 303.390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to bar Plaintiff from claiming and recovering noneconomic damages. (Doc. # 26, p. 3). It is undisputed that Plaintiff was an uninsured driver at the time of the accident, that Plaintiff's prior automobile insurance policy had lapsed over nine months before the time of the accident, and that Defendants were insured at the time of the accident. (Doc. # 25, pp. 1-2; Doc. # 27, pp. 2-3). Plaintiff's main argument against partial summary judgment is purely legal: Defendants are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of noneconomic damages because the express language of \u00a7 303.390 would prohibit Plaintiff from recovering noneconomic damages and thus would violate his right to a jury trial under the Missouri Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Anticipating that \"Plaintiff's only argument will be that he did not need to comply with the statute\" because it violates his rights under the Missouri Constitution, Defendants argue that \u00a7 303.390 is consistent with the Missouri\n   Constitution. (Doc. # 26, p. 6). In particular, Defendants anticipate Plaintiff's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   and distinguish it from the present case. (Doc. # 26, pp. 8-9). Plaintiff argues that \u00a7 303.390 violates Missouri's constitutional right to jury trial because it is analogous to the statute that the Supreme Court of Missouri struck down in\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   for violation of the Missouri constitutional right to jury trial.

The language in \u00a7 303.390 expressly limits a jury's determination of noneconomic damages. Precedent laid out by Missouri's highest court compels a finding that this limitation violates Missouri's constitutional right to a trial by jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7127288\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/376/633/#p642\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant argues that the primary deficiency that the\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   court identified in the statute it struck down-limiting damages \"for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   medical malpractice claims, regardless of the circumstances of each case\"-does not exist in \u00a7 303.390, which \"applies not to the entire cause of action, but only to claimants who failed to maintain requisite insurance coverage when filing suit against a defendant who did maintain that insurance coverage.\" (Doc. # 28, p. 3) (emphasis in original). Defendant argues that \u00a7 303.390 does not act as a mere cap on \"damages for all claims under a particular common law cause of action.\" (Doc. # 28, p. 3). According to Defendant, \u00a7 303.390\"by its terms ... acts as a waiver of a portion of recoverable damages in a particular claim ....\" (Doc. # 28, p. 3). Defendant argues that the\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   holding \"does not overrule the Missouri Legislature's right to abrogate a cause of action cognizable under common law completely.\" (Doc. # 28. p. 2) (citing\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7127288\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/376/633/#p642\">\n    376 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   642-43 ;\n   <em>\n    DeMay v.

In other words, Defendant argues that \u00a7 303.390 establishes a waiver, which does not violate the right to jury trial, but does not establish a cap, which might violate that right by infringing on the jury's determination of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants also point to two Missouri circuit court decisions,\n   <em>\n    Mays v. Williams\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller v. McClellan\n   </em>\n   , to illustrate a split among the circuit courts regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 303.390. (Doc. # 26, p. 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docs. # 26-G, # 26-H). In\n   <em>\n    Mays\n   </em>\n   , the court declined to strike the defendant's \u00a7 303.390 affirmative defense after the plaintiff challenged the statute on grounds similar to those on which Plaintiff relies in this case. In\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , the court characterized \u00a7 303.390 as a waiver as opposed to a cap and held that the statute therefore did not violate article I, \u00a7 22(a) of the Missouri Constitution. (Doc. # 26-8, pp. 2-3) (\"As a waiver, the provisions of sec. 303.390 RsMo. differ fundamentally from the provisions of the statutes invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Lewellen v. Franklin\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Watts v. Lester E. Cox Medical Centers\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff on the other hand argues that \u00a7 303.390 is even \"[w]orse than the situation in\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   \" because it \"would eliminate any award of noneconomic damages, as opposed to merely capping those damages.\" (Doc. # 27, p. 10). Plaintiff characterizes \u00a7 303.390 not as a waiver of one's right to a jury trial but as a \"cap of $0\" on noneconomic damages. (Doc. # 27, p. 10). Plaintiff focuses on subsection 3, which states that in any action covered by the statute, \"[a]ny award in favor of such person shall be reduced by an amount equal to the portion of the award representing compensation for noneconomic loss.\" (Doc. # 27, p. 10). Quoting\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff argues that \u00a7 303.390\"prevents the jury's award from having its full and intended effect\" and therefore violates the Missouri Constitution. (Doc. # 27, p. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Notwithstanding the words \"waiver\" and \"waived\" in subsections 1 and 3 respectively, the express mechanics of \u00a7 303.390 render it an unconstitutional limit on the jury's determination of damages. Express language in the challenged statute allows the jury to receive evidence of and determine noneconomic damages: the jury's total damages award in favor of uninsured driver \"shall be reduced by an amount equal to\n   <em>\n    the portion of the award representing compensation for noneconomic losses.\n   </em>\n   \" \u00a7 303.390.3(1) (emphasis added). The statute then requires the court to reduce the jury's damages award by an amount equal to what they awarded as noneconomic damages without notifying the jury of this reduction. \u00a7 303.390.3(1)-(2). This statutory language expressly requires a change to the jury's determination of damages and therefore violates the right to jury trial as stated in the Missouri Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7127288\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/376/633/#p642\">\n    376 S.W.3d at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Statutory caps on damages in cases in which the right to trial by jury applies necessarily changes and impairs the right of trial by jury 'as heretofore enjoyed.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Under \u00a7 303.390, just as under the statute the\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   court struck down, \"the jury nominally is permitted to find the facts while the judge statutorily is required to make a separate legal determination that applies\" the limitation on noneconomic damages, which causes \"[t]he unavoidable result\" that the \"right to trial by jury is directly subject to legislative limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7127288\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/376/633/#p642\">\n    376 S.W.3d at 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
