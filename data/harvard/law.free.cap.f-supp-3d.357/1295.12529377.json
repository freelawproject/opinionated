When \"Commerce is faced with the choice of selecting from among imperfect alternatives, it has the discretion to select the best available information for a surrogate value so long as its decision is reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Catfish Farmers of Am. v.

Applying the afore-mentioned criteria, Commerce weighed the information on the record and determined that the Romanian data was the best available information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A careful review of the Remand Results indicates that Commerce's selection of Romania over Mexico was a close call. Publicly available data was available from both countries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Remand Results at 12, 15, 30. Although roughly contemporaneous data was available from Mexico, Commerce considered the monthly data from Romania to be more contemporaneous than the annual data from Mexico, which would be impacted by months outside the period of review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. Data from both countries was also considered tax and duty exclusive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13, 15, 27. Commerce expressly found that Romanian data represented a broad market average but made no such finding with respect to Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. Commerce drew distinctions, however, regarding the specificity of the Romanian and Mexican data to the size and price of the raw garlic input.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As to size, Commerce found that the record lacked substantial evidence to conclude that \"Mexic[an] garlic bulbs are identical or more comparable to\" Chinese garlic bulbs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. Commerce explained that most of Xinboda's evidence on Mexican garlic was \"completely unintelligible,\" and the intelligible articles, or parts thereof, failed to support Xinboda's arguments regarding the comparability of Mexican garlic to Chinese garlic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In contrast, Commerce found that substantial evidence supported a finding that Romanian garlic bulbs are \"similar in size to the input garlic bulbs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30 &amp; n.126 (quoting I &amp; D Mem. at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As to price, Commerce first considered whether Mexican or Romanian data reflected the level of trade at which Xinboda's processor, Excelink, purchased raw garlic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27. Reiterating its finding in the underlying review that Excelink did not pay \"farmgate\" prices, Commerce found that Excelink's prices included costs for processing the garlic,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   off-site storage during the non-harvesting months, and transportation from the farmer to Excelink in the harvest season or from rented storage to Excelink in the non-harvesting months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27. Accordingly, Commerce concluded that Romanian wholesale pricing data better reflected Xinboda's purchasing experience than Mexican farmgate prices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27, 30. Commerce also rejected arguments that Romanian garlic prices are distorted by tariff quotas imposed by the European Union (\"EU\"), and that Mexican garlic prices are distorted by phytosanitary measures excluding Chinese garlic from Mexico.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29, 30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In view of these distinctions, Commerce selected Romania as the primary surrogate country,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, and used pricing data reported by the National Institute of Statistics Romania (\"NISR\") to value Xinboda's raw garlic, I &amp; D Mem. at 13; Remand Results at 26-27. Xinboda challenges Commerce's determination that Romania offered the best available information on the record, focusing on Commerce's findings regarding size, purchasing experience, and distortion in Romanian prices.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Xinboda's Remand Opp'n.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   From the outset, Xinboda misstates and misapplies the court's inquiry. Xinboda insists that substantial evidence supports the use of Mexican data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Xinboda's Remand Opp'n at 1-18, 21-29, 31-32. The court's inquiry, however, is whether substantial evidence supports Commerce's use of Romanian data; if so, such use will not be precluded even if substantial evidence also supports the use of Mexican data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i) ;\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec.

Cir. 1984) (the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not preclude the agency's finding from being supported by substantial evidence). Although Commerce's inquiry is directed to which country offers the best available information, the court's inquiry is not the same. Instead, the court considers whether substantial evidence supports the agency's determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhejiang DunAn Hetian Metal Co., Ltd. v.

Further, Commerce's decision in the 17th administrate review illustrates why Commerce may reach different conclusions in separate administrative reviews based on different record facts.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jiaxing Brother Fastener Co., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055198\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1289/#p1293\">\n    822 F.3d at 1299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"each administrative review is a separate exercise of Commerce's authority that allows for different conclusions based on different facts in the record\") (citation omitted). In the 17\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   administrative review, while Commerce selected a farmgate-approximate price over a price resembling a wholesale price, the agency similarly discussed the fact that Xinboda's garlic was not obtained at farmgate prices, but, as here, included some post-harvest processing. Taking that into consideration, in relation to the surrogate values placed on that record (including the Azadpur sales prices from India, which are\n   not at issue in this review) Commerce made its record-specific determination. AR 17 Decision Mem. at 14-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   There is one aspect of Commerce's determination, however, that requires further consideration by the agency. In the underlying proceeding, Commerce added transportation costs to the Romanian wholesale prices to account for delivery of the raw garlic \"from the farmer or storage facility to Excelink.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I &amp; D Mem. at 29 &amp; n.174 (citation omitted).

Thus, while the court sustains Commerce's determination that Romanian prices are more comparable to Excelink's purchasing experience, a remand is required for Commerce to clarify its justification for adding transportation costs to the wholesale prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Xinboda's Remand Opp'n at 29-30.

However, Xinboda provided no evidence indicating that the volume of fresh garlic imported into the EU increased between 2007 and 2014; thus, it is speculative to assume that the above-quota duty had any effect on import quantities, let alone pricing within the EU generally, or Romania specifically, during the period of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In light of record evidence indicating that most, if not all, of the fresh garlic imported into the EU was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   subject to the additional duty of 1,200 Euros, substantial evidence supports Commerce's decision not to infer a causal relationship between EU-imposed tariff quotas and increased Romanian garlic prices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Remand Results at 29; I &amp; D Mem. at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In sum, Commerce's determination that Romanian data better fulfilled the contemporaneity and product-specificity criteria of its factors data analysis is supported by substantial evidence.
