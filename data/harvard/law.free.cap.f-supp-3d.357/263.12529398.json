The accounts, by their express terms, were to accrue interest monthly and renew automatically every 60 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2002, Union State Bank (\"USB\") acquired FFSB and its accounts, including Longo's. However, shortly after acquiring FFSB, USB stopped paying interest on Longo's accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2008, KeyBank National Association (\"KeyBank\") acquired USB and, consequently, Longo's accounts. Like USB, KeyBank did not pay interest on Longo's accounts. Eventually, in late 2013, KeyBank escheated Longo's accounts to the State of New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2018, Longo brought the instant suit, alleging breach of contract claims against KeyBank as an individual and successor-in-interest to USB for failing to pay interest on her accounts and for eventually escheating the accounts to the State of New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In lieu of a formal answer, KeyBank has moved to dismiss Longo's complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the reasons explained below, KeyBank's motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1993, Plaintiff Barbara Longo opened two CD accounts with FFSB. One account, ending in 2462 (\"Account 2462\"), contained $ 151,186.48; the other account, ending in 2463 (\"Account 2463\"), contained $ 104,114.80. Doc. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. The CDs provided that each account would accrue interest at a rate of 5.2% per annum, and that FFSB would distribute earnings on the last business day of each month for an initial term of 60 months, at which point each account would mature. Doc. 4-1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 4 \u00b6 9. The \"Initial Maturity Date\" for both accounts was February 27, 1998. Doc. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Each CD contained the same provision\n   explaining what would happen following the Initial Maturity Date:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   AUTOMATIC RENEWAL.\n   <em>\n    This account shall be automatically renewed at the close of business on the Initial Maturity Date or the maturity date of any Renewal Term\n   </em>\n   (rate of earnings on any renewal term will be the rate in effect for the particular account class at that time) unless (1) withdrawn within the 7-day period referred to in Section 5\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ... or (2) at least 15 days prior to any such date, the Bank gives written notice to the Accountholder that this account will not be renewed. In such event, the account will be converted to a regular savings account and receive earnings at the rate then paid on regular savings accounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Doc. 4-1 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 4 \u00b6 9. By its terms, the provision admits of no limitation on the number of times an account may be renewed automatically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 31, 2002, USB acquired FFSB. Doc. 4 \u00b6 10. Around that same time, USB provided Longo with a pamphlet titled \"What the [USB] acquisition of the [FFSB], Yonkers Branch means to you.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 4-2. The pamphlet provided that all FFSB accounts would be converted to USB accounts by close of business on October 31, 2002, and, relevant here, USB included the following representation in the pamphlet's questions-and-answers section:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Q. Will there be any rate or term changes to my [C]ertificates of Deposit (CDs)?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A. No, there will be no changes to your CDs. All terms and conditions will remain the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Doc. 4-2 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Notwithstanding the representation made by USB, in February 2003 USB stopped paying interest on Longo's two accounts without providing notice to her. Doc. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Approximately five years later, on January 18, 2008, KeyBank acquired USB.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. That same day, KeyBank provided Longo with a booklet titled \"Welcome to KeyBank.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15; Doc. 4-3. According to the booklet, USB accounts automatically transferred to KeyBank on January 18, 2008. The booklet represented to the former USB accountholders that they would continue earning the interest rate initially guaranteed on their fixed-rate CD accounts throughout the remainder of the accounts' terms; that the CD accounts upon maturity would be renewed at the market rates then in effect; and that there would be no changes to the accounts during the current term other than a possible change in interest payment frequency. Doc. 4-3 at 4, 25-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 30, 2011, Longo received a letter from KeyBank regarding the status of Account 2462 that stated in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   State Law requires KeyBank to transfer the balance of any account that has had no activity including withdrawals and deposits, or acknowledgment initiated by KeyBank's customer within the last THREE (03) years to the Department of Unclaimed Funds for that customer's state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   INCLUDES ALL CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS INCLUDING THOSE THAT RENEW AUTOMATICALLY.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Doc. 4-4. KeyBank explained that its records indicated a lack of activity on Longo's part with respect to Account 2462, and it warned her of its plan to remit to the Department of Unclaimed Funds the balance of Account 2462 absent her response to the notice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   KeyBank instructed Longo that if she wished to avoid the transfer of her funds, she should complete and return the response form attached to its letter by August 19, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At some point in August 2011, Longo completed, signed, and hand-delivered to KeyBank at its branch in Yonkers, New York, the response form attached to the letter. At this time, she also directed KeyBank not to escheat Account 2462 to the State of New York. Doc. 4 \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 30, 2011, KeyBank mailed Longo another letter, this time concerning Account 2463.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Like the letter regarding Account 2462, this letter informed her that it would escheat Account 2463 to the Department of Unclaimed Funds absent her response. Longo completed, signed, and mailed to KeyBank the response form attached to this letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Between November 2011 and January 2012, Longo met several times with KeyBank Assistant Branch Manager Boby Basu (\"Basu\") at its Yonkers branch to confirm that KeyBank had received her letter responses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. During these meetings, Mr. Basu confirmed to Longo that KeyBank had received her responses and assured her that her CD accounts would remain active.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In November 2013, despite Mr. Basu's representations to Longo and without notice to her, KeyBank escheated the balance of Longo's CD accounts to the State of New York.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In October 2014, Longo issued a formal demand to KeyBank, requesting that KeyBank pay the outstanding interest owed on her CD accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On March 26, 2016, KeyBank mailed Longo a letter, seemingly in response to a complaint filed by Longo to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 4-7. In this letter, KeyBank explained that, according to its records, Accounts 2462 and 2463 were received from USB in 2008 while they were already at their \"final maturity status.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   KeyBank explained that \"[f]inal [m]atured accounts do not roll over into a new term,\" and maintained that the final maturity date for the two accounts was February 27, 2003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, according to KeyBank, \"no interest would have accrued past the final maturity date of February 27, 2003.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On March 9, 2018, Longo filed the instant action, asserting three claims: (1) breach of contract against KeyBank in its capacity as successor-in-interest to USB for failure to pay interest on Longo's accounts past February 27, 2003; (2) breach of contract against KeyBank individually for failure to pay interest on Longo's accounts from the time it acquired her accounts on January 18, 2008, through the present; and (3) breach of contract against KeyBank individually for escheating her account to the State of New York without warning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On May 29, 2018, KeyBank filed a motion to dismiss Longo's complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

In addition to the plain text of \u00a7 3-122(2), the official comment to U.C.C. \u00a7 3-122 makes clear that the New York State Legislature, in enacting the statute, intended to treat causes of actions involving certificates of deposits differently:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [T]he generally accepted rule [is] that [an] action may be brought on a demand note immediately upon issue, without demand, since presentment is not required to charge the maker under the original Act or under this Article.\n   <em>\n    An exception is made in the case of certificates of deposit for the reason that banking custom and expectation is that demand will be made before any liability is incurred by the bank, and the additional reason that such certificates are issued with the understanding that they will be held for a considerable length of time, which in many instances exceeds the period of the statute of limitations.\n   </em>\n   As to makers and acceptors of time instruments generally, the cause of action accrues on the day after maturity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   U.C.C. \u00a7 3-122 cmt. 1 (emphasis added). As explained in the comment above, the Legislature purposely carved out an \"exception\" to the \"generally accepted rule\" KeyBank attempts to rely on. In essence, \u00a7 3-122(2) serves as a shield for both banks and depositors: accountholders may not demand payment until their CD has reached maturity, which provides banks with ample opportunity to remedy any defects in the CD prior to the maturity date and protects them against accountholder demands for payment prior to the date contemplated at the time of the CD's issuance. Likewise, although \"certificates are issued with the understanding that they will be held for a considerable length of time, which in many cases exceed the statute of limitations,\" accountholders need not worry about their CD's maturity date extending past the statute of limitations for causes of action involving their CD. Accordingly, the Court finds that the New York State Legislature in promulgating U.C.C. \u00a7 3-122(2) clearly altered New York's generally accepted rules regarding breach of contract claims as they pertain to actions involving CDs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Given the applicability of U.C.C. \u00a7 3-122(2), the Court concludes that Longo's breach of contract claims against KeyBank are timely. Because Longo first demanded payment from KeyBank with respect to both of her accounts in October 2014, the six-year statute of limitations applicable to her claims had not yet passed when she filed suit in 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"580888\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/735/645/#p648\">\n    735 F.2d at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The cause of action on a certificate of deposit accrues upon demand.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Notwithstanding the text and official comment of \u00a7 3-122(2), KeyBank argues that \"courts have recognized that the statute of limitations accrues upon the initial breach of a certificate of deposit contract, regardless of when a demand for payment is made.\" Def.'s Mem. at 8.

In concluding that plaintiff's claims were time-barred, the district court relied heavily on the fact that Citibank sent plaintiff a letter in 1977 explaining that \"when Saigon fell in May 1975, [Citibank] transferred all the assets and liabilities of [their] former branch to the Vietnamese government and they now have responsibilities for the same.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668775\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/586/203/#p205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668775\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/586/203/#p205\">\n    at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on these circumstances, the court concluded that \"[n]o demand at the Saigon bank was necessary, because in the circumstances it would have been futile.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668775\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/586/203/#p205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668775\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/586/203/#p205\">\n    at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In this case, however, assuming \"futility of demand\" is an exception to the rule otherwise pronounced in U.C.C. \u00a7 3-122(2), the Court concludes that such \"futility\" is absent here. For one thing, unlike the closed bank branches in\n   <em>\n    Tat Ba\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ngoc Dung Thi Tran\n   </em>\n   , here there is no indication that KeyBank has ceased operations in New York City or was forced to transfer Longo's accounts to the government. And neither party in this action has alleged that KeyBank or USB unequivocally repudiated its obligation to pay interest to Longo. Indeed, Longo in her complaint claims she did not receive\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   notices, written or otherwise, concerning changes to the original terms of her CD accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. And the original terms of Longo's CD accounts provide for the CDs' automatic renewal absent written notice to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 4-1. In acquiring FFSB, USB informed Longo that there would be \"no changes to [her] certificates of deposit. All terms and conditions will remain the same.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 4-2 at 2. Similarly, in acquiring USB, KeyBank represented to Longo that there would be no material changes to her accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 4-3 at 4. Accordingly, assuming \"futility of demand\" is a cognizable exception to U.C.C. \u00a7 3-122(2)'s rule concerning when a cause of action accrues, the Court concludes that \"futility of demand\" is absent here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court finds more persuasive the opinions in\n   <em>\n    Garcia v.

The Second Circuit, applying U.C.C. \u00a7 3-122(2), rejected Chase's argument that plaintiff's claim was time-barred and instead concluded that \"[t]he cause of action on a certificate accrues upon demand,\" which \"occurs upon presentment and refusal to pay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 648.

Section 3-122(2) provides that \"\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   cause of action against the obligor of a ... certificate of deposit accrues upon demand\"; it does not provide that \"\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   causes of actions against the obligor of a certificate of deposit accrue upon demand.\" The better reading of the statute, therefore, is that it applies to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   action predicated upon a CD. And for good reason, too, as the official comment to Section 3-122 makes clear that \"banking custom and expectation is that demand will be made before any liability is incurred by the bank,\" and the statute of limitations is extended because \"such certificates are issued with the understanding that they will be held for a considerable length of time, which in many instances exceeds the period of the statute of limitations.\" U.C.C. \u00a7 3-122 cmt. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, KeyBank proffers several policy reasons why this the Court should find Longo's claims time-barred. In particular, KeyBank argues that this case is \"tailor-made\" for application of a six-year statute of limitations because it \"involves claims of alleged non-payment of interest for more than 15 years on accounts that have been transferred among three different banks over the span of 25 years,\" and \"[i]t is highly likely that witnesses will be unavailable, memories will have faded, and evidence will be lost.\" The Court is unpersuaded. Undoubtedly, prosecution of an action in which the critical decision at issue was made well over a decade ago poses unique challenges. However, this is a situation largely of KeyBank's own making, as both it and USB assured Longo that the terms and conditions of her CD accounts would remain the same, thus obviating the need for her to take additional steps to determine how the corporate acquisitions would affect her. Moreover, where, as here, the text of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the Court is not at liberty to substitute its own judgment for that of the New York State Legislature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Because Longo filed suit against KeyBank within six years after demanding payment from KeyBank on her two CDs, and because U.C.C. \u00a7 3-122 provides that Longo's breach of contract claims accrued\n   upon demand, the Court concludes that her breach of contract claims against KeyBank are timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Longo's Claim against KeyBank for Improper Escheatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   KeyBank argues that Longo's breach of contract claim against KeyBank on a theory of improper escheatment must be dismissed for two reasons: (1) Longo has not identified a contractual provision that KeyBank allegedly breached, and (2) Longo has not sufficiently pleaded damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 10. The Court disagrees with both arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   First, KeyBank argues that Longo has failed to state a breach of contract claim because she has not identified a contractual provision breached by KeyBank. KeyBank maintains that the documents received by Longo from it and USB \"do not, on their face, appear to be contracts.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 5. That much may be true. However, the answer to whether those documents and the representations included therein created contractual obligations between KeyBank and Longo is not so simple.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Here, Longo's improper escheatment claim is predicated upon KeyBank's alleged failure to perform the contractual obligations of its predecessors-in-interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Recurrent Capital Bridge Fund I, LLC v.

Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Longo, as the Court must, Longo has sufficiently pleaded that she entered into a contract with FFSB by which her CDs would accrue interest monthly and renew automatically every 60 months; that USB acquired her accounts from FFSB and informed her that the terms of her CDs would remain the same; that KeyBank acquired her accounts from USB and, like USB, told her that the CDs' terms would stay the same; that KeyBank breached its obligation to pay interest monthly and renew the CDs automatically when it escheated her accounts to the State of New York without notice; and that Longo suffered damages in the form of lost interest as a result of KeyBank's actions.

Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9188959\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/392/520/#p525\">\n    392 F.3d 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525 (2d Cir. 2004) (\"To establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for breach of contract, a plaintiff must plead and prove: (1) the existence of a contract; (2) a breach of that contract; and (3) damages resulting from the breach.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, the Court concludes that Longo has sufficiently pleaded damages resulting from KeyBank's escheatment-namely, the interest her CD accounts would have earned from KeyBank had KeyBank not escheated them to the State of New York. Of course, Longo's success on this claim depends entirely on whether she succeeds on her breach of contract claim for failure to pay interest. However, that Longo may only recover on the improper escheatment claim if she proves entitlement to interest payments from KeyBank-an issue already controverted in another claim-is of no moment. While Longo's breach of contract claim against KeyBank for improper escheatment is derivative of her breach of contract claim for failure to pay interest, it is not\n   <em>\n    duplica\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tive.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the claim may proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
