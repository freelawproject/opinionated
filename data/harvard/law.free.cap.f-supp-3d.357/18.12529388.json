FRIEDRICH, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Deborah Pueschel engaged in a long string of employment-related disputes with her employer, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and began receiving full-time disability benefits for work-related injuries from the Office of Worker\n   Compensation (OWCP) in 1998. She later decided to run for Congress. When FAA found out, it contacted OWCP and said Pueschel's campaign activities demonstrated an ability to work that was inconsistent with the full-time disability benefits she was receiving. OWCP reduced Pueschel's benefits accordingly and cleared her for full-time work. Pueschel then wrote FAA to request a job, but never received one. Now, she brings these Title VII and Rehabilitation Act claims against FAA for retaliation and disability discrimination, asserting that FAA retaliated against her by encouraging OWCP to reduce her benefits and that FAA discriminated against her by not giving her a job. Pueschel also brings First Amendment claims against both FAA and OWCP, asserting that they violated her \"right to run for Congress without penalty\" by taking her campaign activities into account in reducing her benefits. Compl. \u00b6 52, Dkt. 1 at 10. Before the Court is defendants' joint Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Dkt. 15-1 (redacted). For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pueschel began working for FAA as an Air Traffic Controller in 1974. Compl. \u00b6 6. In 1980, she filed an EEO complaint alleging a pattern of sexual harassment by her male colleagues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. In 1981, her disputes with FAA began to intensify. First, she was injured at work and filed a claim for worker compensation with OWCP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Next, she filed a federal lawsuit alleging sexual harassment and reprisal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. After that, she called in sick due to back pain on the same day as an illegal air traffic controllers' strike.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. FAA assumed that Pueschel had participated in the strike, so it fired her and challenged her OWCP claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pueschel lost her first round of sexual-harassment litigation in federal court but obtained a reversal from the Fourth Circuit in 1983.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Three months later, she convinced the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board to reverse her termination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Things between Pueschel and FAA went smoothly for the next seven years. But Pueschel filed additional EEO complaints against FAA in 1990, 1992, 1997, and 2001.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Meanwhile, Pueschel suffered an anxiety attack on the job in 1994 and never returned to work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. She requested disability benefits for work-related anxiety and physical injuries arising from the incident, which OWCP granted in 1998.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. In 1999, FAA terminated Pueschel again-this time because she was no longer able to work as an air traffic controller.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. She unsuccessfully appealed her termination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2000, Pueschel set her sights on Congress.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. She ran for the House of Representatives in 2000-2004 and again in 2012-2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sometime in 2012, FAA began questioning whether Pueschel's campaign activities demonstrated an ability to work that was inconsistent with the full-time OWCP benefits she was still receiving.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. On October 9, 2015, FAA sent a letter to OWCP stating that Pueschel \"demonstrated, and continues to demonstrate, the ability to run for elective office\" and that her campaigning activities \"disprove[d]\" the conclusion that she was \"permanently disabled\" and likely not \"able to work in any capacity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. In January\n   2016, OWCP reduced Pueschel's disability benefits on the grounds she was then capable of working full time as a \"customer service representative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. In March 2016, Pueschel complained to an EEO counselor about what she considered FAA's \"efforts to deprive her of her disability benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In April 2016, Pueschel sent a letter to FAA-specifically, to Margaret Gilligan, the Associate Administrator for Aviation Safety, Pl.'s Opp'n Ex. 4, Dkt. 21-4 at 1\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -explaining that she had been cleared for full-time work and was requesting a position in the FAA Historian's office, Compl. \u00b6 33.

Reply 7-in doing so, OWCP imposed no more significant burden than the equal time rule in\n   <em>\n    Branch\n   </em>\n   . There, the plaintiff had to choose between his job and running for office. Here, Pueschel did not lose her disability benefits entirely because she ran for office. She experienced only a partial reduction in compensation. But just as \"nobody has ever thought that a candidate has a right to run for office and at the same time to avoid all personal sacrifices,\"\n   <em>\n    Branch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730377,4330889\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/824/37/\">\n    824 F.2d at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , nobody has ever thought that a candidate has a right to run for office\n   <em>\n    and at the same time to receive full-time disability benefits.\n   </em>\n   And the fact Pueschel may have had to choose between her disability benefits and her candidacy\n   does not differ in kind from the fact \"many people find it necessary to choose between their jobs and their candidacies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730377,4330889\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/824/37/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Indeed, this case is even simpler than\n   <em>\n    Branch\n   </em>\n   . There, the plaintiff's candidacy\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   impacted his employment. Here, however, Pueschel's candidacy played at most an indirect role in OWCP's reduction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n. 25 (acknowledging that \"OWCP's decision did not directly concern the First Amendment\"). Pueschel does not allege that her candidacy alone triggered the reduction. Rather, she argues that OWCP's \"citation of her campaign activities as evidence to support the reduction\" amounted to an unconstitutional \"burden.\" Pl.'s Opp'n 22. Because having one's candidacy considered as one factor in reducing disability benefits is no more significant than the burden of direct job loss upheld in\n   <em>\n    Branch\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff's \"right to seek political office\" is \"not implicated.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730377,4330889\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/824/37/\">\n    824 F.2d at 47-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is important to note what plaintiff does not allege. She does not claim that OWCP reduced her benefits based on the viewpoint or content expressed in her campaign. Nor does she claim that OWCP punished her for associating with a particular party or that OWCP purposefully retaliated or discriminated against her because of her candidacy-for political reasons, professional reasons, or otherwise. Rather, she argues her right to run for office was impermissibly burdened by OWCP's benefit reduction. Finding that theory foreclosed by D.C.
