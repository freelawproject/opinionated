The Committee's application will be denied without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This application stems from a motion filed by the Government in a criminal prosecution of Seitu Sulayman Kokayi, who was charged with coercion and enticement of a minor. The Government moved to seal the criminal complaint and the supporting affidavit in that case, arguing that \"[p]remature\n   disclosure ... would jeopardize the investigation.\" Government's Motion to Seal Criminal Complaint and Supporting Documents Pursuant to Local Rule 49(B), \u00b6 1,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kokayi\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-mj-406 (E.D. Va. Aug. 22, 2018). Without explanation, the motion twice referred to an individual named \"Assange,\" even though no such individual had been named as a codefendant or mentioned in the\n   <em>\n    Kokayi\n   </em>\n   complaint or supporting affidavit. In the first reference, the motion stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   The United States has considered alternatives less drastic than sealing, including, for example, the possibility of redactions, and has determined that none would suffice to protect this investigation. Another procedure short of sealing will not adequately protect the needs of law enforcement at this time because,\n   <em>\n    due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. In the second, it stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The complaint, supporting affidavit, and arrest warrant, as well as this motion and the proposed order,\n   <em>\n    would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition\n   </em>\n   in this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5 (emphasis added). The Government has characterized its references to \"Assange\" as \"unintentional error.\" Government's Opp'n to Reporters Committee's Appl. [Dkt. No. 7] (\"Gov't's Opp'n\") 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although the magistrate judge initially granted the Government's motion to seal the\n   <em>\n    Kokayi\n   </em>\n   complaint, affidavit, arrest warrant, and motion to seal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order to Seal,\n   <em>\n    Kokayi\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-mj-406 (E.D. Va. Aug. 24, 2018), those documents (with the exception of the affidavit) were unsealed in early September 2018, after Kokayi had been arrested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order,\n   <em>\n    Kokayi\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-mj-406 (E.D. Va. Sept. 4, 2018). Once the motion to seal became public, news outlets and social media users noticed the two references to \"Assange\" and surmised that the Government had instituted criminal charges against Julian Assange, the well-known founder of WikiLeaks, though there is no public record of such charges having been filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memo. of Points &amp; Authorities in Supp. of the Appl. of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press to Unseal Criminal Prosecution of Julian Assange [Dkt. No. 1-4] (\"Comm.'s Memo.\") 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Committee filed this application based on an asserted interest in accessing what it believes are judicial records related to a prosecution of Assange. Specifically, the application \"seeks an order unsealing the court records-including, but not limited to, the Court's docket and any criminal complaint, indictment, or other charging document-from the government's criminal prosecution of Assange.\" Appl. of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press to Unseal Criminal Prosecution of Julian Assange [Dkt. No. 1] \u00b6 12. The Government opposes the Committee's application on the ground that it has neither confirmed nor denied whether charges have been filed against Assange and cannot be required to disclose that information before an arrest is made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This case lies at the intersection of two weighty interests. One is the Government's need to be able to investigate criminal activity and successfully bring to justice those charged with criminal conduct.

The reason for this presumption is simple: \"Any step that withdraws an element of the judicial process from public view makes the ensuing decision look more like a fiat and requires rigorous justification.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064686\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/246/#p265\">\n    749 F.3d at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties agree that once an individual has been charged and arrested, both the First Amendment and the common law provide the public with a qualified right to access at least some judicial records in connection with the ongoing prosecution. Charging documents are a quintessential example.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Historically, the openness of the charging document was intimately connected with the notion of the open trial itself; although government investigations and grand jury deliberations were shrouded in secrecy, formal charges were typically made \"either by indictment presented or information filed in court.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1516476\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/776/1104/#p1112\">\n    776 F.2d 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1112 (3d Cir. 1985). As the Third Circuit put it, \"This historic tradition of public access to the charging document in a criminal case reflects the importance of its role in the criminal trial process and the public's interest in knowing its contents.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1516476\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/776/1104/#p1112\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Knowledge of the charge or charges is essential to an understanding of the trial, essential to an evaluation of the performance of counsel and the court, and, most importantly, essential to an appraisal of the fairness of the criminal process to the accused.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Of course, that a judicial record is subject to the right of access does not mean that the public is entitled to inspect the record at all times and in every case. To the contrary, that the right is presumptive means that it may be overcome, in favor of nondisclosure or sealing, where appropriate. This is usually the case before a charged person has been arrested because of the government's well-established interests in preventing the accused from avoiding arrest, destroying or tampering with evidence, or otherwise interfering with the prosecution; securing privacy rights or confidential sources of information; and protecting the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although the Government recognizes that First Amendment right-to-access analysis typically depends on what \"type of document\" is being sought, it asserts that courts must also consider the \"stage at which public access is sought,\" and specifically it argues that there is no First Amendment right to access charging documents \"before an arrest.\" Gov't's Opp'n at 2-3. The Committee responds that where a defendant has been formally charged, whether he has been arrested will affect the Government's ability to satisfy its burden to keep the charging document under seal but does not change whether the First Amendment applies as a threshold matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Committee has the better argument. The Government principally points to the Ninth Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Times Mirror Co. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539020\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/873/1210/\">\n    873 F.2d 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1989), which held that although the public has a First Amendment right to access a search warrant affidavit if the suspect is charged and ultimately moves to suppress evidence from the search, there is no such right \"at [the] stage in the warrant proceedings\" when \"a pre-indictment investigation is ongoing,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539020\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/873/1210/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539020\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/873/1210/\">\n    at 1217-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the extent this case law supports a clear dividing line based on the stage of a proceeding, that line falls at the filing of formal charges, not arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Third Circuit was therefore correct to acknowledge that the presumptive right to charging documents applies-but may be overcome in light of the \"well-grounded fear of flight by the accused to avoid apprehension\"-before the defendant has been arrested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1516476\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/776/1104/#p1112\">\n    776 F.2d at 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   What makes this case unique is that the Government has not acknowledged whether formal charges have been filed against Assange, and the Committee has not cited any authority supporting the notion that the public has a right to require the Government to confirm or deny that it has charged someone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The dispositive issue in this proceeding is whether, under these circumstances, the Committee's application is ripe for judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the Committee's view, it is a fact \"that Assange has been criminally charged.\" Comm.'s Memo. 1. It supports this view by pointing to the two sentences in the Government's motion to seal in\n   <em>\n    Kokayi\n   </em>\n   as well as to other cases involving Assange or WikiLeaks and news stories reporting that the Government has charged Assange.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taken together, the Committee argues that the \"case against Assange is already a matter of public knowledge\" and that the Government is not entitled \"to put the genie back\" in the bottle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gambale v.

It asserts that the Committee's application is based only on guesswork-or, as counsel for the Government put it during oral argument, \"The only thing you can conclude from our mistake is that we made a mistake, and anything else is speculation.\" Tr. of Mot. Hr'g [Dkt. No. 10] 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Committee has not demonstrated with sufficient certainty that Assange has been charged. Unlike in other high-profile cases, the Government has not affirmatively disclosed that charges have been filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Government acknowledges that it made a mistake in the\n   <em>\n    Kokayi\n   </em>\n   motion, the nature of that mistake is fundamentally unclear, which is why the Committee seeks to bolster its view by pointing to news reports and other civil and criminal cases. The Committee's evidentiary amalgam of an obviously erroneous filing in an unrelated case, public speculation, news stories, and anonymous statements by government officials does not supply a level of certainty comparable to that afforded by official acknowledgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, the question is how the Court should analyze a request for public access to a charging document where there has not been a sufficiently certain disclosure that charges have been\n   filed. The most appropriate way to approach that question is through the lens of the ripeness doctrine, which \"is drawn both from Article III limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Reno v.
