Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2017, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13777, \"Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda,\" which, among other things, instructed executive agencies to identify regulatory actions that were \"outdated, unnecessary, or ineffective\" as candidates for repeal, modification, or replacement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C285\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 12,285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12,286 (Feb. 24, 2017). In November 2017, then-Attorney General Jefferson Sessions issued a memorandum addressed specifically at DOJ guidance documents, in which he observed that DOJ had \"in the past published guidance documents - or similar instruments of future effect by other names, such as letters to regulated entities - that effectively bind private parties without undergoing the rulemaking process.\" Attorney General Memorandum,\n   <em>\n    Prohibition on Improper Guidance Documents\n   </em>\n   , at 1 (Nov. 16, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1012271/download. The memorandum instructed DOJ to refrain from this practice in the future, stating that the agency would no longer \"issue guidance documents that purport to create rights or obligations binding on persons or entities outside the Executive Branch (including state, local, and tribal governments),\" and setting forth several principles for future guidance documents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C285\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C285\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, the memorandum instructed the agency \"to identify existing guidance documents that should be repealed, replaced, or modified in light of these principles.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C285\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C285\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to EO 13777 and the November 2017 Attorney General Memorandum, DOJ announced in December 2017 that it was rescinding twenty-five guidance documents that it had identified as \"unnecessary, inconsistent with existing law, or otherwise improper.\" ECF No. 30-1 at 2. In July 2018, DOJ rescinded an additional\n   twenty-four guidance documents that it had determined \"were unnecessary, outdated, inconsistent with existing law, or otherwise improper.\" ECF No. 30-8 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This dispute arises from the rescission of eight of these guidance documents. First, the \"\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Guidance\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   provided guidance to state and local governments on implementing Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act's (\"ADA\") mandate to provide integrated workplace settings to employees with disabilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 37-60; ECF No. 30-2. Second, DOJ and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's \"1999 Joint Statement\" explained the agencies' view on how the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\") impacted local government control over group living arrangements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 61-68; ECF No. 30-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next set of guidance documents concerned provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") that prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of national origin, or in the case of certain \"protected individuals,\" citizenship status (collectively, the \"INA Guidance\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 69. The third challenged document, the \"Zendejas Letter,\" set forth DOJ's interpretation of when individuals are \"protected individuals\" and various protections that apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C285\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C285\">\n    \u00b6 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; ECF No. 30-4.

Fifth, a DOJ guidance document, \"Refugees and Asylees Have the Right to Work\" (the \"Refugee Employment Flyer\"), provided additional guidance regarding employing those individuals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 77; ECF No. 30-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Two more guidance documents concerned the imposition of fees and fines in the criminal justice system. The sixth challenged document, the \"Dear Colleague\" letter, provided guidance to state and local court entities on constitutional and federal statutory issues raised by various fee and fine practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 85; ECF No. 30-6. Seventh, the \"Juvenile Fines and Fees Advisory\" for recipients of DOJ financial assistance addressed similar concerns as applied to the juvenile justice system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 86; ECF No. 30-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Finally, the \"Technical Assistance Manual\" provided guidance to state and local agencies on addressing the over-representation of minority youth in the juvenile justice system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 99; ECF No. 30-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The City alleges, and DOJ does not dispute, that the agency provided no explanation for withdrawing these guidance documents beyond the statements in DOJ's general rescission announcements.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 5, 2018, the City filed this lawsuit, alleging that DOJ had failed to provide a meaningful and particularized explanation for the December 2017 decision to rescind six of the guidance documents, making its action arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). ECF No. 1. On June 18, 2018, DOJ filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, asserting that the City lacked standing, the City's claims were unripe, and the rescissions of certain of the documents were not final agency actions subject to APA review. ECF No. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 30, 2018, the City amended its complaint to include additional allegations related to its standing, as well as to include within its APA challenge two more guidance documents rescinded in early July 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC. On September 27, 2018, DOJ filed an amended motion to dismiss, raising the same jurisdictional attacks. ECF No. 36.

In finding pre-enforcement challenges justiciable, courts have required plaintiffs to identify particular conduct that may spur such enforcement. In\n   <em>\n    SBA\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the plaintiffs \"pleaded specific statements they intend[ed] to make in future election cycles,\" and the history of prior prosecution of similar statements as false meant that the plaintiffs' future actions were likely to come into conflict with the challenged law.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581581\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2334/#p2342\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , even though the plaintiffs alleged that they had previously violated the challenged law by refusing to rent housing to unmarried couples and \"pledge[d] their intent to do so in the future,\" the Ninth Circuit found these allegations inadequate because the plaintiffs did not \"specify when, to whom, where, or under what circumstances.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11213165\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/1134/#p1139\">\n    220 F.3d at 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, the City's theory is that reduced clarity regarding the law increases the likelihood that the City will make a hypothetical future misstep that violates the ADA without the benefit of \"safe harbors\" provided by the guidance documents. ECF No. 38 at 18. The City cites no case suggesting that this kind of generalized risk can form the foundation of a pre-enforcement challenge, and such a theory is not meaningfully different from relying on regulatory uncertainty alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    California Sea Urchin Commission\n   </em>\n   is on point.

ECF No. 38 at 15 (citing FAC \u00b6\u00b6 48, 58). Because the City has not adequately alleged a likelihood of enforcement based on hypothetical ADA violations, any loss of funds premised on such violations is also too speculative.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    County of Santa Clara\n   </em>\n   , 250 F.Supp.3d at 524-26 (loss of funds sufficiently imminent where plaintiffs demonstrated credible threat of enforcement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In sum, the Court holds that the City has not shown that it reasonably probable that the rescission of the\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Guidance threatens its concrete interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

The 1999 Joint Statement and the 2016 Joint Statement do appear to contain similar information.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 30-3 at 4-5 (\"What is a reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Act?\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36-10 at 9-10 (\"What is a reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Act?\").

If there is no such vacuum, then there is no reason to think that the rescission made it any more difficult for the City to comply with the FHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Though not directly on point, the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Nuclear Information &amp; Resource Service v.

In other words, where two agency actions caused the same alleged harm, reversing only one would not redress plaintiffs' injuries. Here, the converse is true.

In short, the City cannot carry its burden to establish injury simply by pointing to an alleged procedural violation without identifying any concrete effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 1549.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Because the City's theories of liability fail at the outset, the Court need go no further on this question. Nonetheless, the Court also concludes that the City's theories fail for largely the same reasons as the\n   <em>\n    Olmstead\n   </em>\n   Guidance. First, although the City does cite its proprietary interest in land use regulation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Sausalito\n   </em>\n   , 386 F.3d at 1197, it does not identify any actual conflict or particular coercive effect of the FHA or DOJ's rescission,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sturgeon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265160,4264883\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/1066/\">\n    768 F.3d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without such detail, the Court cannot find a reasonable probability that rescission threatens the City's regulatory interests. Second, the City fails to allege that it is reasonably probable that it will be prosecuted for FHA violations because the City has no plans to violate or even arguably violate the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Therefore, the Court holds that the City lacks standing to challenge the rescission of the 1999 Joint Statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    c. INA Guidance (Zendejas Letter, Baudry Letter, and Refugee Employment Flyer)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The City alleges that the rescission of the Zendejas Letter, Baudry Letter, and Refugee Employment Flyer threaten its concrete interests by making \"it more difficult - and therefore expensive - for the City to process more than 4,600 Employment Eligibility Verification (\"I-9\") forms annually.\" ECF No. 38 at 15. Because of this alleged increase in difficulty, the City contends, it is also subject to a greater risk of violations and consequently, enforcement actions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As a threshold matter, the City's standing to challenge the Baudry Letter and the Refugee Employment Flyer suffers from the same defect as its challenge to the 1999 Joint Statement. DOJ contends, and the City does not dispute, that DOJ has issued other documents that contain the same information.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 30-5 (Baudry Letter),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36-6 (\"Guidance for Employers Conducting Internal Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 Audits\"); and\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 30-9 (Refugee Employment Flyer),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 36-7, 36-8 (\"Refugees and Asylees Have The Right to Work\"). The City offers no explanation of how the challenged rescissions make it any more difficult or expensive to process I-9 forms, given these other guidance documents. For this reason alone, the City lacks standing to challenge the Baudry Letter and the Refugee Employment Flyer for this reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Turning to the economic harm, the FAC nowhere alleges that the rescission of any of the three INA Guidance documents makes processing I-9 forms more expensive, let alone explains how it does so. And even if the FAC did contain the bare allegation contained in the City's opposition, it would not be sufficient. True, \"[a]t the pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant's conduct may suffice, for on a motion to dismiss [a court] presume[s] that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    Maya v.

Here, the impact of the rescinded guidance on the cost of processing I-9 forms is not obvious on the face of the pleadings and cannot be reasonably inferred without more information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Finally, as explained above, the City does not adequately allege a reasonable probability of harm to its concrete interests based on the risk of an enforcement action. Similarly, without any information as to how the City's practices arguably violate the INA, the Court cannot assess the materiality of a general increase in federal audits and enforcement actions against employers based on the INA's citizenship provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 38 at 18-19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Therefore, the Court concludes that the City lacks standing to challenge the rescission of the INA Guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Fees and Fines Guidance (Dear Colleague Letter and Juvenile Fees and Fines Advisory)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Next, the City alleges that rescission of the Dear Colleague Letter and the Juvenile Fees and Fines Advisory impairs its concrete interests by (1) increasing the risk of enforcement actions and (2) causing economic harm. ECF No. 38 at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   First, the City alleges that the rescission eliminates a safe harbor and that \"local governments face possible enforcement action even if their policies and practices comply with the rescinded guidance.\" FAC \u00b6 93; ECF No. 38 at 18. As discussed above, the removal of a safe harbor alone is insufficient to cause injury without a satisfactory showing that enforcement action is likely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cal. Sea Urchin Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516046\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/1173/#p1181\">\n    883 F.3d at 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The City makes no such showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Second, the City alleges that it will suffer economic harm because it currently has programs that \"cover court fees, traffic tickets, and similar fees and fines, on a case by case basis,\" and those programs will require greater resources if covered fees and fines increase. ECF No. 38 at 15 (quoting FAC \u00b6 97). But the City provides no explanation as to why those penalties will necessarily increase in the absence of the rescinded guidance. Nor does the City indicate an intent to abandon its recent fee reform legislation or the \"range of other fine and fee reforms\" enacted by the City and the San Francisco Superior Court system. FAC \u00b6 90. Though the FAC briefly alludes to state-law requirements,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91, the City does not explain which provisions of state law it is worried about violating now that the guidance has been withdrawn. In other words, the City supplies no reason why the rescission of the guidance documents would compel the City and the collaborating judicial entities to abandon their reform efforts, nor any reason\n   that they would do so as a matter of policy discretion. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that the challenged action will increase the burdens on the City's programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Alternatively, the City alleges that the rescission of the Fees and Fines Guidance will increase reliance on public benefits and public services. ECF No. 38 at 15. Specifically, the City alleges that, without those guidance documents, residents will be exposed to fees that they cannot afford, which may impair a person's credit rating or cost that person a driver's license or job. FAC \u00b6 94. In turn, the City reasons, this will increase residents' reliance on the City's public benefits and public services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As noted, above, the City does not explain how the rescission will force the City or its courts to impose such fines. Nonetheless, the City also asserts that it will suffer from the practices of the California state courts and other jurisdictions whose residents may move into the City and seek its benefits and services. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 94-96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   This lengthy causal chain requires the Court to consider whether it is \"reasonably probable\" that DOJ's rescission of the two guidance documents will threaten the City's concrete interest in avoiding additional public service burdens.\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266816\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/1144/#p1161\">\n    876 F.3d at 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). The crux of the City's theory is that state and other local courts will impose excessive fees and fines in the absence of the rescinded guidance documents.

The Ninth Circuit found it sufficient that the estimated additional 2,700 daily visitors would increase traffic congestion in Sausalito and demand on public services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1198-99. The court agreed with Sausalito that it was reasonably probable that, given this increase, the challenged action would threaten Sausalito's concrete interests in municipal management, public safety, tax revenue, and the aesthetic and natural resource qualities of the municipality.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1199.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    City of Sausalito\n   </em>\n   does not aid the City here.

Based solely on these alleged facts, it is not reasonable to infer that those other jurisdictions will revert to prior practices, and the Court would simply be guessing how other jurisdictions would have responded had the guidance documents not been rescinded.

In effect, the City asserts that it suffers a cognizable harm from any action that leads to a worse financial situation for persons who may eventually move to its jurisdiction and draw upon its services.
