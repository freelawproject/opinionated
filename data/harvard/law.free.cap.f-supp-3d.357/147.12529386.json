SMITH, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is the latest chapter of a transatlantic saga pitting an Italian producer of diagnostic medical instruments, Alifax Holding SpA, against its Rhode Island-based competitor, Alcor Scientific, Inc., and its itinerant former employee, Francesco Frappa. In this motion for partial summary judgment, Alifax has asked the Court to answer the following question: which jurisdiction's law should define the alleged duty of confidentiality owed by Frappa to his Italian ex-employer? The answer: Italy's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Frappa's contractual employment relationship with Sire Analytical S.r.l., an Italian company acquired by Alifax, is the only conceivable source of his alleged duty of secrecy. His decade-long employment relationship was negotiated, consummated, performed, and terminated in Italy. Neither Frappa nor his work for Sire were connected in any way to Rhode Island. Alifax's claim for trade secret misappropriation under a Rhode Island statute based on acts that occurred within the state does not alter the source of his alleged duty. Accordingly, Italian law governs the substance of Frappa's alleged duty of confidentiality to Alifax in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The stage was set for the current strife between Alifax and Alcor during Francesco Frappa's time as a student in Udine, Italy. In 2000, Frappa interned as a trainee at Sire, a local company. (Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Facts (\"PSUF\") \u00b6 2, ECF No. 165.) After two years, he discussed taking a permanent role with Sire's CEO and was promoted to the position of mechanical fitter apprentice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Frappa and Sire executed a hiring letter formalizing the apprenticeship in Udine on October 7, 2002.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   SUF Ex. A at 2, ECF No. 155-1). The letter states that it was a communication pursuant to cited sections of Italian law and that, \"[f]or other provisions not expressly provided for ... see\n   <em>\n    the laws in effect\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    National Collective Bargaining Agreement applied to the MECHANICAL ENGINEERING INDUSTRY\n   </em>\n   .\" (PSUF Ex. A at 2 (emphasis added).) The \"[a]pprenticeship length\" was three-and-a-half years, and Sire agreed to pay Frappa \"per [the] Collective Bargaining Agreement used by the company.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Alifax, an Italian corporation headquartered in Padova, Italy, acquired Sire two years later.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (SUF \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Disputed Facts (\"PSDF\") \u00b6 3, ECF No. 161-1.) Frappa nevertheless became a permanent mechanical fitter for Sire in October 2004. (PSUF \u00b6 12.) He was promoted over seven years to different roles with more responsibility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13-14.) His duties included hardware and software development as well as work with Alifax's erythrocyte sedimentation rate (\"ESR\") analyzers, clinical devices used to test blood samples for indicia of non-specific inflammation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-22.) At least some of his ESR-related duties were supervisory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) Frappa worked exclusively at Sire facilities in Udine and nearby Nimis or at Alifax's Padova headquarters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) He answered to supervisors in Italy and collected his pay and benefits in Italy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Frappa gave notice of his intent to resign from Sire at the end of August 2011, citing a \"change of position\" as the motive for his departure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30; PSUF Ex. B at 2.) His notice was effective September 1, 2011, but he explained that he intended \"to remain at the company for the entire two-month notice period as set forth in the Contract.\" (PSUF Ex. B at 2.) Prior to leaving, Frappa forwarded certain information concerning an \"anemia factor\" and myeloma from his Sire email account to a personal email account. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSDF \u00b6 106.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Frappa's resignation followed a week-long trip to Rhode Island as the guest of Alcor's founder, Carlo Ruggieri. (PSUF \u00b6 52.) Alcor is a Rhode Island corporation that also produces diagnostic devices. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Additional Undisputed Facts (\"PSAUF\") \u00b6 1, ECF No. 173-1.) Ruggieri invited Frappa to Rhode Island based on a lead from an industry professional to assess whether Frappa might leave Alifax and whether they might work together. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSUF \u00b6 52; PSUF Ex. F at 4.) At the end of Frappa's two-month notice period, Ruggieri told Alcor's staff Frappa would \"immediately take over full responsibility for Alcor['s] most advanced diagnostic product development projects\" as a vice president of research and development. (SUF \u00b6 33; SUF Ex. E at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Frappa moved to Rhode Island around May 2012 and began working on Alcor's iSED ESR analyzer. (SUF \u00b6 33; PSAUF Ex. 1 at \u00b6 8, ECF No. 169-6.) The iSED\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   competes with Alifax's analyzers by delivering blood test results for ESR in just twenty seconds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. &amp; Suppl. Compl. \u00b6 8, ECF No. 68; Defs.' Answer to Pl.'s Second Am. &amp; Suppl. Compl. &amp; First Am. Countercl. \u00b6 8, ECF No. 71.) Alcor developed the iSED in Rhode Island where it is headquartered. (PSAUF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.) Frappa remains employed by Alcor, but now resides in Europe. (PSUF \u00b6 34; PSDF \u00b6 2; Defs.' Answer to Second Am. &amp; Suppl. Compl. \u00b6 2). He remains an Italian citizen. (PSUF \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When Alifax discovered the iSED had rapid analytical capabilities comparable to its devices, it cried foul. It accused Alcor and Frappa of misappropriating its trade secrets and using its proprietary information to develop the iSED, thereby violating the Rhode Island Uniform Trade Secrets Act (Count II) and breaching the confidential relationship between Frappa and Alifax (Count III).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Second Am. &amp; Suppl.

Alifax argues that because Frappa's duty arose out of his contractual employment with Sire, Count III \"sounds in contract\" and triggers Rhode Island's related choice-of-law principles, favoring Italy. (Pl.'s Mot. 12-13.) Alcor stresses that Count III does not plead breach of contract; it pleads breach of fiduciary duty, which is a tort. (Defs.' Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (\"Defs.'

Furthermore, while the various domiciles, residences, places of business and incorporation of the parties weigh equally, Italy is plainly the center of the relationship.

And Italian law does not, as Alcor argues, infringe on important Rhode Island policy prerogatives by altering a\n   <em>\n    Rhode Island\n   </em>\n   employee's fiduciary duties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n 9.) When the alleged duty arose, Frappa was employed in Italy, not Rhode Island. Finally, it should not come as a great surprise to Frappa or Alcor that the confidentiality obligations of an Italian competitor's ex-employee arising from the former employment relationship performed exclusively in Italy would be interpreted under Italian law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court finds that Italian law will govern Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   B. Count II: Trade Secret Misappropriation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   1. Can Italian Law Govern Frappa's Duty of Secrecy?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In Count II, Alifax alleges that Alcor and Frappa violated the Rhode Island Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\"RIUTSA\"), R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 6-41-1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , by misappropriating its trade secrets. Misappropriation is defined to include the acquisition of a trade secret \"by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7278561\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/24/514/#p534\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6-41-1(2)(i). \"Improper means\" include a \"breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7278561\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/24/514/#p534\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 6-41-1(1). RIUTSA also prohibits disclosure or use of another's trade secret without consent by a person who (1) used \"improper means\" to acquire it, or (2) \"knew or had reason to know\" that the trade secret was \"[d]erived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain its secrecy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7278561\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/24/514/#p534\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6-41-1(2)(ii)(B). The statute does not enumerate the possible sources of a defendant's \"duty to maintain secrecy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Alifax theorizes that Frappa's duty for RIUTSA purposes arose from his employment\n   relationship with the company. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Its Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Reply\") 3-4, ECF No. 173.) Thus, Alifax contends that the Italian law bearing on Count III would also serve to define the substance of this single element of its RIUTSA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Defendants dismiss out of hand the idea that Italian law could supply such a duty here. Instead, they argue that where Alifax has sued a Rhode Island corporation under a Rhode Island statute, Rhode Island law must define any duty of secrecy. This interpretation, however logical, conflicts with RIUTSA's plain language. The statute's text is broad; it does not impose limits on the source of the duty of secrecy. For example, a duty may arise from an express contract.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Roton Barrier, Inc. v.

Alcor cites no authority holding that the law of another jurisdiction, if applicable, cannot be the source of a defendant's confidentiality obligations under RIUTSA. And while Alifax's citations are also thin, the Court finds no persuasive justification for Alcor's narrower interpretation. Such an outcome would be inconsistent with RIUTSA's liberal terms, the diverse sources of parties' duties of secrecy reflected in case law, and one of the broad motivating policies of trade secret law: \"the maintenance of standards of commercial ethics.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Uniform Trade Secrets Act \u00a7 1 cmt.

It is clear, however, the \"circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain [the] secrecy,\" R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 6-41-1(2)(ii)(B)(III), of Alifax's confidential information would be the same circumstances creating a duty under Count III, i.e., Frappa's employment relationship with Sire. Count III and the \"duty\" element of Count II thus should rise or fall together. And as explained at length above, under the circumstances of this case, Frappa's duty of confidentiality to Alifax is governed by the law of Italy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   2. The \"Reasonableness\" of Alifax's Conduct\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Alifax has also asked the Court to find that Italian law shall govern whether Alifax's efforts to maintain the secrecy of its trade secret information were \"reasonable under the circumstances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   R.I.

The relevant section of the agreement states that employees\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   must maintain absolute secrecy regarding the interest of the company; furthermore, they shall not profit, to the detriment of the employer, from what is the object of their duties in the company ...\n   <em>\n    nor abuse, after terminating the employment relationship and as a form of unfair competition, information obtained during their period of employment\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   (PSUF Ex.

But the declaration of Alcor's expert implies that was the case, which accords with the unrebutted assertion of Giovanni Duic, Sire's managing director, that the NCBA was \"applicable to Sire's industry.\" (Duic Aff. \u00b6 7, ECF No. 165.) Regardless, the NCBA was incorporated into Frappa's initial hiring letter. An Italian Court would therefore likely conclude that Sire and Frappa adopted the agreement's provisions by their own initiative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mandruzzato &amp; Bittolo,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 6-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   What remains is how to interpret the emphasized language above.

(Pl.'s Mot. 11.) Although its expert does not articulate the contours of a specific interpretation, he urges the Court to use a \"common sense\" construction of \"unfair competition\" rather than a \"technical legal definition\" such as that provided by Article 2598.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Toffoletto Rebuttal Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Such an interpretation is boundless. It suggests an Italian court would enforce a duty of secrecy on an ex-employee that is indefinite both in scope and duration. This is incompatible with the Italian Supreme Court's holdings that technical know-how acquired while working for an ex-employer may be used in future employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franzosi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 2-4. It would also be contrary to Article 1366, which requires every contract to be interpreted \"in good faith.\" The proposed construction would place a more stringent burden on former employees than current employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.c. 2105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Court finds that a narrower reading is more likely consistent with the subjective intent of the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.c. 1362; Chiaves,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 8. Alcor's expert directs the Court to Article 2598, which provides a codified definition of unfair competition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Subject to the provisions concerning the protection of distinctive signs and patent rights, acts of unfair competition are performed by whoever: ... (3) avails himself directly or indirectly of any other means which do not conform with the principles of correct behavior in the trade and are likely to injure another's business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   C.c. 2598. It is widely agreed that this provision prohibits ex-employees from using an employer's confidential information in subsequent employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Franzosi,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 2-3 (and cases cited therein);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Toffoletto Rebuttal Decl. \u00a7 12; Lanzavecchia Decl. \u00b6 16. As stated by the Italian Supreme Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   The use by an ex-employee, in later employment, of processes which are confidential and owned by his ex-employer (and known by the ex-employee because of his previous experience and because of his position as an ex-employee) constitutes activity which is not professionally correct behavior.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Franzosi,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 2. Article 2598 does not prohibit an ex-employee from using experience or technical know-how developed on the job in future positions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franzosi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 2-4 (citing, e.g., Cass., sez. lav., 13 novembre 1972, n. 1156, Guir it. 1976; Corte di Appello, 27 maggio 1977; Corte di Appello, 24 gennaio 1973).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court agrees with Alifax's expert that the NCBA does not expressly refer to Article 2598 and that some degree of redundancy may be injected into the agreement by interpreting \"unfair competition\" in accord with that provision. It is not, however, \"senseless.\" (Toffoletto Rebuttal Decl. \u00b6 3.) Article 2598 applies only to \"entrepreneurs\" who are competitors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mario Franzosi,\n   <em>\n    Italy: Overview\n   </em>\n   , in 2 Trade Secrets Throughout the World \u00a7 22:2; Paulo Auteri,\n   <em>\n    Brief Report on Italian Unfair Competition Law\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   Law Against Unfair Competition: Towards a New Paradigm In Europe? 152 (2007) (\"According to the prevailing opinion, unfair competition law only applies to competitive activities that are committed by one entrepreneur to harm another competitor.\"); (Toffoletto Decl. \u00b6 18). Thus, by definition, Article 2598's ban on unfair competition can only apply post-employment. The NCBA creates a similar duty that only arises \"\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   terminating the employment relationship\" (PSUF Ex. D at 5, (emphasis added) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no incongruity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Civil Code Article 1371 provides additional guidance. If other criteria have failed to establish a satisfactory meaning, Article 1371 instructs that an agreement should be construed to balance the parties' opposing interests. C.c. 1371. Taken together, Article 2598, Article 2105, and the rulings of the Italian Supreme Court demonstrate an unmistakable desire to safeguard the confidential and proprietary information of employers from unfair exploitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court accordingly finds that Frappa owes Alifax, which now stands in Sire's shoes, a post-employment duty of loyalty prohibiting the disclosure or use of Alifax's confidential or proprietary information in a manner that was likely to injury Alifax's business. This duty does not encompass Frappa's professional skills or technical know-how, even if acquired or improved during his work for Sire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   D.
