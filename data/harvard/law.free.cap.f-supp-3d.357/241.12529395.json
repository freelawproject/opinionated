(Dkt. 1). This Court has jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Presently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Dkt. 11; Dkt. 15), and Plaintiff's reply (Dkt. 16). For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiff's motion (Dkt. 11) is granted, the Commissioner's motion (Dkt. 15) is denied, and the matter is remanded to the Commissioner for further administrative proceedings consistent with this Decision and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff protectively filed her application for DIB on August 20, 2014.

On December 19, 2016, the ALJ issued an unfavorable decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-55).

Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last met the insured status requirements of the Act on June 30, 2018. (Dkt. 7 at 44). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since August 4, 2014, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of: \"anxiety; depression; left knee arthritis status post-surgery; fibromyalgia ; complex regional pain syndrome ; obesity ; Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ; and history of herniated discs status post spinal fusion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of endometriosis and migraine headaches were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44-45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 1.04, 12.04, and\n   12.06 in reaching her conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a range of sedentary work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   is limited to occasional climbing of ramps or stairs; occasional climbing of ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; and occasional balancing, stooping, crouching, kneeling, and crawling; able to sit for one hour, and then stand for 15 minutes, alternating throughout the workday; is limited to occasional exposure to unprotected heights; occasional exposure to moving mechanical parts; occasional operating a motor vehicle; occasional exposure to temperature extremes; able to perform simple, routine, repetitive tasks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of information clerk, machine tender, and order clerk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-54). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

(Dkt. 11-1 at 33-40). For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the ALJ erred in evaluating the opinion evidence of Dr. Teerlinck, and that this error necessitates remand for further administrative proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Assessment of Opinion Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because Plaintiff's claim was filed before March 27, 2017, the ALJ was required to apply the treating physician rule, under which a treating physician's opinion is entitled to \"controlling weight\" when it is \"well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] case record[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

Plaintiff's impairments were likely to produce \"good days\" and \"bad days,\" and she would be absent from work as a result of her impairments or treatment more than four days per month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The ALJ afforded Dr. Teerlinck's opinion \"some weight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52). The ALJ explained that while she agreed with Dr. Teerlinck that Plaintiff was capable of performing a low-stress job and could lift ten pounds, there was \"little evidence in Dr. Teerlinck's records to support her opinions that the claimant would need breaks three to four times a day or miss more than four days of work a month.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ did not address Dr. Teerlinck's assessment of Plaintiff's ability to walk, sit, stoop, crouch, climb stairs and ladders, or her need to shift positions at will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court has reviewed the medical record, which contains visit notes from Dr. Teerlinck from January 2015 through January 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 873-81, 977-84). The visit notes reveal ongoing complaints of pain, including pain while sitting, standing, and walking, difficulty walking, and Plaintiff's complaints of needing to reposition frequently. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 873, 876, 879, 880, 979). The records also reveal that Plaintiff received\n   a steroid injection in her back and a nerve block in her left foot, and required visits to urgent care and the emergency room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 873, 878, 979). At the administrative hearing, Plaintiff testified that she has had fourteen surgeries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76). In other words, Dr. Teerlinck's treatment notes, as well as other information in the record, appear to support Dr. Teerlinck's assessment of Plaintiff's limitations, including her need for breaks and absences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without further explanation by the ALJ, the Court is unclear as to why, specifically, the ALJ chose to reject Dr. Teerlinck's opinion on these issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hayden v.

Further, sedentary work requires occasional walking, while Dr. Teerlinck opined that Plaintiff had significant limitations for walking, including that she was unable to walk one city block without rest or severe pain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, while the RFC provides Plaintiff with the ability to sit for one hour, and then stand for 15 minutes, alternating throughout the workday, the ALJ did not discuss why she declined to adopt Dr. Teerlinck's opinion that Plaintiff can sit for only 30 minutes at one time, or her opinion that Plaintiff would need to shift positions at will. The Court is cognizant that \"[i]n resolving evidence, an ALJ is entitled to accept parts of a doctor's opinion and reject others....

The ALJ's failure to consider this factor is problematic, as other medical opinions in the record are consistent with Dr. Teerlinck's assessment of Plaintiff's limitations. Specifically, Plaintiff's chiropractor, Jordan Conrad, D.C., opined that Plaintiff could walk only one to two city blocks without pain, sit for thirty minutes at one time, was limited to standing/walking for two hours in an eight-hour day, and would be absent more than four days per month. (Dkt. 7 at 1067-69). Further, the consultative examiner, Harbinder Toor, M.D., opined that Plaintiff had moderate to severe limitations for standing, walking, squatting, bending, and lifting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 744). In light of the evidence in the record supporting Dr. Teerlinck's assessment of Plaintiff's limitations, it was error for the ALJ to reject those assessed limitations without further explanation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

Further explanation is required before rejecting an opinion by a treating source, particularly where information in the treatment notes document Plaintiff's complaints, and the treating source identifies objective findings for Plaintiff's impairments. Accordingly, remand is required.
