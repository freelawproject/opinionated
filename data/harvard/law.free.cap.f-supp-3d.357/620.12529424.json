Having considered the matter fully, and being otherwise sufficiently advised, the undersigned will grant Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Third Amended Complaint [DE 60].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 2, 2014, Plaintiff was allegedly raped in her University of Kentucky (\"UK\") dorm room by John Doe (\"Student B\"), [redacted]. [DE 57, at 2-3]. While Plaintiff resided in a UK dorm room, she was enrolled as a freshman student at Bluegrass Community and Technical College (\"BCTC\"), a community college located on UK's campus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Also on October 2, 2014, Plaintiff called the UK Police Department from her dorm room to report the alleged rape.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. UK Police Officer Laura Andrews (now Sizemore) responded to Plaintiff's call.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Then, Officer Andrews drove Plaintiff and Plaintiff's roommate to UK's Chandler Hospital, where Plaintiff received a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (\"SANE\") examination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 3, 2014, Officer Andrews notified Director of the Office of Student Conduct Denise Simpson, the acting Dean of Students, of the alleged rape. [DE 57, at 4; DE 60, at 4]. Shortly after the October 2, 2014 incident, Plaintiff was allegedly harassed on both campus and social media. [DE 57, at 4]. Also on October 3, 2014, UK issued Student B a no-contact order and interim suspension and notified both Plaintiff and Student B that a student disciplinary hearing was scheduled for October 8, 2014. [DE 57, at 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 8, 2014, the first student disciplinary hearing was held.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Due to a scheduling conflict in which Student B was required to appear before the Fayette District Court for an arraignment on criminal charges, Student B was unbale to attend the first hearing. [DE 60, at 5 (citing [DE 57, at 5; DE 60-2] ) ]. Prior to the first hearing, Student B notified UK of his scheduling conflict and requested a continuance of the hearing, and UK denied Student B's request. [DE 60 (citing [DE 60-2] ) ]. On October 9, 2014, the first hearing panel issued a decision, finding Student B was responsible for sexual misconduct and\n   the corrective action issued was permanent expulsion from UK. [DE 60, at 6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 15, 2014, Plaintiff dropped out of her classes at BCTC and withdrew from UK's campus housing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On October 20, 2014, Student B appealed the first hearing panel's October 9, 2014 decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On December 4, 2014, the University Appeals Board (\"UAB\") found that proceeding with the first hearing in Student B's absence constituted reversible error and remanded the matter for a new hearing. [DE 57, at 7; DE 60, at 5 (citing [DE 60-2] ) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 18, 2014, a second student disciplinary hearing was held, and on December 22, 2014, the second hearing panel found Student B was responsible for sexual misconduct and the corrective action issued was permanent expulsion from UK. [DE 57, at 7-8]. However, based on the alleged advice of UK's Violence Intervention and Prevention Center's (\"VIP Center\") counselors, Plaintiff did not attend the second hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, Plaintiff submitted a written statement to the second hearing panel that she would not attend the hearing because retelling the account of her alleged rape was not beneficial to her healing and recovery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In lieu of Plaintiff's in-person testimony at the second hearing, the second hearing panel heard a recording of Plaintiff's testimony from the first hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 28, 2014, Student B appealed the second hearing panel's decision. [DE 57, at 8; DE 60, at 6]. Meanwhile, in January 2015, Plaintiff enrolled in classes at BCTC's [redacted] campus. [DE 57, at 8]. On February 9, 2015, the UAB found that the second hearing panel hearing Plaintiff's recorded statement from the first hearing was a procedural error because the prior UAB decision rendered the record from the first hearing inadmissible. [DE 60-4]. Additionally, the UAB found the second hearing panel erred by admitting the written statements of Plaintiff and her roommate without Student B having had the opportunity to ask questions of Plaintiff and her roommate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the UAB reversed the second hearing panel's December 22, 2014 decision and remanded the matter for a new hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 26, 2015, a third hearing was held, and Plaintiff participated by telephone. [DE 57, at 9]. On April 2, 2015 the third hearing panel found Student B was responsible for sexual misconduct, and the corrective action issued was suspension for five years, with any return to UK contingent upon Student B receiving counseling with a licensed therapist regarding anger management and healthy relationship development.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 13, 2015, Student B appealed the third hearing panel's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. On June 9, 2015, the UAB found the third hearing panel erred by permitting witnesses to testify in each other's presence, prohibiting Student B's advisor from providing whispered guidance during the third hearing, and denying Student B a supplemental proceeding in which to establish sanctions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; [DE 60, at 7 (citing [DE 60-5] ) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In July 2015, Plaintiff and Director of the Office of Student Conduct Denise Simpson discussed a potential fourth hearing. [DE 57, at 10-11; DE 60, at 8]. On August 10, 2015, Plaintiff's recently retained counsel contacted Ms. Simpson via e-mail to provide notice of Plaintiff's counsel's representation, object to the fourth hearing, and assert Plaintiff, if necessary, would participate in a fourth hearing. [DE 60-6]. Additionally, Plaintiff's counsel stated, \"[Plaintiff] is in the process of enrolling for school in the fall. She does not yet have her class schedule and needs it to verify her August and September availability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Once [Plaintiff] knows her schedule going forward, I will provide you with her availability for a fourth hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On August 17, 2015, in a subsequent e-mail from Plaintiff's counsel to UK's General Counsel, Plaintiff's counsel stated, \"When [Plaintiff] makes a decision, I will let you know as well. Please keep me updated on the [Student B] timeframe moving forward.\" [DE 60-7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Throughout the summer of 2015, Plaintiff allegedly received threatening phone calls from someone with a male voice stating, \" 'This isn't over yet.' \" [DE 57, at 11]. In August 2015, Plaintiff discontinued her education at BCTC and enrolled in a dental assistance certification program with [redacted], an associate degree program that Plaintiff asserts does not provide a path toward a bachelor's degree or any other degree at UK.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 1, 2015, Plaintiff filed her First Complaint in this matter, seeking injunctive relief to require UK to comply with Title IX, damages, and other forms of relief. [DE 1]. On January 6, 2016, Defendant moved to dismiss this matter, arguing Plaintiff cannot show Defendant was deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff's complaints of harassment. [DE 5; DE 5-1]. On January 27, 2016, Plaintiff responded to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, stating, \"[Plaintiff] has not made a motion for the Court to enjoin the on-campus proceeding against Student B.\" [DE 9-1, at 14]. On January 28, 2016, after learning from Plaintiff's Response to the Motion to Dismiss [DE 9] that Plaintiff would not seek to enjoin future student disciplinary proceedings, UK's General Counsel contacted Plaintiff's counsel to schedule a fourth hearing. [DE 60-8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the Court's August 31, 2016 Order denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [DE 12], the Court found, \"The facts, up to and including the third UAB decision, are insufficient to show 'deliberate indifference' on the part of the University.\" [DE 12, at 8]. However, the Court allowed the Complaint [DE 1] to proceed on the basis that the University may have been deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff by failing to timely schedule a fourth hearing or otherwise bring this matter to a final resolution. [DE 12, at 9].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 1, 2016, Defendant attempted to schedule the fourth hearing. [DE 60, at 10 (citing [DE 57, at 12] ) ]. On October 5, 2018, Defendant set the fourth hearing for October 19, 2016. [DE 57, at 12]. The morning the fourth hearing was scheduled to start, Defendant notified Plaintiff the fourth hearing was cancelled and would be rescheduled for the week of November 14, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Defendant did not reschedule the fourth hearing until December 19, 2016, when the fourth hearing was set for January 10, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the fourth hearing, Student B was found not responsible for sexual misconduct. [DE 60, at 11 (citing [DE 57, at 13] ) ]. On January 31, 2017, Plaintiff appealed the fourth hearing panel's decision. [DE 57, at 14]. On April 8, 2017, the Sexual Misconduct Appeals Board (\"SMAB\"), previously the UAB, denied Plaintiff's appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15; [DE 60, at 12 n. 6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 20, 2018, Defendant moved for dismissal of Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint [DE 57], pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). [DE 60]. However, on August 10, 2018, the Court granted Plaintiff's Motion to Clarify [DE 65] that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [DE 60] should be treated as a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 motion and found, \"Defendant's motion goes far beyond the limitations of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion by presenting matters outside the pleadings and is therefore properly construed as a Rule 56 motion.\" [DE 76, at 2]. Accordingly, the Court held Defendant's\n   Motion to Dismiss [DE 60] in abeyance until the Parties had the opportunity to engage in limited discovery related to Defendant's argument that \" 'because the plaintiff was never a student at the University of Kentucky, she has not been deprived of educational opportunities at the University of Kentucky' \" and file supplemental briefs. [DE 76, at 3-4]. On October 24, 2018, upon the expiration of the time limits the Court set forth regarding limited discovery and the filing of the Parties' supplemental briefs [DE 82; DE 84], the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [DE 60] ceased to be held in abeyance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(d) states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.

In fact, Plaintiff was admittedly ineligible to enroll in the Blue+ program until the end of her first semester. [DE 84, at 7 (citing [DE 84-8, at 20-21] ) ]. Therefore, as Defendant correctly asserts, Plaintiff was not enrolled in either the Blue+ or Double Enrollment programs.

Instead, the Degree Pathways program appears to offer Kentucky Community and Technical College System (\"KCTCS\") students, including BCTC students, four-month course schedules that would not only satisfy the requirements for an associate's degree at KCTCS but also meet the pre-major requirements for a bachelor's degree at UK.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517709\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/127/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In essence, the Degree Pathways program provides KCTCS students with guided curriculums for associate's degrees that would satisfy the pre-major requirements for a variety of majors at the UK and prevent KCTCS students from taking courses at KCTCS community colleges, such as BCTC, that would not transfer to UK or would not fulfill the pre-major requirements for a bachelor's degree at UK. However, the Degree Pathways program does not appear to enroll KCTCS students in any UK program, and the curriculum's provided by UK encourage KCTCS students who are planning to transfer to UK to work with the UK Transfer Adviser each semester to ensure both KCTCS and UK's requirements are met.\n   <em>\n    Id.; see also\n   </em>\n   Transfer Pathway for an Associate in Arts for Anthropology, http://www.uky.edu/admission/sites/www.uky.edu.admission/files/Anthropology_Pathway_Web.pdf (last visited Dec. 26, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   By citing\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Univ. of Notre Dame Du Lac\n   </em>\n   ,] [t]he Court never questioned whether Plaintiff was a student under Title IX, assuming without discussing that the plaintiff was a beneficiary and proceeded to the deliberate indifference standard.\" [DE 84, at 12-13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Specifically, \"Gateway students are guaranteed transfer admission following completion of their first year, as long as their cumulative GPA is 3.5 or higher, and grades are a B or higher, and they are in good standing with both institutions.\" Gateway Program, https://admissions.nd.edu/gateway-program/ (last visited Dec. 26, 2018);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Gateway Program, https://www.hcc-nd.edu/gateway/ (last visited Dec. 26, 2018). While the University of Notre Dame's Gateway Program is similar to UK's Degree Pathways program in the sense that both programs offer students from a separate school a guided program of courses that will satisfy requirements for a university curriculum, the Gateway Program is distinct because it \"invites select students to enroll at Holy Cross College (Notre Dame, Indiana) for their first year of college with a guaranteed transfer agreement to Notre Dame for the start of the student's sophomore year.\" Gateway Program, https://admissions.nd.edu/gateway-program/ (last visited Dec. 26, 2018);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Gateway Program, https://www.hcc-nd.edu/gateway/ (last visited Dec. 26, 2018). Furthermore, the Gateway Program expressly states participating students are enrolled in the program, and Holy Cross College charges students who are enrolled in the program a $ 7,000 Gateway Administrative Fee. Gateway Program, https://www.hcc-nd.edu/gateway/ (last visited Dec. 26, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Unlike the Gateway Program in\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Univ. of Notre Dame Du Lac\n   </em>\n   , the Degree Pathways program in the present case does not appear to enroll students in the program or the university they wish to someday attend, guarantee admission when the student attempts to transfer, or charge students a fee to participate in the program. Accordingly, the Gateway Program in\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Univ. of Notre Dame Du Lac\n   </em>\n   is not analogous to the Degree Pathways program in the present case, and Plaintiff's assertion that she was \"a direct beneficiary of educational programs and activities of the University of Kentucky through BCTC's partnership with the University\" is unfounded. [DE 84, at 13]. Plaintiff has failed to show she is enrolled in the Degree Pathways program, or that the program is one in which a prospective transfer student can even enroll. Furthermore, since Plaintiff only attended BCTC for approximately one (1) month before dropping out, the Court is unable to ascertain whether Plaintiff intended to complete a Degree Pathways curriculum because Plaintiff did not attend BCTC long enough to complete any of the courses she would have needed to receive credit toward a bachelor's degree at UK. [DE 60, at 6]. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds Plaintiff was not enrolled at UK either through a dual-enrollment program or a pathway program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Despite not being enrolled at UK, Plaintiff argues that due to the intertwined nature of her status as a BCTC student living on UK's campus, she was deprived of educational opportunities. [DE 84, at 1-9]. Inarguably, living in a residence hall on UK's campus offered Plaintiff a variety of benefits, obligated her to pay various fees and costs associated with campus living, and required her to follow various policies and rules that she would not have been privy to had she been a BCTC student who commuted to BCTC's campus. As a BCTC student residing on UK's campus, Plaintiff \"was required to purchase the UK dining plan, [sic] and to pay mandatory fees to UK for services and activities including the student government association, student activities, student center, student\n   health plan, technology fee, Johnson Center recreation facility, and student affairs.\" [DE 84, at 1]. Additionally, \"[t]he University of Kentucky issued a UK email account and student ID number and card to Doe to facilitate her access to services and activities on campus.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2079778\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Also, \"BCTC classes were conducted on the UK campus, in buildings owned (and maintained) by UK, and leased to BCTC.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2079778\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing [DE 84-6; DE 84-8] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The unique relationship between UK and BCTC at least partially stems from the fact that BCTC was formerly Lexington Community College (\"LCC\"), \"an entity wholly owned and operated by [UK].\" [DE 84, at 2]. Once UK agreed to transfer LCC to KCTCS and rename it BCTC, UK and BCTC's relationship effectively became that of a landlord and tenant, respectively. Pursuant to UK and KCTCS's agreement, UK handles many of the maintenance and support services at BCTC, such as \"utilities including electric, gas, water, sewer, steam, chilled water, garbage and recycling collection, fire alarm inspection and monitoring, and storm water control,\" [DE 84, at 3 (citing [DE 84-6, at 23] ) ]; \"grounds maintenance ... major repairs ... vehicle maintenance, parking and transportation services for BCTC students and employees,\" [DE 84, at 3 (citing [DE 84-6, at 23-27] ) ]; UK Police providing \"services for all BCTC emergency response[s], criminal investigation[s], Minger and Clery Act reporting, general patrols, and crime prevention,\" [DE 84, at 3 (citing [DE 84-6, at 27-28] ) ]; and \"environmental health and safety services for BCTC ...,\" [DE 84, at 3-4 (citing [DE 84-6, at 28] ) ]. However, no matter where BCTC is located or what maintenance and support services UK may offer BCTC and its students who live on UK's campus, the fact remains that each benefit Plaintiff received, every fee and cost she had to pay, and every rule she had to follow had no relation to any of UK's educational programs or activities. Instead, Plaintiff's opportunities and obligations pertained to non-educational matters related to living on campus and partaking in non-educational activities, many of which were available to the general public, such as accessing UK's dining facilities, library services, bookstore services, and the VIP Center. [DE 84, at 1-8; DE 82, at 6-7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiff attempts to argue that by assigning her a UK ID number and LinkBlue account, she was given access to \"University library borrowing privileges\" and \"University computers.\" [DE 84, at 6 (citing [DE 84-8, at 9-11] ) ]. However, while Plaintiff used her UK ID number and LinkBlue account to access UK's library and computers, any public person can enter the library and access the same technology with a guest pass, so Plaintiff received no opportunity that was not also available to the general public. [DE 84-8, at 9-11]. Plaintiff's argument regarding library access illustrates one underlying issue with the present action, which is that not only was Plaintiff not participating in any UK educational programs or activities, but the activities she was participating in at UK could also be accessed by the general public and can still be accessed by Plaintiff to this day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As previously mentioned herein, the First Circuit Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Brown University\n   </em>\n   found that members of the public who avail themselves of university services and participate in university activities, such as libraries, computer labs, campus tours, public lectures, and sporting events, \"are either taking part or trying to take part of a funding recipient institution's educational program or activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown University\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517709\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/127/\">\n    896 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   132 n.6.

Since Plaintiff has failed to show she was either a UK student or enrolled in a UK education program or activity, Plaintiff lacks standing to bring the present action under Title IX, and the Court need not consider Defendant's arguments regarding the first three disciplinary hearings and Plaintiff's alleged failure to state a Title IX retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Therefore, having considered the matter fully, and being otherwise sufficiently advised,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (1) Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Third Amended Complaint [DE 60] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (2) This matter is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (3) This is a final and appealable order; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (4) The Clerk of Court shall\n   <strong>\n    FILE\n   </strong>\n   this Order under\n   <strong>\n    SEAL\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
