(SAC \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.) By 2017, Chau had moved to California and was raising capital for a new venture fund named MotiVentures. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 16, 19-20.) Chau asked Donovan if his company, Granger, which invests money on behalf of a limited number of wealthy families, (SAC \u00b6 5), \"might want to invest in or partner with MotiVentures.\" (SAC \u00b6 19.) Donovan \"confidently assured Chau that Granger would probably invest $25-50 million because his partners trusted him.\" (SAC \u00b6 26.) Donovan joked with Chau that \"if Granger declined to invest then he would offer $5,000 of his own money into Chau's fund if he could have a threesome with Chau and his wife.\" (SAC \u00b6 28.) Donovan continued to text with Chau and \"divert talk of business into talk of alcohol and sex.\" (SAC \u00b6 29;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20City%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%208-101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20City%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%208-101\">\n    \u00b6 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Chau, Donovan, and Chau's MotiVentures partners met for dinner in New York City on April 19, 2017 to discuss Granger's potential investment. (SAC \u00b6 35.) After dinner, Chau and Donovan went to a hotel bar to discuss Chau's MotiVentures partners. (SAC \u00b6 36.) Donovan \"confessed that ... he was only using his authority and influence within Granger to steer an investment to MotiVentures 'because of her,' \" and \"fe[ ]d Chau drinks, with the intent to get her drunk.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.) Donovan began \"touching Chau inappropriately,\" \"convinced Chau to ride in his Uber\" where he continued to touch her inappropriately, and \"forced his way onto the elevator\" at her hotel despite repeated objections. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.) When Chau opened the door to her hotel room, Donovan \"powerfully pushed past her into the room,\" \"began touching her in a sexual way,\" \"removed his pants and forced himself on top of her,\" and groped, kissed, digitally penetrated her, and masturbated next to her without Chau's consent. (SAC \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the April 19, 2017 encounter, Chau \"continued communicating with Donovan because she did not want to lose the potential investment,\" and Donovan continued to \"change[ ] the subject to sex.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 43, 45, 47, 49, 61.) In May 2017 Donovan informed Chau that Granger would not be investing in MotiVentures. (SAC \u00b6 46.) He also informed her that \"he would find a spot for Chau to work for him at Granger\" if her position at MotiVentures was terminated. (SAC \u00b6 46.) Donovan told Chau that getting her a job would be \"99% [his] call,\" and quoted her a starting salary of $250,000 with bonuses around $500,000. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.) He also stated that Chau \"might be able to do some things that would get [him] to pay [her] more,\" which Chau understood to refer to sexual acts\n   with him and his wife. (SAC \u00b6 53.) Donovan and Chau discussed \"start dates and how Chau would have to come to New York City to interview.\" (SAC \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Donovan informed Chau he wanted her to meet \"his bosses,\" the two named partners of Granger, but did not want to pay for Chau to fly to New York. (SAC \u00b6 56.) He instead suggested she meet him in San Diego, CA in October 2017, where he would be attending a conference, to discuss the job. (SAC \u00b6 56.) In San Diego they \"discussed salaries, the type of work Chau would do, and Granger in general.\" (SAC \u00b6 58.) Donovan made Chau understand that her job responsibilities would include investment advising, sales, and operations. (SAC \u00b6 59.) During the meeting, Donovan groped and touched Chau inappropriately while in San Diego at a hotel bar despite her repeated objections. (SAC \u00b6 62.) Shortly after Donovan returned to New York City, he informed Chau that Granger could no longer hire her. (SAC \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Chau spoke with friends and various mental health professionals about her experience and \"came to realize that the treatment that she had suffered\" by Donovan \"was wrong.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 65-68.)

(SAC \u00b6\u00b6 28, 33, 39, 43, 47, 53, 64.) She further alleges he masturbated next to her in the hotel room in April 2017 without her consent. (SAC \u00b6 39.)

Chau has adequately pled causation. The campaign of distress Chau complains of took place between March and late October 2017. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 28, 58.) Chau asserts that contemporaneous with the events of April 19, 2017 she \"greatly and imminently feared [Donovan] would\" engage in forced sexual intercourse, and that he performed acts of sexual battery on Chau that caused her a \"great deal of pain.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.) In June and July, she repeatedly told Donovan that his sexual comments offended her and that she felt \"angry\" about their non-consensual sexual encounter in April 2017. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.) She asserts that \"[t]hroughout 2017, Chau had felt uneasy about the pressure that Donovan maintained for her to engage in sex with him and/or his wife,\" and that the persistent sexual pressure left her \"depressed,\" \"upset,\" and manifested in \"physical symptoms.\" (SAC \u00b6 64.) She continued to feel \"angry, upset,\" and suffered from \"significant anxiety\" in the fall of 2017 based on Donovan's conduct, which had continued through October 2017. (SAC \u00b6 65;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 58, 62.) She saw a therapist, psychiatrist, and counselor, and called a rape crisis hotline to seek help. (SAC \u00b6 67.) She was \"diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic\n   stress disorder and depression\" as a result of Donovan's conduct. (SAC \u00b6 69.) Given these facts, Chau has sufficiently pled that Donovan's alleged acts of sexual battery and continued sexual harassment were related to emotional distress experienced by Chau.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.
