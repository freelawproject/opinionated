She alleged that her disability began on December 30, 2013, when she was 50 years old. R. 92-93, 100-01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") denied the applications, R. 98, 107, 115-21, and Bonilla-Bukhari sought review by an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), R. 131-37. An initial hearing was held on\n   April 19, 2016, before an ALJ. R. 45-69. The ALJ scheduled a supplemental hearing in order to consider information contained in Bonilla-Bukhari's Worker's Compensation records, R. 64-65, 68, 72, which was held on August 2, 2016, before the same ALJ, R. 70-91. In a written decision dated September 14, 2016, the ALJ found Bonilla-Bukhari not disabled within the meaning of the Act. R. 20-28. On November 9, 2017, the Appeals Council denied Bonilla-Bukhari's request for review of the ALJ's decision, making the ALJ's decision the final decision of the Commissioner. R. 1-6. This action followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Hearing Before the ALJ\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Bonilla-Bukhari was represented by attorney Connor Devereaux at her hearings. R. 48, 70, 72. During the first hearing, Bonilla-Bukhari testified that she lived on Staten Island on the second floor of a house with her husband. R. 50. There were approximately nine stairs leading to her apartment. R. 51. She had four grown daughters and two grandchildren. R. 51. She did not have a driver's license, traveled to the hearing by taxi, rarely took public transportation, and when she did take public transportation, had to travel with someone else. R. 50-51. When she would take the train, she needed to use the elevator. R. 52. Her husband was supporting her, R. 52; he did most of the housework and laundry, R. 63; and her brother and sister would cook for her and assist her during the day while her husband was at work, R. 64. In a typical day, Bonilla-Bukhari would stay in bed and watch TV, and one of her siblings would stay home with her during the day to prepare food for her and help her use the bathroom. R. 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Bonilla-Bukhari explained the incident that caused the onset of her alleged disability. R. 55. While working as a Certified Nurse's Assistant (\"CNA\") at Staten Island Care Center in June 2012,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 53, Bonilla-Bukhari slipped on water and toothpaste that was on the floor of the hospital's psychiatric unit while she was walking over to render care to one of the residents of that unit. R. 53, 55. When she slipped, her \"whole body was flipped on the floor,\" and she injured her left leg, left arm, her lower back, and buttocks, which all hit the floor. R. 55. She also injured her right hand while trying to prevent the fall. R. 55. Six months after her fall, on December 31, 2012, Bonilla-Bukhari attempted to return to work at Staten Island Care Center, but quit after three hours because she could not perform the physical demands of the job.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 53-54. In 2014, she made some income from selling food that she prepared at home. R. 54, 56. In January 2015, Bonilla-Bukhari attempted to return to work as a CNA at a different hospital, but had to leave during orientation because of pain in her leg. R. 53, 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Bonilla-Bukhara also testified about her impairments. In addition to pain in her left knee and left leg, she experienced severe issues with muscle spasms in her back. R. 57. She testified that she could not receive cortisone injections for her back pain because the shots \"lock[ her] leg.\" R. 57. Since having an arthroscopy and a meniscectomy on her knee in 2015, her knee has gotten worse. R. 57. She testified that she uses a cane to walk all the time, including in her house, because her left leg trembles and can cause her to fall. R. 57-58. She can stand for about 20 minutes before having to sit down because of pain in her leg. R 58-59. She also experiences swelling in her legs, which she addresses by elevating her legs while in bed, sometimes using a pillow for assistance. R. 59. In addition, she has edema in her shoulder, which causes pain, R. 60, and she has herniated discs in her neck from a prior accident, which occurred in 2003. R. 55-56. She has been taking\n   Percocet for pain management since 2012. R. 62-63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Bonilla-Bukhara also testified that she experiences problems with \"digestion and bowel movement[s],\" including constipation, and that the medication she takes for this causes symptoms including \"[v]omiting ... nausea, dizz[iness], [and] headaches.\" R. 60. She has a history of breast cancer, and experiences symptoms including numbness and \"pain in [her] nipple to [her] armpit,\" and having her arm \"lock[ ],\" which makes it difficult to comb her hair, dress herself, and tie her shoes. R. 61. Bonilla-Bukhara testified about her asthma and breathing difficulties, explaining that she takes Advair 150, Azmacort, and albuterol, and becomes winded after walking approximately half a block. R. 61-62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Bonilla-Bukhari's attorney asked her several questions about treatment of her left knee injuries. R. 73-77. Bonilla-Bukhari testified about her conversations with doctors about her need for future knee surgery. R. 73. She stated that she has gotten three or four opinions, and has been advised that she may need a partial or full knee replacement, and that continuing to drain the cyst behind her knee may not be fruitful as it will keep coming back. R. 73. In response to questioning by the ALJ, she testified that in 2015, Dr. Michael Kang performed surgery to repair a torn meniscus. R. 73-74. Following the surgery, she attended physical therapy, though there was some delay in beginning physical therapy, apparently due to a misunderstanding between Bonilla-Bukhari and her doctor. R. 74. She attended physical therapy approximately three or four times after her surgery, but stopped because the physical therapy began to cause muscle spasms and pain in her leg and back. R. 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During the second hearing, Bonilla-Bukhari again testified about her use of her cane, explaining that she uses it \"[b]ecause there's times when [her] leg really, really gets swollen,\" and because her leg \"gets so numbed up [she] cannot move [it].\" R. 76. She explained that she used her cane outside, and in her house sometimes, though she can also use the walls for support in her house. R. 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Bonilla-Bukhari also testified about why she can no longer perform her work as a CNA. She explained that because of pain and issues with her leg and left side, she would not be able to move patients, and is not able to stand up for very long. R. 76-77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The ALJ then heard testimony from a vocational expert (\"VE\"), Frank Linder. R. 77-91. The VE identified Bonilla-Bukhari's past jobs as \"nursing assistant\" and \"direct care aid,\" which both have an exertional level of \"medium.\" R. 83. However, the VE found that Bonilla-Bukhari performed both these jobs at the \"heavy\" level. R. 83-84. The ALJ then posed several hypothetical questions to the VE. First, the ALJ asked the VE to \"assume a hypothetical individual of the claimant's age and education with the past jobs\" the VE had identified, restricted to light work, with additional limitations, including that the particular person \"could stand or walk for a total of four hours in an eight-hour workday,\" and could \"reach frequently [w]ith their upper left extremity, ... can handle frequently, finger frequently and feel frequently,\" assuming the person is right-hand dominant. R. 84. The ALJ further instructed the VE to assume that the hypothetical person could \"occasionally climb ramps and stairs, never climb ladders, ropes or scaffolds, occasionally balance and occasionally stoop, but never kneel, crouch or crawl,\" and that the individual \"should never be expos[ed] to unprotected heights,\" should never operate a motor vehicle, and \"should have no concentrated exposure to dusts, odors, fumes or\n   pulmonary irritants.\" R. 84. In addition, the ALJ instructed the VE to assume that this person \"should be allowed to sit or stand alternatively at will providing this person is not off task more than five percent of the work period.\" R. 84. In addition, the VE was to assume that \"this individual could occasionally push or pull.\" R. 84\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The VE confirmed that such a hypothetical individual could not perform any of the prior jobs Bonilla-Bukhari performed, either as she actually performed them or as they are generally performed in the national economy. R. 85. However, the VE testified that the hypothetical individual could perform the positions of recreation aide, routing clerk, and information clerk. R. 85. The ALJ next asked the VE to assume an additional limitation, which was that the hypothetical individual \"would be limited to jobs that can be performed by using a hand-held assistive device only for uneven terrain or prolonged ambulation.\" R. 85. The VE testified that such an individual would be able to perform the jobs of routing clerk and information clerk, but not recreation aide. R. 85. In addition, such a person would be able to perform the job of inspector. R. 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The ALJ asked the VE to assume that the hypothetical individual would have to use the handheld assistive device at all times when standing. R. 86. The ALJ stated that this would not change his assessment of available jobs. R. 86. The ALJ asked the VE to assume that this hypothetical person was off task twenty percent of the time, or off task fifteen percent of the time. The VE stated that while the individual could be off task fifteen percent of the time, at twenty percent the jobs would not be available. R. 86. The VE further testified that the hypothetical individual could be absent once per month, but more than once per month would be unacceptable. The VE stated that the information about the jobs he discussed was based on the information contained in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\"DOT\"), and that information about the percentage of time off-task and about absences was based upon his work experience and reading material, as was information about \"the sit/stand option.\" R. 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Bonilla-Bukhari's attorney examined the VE. The attorney asked the VE whether Bonilla-Bukhari had any transferrable skills from her past job to sedentary work, and the VE confirmed that she did not. R. 87. The attorney asked whether Bonilla-Bukhari would be able to perform any jobs at the light level if she were to need a cane for all standing and walking, and the VE stated that she could perform the jobs of routing clerk and information clerk, but not the job of inspector. R. 87. The ALJ interjected, explaining that in his earlier hypothetical, he had meant to ask the VE to assume that the individual needed the cane for all standing. R. 88. The VE stated that there was a difference in job availability depending on whether the cane was needed for all standing, versus for all standing and walking. R. 88. The attorney asked the VE whether an individual \"who needs a cane at all times for standing and walking would be generally limited to type sedentary occupat[ion]s,\" to which the VE replied affirmatively, explaining that this was \"because usually there's involvement of one hand depending on the kind of work the individual may do.\" R. 88. The VE then identified the additional job of office helper as a position the hypothetical individual, as described by the attorney, could perform. R. 90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Medical Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Commissioner has provided a summary of the medical evidence contained in the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   at 4-18. The Court had directed the parties to specify any objections they had to the opposing party's summary of the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, filed May 11, 2018 (Docket # 12), \u00b6 5. Plaintiff has not provided a summary of the medical record. Accordingly, the Court adopts the Commissioner's summary of the medical evidence as accurate and complete for purpose of the issues raised in this suit. We discuss the medical evidence pertinent to the adjudication of this case in Section III below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The ALJ's Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The ALJ denied Bonilla-Bukhari's application for DIB and SSI on September 14, 2016. R. 20-28. Following the five-step test set forth in SSA regulations, the ALJ found that Bonilla-Bukhari met the insured status requirements and had not engaged in \"substantial gainful activity since December 30, 2013, the alleged [disability] onset date.\" R. 21. At step two, the ALJ found that Bonilla-Bukhari had the following severe impairments: \"left knee osteoarthritis and Baker's cyst, degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine with radiculopathy, asthma, and peptic ulcer.\" R. 21. The ALJ also noted that Bonilla-Bukhari had the other nonsevere impairments of hemorrhoids, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic rhinitis, status post right mastectomy, and elevated fasting glucose. R. 21. At step three, the ALJ concluded that none of Bonilla-Bukhari's severe impairments singly or in combination met or medically equaled an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (the \"Listings\"). R. 22. The ALJ considered Listings 1.02, 1.04, and 3.03, in determining that Bonilla-Bukhari did not exhibit the necessary medical criteria. R. 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Before moving to step four, the ALJ assessed Bonilla-Bukhari's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"). R. 22-26. The ALJ determined that Bonilla-Bukhari retained the RFC \"to perform light work\" with the following limitations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   she can stand or walk for a total of 4 hours in an 8-hour workday; occasionally push/pull; she can frequently reach in all directions; handle, finger, and feel with the upper left extremity (claimant is right-hand dominant); the ability to occasionally climb ramps and stairs; the inability to climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; she can occasionally balance and stoop; she can never kneel, crouch, or crawl; she needs to avoid all exposure to unprotected heights and operating a motor vehicle; she needs to avoid concentrated exposure to dust, odors, fumes, or pulmonary irritants; she is limited to jobs that can be performed while using a hand held assistive device at all times when standing and walking; and she needs to be allowed to sit or stand alternatively at will provided that she is not off task more than 10% of the work period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   R. 22. In making this determination, the ALJ accorded varying weights to the opinions of Dr. Lamberto Flores, Dr. Chitoor Govindaraj, and Dr. Mahendra Misra. R. 26. Having determined Bonilla-Bukhari's RFC, at step four, the ALJ concluded that Bonilla-Bukhari could not perform any past relevant work. R. 26. At step five, the ALJ found that Bonilla-Bukhari's ability to perform \"all or substantially all of the requirements\" of a level of the \"full range of light work\" was \"impeded by additional limitations.\" R. 27. However, based on the testimony of the VE, the ALJ determined that Bonilla-Bukhari \"would be able to perform the requirements of representative occupations,\" including routing clerk, information clerk, and office helper. R. 27. The ALJ thus determined that Bonilla-Bukhari was not disabled.

Dec. 29, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Here, while the ALJ did not explicitly discuss Bonilla-Bukhari's obesity, he considered the opinions of physicians who themselves considered her weight. For example, the ALJ gave great weight to the opinions of Dr. Flores, who observed that Bonilla-Bukhari was obese during a June 9, 2014, consultative examination. R. 26, 334-37. While determining Bonilla-Bukhari's RFC, the ALJ also considered notes from examinations by Dr. Michael Kang from 2015, in which he repeatedly noted that Bonilla-Bukhari was obese.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 25, 682, 701. While Dr. Misra did not explicitly note that Bonilla-Bukhari was obese, he did note that Bonilla-Bukhari had a height of five feet two inches and a weight of 176 pounds, R. 500, which would mean Bonilla-Bukhari had a Body Mass Index between 30 and 31, making her obese,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Body Mass Index Table (annexed to Pl. Mem.) (\"BMI Table\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Having reviewed the medical record, we are not aware of - and Bonilla-Bukhari does not point to - any notes from any of the providers who examined or treated her indicating that her obesity had any particular impact on any of her impairments. Case law holds that an \"ALJ's obligation to discuss a claimant's obesity alone, or in combination with other impairments, diminishes where evidence in the record indicates the claimant's treating or examining sources did not consider obesity as a significant factor in relation to the claimant's ability to perform work related activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Battle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205089502\">\n    2014 WL 5089502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Thus, as was true in\n   <em>\n    Battle\n   </em>\n   , in this case, \"the record reflects that plaintiff's treating and consultative examining medical sources were aware of plaintiff's obesity, but there is no indication that any medical\n   source attributed any symptoms, limitations of function, or exacerbation of other impairments to her weight.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205089502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In addition, \"during the hearing before the ALJ, plaintiff was not questioned by her attorney about any specific functional limitations relating to obesity, nor did she allege obesity as a disabling impairment or include obesity as a factor limiting her ability to work in any of the disability reports submitted in association with her claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. Under these circumstances, the Court concludes that the ALJ did not err.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Vocational Expert's Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Bonilla-Bukhari argues that the ALJ erred by finding that she could perform three light duty jobs identified by the VE, while also according great weight to the opinion of two examining physicians who imposed limitations with respect to prolonged standing.

While Bonilla-Bukhari noted that the VE stated that his testimony was consistent with the DOT, Bonilla-Bukhari questions whether this is so, \"given that the DOT classifies the positions identified by the VE as light duty.\" Pl. Mem. at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   During the hearing, the VE identified three jobs that a person with the claimant's RFC and the need to use a hand-held assistive device at all times when standing or walking could perform: routing clerk, information clerk, and office helper. R 88, 90. The VE testified that his testimony was consistent with information in the DOT, and that he used his own \"work and experience and reading material\" to answer questions regarding the percentage of time the worker could be off task, the acceptability of absences, and the availability of a sit/stand option. R 87. In his decision, the ALJ found that \"the vocational expert's testimony [was] consistent with the information contained in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles.\" R. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   At the outset, substantial evidence supports the ALJ's determination of Bonilla-Bukhari's RFC. The ALJ found that Bonilla-Bukhari retained the ability to perform light work with several limitations, including the ability to stand or walk for a total of only four hours out of an eight hour workday, that she must be able to use a hand held assistive device at all times while standing and walking, and that she needs to be allowed to sit or stand alternatively at will, in addition to other environmental and assertive limitations. R. 22. The ALJ properly accounted for Dr. Misra's finding that it would be \"difficult for [Bonilla-Bukhari] to do jobs which require prolonged standing, sitting, walking, climbing, crouching, bending, crawling, lifting pulling or pushing,\" R. 501, by requiring that Bonilla-Bukhari be \"allowed to sit or stand alternatively at will,\" R. 22, as well as by limiting pushing and pulling, climbing ramps and stairs to \"occasionally,\" R. 22, and by finding that she could \"never kneel, crouch, or crawl,\" R. 22. This RFC is also supported by Dr. Flores' opinion that Bonilla-Bukhari must avoid \"prolonged walking, standing, climbing stairs and heavy lifting.\" R. 337.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Substantial evidence also supports the ALJ's finding that the VE's testimony was consistent with the DOT. \"[A] vocational expert is not required to identify\n   with specificity the figures or sources supporting his conclusion, at least where he identified the sources generally.\"\n   <em>\n    McIntyre v.

The VE identified three jobs that would satisfy these criteria. Of course, \"[t]he Commissioner need show only one job existing in the national economy that [a claimant] can perform.\"\n   <em>\n    Bavaro v.
