Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff initiated the above-captioned action on July 31, 2017 by filing a complaint against Defendants pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   , in connection with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services' (\"USCIS\") denial of his I-485 application to adjust status. (Doc. No. 1.) On October 6, 2017, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (Doc. No. 8), along with a brief in support (Doc. No. 10). On November 2, 2017, noting that Plaintiff was required to file a brief in opposition to the motion on or before October 31, 2017 pursuant to Local Rule 7.6, the Court directed Plaintiff to show cause on or before November 8, 2017, why Defendants' motion should not be granted. (Doc. No. 12.) On November 7, 2017, Plaintiff filed both a brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 13), as well as a document containing Plaintiff's \"response to the order to show cause and motion for leave to amend the complaint\" (Doc. No. 14). Having been given leave to file an amended complaint on November 13, 2017 (Doc. No. 16), Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on November 17, 2017 (Doc. No. 17). After obtaining an extension of time \"to file a consolidated reply and answer or response to\" both Plaintiff's brief in opposition and amended complaint (Doc. Nos. 18, 19), Defendants filed a \"reply in support of their motion to dismiss and opposition to the amended complaint\" on December 15, 2017 (Doc. No. 20). Accordingly, although Plaintiff filed an amended complaint (Doc. No. 17), subsequent to Defendants' filing of a motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 8), due to the parties' respective filings, the Court considers Defendants' motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 8), in connection with Plaintiff's amended complaint (Doc. No.17).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 2, 2018, after reviewing \"the amended complaint, the parties' briefing, and the relevant authorities\" and concluding that \"disposition of Defendants' motion to dismiss [was] unwarranted because the record presently before the Court [was] insufficient so as to permit the Court to examine the propriety of USCIS' denial of Plaintiff's application to adjust status[,]\" the Court ordered the parties to file supplemental briefing addressing certain issues identified by the Court in relation to the motion to dismiss, and directed the parties to submit \"the full administrative record pertaining to Plaintiff's I-485 application to adjust status with USCIS.\" (Doc. No. 24). The parties having complied with the Court's directive (Doc. Nos. 25, 26, 27, 28), Defendants' motion is now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Allegations in the Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff is an adult Haitian citizen and national currently residing in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. (Doc. No. 17 \u00b6 6.) Defendants, all of whom are named in their\n   official capacities, include the acting director of the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") and various individuals employed by USCIS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-10.) Plaintiff's allegations stem from USCIS' January 28, 2016 denial of his I-485 application for adjustment of status to that of a permanent resident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff entered the United States through Miami, Florida in September of 2009 pursuant to a C1/D visa issued to him on July 27, 2009 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12), which indicates that Plaintiff was employed as a janitor for a cruise line known as Celebrity Cruises (Doc. Nos. 10 at 2-3, 17-1 at 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having possessed a stamped I-94 arrival record, \"Plaintiff has been continuously present in the United States since September 6, 2009.\" (Doc. No. 17-1.) In accordance with Section 244(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), Haiti has been designated for temporary protected status (\"TPS\") by DHS since January of 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Haiti's TPS designation has since \"been extended several times, and has not lapsed since its original designation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Shortly after Haiti was originally designated for TPS, \"Plaintiff registered for, and was granted, TPS,\" and he was re-granted TPS most recently on February 17, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Accordingly, \"Plaintiff's TPS has been continuously valid since July 22, 2011.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In January of 2015, Plaintiff married Olguine St. Pierre, a United States citizen who subsequently \"filed an I-130 Petition for Alien Relative\" that was approved by USCIS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Accordingly, \"an immigrant visa was immediately available to Plaintiff as the alien-spouse of a United States citizen,\" and because Plaintiff was already present in the United States at this time, \"he filed an I-485 application to adjust status with USCIS\" to that of a permanent resident on March 11, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) In November of 2015, Plaintiff was interviewed for purposes of determining his eligibility for adjustment of status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 28, 2016, USCIS informed Plaintiff that it was denying his I-485 application to adjust status on the\n   basis that \"Plaintiff's entry [into the United States] as an alien crewman barred his adjustment of status.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Plaintiff moved for USCIS to \"reconsider its decision and/or reopen the case to receive additional evidence,\" and USCIS denied this motion in a letter dated May 30, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) According to the complaint, Plaintiff is not a \"crewman\" for purposes of the INA, and he \"has not served on board a vessel or aircraft since 2009.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The amended complaint sets forth one count against Defendants, alleging a violation of the APA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   , on the following grounds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   First, Plaintiff has met all three of the substantive requirements for adjustment ... in that (1) he has made an application for such adjustment, (2) he is and was eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence, and (3) an immigrant visa was immediately available to him at the time his application was filed. Second, Plaintiff is not an \"alien crewman\" for the purposes of [S]ection 1255(c). Third, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(f)(4) provides that \"for purposes of adjustment of status under [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] ... the alien [with TPS] shall be considered as being in, and maintaining, lawful status as a nonimmigrant.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23) (third and fourth alterations in original). According to Plaintiff, \"Defendants failed to enforce and administer the provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254a and 1255(a) in conformance with the law,\" and \"acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and contrary to law in violation of the [APA] by denying Plaintiff's I-485 application to adjust status.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.) Finally, Plaintiff alleges that he has exhausted all applicable administrative remedies and \"has no other recourse to judicial review other than by this action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Exhibits to the Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff's amended complaint is accompanied by six exhibits. Exhibit 1 is a copy of Plaintiff's visa, which includes a C1/D designation (Doc. No. 17-1), while Exhibit 2 consists of a copy of Plaintiff's I-94 arrival/departure record (Doc. No. 17-2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exhibit 3 includes notices provided to Plaintiff indicating his receipt of TPS (Doc. No. 17-3), and Exhibit 4 is a copy of an I-797 Notice of Action form notifying Plaintiff that he was approved for a visa on the basis that his spouse is a United States citizen (Doc. No. 17-4). Exhibits 5 and 6 include copies of USCIS' decision denying Plaintiff's I-485 application to adjust status (Doc. No. 17-5), and its subsequent decision denying Plaintiff's motion to reopen/reconsider its denial of his application to adjust status (Doc. No. 17-6), respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The plaintiff must present facts that, accepted as true, demonstrate a plausible right to relief. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). Although Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires \"only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\" a complaint may nevertheless be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for its \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

No. 17 \u00b6 23) (internal quotation marks omitted), such a statement constitutes a legal conclusion that is not entitled to a presumption of truth under the standard applicable to a court's analysis of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    556 U.S. at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the \"conclusory nature\" of allegations \"disentitles them to the presumption of truth\"). Further, while Plaintiff urges the Court to view the statutory definition of a crewman as applying only to those who are \"currently serving on board a vessel or aircraft, not an alien who once served on same,\" Plaintiff provides no support for this proffered interpretation of the statutory provision. (Doc. No. 13 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The exhibits accompanying the amended complaint further demonstrate that Plaintiff was admitted to the United States as an alien crewman. Plaintiff received a C1/D visa upon his arrival in the United States, which includes an annotation for \"Celebrity Cruises.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 17-1.) As explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , a visa with the designation \"C\" denotes that the visa-holder is transiting the United States, while a \"D\" visa indicates crewmember status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   Third Circuit has explicitly rejected the argument that one cannot be considered a crewman if he holds a C-1 visa in addition to a D visa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sarup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071607\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/423/231/#p234\">\n    423 F.

The Impact of Plaintiff's Subsequent Receipt of TPS on His Ability to Adjust Status\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Arguments of the Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff argues that \"[e]ven if he is an alien crewman, his TPS overcomes the crewmen bar\" to adjustment of status. (Doc. No. 13 at 10.) In support, Plaintiff maintains that \"this Court should extend the holdings of other decisions in which courts have held that the receipt of TPS is sufficient to trigger eligibility for adjustment of status\" on its own, regardless of whether Plaintiff may be considered an alien crewman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiff, \"the plain meaning of [S]ubsection 1254a(f)(4) ... speaks to all of [S]ection 1255, not to any one part of [S]ection 1255 in particular,\" and therefore, \"TPS operates to overcome any and all threshold barriers to admission.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, Plaintiff asserts that \"if Congress meant to bar crewmen with TPS from adjusting [status], it could easily have said so when it created TPS.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) Plaintiff also states that \"the policy reasons for allowing unadmitted and uninspected aliens to adjust [status] hold for alien crewmen.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11) (citing\n   <em>\n    Guerrero I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4194366\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/138/754/#p756\">\n    138 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   761 ). As stated by Plaintiff, any holding that he is barred from adjusting status by virtue of his designation as an alien crewman \"would be absurd\" because \"Haitians were granted TPS in part to avoid ... being deported to Haiti.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In contrast, Defendants maintain that Plaintiff's subsequent receipt of TPS does not permit him to overcome the statutory prohibition on adjustment of status for alien crewmen. (Doc. Nos. 10, 20.) Specifically, Defendants argue that \"Congress has clearly demonstrated that certain\n   aliens remain subject to the terms of their admission, even after remaining beyond the authorized period of that admission.\" (Doc. No. 10 at 15-16) (citing\n   <em>\n    Bradley v. Attorney Gen.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4227144\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/603/235/#p241\">\n    603 F.3d 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 241-42 (3d Cir. 2010) ). In addition, Defendants posit that because an alien may be considered an alien crewman and a TPS recipient simultaneously, Plaintiff remains ineligible for adjustment of status under Section 1255. (Doc. No. 20 at 10.) According to Defendants, \"[w]hen reading\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in concert with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201254\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5), it becomes clear that an alien granted TPS continues to hold any previously obtained status for the duration of his TPS[,]\" and as it relates to Plaintiff, \"this is his crewman status.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Defendants maintain, therefore, that even if Plaintiff \"meets the prefatory admission requirement under [S]ection 1255(a) through his TPS, his previous entry as a crewman still renders him ineligible for adjustment of status.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Whether Plaintiff's Subsequent Receipt of TPS Permits Him to Overcome the Bar to Adjustment of Status for Alien Crewmen\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court concludes that USCIS correctly denied Plaintiff's application to adjust status because Plaintiff's subsequent receipt of TPS does not permit him to overcome the prohibition on adjustment of status for alien crewmen. As an initial matter, because the issue presented by Plaintiff's claim is one of statutory interpretation, the Court's analysis \"begins with an examination of the plain language of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alston v. Countrywide Fin. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3479838\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/753/#p759\">\n    585 F.3d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 759 (3d Cir. 2009) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Like the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Guerrero II\n   </em>\n   , this Court recognizes that the text of Section 1255(c)(1)'s prohibition on adjustment of status \"is clear[,]\" for \"the relief [Plaintiff] seeks 'shall not be applicable to an alien crewman' like him.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guerrero II\n   </em>\n   , 742 Fed.Appx. at 798 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) ). Moreover, as the Fifth Circuit aptly noted, that the TPS statute permits those with TPS to \"be considered as being in, and maintaining, lawful status as a nonimmigrant\" is of no moment because the TPS statute does not \"erase[ ] the historical fact that [Plaintiff] last entered the United States\" as an alien crewman and, therefore, remains subject to Section 1255(c)(1)'s prohibition on adjustment of status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Further, the analysis herein is consistent with other case law within the Third Circuit reaffirming the prohibition on adjustment of status for alien crewmen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chica-Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3912178\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/462/221/#p224\">\n    462 F.
