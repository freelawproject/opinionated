On October 23, 2018, following a jury trial that lasted nine days and featured twenty eight witnesses, the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs against Officers Lockett and Montalto and awarded compensatory damages to Mr. Grant in the amount of $ 1,130,000.00 and damages for loss of consortium to Mrs. Grant in the amount of $ 450,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Presently under consideration are: (a) defendants' motion pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 50(b) for judgment as a matter of law and Rule 59 for a new trial or remittitur (ECF No.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   164) and (b) plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees and expenses (ECF No. 166). Both motions have been fully briefed. For the following reasons, defendants' motion is denied and plaintiffs' motion is granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The underlying facts and procedural history of this case are set forth in earlier decisions. The following is a brief summary of the testimony and evidence presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On June 28, 2014, plaintiffs resided at 105 Hudson Street in the City of Syracuse with their youngest son, Alonzo Grant, Jr. In the early evening while a family barbeque was occurring, Mr. Grant got in an argument with his daughter Alyssa and requested she leave the home. After she left, she proceeded to get in an argument with a neighbor prompting Mr. Grant to call 911 and request police assistance. Officers Lockett and Montalto arrived at the Grant home soon thereafter and were advised by plaintiffs that their assistance was not needed as Alyssa had left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   However, Officers Lockett and Montalto testified that Mr. Grant was yelling at an\n   unidentified person in the residence and they were concerned about a domestic situation. Officer Lockett entered the residence and testified that Mr. Grant was flailing his arms violently and was still upset with the female occupant of the home. Officer Lockett then asked Mr. Grant to exit his house and speak with Officer Montalto. While exiting the home, Mr. Grant shoved the front door, causing it to hit against an iron rail on the front porch. Officer Lockett testified that he decided to place handcuffs on Mr. Grant to permit him to calm down and for the safety of Mr. Grant and those around him. He testified that he attempted to do this while on the front stairs to the home and that Mr. Grant turned around and bear hugged him, necessitating Officer Lockett to grab Mr. Grant and strike him at least ten times in the head and torso.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In contrast, plaintiffs testified that their argument had ceased by the time Officers Lockett and Montalto arrived. Plaintiffs testified that Mr. Grant spoke loudly while inside the home but did not act violently. Mr. Grant testified that after exiting the home, Officer Lockett grabbed him from behind, throwing him over the railing on the front porch. Plaintiffs testified that while on the ground, both Officers Lockett and Montalto repeatedly kicked and punched Mr. Grant. Eventually, the officers handcuffed Mr. Grant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the incident, Mr. Grant received medical attention from paramedics and was transported to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Mr. Grant was subsequently charged with violating New York Penal Law \u00a7 240.26(1) (\"Harassment in the Second Degree\"), Penal Law \u00a7 240.20(1) and Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 530.11 (\"Domestic Disorderly Conduct\"), and Penal Law \u00a7 205.30 (\"Resisting Arrest\"). On September 10, 2014, the Syracuse Criminal Court dismissed all the charges against Mr. Grant in the interest of justice pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 170.30.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The jury found that Mr. Grant proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Officers Lockett and Montalto falsely arrested him on June 28, 2014 in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and New York state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jury Verdict, ECF No. 155. Additionally, the jury found for Mr. Grant with respect to his excessive force and assault and battery claims against Officers Lockett and Montalto. The jury did not find in favor of Mr. Grant with respect to his claim pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Monell v. Depart. of Social Services of City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    436 U.S. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978) against the City of Syracuse. Further, the jury declined to award Mr. Grant punitive damages against Officers Lockett or Montalto. Lastly, the jury found that Mrs. Grant proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the actions of Officers Lockett and Montalto deprived her of the comfort, companionship and services of her husband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The excessive force and false arrest occurred on the front lawn of his home in front of his family and neighbors. In addition to his physical injuries, Mr. Grant suffered significant mental and emotional damages. Mr. Grant testified with regards to the difficulties he experienced at work, including dizziness and problems with lifting, sun sensitivity and memory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Testimony of Alonzo Grant, Exhibit A to the Powers Decl., ECF No. 164-2, at 55:18-58:5.

He cites his advice to Mr. Grant not to accept an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal that was originally offered by the District Attorney's Office and pushing for further investigation, which he believes lead to the District Attorney William Fitzpatrick drafting a letter and press release regarding the charges against Mr. Grant. Further, Mr. Bonner asserts that in comparison to recent jury verdicts in the Northern District of New York, the success of the jury award obtained by plaintiffs supports a finding that relying on local counsel alone would have likely resulted in a substantially inferior result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Further, plaintiffs cite the case of\n   <em>\n    Trudeau v.

April 7, 2009), to support their claim for out-of-district rates. In\n   <em>\n    Trudeau\n   </em>\n   , the Northern District approved a hourly billing rate for plaintiff's counsel from Chicago and Washington, D.C. of $ 585, 450 and $ 425.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 5. However, the Court highlighted the fact that the attorneys were plaintiff's \"longtime counsel\" and that he was required to retain counsel on an expedited basis. Further, the Court noted that the client actually assented to the rates and was willing to pay them, rather than entering into a contingency fee relationship with his counsel, a situation not present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   While the strategy deployed by Charles Bonner certainly benefitted plaintiffs and he is to be commended on his fine work on this case, plaintiffs have failed to justify an award of out-of-district rates as they have not shown that litigating this case required special expertise not available within this district. Plaintiffs appear to have assumed that local counsel could not have achieved a successful result in this action without inquiring into the competence and expertise of attorneys within this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Accordingly, as Charles A. Bonner has failed to make a particularized showing to rebut the presumptive forum rule, the prevailing rates in the Northern District of New York will be applied. However, Charles A. Bonner will be awarded an hourly rate on the high end of the reasonable rates within the Northern District of New York to reflect his fine work and will be compensated at the rate of $ 350.00 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     A.
