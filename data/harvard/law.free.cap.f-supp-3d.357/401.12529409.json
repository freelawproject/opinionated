(\"Avis\") and an Avis subsidiary, Payless Auto Rental, Inc. (\"Payless\"). The Complaint alleges that the defendant rent-a-car companies routinely charged customers' credit and debit cards for ancillary products and services that the customers had not authorized, or even had declined. The plaintiffs, car rental customers who allegedly incurred such unauthorized charges, assert claims for damages under New Jersey, Florida, and Nevada consumer protection and unfair trade practices statutes, for unjust enrichment, and for conversion. They also seek injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   .)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs propose to certify a nationwide class action comprising five subclasses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Now before the Court are two motions for summary judgment. The first is brought by defendants jointly. (DE 81). Defendants' motion seeks an order compelling the plaintiffs to arbitrate their claims on an individual basis. The plaintiffs oppose that motion and cross-move for summary judgment that the claims not be arbitrated, but proceed in this Court. (DE 93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied outright to the extent it rests on the agreements signed in person by the plaintiffs when they rented their cars in the United States, and the plaintiffs' corresponding cross motion is granted to the same extent. Section II.D.1 &amp; 2,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendants' motion and the plaintiffs' cross motion are both denied to the extent that they rest on the agreement signed in person by the plaintiff who rented her car in Costa Rica, because factual issues remain. Section II.D.3,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To the extent the motions rest on the terms of service on booking websites, I find that the record is not sufficiently developed. After appropriate discovery, the issue may be resolved on summary judgment or tried. Section II.E,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiffs filed their Complaint on September 26, 2016. Defendants initially moved to dismiss the Complaint and compel arbitration. (DE 16, 17). Because the defendants' motions to dismiss presented issues of fact, I denied those motions as offered and ordered limited discovery on the issue of arbitrability. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD Opinion). In that Opinion, I described how discovery was necessary to develop the record on the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate so that the motion to compel could be decided on a summary judgment standard pursuant to the framework outlined in\n   <em>\n    Guidotti v. Legal Helpers Debt Resolution, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047470\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/764/\">\n    716 F.3d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2013). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD Opinion at 6-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Once discovery on the question of arbitrability was completed, the defendants filed the present motion for summary judgment to compel arbitration. Plaintiffs cross-moved for summary judgment on the same issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The U.S. Plaintiffs' Rental Agreements and Rental Jackets\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Six of the seven plaintiffs (the \"U.S. Plaintiffs\") rented cars in the United States-specifically, New Jersey, Nevada, or Florida. (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 113, 123, 131, 146, 159, 168).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The seventh plaintiff, Arcadia Lee, rented a car in Costa Rica.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The U.S. Plaintiffs signed identical one-page rental agreements (the \"U.S. Agreement\") to rent Payless cars. (PSMF \u00b6\u00b6 5-7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each U.S. Agreement is essentially a receipt. It itemizes charges and fees, lists basic identification information about the customer and the rented vehicle, and states pickup and drop-off details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Each U.S. Plaintiffs signature appears immediately below the final paragraph of the U.S. Agreement. That final paragraph states, in part, as follows: \"I agree the\n   charges listed above are estimates and that I have reviewed&amp;agreed to all notices&amp;terms here and in the rental jacket.\" (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 8, 108; PRDSMF \u00b6\u00b6 8, 108) (spacing\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   in original). The U.S. Agreements do not specifically define what a \"rental jacket\" is, and the phrase is not capitalized or otherwise emphasized. (DSMF \u00b6 8; PRDSMF \u00b6 8; DRPR \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendants attach copies of what they identify as the rental jackets that correspond to the U.S. Agreements (the \"Rental Jackets\"). (DSMF \u00b6 109).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   These Rental Jackets, pre-printed documents about the size of standard sheet of paper (8.5\"xl 1\"), contain certain terms and conditions. (DSMF \u00b6 9; PRDSMF \u00b6 9). Folded into thirds, they are eventually used to enclose the U.S. Agreements, as described more fully below. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; DSMF \u00b6 15; PRDSMF \u00b6 15; DRPR \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Payless rental sales associates are instructed to give a rental jacket to the customer after the customer signs the rental agreement. (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 14, 36; PRDSMF \u00b6 14; DRPR \u00b6 14). They are also instructed to give a rental jacket to any customer who requests one. (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 16, 36). However, rental sales associates are not trained to alert customers to the existence of the rental jacket or to any additional terms while the customer is reviewing the U.S. Agreement. (PRDSMF \u00b6 36; DRPR \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the customer signs the U.S. Agreement, the rental sales associate takes the signed agreement, folds the customer copy, inserts it into a Rental Jacket, and hands the customer the Rental Jacket with the copy of the signed U.S. Agreement inside. (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15; PRDSMF \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15; DRPR \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15). Thus the customer routinely receives the Rental Jacket only after signing the U.S. Agreement, unless the customer has specifically asked to see the Rental Jacket at some earlier time. (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 32, 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   That is essentially what occurred when each of the U.S. Plaintiffs rented a car. (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 113, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127-29, 131, 138, 140-41, 146, 151-52, 154-55, 163, 165-66, 168, 180, 182, 185). The U.S. Plaintiffs did not ask to see the Rental Jacket; the rental sales associates did not mention anything about the Rental Jacket as the U.S. Plaintiffs were reviewing their Agreements; the U.S. Plaintiffs signed their Agreements; and then the rental sales associates folded the U.S. Agreements inside the Rental Jackets and handed them back to each U.S. Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It is undisputed that the U.S. Plaintiffs received the Rental Jackets at the rental counter only after they signed their Rental Agreements. (PSMF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2; DRPSMF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of the U.S. Plaintiffs, it seems, actually read the Rental Jacket when they received it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Rental Jacket, so called, is not actually titled as such; the actual title at the top of the page is \"Rental Terms and Conditions.\" (DSMF \u00b6 10; PRDSMF \u00b6 10;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   DRPR \u00b6 10). The Rental Jacket includes 31 paragraphs of terms and conditions in small but legible print. The word \"jacket\" is not found as a header anywhere in the document; it does appear in the text of the second numbered paragraph, which refers to the \"Rental Document Jacket.\" (DE 81-11). The terms and conditions, as well as the layouts, are substantially the same across all six Rental Jackets provided to the U.S. Plaintiffs. Each includes the same arbitration provision, which states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   28.\n   <em>\n    Arbitration.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Dispute Resolution: Except as otherwise provided below, in the event of a dispute that cannot be resolved informally through the pre-dispute resolution procedure, all disputes between you and Payless arising out of, relating to or in connection with your rental of a vehicle from Payless and these rental terms and conditions shall be exclusively settled through binding arbitration through the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") pursuant to the AAA's then-current rules for commercial arbitration. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court and review by a court is limited. YOU AND PAYLESS AGREE THAT ANY SUCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Notwithstanding any provision in these terms to the contrary, if the class-action waiver in the prior sentence is deemed invalid or unenforceable, however, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration.... This arbitration agreement is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.... Disputes and claims that are within the scope of a small claims court's authority, as well as disputes to or loss of a vehicle related to your Payless rental, are exempt from the foregoing dispute resolution provisions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 11-13, 21; PRDSMF \u00b6\u00b6 11-13, 21; DRPR \u00b6\u00b6 11-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The defendants keep the Rental Jackets at the rental counter, typically near the computer terminal or printer. (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 35, 41; PRDSMF \u00b6\u00b6 35, 41; DRPR \u00b6\u00b6 35, 41). The parties provided photos of the rental counters where the U.S. Plaintiffs rented their cars in Tampa, FL and Las Vegas, NV to illustrate the physical layout.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the Las Vegas location, the Rental Jackets are located on a desk behind the counter where the rental associate stands. The desk on which they sit is lower than the counter, so the view of a customer who is standing more than a few feet away is obstructed. Even for a customer standing directly at the counter, only the bottom portion of the Rental Jacket page would be visible. The Rental Jackets are facing in the direction of the rental sales associate (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the text is upside-down from the customer's point of view).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The photos of the Tampa location are similar, except that the Rental Jackets are somewhat less obstructed by the counter ledge, and the bottom of the rental jacket is therefore more visible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Lee's Costa Rica Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Arcadia Lee rented a car in Costa Rica from Payless's licensee, Las Cuatro Vias, S.A. (\"LCV\"). (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 186, 192-93, 203). LCV uses an agreement that is printed on\n   both sides of a single sheet of paper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 194). The front side is a receipt-like document, customized by insertions, that contains the essential terms of the particular transaction (the \"Costa Rica Fill-in Agreement\"). The back side of the paper includes general preprinted terms, in both English and Spanish, and is entitled Rental Agreement (the \"Costa Rica Terms\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 194). Both the front-side Costa Rica Fill-in Agreement and the back-side Costa Rica Terms have their own signature lines for the customer to sign. (PRDSMF \u00b6 194; DRPR \u00b6 194). Lee signed the Costa Rica Fill-in Agreement on the front of the sheet, but did not separately sign the Costa Rica Terms on the back. (DE 81-8; PRDSMF \u00b6 207; DRPR \u00b6 207).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The front side of the Costa Rica Fill-In Agreement is a receipt-like agreement that bears the Payless logo as well as LCV's name and address. (DE 81-8; DSMF \u00b6 195). It includes basic identification information about the customer and the rented vehicle, itemizes charges and fees, and identifies pickup and drop-off details for the rented vehicle. (DE 81-8). It also includes several provisions with blank lines next to them for the customer to initial to signify that it is accepted or declined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). These include a collision damage waiver, emergency roadside assistance, and supplemental liability insurance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The collision damage waiver states that it is subject to capitalized \"Terms and Conditions on this countract [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). There is no document or paragraph entitled \"Terms and Conditions,\" however. The front side does not explicitly refer to content on the back side of the paper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Aside from the reference in the collision damage waiver, the front-side Costa Rica Fill-in Agreement does not refer to, let alone identify, any separate terms and conditions. It does not refer to any extrinsic \"Rental Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the bottom of the front side appears the following admonition: \"By signing below, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and you acknowledge that you have been given an opportunity to read this Agreement before being asked to sign.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; DSMF \u00b6 197; PRDSMF \u00b6 197; DRPR \u00b6 197). Lee signed the front side just underneath that admonition. (DE 81-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Costa Rica Terms,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the back of the sheet, bears the heading \"Rental Agreement.\" It comprises 21 paragraphs in English and 21 paragraphs in Spanish on a single page. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The writing is quite small and difficult to read, at least in the Court's copy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The first numbered English paragraph, titled \"Parties,\" explains that the parties include LCV and the renter, defined as the \"persons whose data is detailed on the face of this document and whose signatures are affixed at the bottom, as well as any other individuals or entities in which name the car-rental invoice is issued by instructions of the signatory who shall be jointly liable for the obligations hereunder acquired.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; DSMF \u00b6 196; PRDSMF \u00b6 196; DRPR \u00b6 196).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Costa Rica Terms include a \"Dispute resolution\" clause, essentially an arbitration provision, which states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Every controversy or dispute that may be related to this agreement or its performance, liquidation or interpretation shall be resolved in accordance with the following procedure: 1) The parties shall resort to conciliation mechanisms in accordance with the Conciliation Regulations of the Center for Conciliation and Arbitration of the Chamber of Commerce of Costa Rica. If the Parties have not reached a conciliation agreement within fifteen business day [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] following the conciliation request, the controversy or dispute shall be resolved by\n   means of 2) Arbitration proceedings, in accordance with the Arbitration regulation of said center, to which rules the parties subject themselves unconditionally. The Arbitration Panel shall be composed of one member and resolve [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] pursuant to law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (DE 81-8; DSMF \u00b6 199).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The back side of the paper has its own signature line, at the bottom right corner. It is preceded by the following admonition: \"By signing below, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,\" in English and Spanish. Lee did not sign the Costa Rica Terms on the back side of the paper. (DE 81-8; PRDSMF \u00b6 207; DRPR \u00b6 207; PSMF \u00b6 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The parties attach a video of Lee's rental transaction at LCV in Costa Rica. (DE 93-5 at 138 (the \"video\") ). This video shows Lee reviewing and signing the Costa Rica Agreement; it does not show that she ever turned over the Costa Rica Fill-in Agreement to review the Costa Rica Terms on the back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The video shows the rental sales associate physically pointing to where Lee should sign the Costa Rica Fill-In Agreement on the front side, but it does not show the rental sales associate communicating to Lee that there is additional content on the back side of the paper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; PRDSMF \u00b6 208; DRPR \u00b6 208).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   During the transaction, Lee can be heard asking, \"do you want me to sign next to each one?\" The evident reference is to the initial lines on the front requiring the customer to accept or decline the collision damage waiver, the emergency roadside assistance sentence, and the supplemental liability insurance. (Video at 34:35 - 34:45). The rental sales associate responds, \"at the end, please\", and points to the signature line at the bottom of the front side. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Later on, the rental sales associate gives the paper back to Lee and says, \"sign the initials for your name; one, two, three, and at the end, alright?\" (Video at 54:27 - 54:59). After Lee signs the front side, the rental sales associate takes back the paper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Neither the testimony nor the video suggests that Lee asked any questions about the Costa Rica Terms or turned the sheet over during this rental transaction. (DSMF \u00b6 208).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Third-Party Booking Websites\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Payless has business relationships with travel booking websites such as Expedia.com, Hotwire.com, and Priceline.com (collectively, \"the Booking Websites\"). (DSMF \u00b6 54). These Booking Websites provide online reservation services and assist users in making car rental reservations with vendors, including Payless. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56). Five of the six U.S. Plaintiffs used those websites to reserve their car rentals online.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The defendants attach the Booking Websites' Terms of Use that were in effect at the time the five U.S. Plaintiffs reserved their car rentals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76, 83, 92).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   To use the Booking Websites to reserve their rentals, the five U.S. Plaintiffs had to click boxes acknowledging that they had read and agreed to the Booking Websites' Terms of Use. (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 68-69, 77, 84-85, 93, 99, 100). The Terms of Use for each of\n   the Booking Websites included an arbitration provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The arbitration provision included in the Expedia.com Terms of Use provided the following: \"Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court.... This includes any Claims you assert against... travel suppliers or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement).\" Such arbitration, it provides, \"will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.\" (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 61, 78; DE 81-30 at 37-47). It also states that \"[y]ou agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to... any services or products provided\" and that \"[i]f we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; DSMF \u00b6 79). The terms \"we\", \"us\", and \"our\" are defined to refer to Expedia, Inc., and its subsidiaries and corporate affiliates, including Travelscape, LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The term \"you\" is defined to mean the customer visiting or booking a reservation through Expedia.com.

ANY TRAVEL SERVICE PROVIDERS OR COMPANIES OFFERING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THROUGH THE SITE.\" (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 63, 104; DE 81-30 at 48-79). It defines \"third-party suppliers or providers\" as including \"the airlines, hotels, rental car companies and other suppliers that provide travel or other services through this Site (such third parties collectively referred to as the Travel Service Providers').\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It requires a Notice of Dispute prior to any arbitration; \"If Priceline and you, or Priceline and any Third-party, do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within 60 days after the Notice is received, you, or the Third-party, may commence an arbitration proceeding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

The Parties' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In broad strokes, the defendants argue that the arbitration provisions in the Rental Jackets and the Costa Rica Terms are enforceable and that the plaintiffs' claims fall within the scope of those arbitration provisions. Further, they argue that the class-action waivers in the arbitration provisions require the plaintiffs to bring their claims on an individual rather than a class-wide basis. Although Avis is not a signatory to the Rental Jackets, and neither defendant is a signatory to the Costa Rica Terms, they say they may enforce the arbitration provisions under principles of agency law and equitable estoppel. Furthermore, defendants argue, the plaintiffs who reserved their car rentals through the Booking Websites can be compelled to arbitrate their claims based on the arbitration provisions found in the Booking Websites' Terms of Use. According to defendants, then, all of the plaintiffs must submit their claims against Avis and Payless to arbitration, and on an individual basis-the U.S. Plaintiffs in the United States, and Lee in Costa Rica.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As plaintiffs see it, arbitration cannot be compelled here. The U.S. Agreements and the Costa Rica Fill-In Agreement do not effectively incorporate by reference the Rental Jackets or the Costa Rica Terms, including the arbitration clauses therein. Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the Rental Jackets and Costa Rica Terms are effective, plaintiffs make additional arguments that these disputes are beyond the scope of the arbitration agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Particularly for the Rental Jackets, I agree with the plaintiffs that the incorporation-by-reference issue precedes all others. If plaintiffs are correct, there is no agreement to arbitrate at all, so issues of interpretation and scope become moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that they cannot be compelled to arbitrate their claims pursuant to the arbitration provisions in the Booking Websites' Terms of Use. The evidence of those terms, they say, is not competent or admissible. And\n   even if those terms are admissible, plaintiffs say, they never assented to them. Further, the plaintiffs argue that these disputes are beyond the scope of the Booking Website arbitration clauses, because they do not involve the reservations, but rather the unauthorized charges imposed after the rental transactions had concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The U.S. and Costa Rica Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The main thrust of the defendants' position is that the plaintiffs, at the time they picked up their rental cars, signed rental agreements that contained or incorporated agreements to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   I first discuss the U.S. Agreements. As I say, New Jersey and Florida law govern the issue of whether the Agreements signed by the U.S. Plaintiffs effectively incorporated the arbitration clauses in the Rental Jackets. Ordinary principles of New Jersey and Florida contract law determine the validity of an agreement containing an arbitration clause.\n   <em>\n    First Options of Chicago, Inc. v.

The relevant arbitration language appears only in the Rental Jackets, not in the Agreements. There can be no mutual assent with respect to terms in a document that the parties do not understand to be part of the contract. Therefore, a fundamental question is the extent to which the Rental Jackets were available for the customers' inspection when they signed the U.S. Agreements. Since the Rental Jackets were not adequately presented to the plaintiffs until after they signed the U.S. Agreements, and because the Agreements did not describe the Rental Jackets in a way that would be clear to the reader, I hold that the U.S. Agreements did not adequately incorporate the Rental Jackets under New Jersey or Florida law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   With respect to the Costa Rica Fill-In Agreement, my resolution is different. I hold that there is a question of fact whether Lee was given reasonable notice of the Costa Rica Terms, and I therefore deny both parties' motions for summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    1. New Jersey Law and the U.S. Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The agreements signed by Bacon, Alexander, DeVries, and Davidson in the United States are governed by New Jersey law. Because they are substantially identical, I discuss them together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Under New Jersey law, \" '[a]n agreement to arbitrate, like any other contract, must be the product of mutual assent, as determined under customary principles of contract law.' \"\n   <em>\n    James v.

It purports to bind the rent-a-car customers \"to all notices &amp; terms here and in the rental jacket.\" \"Rental jacket,\" a bit of industry jargon, is not highlighted or emphasized, and it does not have a self-evident meaning. It is not defined in the Rental Agreement, by words or ostension.

Here, we may even indulge the assumption that a reasonable customer could piece together the meaning of \"rental jacket\" when he or she was handed the Rental Agreement, folded inside the\n   \"Rental Terms and Conditions\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Rental Jacket).

Just as in\n   <em>\n    Quinn\n   </em>\n   , it is here true \"without dispute that [plaintiffs] were not shown and did not see the document\" until after they signed the relevant contract containing the incorporation-by-reference.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151024,3919724\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/24/777/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Quinn\n   </em>\n   , \"there was never any discussion concerning\" the terms of the putatively incorporated document prior to the signing of the agreements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151024,3919724\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/24/777/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Those facts, said the\n   <em>\n    Quinn\n   </em>\n   court, were the \"most important[ ]\" in determining whether the external document was incorporated by reference. So too here. These undisputed facts easily create the necessary level of doubt under New Jersey law as to whether the U.S. Plaintiffs knew of and assented to the terms of the Rental Jacket when entering into the contract. Indeed, the conclusion is nearly inescapable that they did not. Thus New Jersey's stringent \"beyond doubt\" standard, while applicable, is not critical to my analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section III.D.2,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As I noted in the MTD Opinion, the\n   <em>\n    Quinn\n   </em>\n   contract was an attorney retainer agreement.

The plaintiff must receive an incorporated document, or else be given clear direction on how to access it, before signing the agreement that allegedly incorporates that extrinsic document. Defendants Avis and Payless failed to provide Geary and Wheeler with the necessary access to the Rental Jackets here. They were not given the Rental Jackets until after they signed their Rental Agreements. The Rental Agreements did not describe the Rental Jacket or state where it could be found. Nor did the Rental Agreements, like the one found\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   adequate in\n   <em>\n    Spicer\n   </em>\n   , alert Geary and Wheeler even generally to the contents of the Rental Jacket or the fact that it contained an arbitration clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Contrary to defendants' assertion, these Rental Jackets were not accessible or plainly noticeable. Much ink is spilled on the issue of the jackets' visibility during the rental transaction. I cannot find that any version of the standard requires the consumer to officiously take it upon herself to read a fine print document on the agent's desk upside-down. What is critical is that the Rental Agreement did not define the meaning of a \"rental jacket,\" the customers were not directed to it in any way, and the document did not actually even bear that title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <em>\n    Spicer\n   </em>\n   relied on\n   <em>\n    BGT Group, Inc. v.

New Jersey Law and the Costa Rica Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   As outlined above, the incorporation-by-reference issue for the Costa Rica Fill-in Agreement is also governed by New Jersey law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 415-16; MTD Opinion at 11-16 (choice of law analysis).

The Costa Rica Terms and the Costa Rica Fill-In Agreement, recall, are printed on two sides of the same sheet of paper. Defendants argue that they therefore constitute a single, integrated document. (Def. Br. at 36-37; Def. Reply at 39-40). True, the single-sheet scenario may ease the defendants' burden of proof. Either way, however, it is fundamental that for Lee to be bound by the arbitration provision, she must have had reasonable notice of the Costa Rica Terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atalese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191590\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/219/430/\">\n    219 N.J. at 444-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4191590\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/219/430/\">\n    99 A.3d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Noble\n   </em>\n   , 682 Fed.Appx. at 116 (discussing New Jersey Appellate Division cases and noting that under New Jersey law mutual assent \"necessarily requires reasonable notice to each contracting party of the contractual terms,\" including an arbitration clause).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The issue of whether Lee received reasonable notice requires the court to find facts and weigh their significance. Because some of those material facts are in dispute and because weighing them is the province of a fact finder, the issue is inappropriate for disposition on summary judgment. Therefore, I deny both parties' motions for summary judgment on the question of whether Lee agreed to arbitrate her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The Costa Rica Fill-In Agreement is a receipt-like document. That Agreement, on the face of the sheet, is similar to the U.S. Agreement. The Costa Rica Fill-In Agreement does not refer even generally to the existence of any other agreement, extrinsic terms, or rental jacket.\n   <em>\n    A fortiori\n   </em>\n   it does not direct the reader's attention to any arbitration clause. Near the bottom of the page, above the signature line, it states, \"By signing below, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and you acknowledge that you have been given an opportunity to read this Agreement before being asked to sign.\" (DE 81-8). Lee signed the Costa Rica Fill-In Agreement on the face of the sheet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   On the reverse side of the Costa Rica Fill-In Agreement is a preprinted set of terms (the \"Costa Rica Terms\"), entitled \"Rental Agreement.\" The Costa Rica Terms are similar to those contained in the U.S. Rental Jackets, discussed above, and they include an arbitration provision. The Costa Rica Terms page has its own, separate\n   signature line. Although Lee signed the Costa Rica Fill-in Agreement on the face of the sheet, she did not execute the signature line of the Costa Rica Terms on the reverse. The Costa Rica Terms define the \"Parties\" to the agreement as including the \"persons whose data is detailed on the face of this document and whose signatures are affixed at the bottom, as well as any other individuals or entities in which name the car-rental invoice is issued by instructions of the signatory who shall be jointly liable for the obligations hereunder acquired.\" (DE 81-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Defendants contend that Lee was placed on constructive notice of the Costa Rica Terms when she was handed the sheet of paper, even if she did not actually turn over the paper and read the Terms. Defendants also point to the collision damage waiver on the front-side Costa Rica Agreement, which states that it is \"Subject to the Terms and Conditions, stated on this countract [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ].\" The prefatory admonition to the signature line states that the signer assents to \"the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants say that these references were enough to put Lee on constructive or actual notice that there were additional terms on the back of the paper. The language, however, is ambiguous at best. It does not direct the reader to \"terms and conditions\" that appear elsewhere; if anything, it tends to suggest that the \"terms and conditions\" consist of what appears on the front side of the form-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that to which the customer agrees by signing the front side. And of course they do not specifically refer to arbitration at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Plaintiffs emphasize the following facts: The rental sales associate never directed Lee to the Costa Rica Terms on the reverse side of the Costa Rica Fill-In Agreement; the rental sales associate never discussed with Lee the existence or substance of the additional terms; the Costa Rica Fill-in Agreement does not explicitly state anywhere that there are additional contract terms on the reverse side of the paper; the reverse side, although it could be described as containing terms and conditions, does not bear that title; the back-side Costa Rica Terms have their own signature line, which Lee never signed; and the video does not show that Lee was directed to turn over the sheet to review the Costa Rica Terms, or that she actually did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Under the New Jersey incorporation-by-reference standard, the language of the contract must permit a reasonable consumer to \"ascertain[ ] beyond doubt\" the additional, extrinsic terms.\n   <em>\n    Quinn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899566\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/410/510/#p533\">\n    410 N.J.

Neither party presents any case law on the specific question of whether terms on the reverse side of an agreement (as opposed to a separate document) are subject to the incorporation-by-reference analysis.

Faced by conflicting evidence as to whether the reverse side was properly called to the signer's attention, they generally have denied summary judgment. \"A party should not be bound by clauses printed on the reverse side of a document unless it be established that such matter was properly called to its attention and that it assented to the provisions there stated....

If Lee had executed both the front and back signature lines, this would be an easier case for summary judgment. But she executed, and apparently was asked to execute, only the front. An additional factual issue arises, then, as to the possible lulling effect of the signature line on the front of the document, which could have left (and here, possibly did leave) the impression that there was nothing more to be read or done. The sales associate only confirmed that impression by instructing Lee to sign in only one place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The parties dispute whether the rental sales associate actually displayed the paper in a manner that would have shown, at least generally, that there was something\n   printed on the back. (PSMF \u00b6\u00b6 49-51; DRPSMF \u00b6\u00b6 49-51; DSMF \u00b6 209; PRDSMF \u00b6 209; DRPR \u00b6 209). The parties also dispute whether the language of the front-side Costa Rica Fill-In Agreement indicates that there are additional terms and conditions on the reverse side. For the reasons stated above, this is an open question. A finder of fact could easily conclude that the collision damage waiver itself, along with the other initialed paragraphs on the Costa Rica Fill-In Agreement,\n   <em>\n    themselves\n   </em>\n   constitute the \"terms and conditions.\" It is possible, however, that a reasonable consumer could have understood this as a reference to additional terms and conditions on the reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   These disputed facts are genuine and material to the issues in suit. A fact finder must determine whether Lee was on reasonable notice of the arbitration provision found within the Costa Rica Terms. Summary judgment on the question of arbitrability is therefore denied as to the Costa Rica rental transaction of plaintiff Lee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Third-Party Booking Websites' Terms of Use\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   As noted above, the defendants have another, alternative argument in relation to those plaintiffs who booked their reservations through third-party Booking Websites, such as\n   <em>\n    Expedia.com\n   </em>\n   . Those websites' Terms of Use, they say, contain their own arbitration provisions that would cover these overcharge claims. The plaintiffs respond initially that much of the evidence relating to the booking of such reservations and the websites' terms of use is not proffered in admissible form. Assuming there was evidence of contractual assent, the plaintiffs say, these add-on charges, imposed by the rent-a-car companies at the end of the rental, are nevertheless beyond the scope of the arbitration provisions in the third-party Booking Websites' terms of use. (Def. Br. at 25-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The issue regarding admissibility of the evidence of assent breaks down further into two components. The first concerns the layout and details of the Booking Websites at the time the plaintiffs used them. The second concerns the contemporaneous content of the Booking Websites' Terms of Use (which allegedly contain the arbitration clauses). For the reasons stated below, my decision process stalls at the first step. The certification purporting to describe the layout and details of the Booking Websites is not sufficiently based on personal knowledge. I will therefore permit additional discovery on this issue pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e). Because additional arguments regarding the Terms of Use are likely to be altered or even mooted by such additional discovery, I do not reach them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Defendants attach a certification from Matt Enderle, an Avis employee who has worked on Payless relationships and accounts with travel booking websites since April 2014, including the Booking Websites at issue in this case.

Mr. Enderle is \"generally familiar with the terms and conditions\" on the booking websites, which he \"review[s] and reference[s] from time to time as part of [his] job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Mr. Enderle's certification attaches screenshots of the Booking Websites in an attempt to document the process that plaintiffs underwent when reserving their rentals online. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 17, 27). Those screenshots, however, date from over a year after the named plaintiffs actually used the websites to book their rentals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Thus, for example, Mr. Enderle attaches screenshots of the Expedia.com website dating from December 11, 2017. Plaintiffs Alexander and Geary booked their rentals through Expedia.com nearly eighteen months earlier, on June 21 and June 17, 2016. (DSMF \u00b6\u00b6 65, 66). The time gap is\n   papered over with say-so: \"The process for booking a Payless rental on Expedia.com now,\" says Mr. Enderle, \"is the same process that existed at the time Mr. Alexander and Ms. Geary booked their Payless rentals in 2016.\" (DE 81-14 \u00b6 12). As to reservations booked through two other websites, Hotwire.com and Priceline.com, the Enderle certification attaches similar screen shots and makes similar statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   No evidence from any employee of those websites is offered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Mr. Enderle's certification goes on to describe the process the plaintiffs would have experienced when booking their rentals online. For example, he describes the locations of hyperlinks used to access the Terms of Use (DE 81-14 \u00b6\u00b6 13, 21, 28); what a customer had to click in order to complete a reservation (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 23, 30); the text within the box that acknowledged the customer's assent to the Terms of Use (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 23, 30); and the requirement of clicking large colored boxes to acknowledge having read and accepted the Terms of Use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 24, 31). Those facts are highly material to the question of whether plaintiffs properly assented to the Booking Websites' Terms of Use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hite v.

Such a statement does not suffice to support his conclusory assertion that the layouts and procedures of the websites when the plaintiff used them in mid-2016 were precisely those he observed at the end of 2017. Defendants' presentation is, however, suggestive, and such information, if it exists, should be readily available from the operators of the websites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   One option would be to simply rule that defendants' proofs have failed and to deny arbitration on this basis. Where there has been full discovery and a party's case has failed on the merits, that option is often appropriate. In such a case, summary judgment will have served its purpose of narrowing and defining the issues to be tried. Here, however, there has been only limited discovery, and denial of defendants' motion will not end the case, but rather guarantee that it go forward, meaning that further discovery is a foregone conclusion. That option, then, seems an improvident exercise of my discretion. Rule 56(e) affords the Court the additional option of permitting a party to supplement its proofs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is the option I take here. The defendants, if they wish to do so, may ask the Magistrate Judge to help them schedule discovery so that they can seek necessary evidence of online assent in admissible form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Assuming the plaintiffs have assented, there remains the issue of what they assented to. The defendants proffer evidence as to the Booking Websites' Terms of Use as of the dates that the plaintiffs booked their reservations. For this, they do not rely solely on Mr. Enderle's recollection. Rather, they also attach copies of those online Terms of Use that they obtained from the Internet Archive's \"Wayback Machine.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DE 81-30) Those retrieved Terms of Use documents are sponsored by an appropriate representative of the Internet Archive. (DE 81-29)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Here, defendants are on more solid ground. Although the issue is not free from doubt, there is case law support for the proposition that the Wayback Machine copies of the Terms of Use, particularly as corroborated by the Enderle certification, would be admissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

App'x 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2018). At least there are strong indications that a proper foundation for admission could be laid at a trial of the arbitrability issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Should both assent and the particulars of the Terms of Use be established, many issues will remain before arbitration can be ordered. One such issue is choice of law, which may play out differently vis-\u00e0-vis the websites than it did in relation to the in-person car rental agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another is whether, under whatever law applies, a non-signatory may compel arbitration under these circumstances. Still another is the scope of the website arbitration provisions, for example, whether they extend to these defendants' alleged imposition of unauthorized charges after entering into new agreements with the customers, at or after the time the cars were returned. Given my rulings above, consideration of those issues would be premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the defendants' motion for summary judgment to compel arbitration (DE 81) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as presented. The plaintiffs' cross motion for summary judgment denying arbitration (DE 93) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   More specifically:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   1. The defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied outright to the extent it rests on the agreements signed in person by the plaintiffs when they rented their cars in the United States, and the plaintiffs' corresponding cross motion is granted to the same extent. Section II. D.1 &amp; 2,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   2. The defendant's motion and the plaintiffs' cross motion are both denied to the extent that they rest on the agreement signed in person by the plaintiff who rented her car in Costa Rica, because factual issues remain.

To the extent the motions rest on the terms of service on booking websites, I find that the record is not sufficiently developed.
