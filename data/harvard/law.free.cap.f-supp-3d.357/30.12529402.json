COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Under federal law, a foreign-owned shipping vessel must use the services of a\n   registered, experienced American or Canadian seaway pilot to navigate the Great Lakes or the St. Lawrence Seaway. The United States Coast Guard is responsible for setting the rates that foreign shipping companies must pay these pilots. To ensure that the rates adequately reimburse pilots associations for the cost of doing business, the Coast Guard must account for their operating expenses. In 2016, the Coast Guard announced that it would no longer recognize legal fees as reimbursable operating expenses if the fees were incurred in litigation against the U.S. government. In 2017, it did just that, excluding $ 75,049 in legal fees that three pilots associations had incurred in an earlier suit against the Coast Guard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Those three pilots associations have again sued the Coast Guard. They allege that the 2016 Rule excluding such fees is arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") because it was an unacknowledged policy change and was insufficiently justified. The pilots associations thus move for summary judgment, asking the Court to vacate the rule. The Coast Guard and several foreign shipping companies, who have intervened as defendants, oppose that motion, and the Coast Guard cross-moves for summary judgment. Because the record shows that the Coast Guard neither acknowledged that the 2016 Rule represented a change in policy nor adequately explained its reasoning, the Court will grant summary judgment to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Part 404. It applies these methods through notice-and-comment rulemaking to determine the applicable rates. The Coast Guard's stated goal is to set rates that \"promote safe, efficient, and reliable pilotage service on the Great Lakes, by generating for each pilotage association sufficient revenue to reimburse its necessary and reasonable operating expenses, fairly compensate trained and rested pilots, and provide an appropriate profit to use for improvements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404.1(a). In other words, the Coast Guard strives to account for \"necessary\" and \"reasonable\" expenses when setting rates to ensure that pilots associations can recoup those costs through sufficiently high revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case revolves around a 2016 regulatory overhaul of the rate-setting methodology. Until that overhaul, the Coast Guard used rate-setting methods promulgated in 1995.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Great Lakes Pilotage Methodology,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Fed.%20Reg.%2018%2C366\">\n    60 Fed. Reg. 18,366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (April 11, 1995). While this case turns on differences between the two sets of methods, they both take the same general approach to operating expenses. Under each set of regulations, pilots associations are responsible for providing a detailed accounting of expenses for the Coast Guard to consider in setting rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.2\">\n    46 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.5\">\n    46 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (2015).

In applying the rule, the Coast Guard recognized legal fees among necessary and reasonable expenses, whether or not they were incurred in litigation against the U.S. government. In a 2003 interim rulemaking, the Coast Guard responded to comments questioning the wisdom of recognizing legal fees as allowable expenses by explaining that it \"reviewed all legal fees using the guidelines of necessity and reasonableness contained in [the 1995 regulation],\" and approved \"[o]nly reasonable and necessary legal fees[.]\" Rates for Pilotage on the Great Lakes,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2069%2C564\">\n    68 Fed.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The pilots contend that the Coast Guard arbitrarily and capriciously enacted the 2016 Rule by not acknowledging a change in policy and failing to meaningfully respond to comments submitted. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   There is no dispute that the 2016 Rule changed the Coast Guard's policy on legal fees incurred against the government. The 2016 Rule and its predecessor took substantively identical approaches to defining \"necessary\" and \"reasonable\" operating expenses. But the 2016 Rule creates an exception to that approach, excluding a category of legal fees regardless of whether they otherwise meet the regulatory definition of \"necessary\" and \"reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.2\">\n    46 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6). In practice, the old rule allowed pilots associations to include such fees among \"necessary\" and \"reasonable\" expenses recoupable in the rate-setting process, as the Coast Guard explicitly acknowledged in its 2003 interim rulemaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Rates for Pilotage on the Great Lakes,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2069%2C564\">\n    68 Fed.

Upon adoption of the 2016 Rule, that is no longer the case if the fees were incurred in litigation against the U.S. government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Coast Guard did not acknowledge the change. The agency noticed the rule in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\"NPRM\") describing a significant overhaul of rate-setting methodology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Great Lakes Pilotage Rates-2016 Annual Review and Changes to Methodology,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2054%2C484\">\n    80 Fed.

It indicated that the newly numbered provision-now\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.2\">\n    46 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -\"would do the same thing [as the previous provision], and make no substantive changes except with respect to the recognition of pilot benefits as an element of pilot compensation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2054%2C484\">\n    80 Fed.

Put simply, the NPRM stated explicitly that, except for a matter unrelated to legal expenses, the proposed methodology would not alter expense-recognition policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In response to the NPRM, the pilots commented that the new methodology would depart from past practice, citing the 2003 interim rulemaking. They further noted that legal fees are typically recognized as recoupable expenses in the maritime industry, explained that litigation against the U.S. government was sometimes necessary to ensure appropriate rates, and cited the outstanding fees from the 2014 litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 61, 98-100. In its final rulemaking, the Coast Guard summarized these comments, noting that one group \"said our proposal was contrary to past Coast Guard practice, which allowed those fees so long as there was no finding of bad faith on the part of the pilots,\" and another group \"said disallowing fees is an arbitrary and capricious departure from past Coast Guard practice and an illogical departure from customary practice in other industries.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2011%2C908\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. at 11,922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Coast Guard's full response as relevant to these comments was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   We disagree. The U.S. Government, through the Coast Guard, is the pilots' regulator, and therefore, it is inappropriate for the Coast Guard routinely to approve any legal costs for actions against the Government or its agents. We note that when court-ordered to do so, as we were as part of the settlement ending the 2014 litigation, we do pay the opposing party's litigation costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2011%2C908\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   These facts are clear and fatal to the new rule's treatment of legal fees. \"A central principle of administrative law is that, when an agency decides to depart from ... past practices and official policies, the agency must at a minimum acknowledge the change and offer a reasoned explanation for it.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Cir. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, the Coast Guard failed to acknowledge the change in the first instance, when it noticed the proposed rulemaking. To the contrary, it explicitly indicated that the only substantive change was unrelated to legal fees. Even when alerted to the change, the Coast Guard did not acknowledge it in the final rulemaking, saying only \"We disagree,\" and tersely explaining its view of why it should not recognize such expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Coast Guard contends that \"We disagree\" was not meant as a denial of\n   changed policy, but rather a response to criticism of the substance of the policy. Hr'g Tr. 29:18-30:9. Perhaps. But even then, nothing in the record evinces a straightforward acknowledgement of a changed course. When pressed at the hearing, the Coast Guard urged the Court to consider its summary of the pilots' comments as an acknowledgment of change.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   31:15-32:2. Even with this generous reading, in the face of an NPRM that explicitly discounted a change in policy, a summary of a comment in the final rule would not satisfy the agency's responsibility to affirmatively acknowledge change.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Agape Church, Inc. v.

Cir. 2013) (\"[A]n agency cannot bootstrap notice from a comment[.]\" (internal marks and citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Coast Guard similarly falters in emphasizing that it properly noticed the new regulation, that Plaintiffs understood the proposal and submitted comments addressing it, and that the Coast Guard responded to these comments with an explanation of its policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Coast Guard Mot. Summ. J. at 7. This misses a key point: It is the\n   <em>\n    Coast Guard's\n   </em>\n   responsibility to \"indicat[e] that prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed, not casually ignored.\"\n   <em>\n    Lone Mountain Processing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661754,3547759\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/1161/\">\n    709 F.3d at 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fact that Plaintiffs were able to identify the change in policy does not absolve the Coast Guard of its obligation to engage in reasoned decision-making, which starts with acknowledging a deliberate change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Coast Guard points to\n   <em>\n    FCC v.
