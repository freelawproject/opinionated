The matter is before the Court on the parties' Joint Stipulation, filed August 2, 2018, which the Court has taken under submission without oral argument. For the reasons stated below, the Commissioner's decision is reversed and this action is remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff was born in 1959. (Administrative Record (\"AR\") 38, 65.) She completed \"[s]ome college\" (AR 39) and worked as a realtor for about 26 years (AR 198, 211).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 18, 2011, Plaintiff was found disabled as of July 16, 2010, because of breast cancer. (AR 67-74;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 16, 17-18.) On March 21, 2014, she was notified that her disability was determined to have ended as of March 1, 2014, and that her benefits would be terminated. (AR 79, 102-05;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 16.) After the decision was upheld on reconsideration (AR 80, 81), a\n   disability hearing officer found her not disabled based on \"the evidence in the file.\" (AR 111-17.) She then requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. (AR 121, 279-86.) A hearing was held on May 5, 2016, at which Plaintiff, who was represented by counsel, and a vocational expert testified. (AR 33-64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In a written decision issued June 21, 2016, the ALJ found Plaintiff not disabled as of March 1, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 13-25.) Plaintiff requested review from the Appeals Council (AR 180-81, 313-17), which denied it on July 28, 2017 (AR 4-6). This action followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Dr. Jone also noted that she had not been \"taking lots of pain med[ications] for alleged severe 'bone' pain\" and that \"chemotherapy usually does not cause 'bone pain.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Regarding Plaintiff's shortness of breath, the doctor did not see any medical reason for her symptoms, noting that tests showed \"normal respiratory rate and oxygen level.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In June 2014, Dr. Stuart Laiken\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   completed an RFC assessment and similarly limited Plaintiff's RFC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 513-16.) But unlike Dr. Jone, he found that Plaintiff's ability to \"[r]each[ ] in all directions\" was limited, citing her surgical history. (AR 515.) He concluded that Plaintiff's symptoms were \"attributable ... to a medically determinable impairment\" but that the \"severity\" or \"duration of the symptom(s)\" was \"disproportionate to the expected severity or expected duration on the basis of the ... medically determinable impairment(s).\" (AR 517.) He did not review any medical-source statement (AR 518), but he reviewed records from treating doctors and Plaintiff's fatigue questionnaire (AR 520-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    MRIs and bone-density tests\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A December 2014 MRI of Plaintiff's lumbar spine had mostly \"normal\" and \"unremarkable\" results. (AR 538.) The radiologist noted \"mild to moderate disc space loss with endplate degenerative changes,\" \"broad-based posterior disc osteophyte complex,\" and \"mild bilateral neuroforaminal narrowing\" at L5-S1. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also noted \"broad-based posterior disc protrusion\" at L4-L5. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He found \"no evidence for metastatic disease in the lumbar spine\" but suggested possible correlation between his findings and complaints of neuropathy. (AR 539.) An MRI of the cervical spine done at the same time also revealed \"no evidence for metastatic disease,\" but it showed \"multilevel degenerative change ... with mild cord flattening at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 secondary to disc protrusions.\" (AR 540-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff had a bone-density study on March 20, 2015.

Plaintiff's bone density had decreased by 0.7 percent in her lumbar spine, 4.3 percent in her left hip, and 8.3 percent in her right hip, and the doctor concluded that she now had osteoporosis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She did not give Plaintiff any treatment instructions other than advising her to follow up in \"[two] years, based on [National Osteoporosis Foundation] recommendation[s].\" (AR 537.) In February 2016, Plaintiff had another bone-density test, which revealed slight improvement in her lumbar and right-hip-bone mineral density. (AR 569-70;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 564-68.) The reviewing doctor noted that Plaintiff did not have \"current pathological fracture\" and \"estimate[d] a 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture at 8.5% and of hip fracture at 1.7%.\" (AR 569.) He recommended follow-up testing in two years.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She did not walk daily, but she did \"try and do some stretching to help relieve the pain\" and napped \"at least once a day.\" (AR 262.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   A couple months after Plaintiff was notified of the cessation of her disability benefits, she asked for reconsideration, stating that starting in January 2014, she had had \"dizzi[ ]ness, headache, recurring sore throat, sore neck, upper [and] lower back pain, numbness in right hand and right leg and foot.\" (AR 266.) She claimed that her \"pain [had gotten] worse,\" specifying \"back pain and neck pain and throat pain.\" (AR 271.) In her request for a hearing, dated September 8, 2014, Plaintiff wrote that starting in January 2014 she had had a \"very bothersome\" hernia, \"difficulty standing and walking,\" and \"worse\" small-airway problems. (AR 279.) She also complained that she was having trouble breathing \"more often,\" was feeling \"very fatigued,\" and was sleeping \"longer hours.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She suffered from \"stiffness of neck, bone aches and difficulty sitting for long periods of time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At the May 5, 2016 hearing, Plaintiff testified that she had pain in her \"neck,\" \"ribs,\" \"arm,\" \"hip area,\" \"groin area,\" \"leg,\" and \"feet.\" (AR 42.) She took \"pain medication\" and rested for the pain. (AR 44-45.) Her chest and rib pain was a \"daily problem\" and was at least a \"four or five\" out of ten.

She could \"sit for about an hour or two,\" stand \"probably half an hour,\" and walk \"just short distances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She could \"comfortably\" lift \"about eight pounds, ten pounds.\" (AR 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the ALJ failed to \"fully and fairly develop the record\" (J. Stip. at 8) because the state-agency reviewing physicians, whose opinions she gave \"great weight\" (AR 23), did not review the MRIs or bone-density scans that showed Plaintiff suffered from osteoporosis and other spinal issues (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   J. Stip. at 8-9). Plaintiff argues that the ALJ should have \"recontacted the treating doctors for further explanation or clarification or sent [her] out for a consultative examination.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She further contends that the ALJ improperly \"cited to the objective findings of the MRI\" because she was not a doctor and was not qualified to interpret them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The stage-agency physicians reviewed Plaintiff's medical records in March and June 2014 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 476-85, 512-18), and so they did not see the December 2014 lumbar-\n   and cervical-spine MRIs showing degenerative changes and cord flattening, among other issues (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 538-41). They also were not aware of Plaintiff's osteoporosis, which wasn't diagnosed until 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 536-37.) At most, they may have had access to records showing osteopenia. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 536 (indicating clinical history of osteopenia based on 2010 records).) Thus, based on the information they had available at the time, the state-agency physicians discounted Plaintiff's bone pain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 483.)

Such an evaluation could have clarified the record in this case, but the ALJ did not order one. Instead, she evaluated the MRIs and bone-density evidence herself, determining that the MRIs showed only \"slight abnormality that would have no more than a minimal effect on [Plaintiff's] ability to work\" and that the osteoporosis was nonsevere.
