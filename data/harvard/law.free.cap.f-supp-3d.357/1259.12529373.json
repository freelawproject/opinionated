For the following reasons, Travelers' Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 23, 2016, Defendant Volinski (\"Volinski\") was driving a 2001 GMC Jimmy with Kevin Maull (\"Maull\") as a passenger when she lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the ejection of both Volinski and Maull. (Doc. 30-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.) At the time of the accident, Volinski had left work and had spent a few hours at her apartment before leaving with Maull in the GMC Jimmy to take Maull to his job. (Doc. 47-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Volinski was employed by Peachstate (collectively, with Flor &amp; Floyd and Oxford, the \"Corporate Defendants\") as a filer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.) Her job duties were entirely clerical and included cleaning out and organizing files and answering phone calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Her job duties did not, however, include driving, and she was never paid for her time driving to and from work, even when driving the GMC Jimmy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The GMC Jimmy involved in the accident was personally owned and personally insured by Defendant Christopher Flor (\"Flor\"), an executive officer of the Corporate Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.) The vehicle was \"wrapped\" with advertising for the Corporate Defendants and generally remained at various locations to help with visibility and advertising for the Corporate Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28.) The employees of the Corporate Defendants did not readily have access to the GMC Jimmy, which was only available upon the permission of Flor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Apart from Flor's personal insurance policy, the Corporate Defendants obtained general liability and umbrella policies from Travelers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35, 44.) The corporate policies excluded coverage for bodily injury arising out of the use of any vehicle operated by the insureds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39.) However, the corporate policies contained an Endorsement that modified the general exclusion to provide coverage for bodily injury arising from the use of a \"hired auto\" or \"nonowned auto.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.) This Endorsement specifically did not apply to vehicles used in the course and scope of the Corporate Defendants' business at the time of an occurrence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In a lawsuit currently pending in state court (the \"Underlying Action\"), Defendant\n   Daisy Davis (\"Davis\"), as representative of Maull, asserts claims against the Corporate Defendants, Flor, and Volinski stemming from the single-vehicle accident on November 23, 2016. (Doc. 30-1.) The complaint in the Underlying Action alleges that the GMC Jimmy was covered in advertisements for the purpose of promoting the business of the Corporate Defendants and was used for the purpose of providing transportation to an employee for the furtherance of the Corporate Defendants' business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.) Davis claims that as a result of Defendants' negligence, Maull suffered a traumatic brain injury that led to a permanent vegetative state. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.) Davis is ultimately seeking recovery for past and future medical expenses, lost wages and fringe benefits, and past and future pain and suffering. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 33-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Travelers agreed to provide a defense for and indemnify the Corporate Defendants for the Underlying Action subject to a full reservation of rights under the insurance policy provided to the Corporate Defendants. (Doc. 47-2 at \u00b6 11.) Travelers subsequently filed this declaratory action seeking a determination that it has no duty to defend or to indemnify Defendants for the claims asserted in the Underlying Action. Travelers now moves for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The contract of liability insurance at issue in this case generally excludes coverage for bodily injury caused by motor vehicle accidents. However, the policies provide limited coverage under a \"Hired Auto and Nonowned Auto Liability\" Endorsement for \" 'bodily injury'...arising out of the maintenance or use of a 'hired auto' or 'nonowned auto.' \" Specifically, the policy defines \"hired auto\" and \"nonowned auto\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Hired auto\" means any \"auto\" [Peachstate, Flor &amp; Floyd, or Oxford] lease, rent or borrow. This does not include:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   b.

( [Doc. 47-2, at \u00b6 33]; [Doc. 52-2, at \u00b6 33]; [Doc. 53-1, at \u00b6 33.] ) Furthermore, even if it were leased, rented, or borrowed by the Corporate Defendants, the vehicle is owned by Defendant Flor-an employee, partner, or stockholder of the Corporate Defendants-and would thus be excluded from coverage under the policies. Thus, the only question remaining is whether the vehicle qualifies as a \"nonowned auto\" under the Endorsement, which requires that the vehicle was being used in the course and scope of the Corporate Defendants' business at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Endorsement does not define \"course and scope of business.\" As such, the term should be construed in accordance with its commonly used meaning.\n   <em>\n    Broad v.
