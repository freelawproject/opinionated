Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendants engaged in purposeful discrimination and conducted a pretextual disciplinary investigation that ultimately resulted in Plaintiffs' forced resignations. These allegations are predicated on a 2015 internal investigation, wherein Plaintiffs and six other officers were identified as spending excessive amounts of time inside campus buildings, rather than patrolling the Temple campus, as they were required to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   All Defendants have moved for summary judgment. For the reasons stated below, I will grant the Motions for Summary Judgment on all claims, with the\n   exception of the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendants Temple University, Wilhelm, and Woltemate as to Plaintiffs' Procedural Due Process Claim (Count Four).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their Complaint against multiple Defendants on October 25, 2016. Setting out each of these claims is necessary to understand the bases for my analysis. The claims brought against Defendant Busam are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   - Violation of Plaintiffs' First Amendment Rights (Count One);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   - Violation of Title VII by creating a hostile work environment through his use of aggressive and abusive language against Plaintiffs and other minorities, and by retaliating against Plaintiffs by initiating disciplinary action against Plaintiffs after they attended a \"Grievance Meeting.\" (Count Two);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   - Violation of Plaintiffs' equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment (Count Three);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   - Violation of Plaintiffs' Substantive Due Process Rights (Count Four);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   - Violation of Plaintiffs' Procedural Due Process Rights (Count Five).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs have brought the following claims against Defendants, Temple University, Wilhelm, Woltermate, James, and Crawford (collectively, the \"Temple Defendants\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   - Violation of Plaintiffs' First Amendment Rights by taking retaliatory action against Plaintiffs because Plaintiffs participated in the same Grievance Meeting mentioned above (Count One);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   - Violation of Title VII by creating a hostile work environment, retaliating against Plaintiffs by initiating disciplinary action against Plaintiffs after they attended the \"Grievance Meeting,\" and intentional discrimination by assigning more favorable jobs to Caucasian officers and discriminatorily investigating minority police officers while failing to investigate Defendant Busam (Count Two);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   - Violation of Plaintiffs' equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, where the Temple Defendants failed to discipline Defendant Busam and failed to respond to an officer's email that stated his belief that Temple was perpetuating systemic racism (Count Three);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   - Violation of Plaintiffs' Substantive Due Process Rights by depriving them of their ability to \"pursue a calling.\" (Count Four); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   - Violation of Plaintiffs' Procedural Due Process Rights by failing to provide meaningful notice and an opportunity to be heard in the pre-termination hearings (Count Five).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs have gone to great lengths to identify \"genuine\" disputed facts. However, careful examination of these purported disputed facts reflects that most of the \"disputes\" raised by Plaintiffs are either taken out of context, inaccurate, or conclusory in nature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   My review of the record\n   reflects that the following facts are undisputed, unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff Shaw is an African American male who worked for the Temple University Police Department as a bike patrol officer from 2003 to August 2016. (Shaw Dep. 8/11/17 at 19:20-20:5, 66:12-69:14, 133:23-134:2, ECF No. 77-10, 79-2, 83-6.) Plaintiff LaCourt is a Puerto Rican male who worked for Temple University Police Department from 2010 to August 2016, also as a bike patrol officer. (LaCourt Dep. 8/28/17 at 29:2-7, 34:13-18, 63:22-24, 106:20-107:7, 117:20-21, ECF No. 77-7, 79-3, 83-7.) During their employment, Plaintiffs were members of the International Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America Union and its Amalgamated Local 511 Union (the \"Union\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:8-10, Shaw Dep. at 74:24-75:9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant Temple University is a private state-related university, which supervises and controls its Department of Campus Safety Services (the \"Temple Police\"). (Compl. \u00b6 3, ECF No. 1.) The Temple Police provides 24-hour safety and security services to Temple University's campuses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Defendants Denise Wilhelm and Edward Woltemate were employed by the Temple Police as captains during the events in question. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.) Defendant Charles James was employed by the Temple Police as a sergeant during the events in question. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Defendant Brian Crawford was employed by the Temple Police as a corporal during the events in question. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Defendant Justin Busam was employed by the Temple Police as a patrol officer during the events in question. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Temple Police use the following hierarchical structure: the highest position is executive director, followed by deputy director, captain, sergeant, corporal, and ending with patrol officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Plaintiffs and Defendant Busam were patrol officers of equal rank during the alleged events. (LaCourt Dep. at 322:24-223:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Shift Assignments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Temple Police Officers work in one of three shifts, wherein the Shift Supervisor assigns each patrol officer to a particular sector of campus to be patrolled by car, bike, or on foot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-18.) Lieutenant Russell Moody, who is not a defendant, is an African American male and was the Shift Supervisor who determined Plaintiffs' shift assignments. (Moody Dep. 8/1/17 at 204:22-207:19, ECF No. 77-6, 79-28, 83-8; Wilhelm Dep. 7/18/17 at 15:7-18, 60:21-24, 223:11-22, ECF No. 77-8, 79-26, 79-27,\n   83-9.) Defendant James, Defendant Crawford, and Corporal Francisco Gonzalez (not a defendant) would sometimes alter Lieutenant Moody's assignments based on the demands of the day. (Moody Dep. at 24:4-8; James Dep. 7/17/17 at 184:12-22, ECF No. 80-31, 83-30; Crawford Dep. 7/19/17 at 8:23-9:5, 11:10-24, ECF No. 80-51, 83-27; Alston Dep. 12/15/17 at 19:13-23:8, ECF No. 77-13, 79-29, 83-20; Santiago Dep. 8/29/17 at 57:11-60:9, ECF No. 83-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Grievance Meeting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In July of 2015, Lieutenant Moody sent a text message to the bike patrol officers assigned to the night shift, requesting an informal meeting in the lobby of a Temple University building that was separate from the Police Headquarters (the \"Grievance Meeting\"). (Compl. \u00b6 40.) The Grievance Meeting was not initiated on behalf of the Union or Temple University. Plaintiffs attended the Grievance Meeting with six other officers; the group was comprised of African American, Caucasian, and Latino individuals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) Defendant Wilhelm was informed of the Grievance Meeting on November 9, 2015. (Wilhelm Dep. at 211:13-212:11; Moody Dep. at 106:12-21; LaCourt Dep. at 243:5-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the Complaint and Response in Opposition to Summary Judgment, Plaintiffs complain about racial discrimination and Defendant Busam's racial slurs. Yet, the undisputed facts of record reflect that during the Grievance Meeting, the officers did not discuss or allege anything about a \"segregation conspiracy,\" racially-motivated assignments, or a \"stigma of inferiority\" on minority officers. (LaCourt Dep. at 130:18-131:2, 206:5-18, 131:4-7, 206:19-207:15.) Rather, Plaintiffs and the other officers complained about officer safety concerns, back-up issues, assignment changes, and the \"unfair treatment in the rotation of vehicles.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:7-14, 214:5-215:11.) While the officers did express their dislike for Busam, none contended during the Grievance Meeting that he was racist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74:2-11, 85:11-87:7, 202:17-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The 2015 Investigations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Sometime in late July 2015, after the Grievance Meeting, Defendant Busam complained to Defendant Wilhelm that some officers were spending extended or excessive periods of time in campus buildings and not properly performing their police duties. (Wilhelm Dep. at 23:12-26:24.) Upon receiving the complaint, Wilhelm initiated an investigation with Defendant Woltemate by requesting that Detective Haworth (also not a defendant) review the surveillance video of the campus buildings. (Wilhelm Dep. 46:7-23; Woltemate Dep. 7/19/17 at 23:9-11, ECF No. 80-32; Haworth Dep. 8/18/17 at 26:22-28:24, 50:20-51:18, ECF No. 80-33, 83-30.) Detective Haworth's review of the campus buildings was not directed toward any particular officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The investigation revealed that Plaintiffs and six other officers had been spending excessive periods of time in buildings during their shifts, in violation of the employment policies. (Woltemate Dep. at 26:20-27:24; Haworth Dep. at 7:10-11, 20:12-22:18, 23:9-11; Wilhelm Dep. at 54:16-55:15, 63:14-23, 69:10-70:6, 96:16-97:1, 121:4-122:2.) The group of eight officers identified in the investigation was\n   comprised of Hispanic, African American, and Caucasian individuals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Based on the findings of the investigation, Defendants Wilhelm and Woltemate facilitated an interview with each of the eight officers, wherein each officer, including Plaintiffs, were interviewed about the excessive time spent inside campus buildings during their patrols. Plaintiff Shaw's interview was conducted on September 2, 2015 and Plaintiff LaCourt's interview was conducted on September 17, 2015. (Shaw Tr. 9/2/15, ECF No. 80-35, 83-10, 83-11; LaCourt Tr. 9/17/15, ECF No. 80-36, 83-11.) During each interview, Wilhelm and Woltemate asked essentially the same questions of all the officers, and provided them with the opportunity to explain why they were spending excessive time in the buildings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Notice of Plaintiffs' offenses was provided during the interview and each Plaintiff was represented by a Union Representative during the interviews. (Shaw Dep. at 248:2-250:21; Shaw Tr. 9/2/15; LaCourt Dep. at 228:10-24, 230:20-231:18; Jones Dep. 12/16/18 at 12:12-24, ECF No. 80-44, 83-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Neither Plaintiff was shown the surveillance footage during their interviews. (Wilhelm Dep. at 70:7-13; Woltemate Dep. at 85:23-87:2.) It is important to note here that Plaintiff LaCourt did not request to see the surveillance footage during the interview. (LaCourt Dep. at 355:17-356:4; Wilhelm Dep. at 70:7-13; Woltemate Dep. at 85:23-87:2.) However, it is disputed whether Plaintiff Shaw requested to see the video and patrol logs that Defendants stated were evidence of his violations. (Shaw Dep. at 265:1-10; Sabir Dep. 8/2/17 at 39:7-15, ECF No. 79018, 83-12; Wilhelm Dep. at 70:7-13; Woltemate Dep. at 85:23-87:2.) Defendant Woltemate transcribed the interviews, which were provided to Plaintiffs and their union representatives at the end of the interviews. (Shaw Dep. at 248:2-250:21; LaCourt at 228:19-24, 232:1-6.) After reviewing the transcription, both Plaintiffs signed a statement indicating that they did not dispute being in the buildings during the alleged times. (Shaw Tr. 9/2/15; LaCourt Tr. 9/17/15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Last Chance Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   After concluding these interviews, the Union negotiated the same sanctions for Plaintiffs and the other six officers. (Sabir Dep. at 33:13-15; Shaw Dep. at 273:20-275:3, 276:13-20, 320:1-12; Davis Dep. 6/1/18 at 10:18-11:13, 13:18-20, 17:14-22:24, ECF No. 80-49, 83-39; Leone Dep. 12/4/17 at 27:2-23, 31:24-35:24, ECF No. 80-46, 83-14.) While the officers could have been terminated for their offenses, the Union instead negotiated a three-day suspension, followed by a \"probationary\" period of one year. During this probationary period, Plaintiffs agreed that they could be terminated for any violation of the Temple University Rules of Conduct that resulted in a written warning. In other words, if Plaintiffs violated the Temple University Rules of Conduct, they could be immediately terminated without being able to contest the termination (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a grievance). This negotiated discipline was memorialized in the \"Last Chance Agreements,\" which was signed by each Plaintiff. (LaCourt's Last Chance Agreement 3/11/16, ECF No. 80-5; Shaw's Last Chance Agreement 9/30/15, ECF No. 80-6; Davis Dep. at 15:2-16; Shaw Dep. at 277:21-24, 278:1-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On September 29, 2015, Plaintiff Shaw was presented with his Last Chance Agreement in the presence of Union Representative William Lacey. (Shaw Dep. at 275:4-16; Lacey Dep. 1/12/18 at 21:4-23:24, ECF No. 80-48, 83-40.) Plaintiff Shaw was provided with the opportunity to discuss the Last Chance Agreement with Lacey, but he did not ask Lacey any questions or raise any objections. (Lacey Dep. at 35:12-17,\n   37:20-38:1; Shaw Dep. at 272:19-273:3, 341:18-342:3.) Plaintiff Shaw signed the Last Chance Agreement, which placed him on probation until October 3, 2016. (Shaw Dep. at 272:19-273:3, 277:21-24, 341:18-342:3; Lacey Dep. at 21:2-3, 31:19-24.) As noted above, the Last Chance Agreement stated that any violation of Temple University's Rules of Conduct during the probationary period would \"be grounds for termination and will not be grievable.\" (Shaw's Last Chance Agreement 9/30/15; Shaw Dep. at 277:21-24, 278:1-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On March 11, 2016, Plaintiff LaCourt was also presented with his Last Chance Agreement in the presence of Union Representative Brent Tillman. (Tillman Dep. 1/12/18 at 5:17-6:4, 9:23-10:9, 18:12-15, ECF No. 80-49, 83-49.) Plaintiff LaCourt was provided with the opportunity to discuss the Last Chance Agreement with Tillman, but he did not ask Tillman any questions or assert any objections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:17-13:5, 15:22-16:24, 23:20-24, 25:11-17.) Plaintiff LaCourt signed the Last Chance Agreement, which placed him on probation until March 12, 2017. (LaCourt Dep. at 191:23-192:14, 279:8-280:12; Tillman Dep. at 10:5-17:7.) The Last Chance Agreement also stated that any violation of Temple University's Rules of Conduct during the probationary period would \"be grounds for termination and will not be grievable.\" (LaCourt's Last Chance Agreement 3/11/16; LaCourt Dep. at 279:18-280:12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The 2016 Violations and Interviews\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On July 22, 2016, Plaintiff Shaw received a radio order to respond to an unconscious student in a dorm room, but did not respond until thirty minutes after receiving the call because he was on a shift break. (Shaw Dep. at 332:14-22, 349:1-351:23.) Shaw never informed dispatch that he was on break, even though he was required to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Crawford Dep. at 143:2-144:24.) Given the severity of the situation, Defendant Crawford, acting as the supervisor on duty, reported the incident to his supervisor, Defendant James. (James Dep. at 60:10-61:15; Crawford Dep. 144:9-13.) Defendant James reviewed the available security footage to determine why Plaintiff Shaw failed to respond to the call. (James Dep. at 71:7-72:24, 99:10-100:19.) During this review, Defendant James discovered that both Plaintiffs had been in a University building for an excessive amount of time when they should have been patrolling. (James Dep. at 72:7-10.) Defendant James informed his supervisor, Defendant Wilhelm, of the incident in a memorandum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Wilhelm Dep. at 163:21-164:3.) Defendant Wilhelm investigated the incident by obtaining the audio logs, patrol logs, video footage, and incident report. (Wilhelm Dep. at 164:16-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Based on Defendant Wilhelm's investigation, Defendants Wilhelm and Woltemate conducted interviews, wherein they asked Plaintiffs about the incident in the presence of their Union Representatives. (Shaw Dep. at 346:21-347:4, Sabir Dep. at 15:2-22:16; LaCourt Dep. at 65:16-66:1, 70:6-16.) Both Plaintiffs admitted to being in a University building during the alleged time when they should have been patrolling. (Shaw 2016 Interview, ECF No. 80-20; LaCourt 2016 Interview, ECF No. 80-21; Shaw Dep. 345:13-346:20; LaCourt Dep. 77:18-78:20.) Defendant Woltemate transcribed the questions and responses. (Woltemate Dep. at 74:23-76:21.) After the interviews, Plaintiffs were given the opportunity to discuss the transcriptions with their Union Representatives and signed the transcription without voicing any disagreements or objections. (Shaw Dep. at 345:13-346:20; Sabir Dep. at 21:19-22; LaCourt Dep. at 77:18-80:18, 95:15-96:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff Shaw's conduct on July 22, 2016 relating to the failure to respond to a radio call, spending excessive time in buildings, and failing to record time in or out on the time logs violated the Temple University Rules of Conduct. (Temple University Code of Conduct, ECF No. 80-24.) Likewise, Plaintiff LaCourt's excessive time spent in buildings violated the Temple University Rules of Conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On July 22, 2016, both Plaintiffs were still working under their one-year probationary period. (Shaw's Last Chance Agreement 9/30/15; LaCourt's Last Chance Agreement 3/11/16.) Because this conduct violated the Temple University Rules of Conduct and occurred within the probationary period, Plaintiffs violated their Last Chance Agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Both Plaintiffs resigned based upon the Union Representative's advice that they would be terminated. (LaCourt Dep. at 76:3-6; Shaw Dep. at 87:17-89:3; Shaw's Resignation Letter 8/18/16, ECF No. 77-2, 79-23; LaCourt's Resignation Letter 8/18/16, ECF No. 77-4, 79-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

(Alston Dep. at 22:9-23:8; Santiago Dep. at 57:11-60:9.) Moreover, Plaintiffs cannot establish that Defendant Busam's alleged report to Defendant Wilhelm rises to the level of \"initiating a disciplinary process,\" given that it was up to Wilhelm as supervisor to decide whether or not to investigate. In fact, the undisputed facts reflect that it was only after Wilhelm broadly investigated the allegations that a disciplinary process was initiated.

Section 1981 Claims (Count Four)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that Defendant Busam created a hostile work environment through his aggressive and abusive language against Plaintiffs and other minorities and that he retaliated against Plaintiffs using his\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facto\n   </em>\n   supervisory authority to initiate the investigation against Plaintiffs. Defendant Busam responds that Plaintiffs' hostile work environment claim is not supported because there is insufficient evidence to establish \"extreme and pervasive conduct.\" Defendant Busam further argues that Plaintiffs cannot establish a retaliation claim against him because he had no supervisory authority over Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has found individual liability under \u00a7 1981 \"when [the defendants] intentionally cause an infringement of rights protected by Section 1981, regardless of whether the [employer] may also be held liable.\" See\n   <em>\n    Cardenas v.

Plaintiff LaCourt similarly stated that Defendant Busam used a racial slur in his presence one time when he called another officer (Acosta) \"an f'ing Puerto Rican.\" (LaCourt Dep. at 324:15-325:14.)

But, as explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs cannot establish that they were victims of Busam's \"pervasive and severe\" discrimination. Further, Plaintiffs cannot establish that the alleged discriminatory shift assignments rise to the level of a hostile work environment where the shift\n   assignments were determined by Moody, an African American officer. (Moody Dep. at 204:22-207:19; Wilhelm Dep. at 25:5-11, 60:21-24, 223:11-22.)

Plaintiffs' reliance on the speculation of Officers Alston and Santiago that Defendants James and Crawford changed the assignments because of their friendship with Busam does not rise to the requisite level of discrimination.

First, neither Wilhelm nor Woltemate identified any officers by name when conducting the general surveillance review during the 2015 investigation. (Wilhelm Dep. at 46:7-23; Woltemate Dep. at 23:9-11.) Second, Detective Haworth's review of the campus buildings was not directed toward any particular officer. (Haworth Dep. at 26:22-28:24, 50:20-51:18.) Once the investigation was complete, a group of eight officers was identified as spending excess time in the buildings, which was comprised of African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic officers. These eight officers were all investigated\n   and interviewed in the same manner. (Woltemate Dep. at 26:20-27:24; Haworth Dep. at 7:10-11, 20:12-22:18, 23:9-11; Wilhelm Dep. at 54:16-55:15, 63:14-23, 69:10-70:6, 96:16-97:1, 121:4-122:2.) Third, after the investigation and interviews, all eight officers received the same discipline that was negotiated by the Union. (Sabir Dep. at 33:13-15; Shaw Dep. at 273:20-275:3, 276:13-20, 320:1-12; Shaw Dep. at 273:20-275:3, 276:13-20, 320:1-12; Davis Dep. at 10:18-11:13, 13:18-20, 17:14-22:24; Leone Dep. at 27:2-23, 31:24-35:24.) Lastly, and most importantly, Plaintiffs do not refute that their conduct violated the University's Policies and Last Chance Agreements, which explicitly provided for their termination. (Shaw's Last Chance Agreement 9/30/15; LaCourt's Last Chance Agreement 3/11/16.) This fact precludes Plaintiffs from establishing that the alleged adverse action raises an inference of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Inexplicably, Plaintiffs also argue that the Temple Defendants intentionally discriminated against them by failing to investigate Defendant Busam for more egregious behavior. But, Plaintiffs have not explained how this fact, even if proven, establishes an intentional discrimination claim. This is especially the case where Defendant Busam was not implicated in the 2015 investigations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hanzer v.

And, as explained in great detail\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , neither Wilhelm nor Woltemate identified any officers by name when conducting the general surveillance review during the 2015 investigation, and Detective Haworth's review of the buildings was not directed toward any particular officer.

But, Plaintiffs have not explained how this argument establishes an intentional discrimination claim, which requires them to establish a disparate impact plus some additional evidence that the defendant intended to discriminate. Plaintiffs and the six other officers were investigated and identified by Captain Wilhelm and Captain Woltemate after Detective Haworth conducted a general review of the security footage of the campus buildings, which was not directed toward any particular officer.

Further, Plaintiffs fail to explain why the investigation of Defendant Busam is relevant, given that he was not part of the group of eight officers identified in the investigation. Neither have Plaintiffs presented evidence of the Temple Defendants' intent to discriminate, where the group identified in the investigation was comprised of African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic officers, all of whom were investigated, interviewed, and disciplined in the same manner.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that Defendant Busam's Motion for Summary Judgment should be granted, and the Temple Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment should be granted as to Counts One, Two, Three, and Five. Defendants Crawford and James' Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiffs' Procedural Due Process Claim (Count Four) will also be granted. Defendants Temple University, Wilhelm, and Woltemate's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiffs' Procedural Due Process Claim (Count Four) will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    By way of example, in support of their motion, the Temple Defendants note that \"[d]uring the probationary term, in direct violation of Temple University's Rules of Conduct, Plaintiffs were again found to be spending excessive amounts of time in campus buildings.\" (Temple Defs.' Statement of Undisputed Facts \u00b6 5, ECF No. 80-1.) In an attempt to rebut these facts, Plaintiffs state: \"Denied. The documents cited in this paragraph speak for themselves. It is denied that the August 2016 'interviews' of Shaw and LaCourt referred to in this paragraph were the basis for any determination of 'violation' referenced in this paragraph.\" (Pls.' Resp. Temple Defs.' Statement Undisputed Facts \u00b6 5, ECF No. 83-1.) Yet, as will be detailed\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , it is undisputed that Plaintiffs acknowledged that they were spending excessive amounts of time in campus buildings. (Shaw Dep. 8/11/17 at 352:18-20, ECF No. 80-2; LaCourt Dep. 8/28/17 at 353:13-18, ECF No. 80-3; Shaw Interview 8/10/16, ECF No. 80-10; LaCourt Interview 8/17/16, ECF No. 80-11; Report of Sergeant James, ECF No. 80-9.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    By way of further example, and in support of their position that Plaintiffs were not discriminatorily assigned to bike patrol, the Temple Defendant note that: \"Officers on bike patrol can ask to come off patrol at any time.\" (Temple Defs.' Statement of Undisputed Facts \u00b6 17, ECF No. 80-1.) In response, Plaintiffs state: \"Denied as stated. The portion of the deposition cited in this paragraph speaks for itself. David Alston (AA) ('Alston') testified that any 'request' to 'come off bike' patrol was subject to supervisory approval\" (Pls.' Resp. Temple Defs.' Statement Undisputed Facts \u00b6 17, ECF No. 83-1.) Plaintiffs' response does not refute the Temple Defendants' statement of facts, and it remains undisputed that the bike patrollers could request to be removed from patrol.

However, Plaintiff Shaw testified that he personally overheard Busam using a racial slur against someone else only one time. (Shaw Dep. 235:11-236:3.) Plaintiff LaCourt similarly testified that Busam used a racial slur in his presence one time when he called another officer \"an f'ing Puerto Rican.\" (LaCourt Dep. 324:15-325:14.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    Plaintiffs assert that Defendant Busam is liable under the \"cat's paw theory\" of liability. This theory of liability \"addresses the circumstances under which\n    <em>\n     an employer\n    </em>\n    may be held liable for employment discrimination based on the discriminatory animus of an employee who influenced, but did not make, the ultimate employment decision.\"\n    <em>\n     Jones v.
