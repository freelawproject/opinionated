Mot. at 12-23. The Court first discusses whether the relief sought by Malem against Theos in the Contempt Proceeding constituted covered \"damages\" under the policies and determines it does not. Second, the Court discusses the policies' Intellectual Property and Unfair Competition Exclusions and finds that even if the Contempt Proceeding sought covered \"damages,\" these exclusions would nonetheless bar coverage.

Theos Mot. at 8-10. Theos's argument is based on the fact that Malem stated in the Contempt Motion that it was seeking \"\n   <em>\n    [m]onetary damages\n   </em>\n   arising from [Theos and Bhatia's] violations of the Consent Order and for breach of the Settlement Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Contempt Motion at 3 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Theos Mot. at 9-10. Theos focuses on the fact that breach of the Consent Decree was based on Theos's disparagement of Malem. Theos Mot. at 9-11 (arguing that \"it is crystal clear that it is clear that Malem sought compensatory damages for disparagement in their moving papers\"). Theos also relies on the February 8, 2017 letter from Malem's counsel to Theos's counsel and Malem's July 20, 2017 trial brief to support its argument that Malem was seeking compensatory damages in the underlying Contempt Proceeding. Theos Mot. at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Court finds Theos's arguments unconvincing. First, despite the fact that Malem stated it was seeking \"monetary damages\" in the relief section of the Contempt Motion, Malem's argument section makes clear that Malem was actually seeking attorneys' fees and legal costs. Malem explained that it believed that Theos had breached Paragraph 9 of the Consent Order by making disparaging comments and that Malem believed it was entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs for that breach pursuant to Paragraph VII of the Settlement Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Contempt Mot. at 4-8. Malem never stated it was seeking compensatory damages for disparagement.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20804\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Moreover, to the extent there was any ambiguity in Malem's opening Contempt Motion brief, Malem's reply in the Contempt Proceeding clarified that it was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   seeking damages for disparagement and instead was seeking only attorneys' fees and costs under the Settlement Agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Combined Opposition, at page 5, mistakes [Malem's] prayers for costs with a prayer for damages\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .... That simply is a misreading of the Motion for a Show Cause Order, which only seeks the costs of obtaining the contempt citations.... [P]age 3, n. 2, and page 7 where the issue of 'damages' is limited to reopening the case to permit [Malem] to seek 'damages under the Settlement Agreement' which had a prevailing party attorney's fees clause ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Neither of [Malem's] motions seeks a fine or damages at this point.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   There is no question that [Malem] will file a motion to reopen the case to sue for breach of contract, unfair trade practices and trade libel.

Importantly, the exclusions apply not just to \"any claim,\" but also to any \"\n   <em>\n    suit\n   </em>\n   \" that includes intellectual property or unfair competition claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. A at 0046-47; Ex. B at 0050-51. The Malem Action constitutes a suit because it was a civil proceeding in which damages were sought, and the Malem Action included intellectual property and unfair competition claims because Malem brought claims for, among other things, unfair competition under state and federal law, and common law misappropriation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Great American RJN, Ex. J. Moreover, the Contempt Proceeding was a part of the Malem Action, that is, part of the same \"suit.\" Both the Malem Action and the Contempt Proceeding were before the same court and had the same case number and caption. Further, Judge Chen specifically retained jurisdiction over the Malem Action to hear the Contempt Proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Consent Decree \u00b6 9. Therefore, as the Malem Action was a suit that contained allegations of intellectual property infringement and unfair competition claims, and as the Contempt Proceeding was a part of that \"suit,\" the Court finds that coverage of the Contempt Proceeding is also barred by the Intellectual Property and Unfair Competition Exclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Theos's arguments to the contrary are unavailing. First, Theos's citation to\n   <em>\n    Western Intern. Corp. Syndication Corp. v. Gulf Ins.

Moreover, the Court granted Great American's request to take judicial notice of those documents.\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    , note 1. Therefore, Theos is similarly granted judicial notice of the July 20, 2017 trial brief.
