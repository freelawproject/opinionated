RELEVANT FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    3.1 Night of March 9-10, 2014\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the afternoon of March 9, 2014, Terry was arrested and taken to the MCJ. Terry was 32 years old and nine months pregnant with her third child. Terry was screened by Nurse Maggie Burton at around 6:28 p.m. Terry informed Burton that she was a daily heroin user and that she was due to deliver that day. Terry also stated that she felt pressure and tightening,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that she felt a pain sensation that she was familiar with from her other two births, which she associated with the baby dropping right before labor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Burton arranged for the MCJ to send Terry to Froedtert Hospital (\"Froedtert\"), where she was monitored for labor. Terry's records from Froedtert reveal that she was 80 percent effaced and 2 centimeters dilated, and experienced \"intermittent\" contractions, some of which she slept through. The hospital records also indicate that Terry was a daily heroin user and had tested positive for opiates that day. After conducting an ultrasound, Froedtert estimated that she was likely due around March 18, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When Terry did not show any change in dilation or rate of contractions, Froedtert concluded that Terry was \"not currently in labr\" (sic) and released Terry back to the MCJ, where she was to receive continued prenatal care. (Docket # 174-11 at 21-23). Terry recalls the doctor telling her that she was in the early stages of labor, and it was unclear how fast labor would progress. The County Defendants deny that this was communicated to them, though they admit that two correctional officers were with Terry at Froedtert. Terry was restrained at the hospital, with one wrist restraint and one leg iron. She was also transported to, and held at, the hospital in leg irons, wrist restraints, and a belly chain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Terry returned to the MCJ around 1:00 am with incomplete discharge paperwork from Froedtert Hospital. Specifically, the discharge paperwork did not contain information detailing the tests that the Froedtert medical staff had performed, what they recommended for a treatment plan, or details about Terry's condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When Terry returned to the MCJ, Exum evaluated her for admittance back to the jail. Exum knew that Terry was nine months pregnant, an opiate user, and had just returned from Froedtert to rule out labor. Based on Terry's late stage pregnancy and opiate history, Exum also knew that Terry was at risk of early labor. Terry told Exum that the hospital said she was in labor but sent her back to jail anyway. Terry denied feeling contractions but stated that she was experiencing pressure at the bottom of her stomach. Exum checked for contractions but did not detect any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Exum contacted Dr. Gina Buono, who was the on-call physician that night, to discuss Terry. Exum told Dr. Buono that Froedtert had medically cleared Terry for admittance to the jail. Exum also explained that there were no specific discharge orders. Dr. Buono instructed Exum to contact Froedtert to receive an oral report and request Terry's discharge paperwork. Exum called Froedtert and spoke with an unidentified person, who confirmed that Froedtert had ruled out labor for Terry, but did not provide information regarding a treatment plan (particularly with regard to the impending opiate withdrawal).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exum requested Terry's discharge papers by fax, then called Dr. Buono back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Based on Exum's report, Dr. Buono approved Terry's admittance to the MCJ,\n   and placed her in the Special Medical Unit (\"SMU\"), where she could be closely monitored by medical staff. Exum also received approval to begin the paperwork for the MCJ's opiate protocol for heroin-addicted mothers. (Docket # 174-13 at 101:11-102:9). Meanwhile, Dr. Buono instructed Exum to procure Terry's discharge documents. Exum conducted a standard, 20-minute medical examination of Terry, which included taking her vitals. When Terry was admitted to the SMU at approximately 1:30 a.m. on March 10, neither Dr. Buono nor Froedtert's medical staff had ordered additional nursing assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The SMU is located on the second floor of the MCJ, upstairs from Exum's booking station, and across the hall from the clinic. The SMU consists of 11 cells arranged in a semi-circle, with an officer's work station at one end of the semi-circle. Cells 1-3 have two doors, whereas Cells 4-11 only have one door. Despite having two doors, it is possible to hear inmates when standing outside of Cells 1-3. Additionally, each cell door has a window, so an officer standing outside of the cell can see inmate activity inside of the cell. Each cell is also equipped with a call apparatus that activates a red light outside the cell door. This red light notifies the correctional officer on duty to call the nurse in the clinic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During the night shift, from 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., the SMU is staffed with one nurse, who sits in the clinic across the hall from the SMU, and one correctional officer, who sits at a work station at the end of the semi-circle of cells. It is the SMU nurse's responsibility to know the medical conditions of the inmates in the SMU, based on information provided from the booking nurse. The SMU nurse working the night shift typically performs at least two rounds to check on inmates in the SMU (at around 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.). When Terry arrived at the SMU around 1:45 a.m., Bevenue, the nurse on duty that night, had already performed her initial round. Terry believes that Bevenue may have entered the SMU after Terry was admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Wenzel was the correctional officer on duty at the SMU that night. He worked in the SMU alone, and was the only person responsible for periodically checking the inside of the cells of the SMU. Armor and the County do not require officers to have any special medical training in order to work at the SMU.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Terry was the sixth inmate assigned to the SMU that night. She was placed in Cell 3, which was located directly across from Wenzel's desk. Lieutenant Crystalina Montano (\"Montano\"), the supervisor on duty, informed Wenzel that Terry was nine months pregnant and had just returned from Froedtert Hospital because she was not in active labor. Wenzel also learned that Terry was a heroin user and might experience withdrawal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Soon after Terry arrived in the SMU, she began to experience contractions. She screamed in pain, called for help, and activated the emergency light, with no response from either Wenzel or Bevenue. She pounded on the window of her cell door at least three times. All parties agree that her water broke, and that at some point she took off her pants and underpants. As her contractions became more frequent and painful, she lay down on the bed and tried to breath though them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Part of Wenzel's job was to make rounds approximately every thirty minutes, which entailed walking past the 11 cells in the SMU and peering through the window of each cell. He was supposed to log each of these checks on his computer. It generally takes between one and two minutes to perform each inspection of the SMU. Many of Wenzel's entries from that night show that he completed his inspections\n   within a one-minute time-frame. The computer log shows that Wenzel ostensibly performed checks at 1:57 a.m., 2:27 a.m., 2:57 a.m., 3:11 a.m.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   3:41 a.m., 3:57 a.m., and 4:27 a.m. During Wenzel's break, another officer conducted a check at 3:27 a.m. At 4:40 a.m., Montano entered the SMU on a supervisory round.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At some point between 4:41 a.m. and 4:46 a.m., Terry delivered the baby, which was blue and appeared to have difficulty breathing. Terry reached into the baby's throat and cleared mucus from the air passage. At approximately 4:46 a.m., Wenzel made an emergency call, requesting medical assistance for Terry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nurses Exum, Hoover, and Bevenue responded to the call, and Terry and the baby were transferred to Aurora Sinai Hospital (\"Aurora\") shortly thereafter. Terry has no recollection of being restrained while she was transported to Aurora.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In contrast to this series of events, the County Defendants claim that no official knew that Terry was in labor, and that she gave no indication to any person that she was going into labor. According to the County Defendants, Bevenue and Wenzel performed their rounds dutifully and neither heard nor saw a single out-of-the-ordinary thing until 4:46 a.m., when the faint cry of a baby (and a previously unnoticed red light) drew Wenzel's attention to the fact that Terry had (silently) given birth in her jail cell. These facts are, clearly, in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Terry stayed in the hospital from March 10 to March 13, 2014 for post-partum care and medical monitoring of her drug withdrawal. During this time, she was restrained by her right wrist and left ankle. The wrist restraint was removed at one point to allow Terry to hold her baby. The wrist restraint was also switched to allow Terry to use a different arm for the IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    3.2 Armor and the County's Policies and Procedures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Armor and the County have several policies that are relevant to Terry's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Armor's Receiving Screening Policy, J-E-02, revised May 3, 2013 predicates a hospitalized inmate's readmission to the MCJ on receipt of written documentation of treatment and follow-up recommendations. (Docket # 182-30 at 2). It was nevertheless common for patients to return to jail from the hospital without adequate documentation about their condition. Armor and MCJ were aware of this ongoing issue. Dr. Buono described this as a recurrent problem not only with Armor and at MCJ, but at the Wisconsin Department of Corrections as well. (Docket # 174-14 at 62:17-64:24). She also described the measures that she takes to encourage physicians to fill out the appropriate paperwork for inmates returning to jail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65:4-22. There is evidence that, in the absence of paperwork, the MCJ staff were tasked with \"hunting\" down the hospital paperwork and calling physicians in order to get appropriate orders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65:1-66:3, 72:1-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Armor's Pregnancy Management Policy, J-G-07, revised June 12, 2009, states that \"[p]regnant patients who are on opiates\n   other than methadone and at risk for withdrawal will be protected from experiencing withdrawal through aggressive medical management including specialty consultation.\" (Docket # 190-1 at 3). The policy delineates various pregnancy management and prenatal care practices, and notes that \"[d]elivery will be at the hospital designated by the provider of prenatal services to the extent possible in accordance with facility operating procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Exum was trained by Armor and the County to call 911 if she thought someone was in labor. (Docket # 174-13 at 42:2-10; 43:7-14). Dr. Buono stated that patients in labor should be in the hospital, and that she would not put a patient in labor in the SMU. (Docket # 174-14 at 36:15-19). Wenzel was not trained in how to respond to pregnant inmates' needs, though he did understand that if an inmate \"verbalize[s that] they are in any sort of distress, you let somebody obviously higher trained than you come in and assist them.\" (Docket # 174-21 at 45:1-7;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 95:21-22 (\"When there is an emergency, we were trained to call master control.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The County's restraint policy in March 2014 required all inmates who went to the hospital to be restrained at two points, regardless of their criminal history or individualized circumstances. (Docket # 174-27 at 3-4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The policy, MMHS 13.7, required that \"[i]nmates in the hospital will be restrained by a handcuff and a leg iron attached to the side rail of the bed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. If an inmate was moved from the bed, they needed to be shackled at both ankles and placed in a belly chain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This provision also required a second officer to be present \"any time an inmate is removed from the bed until the inmate is re-secured to their hospital bed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    4. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The County Defendants assert that Exum and Bevenue acted reasonably as a matter of law, and that Wenzel did not know that Terry was in labor until after she gave birth. The County Defendants also argue that Terry did not adequately plead or support her\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims, and that she fails to show that any unconstitutional policy was the cause of her giving birth, unattended, in the MCJ. Finally, the County argues that its use of restraints was constitutional. Armor also contends that the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims pled in Terry's amended complaint are deficient and unsupported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the claim against Exum will be dismissed, and the claims against Wenzel and Bevenue will move forward. Whether Wenzel and Bevenue knew, or should have known, about Terry's labor, and whether they purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly ignored that she was in labor, are fact intensive issues subject to genuine dispute. Further, neither of these defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court will also dismiss the two\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   related to Armor and the County's intake paperwork policy and their lack of policy for late term pregnant or laboring inmates. The\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against the County regarding the use of restraints may go forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    4.1 Constitutional Violations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In the past, courts assessed pretrial detainee medical care claims under\n   the Eighth Amendment's deliberate indifference standard, \"reasoning that pretrial detainees are entitled to at least [as] much protection\" as convicted prisoners.\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Cty. of Lake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518199\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/335/#p350\">\n    900 F.3d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 350 (7th Cir. 2018).

Second, consistent with longstanding precedent concerning constitutional claims of medical misconduct, the jail officials' failure to properly recognize or treat the plaintiff's illness must have been the result of something more than negligence, or even gross negligence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518199\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/335/#p350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518199\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/335/#p350\">\n    at 353-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In fashioning a legal standard that accommodates these competing concerns, the Seventh Circuit created a doctrine that is difficult to apply. The Court of Appeals held that the standard for medical care under the Fourteenth Amendment consists of two questions. First, did the medical defendants act \"purposefully, knowingly, or perhaps even recklessly when they considered the consequences\" of their actions?\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518199\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/335/#p350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518199\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/335/#p350\">\n    at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, if so, was their conduct objectively reasonable, without consideration for their subjective intent?\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518199\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/335/#p350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   These elements are not clearly aligned with\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court stated that the intent element is intended to foreclose accidents.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590968\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2466/#p2473\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   's intent element initially\n   appears to correlate with this threshold question in\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   as to whether the defendant's conduct was volitional. But asking whether the defendant acted purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly with respect to \"the consequences of [his actions]\" goes well beyond asking whether he performed volitional acts.\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518199\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/335/#p350\">\n    900 F.3d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For instance, it is indisputable that a doctor who performs a surgical removal of a limb engaged in volitional acts to bring about that removal-he did not cut off the patient's leg by accident. It is a far different question to ask whether he performed those acts with purposeful, knowing, or reckless indifference to the consequences of the removal-i.e., future infection, removing the wrong leg, permanent handicap or disfigurement, or other medical problems. When read this way,\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   's first element, which is intended to exclude those claims where the harm caused was a complete accident,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590968\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2466/#p2473\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , does not align with the first element set forth in\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . This is to say,\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   's volitional element probes the defendant's appreciation of the consequences of his actions, while\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   's does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On the other hand, the examples in\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   that illustrate intentional conduct consist entirely of the defendant acting in ways that result in harm. One does not purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly punch/push/tase someone without knowing, on some level, that there is a high risk that the subject is going to get hit/pushed/stunned. Thus, despite the Supreme Court's assertion to the contrary, perhaps the first element in\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   is intended to probe the defendant's appreciation of the consequences of his action. If that is the case, then the subjective element in\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   is less at odds with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , but no easier to apply in the medical context, for the reasons discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   After determining whether the defendant acted purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly with regard to the consequences of his actions,\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   then instructs courts to consider whether the medical defendant's actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518199\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/335/#p350\">\n    900 F.3d at 353-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In assessing this element, says the Court of Appeals, one should not consider the defendant's subjective intent or knowledge as to the risk of harm his actions created. This is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   , as should be clear from the discussion above. But this second element is in tension with the first, and with the longstanding principle that constitutional claims cannot be premised on medical negligence. If we must assess a jail doctor's conduct objectively, how can we ask whether the doctor was \"reckless\" with respect to the consequences of his actions? Whether or not he was reckless (or acted with knowledge or intent) should not matter when considering the objective reasonableness of his conduct. Thus, the objective inquiry sought in the second\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   element is undermined by the intent-based inquiry of the first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   What is more, asking whether the jail doctor's conduct is objectively reasonable is equivalent to asking whether they were negligent-that is, whether they failed to demonstrate ordinary, reasonable care in the face of a risk of harm. To say that a plaintiff must prove that the doctor was at least reckless with respect to the risk of harm raises the bar set in\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   . In essence,\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   's attempt to harmonize\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   with the negligence-is-not-enough principle has created an entirely new standard of constitutional liability: reckless indifference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Doctrinal concerns with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   aside, the Court is left to apply the law to the case before it. Thus, a pretrial detainee's Fourteenth Amendment right to medical\n   care is violated if: (1) there was an objectively serious medical need; (2) the defendant made a volitional act with regard to the plaintiff's medical need; (3) that act was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances in terms of treating or assessing the patient's serious medical need; and (4) the defendant \"acted purposefully, knowingly, or perhaps even recklessly\" with respect to the risk of harm.\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518199\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/335/#p350\">\n    900 F.3d at 353-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even with the rule articulated above, is difficult to envision a world in which a defendant acted reasonably under the circumstances, but also acted purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly with regard to a high risk of harm. In any application, the Court will be ultimately applying a recklessness test. The \"objective\" prong functions primarily as a gatekeeper for the intent prong.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   With regard to whether an inmate has a \"serious medical need,\" the Court of Appeals continues to find Eighth Amendment precedent to be instructive on this issue. \"An objectively serious medical condition is one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would perceive the need for a doctor's attention.\"\n   <em>\n    Gayton v.

It is also worth noting that the SMU is located on the floor above booking, where Exum was stationed, and Exum did not see Terry until after Terry gave birth. There is no evidence in the record that Exum heard Terry's screams from one floor below, or that Wenzel and Bevenue told Exum that Terry was calling for help.

He also had a view of the red flashing light over her door. Terry explains that shortly after entering the SMU, she began to experience painful contractions, that she screamed, called for help, and banged on the door at least three times, but Wenzel ignored her. She also activated the red light outside of her door to indicate an urgent situation. At some point, Terry's water broke, and she took off her pants.

There is at least one report from a fellow inmate who heard some screaming that night, and there are no working security cameras to corroborate either account. This is an issue of fact for the jury. A reasonable jury could find that Wenzel did not check on Terry, or that he did check on Terry but unreasonably overlooked (or ignored) the fact that she was about to deliver, and in fact did deliver, a baby in a jail cell.

To the contrary, the evidence demonstrates that Armor and the County were actively trying to enforce their policy requiring discharge paperwork from the\n   hospital and, where discharge paperwork was not immediately available, took to calling the discharging hospital to get necessary information while keeping the inmate under supervision in the SMU. Indeed, when Terry arrived back at the MCJ without adequate paperwork, Exum raised the issue with Dr. Buono and then called the hospital in order to get the paperwork, which was obtained less than 12 hours later. It is not plainly obvious that a delay of less than 12 hours in discharge paperwork would result in a constitutional violation-presumably, when a person is discharged from a hospital, it is because they no longer have a serious medical need. While there are clearly issues in carrying out the letter of the policy that should not be taken lightly, these enforcement issues do not give rise to a custom of admitting detainees without discharge paperwork \"so entrenched and well-known as to carry the force of policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Rice v.

There is evidence of only one other case of a woman giving birth at the MCJ, which occurred two years after Terry's experience. Perhaps it is obvious that a pregnant woman would, at some point, go into labor in jail and require some form of medical intervention. However, the evidence demonstrates that there\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a written policy of sending women to external facilities to deliver, and this policy that has not been so woefully deficient as to result in a myriad of women giving birth unassisted in jail. In addition to requiring deliveries to occur at\n   a hospital, Armor's policies describe (albeit perfunctorily) the various other measures of prenatal and medical monitoring that Armor will take throughout the pregnancy. Finally, the individual defendants' depositions clearly show that the concept of a woman giving birth in jail was unusual and not at all desired by either Armor or the County.

The depositions show that MCJ employees restrained all inmates the exact same way, regardless of their individual histories or medical conditions. For example, Kevin Nyklewicz, the deputy inspector at the MCJ, noted that the MCJ's general policy was to \"properly secure[ ] [all inmates] before they leave the jail, which will be the restraints.\" (Docket # 182-35, 18:10-22). He further acknowledged that every inmate, no matter the reason for their hospitalization, would be attached to the hospital bed by a leg iron and wrist cuff unless there was a medical reason identified by a medical professional at the hospital as to why this should not be done.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:5-17.

The shackling policy was enforced even when inmates were under the supervision of armed officials. (Docket # 182-36 at 14:25-15:11). Elizabeth Freuck, the deputy sheriff, who estimates that she has served on hospital watches for approximately 80 pregnant inmates, also acknowledges that the \"typical\" policy was to have a two-point restraint at all times.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:8-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Terry must also establish that the policy was \"the moving force\" behind her constitutional injury.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652076\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/397/#p407\">\n    520 U.S. at 404-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11652076\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/397/#p407\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In ignoring those signs, a jury would necessarily find that the officer was acting objectively unreasonably under the circumstances, since he knew or should have known that the inmate was calling for help, and a reasonable official in his situation would have responded. By contrast, if the officer did\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    perceive any distress calls, a jury could find that he did not act with purposeful, knowing, or reckless disregard for a serious risk-and therefore, whether he acted reasonably or unreasonably wouldn't matter for the purposes of determining liability.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    In any case, the scenarios in which an officer acts reasonably but\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    with purposeful, knowing, or reckless disregard for the health of an inmate are extremely unlikely. One far-fetched example of this application might be if a jail riot occurred and an official had a choice between evacuating the jail to save himself or risking his life to ensure medical care to an ailing inmate. If the official abandoned the ailing inmate, a jury could find that this was objectively reasonable under the circumstances of the jail riot, even though the official did so knowing of the high risk of harm to the inmate. Obviously, this does not make leaving the inmate the morally correct option, but it might save the officer from legal liability.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    The Court acknowledges that labor is a multi-stage and variously defined experience that changes from person to person. It seems that Terry was in the early stages of labor (i.e., intermittent contractions, partial effacement, minor dilation) up until she was placed in the SMU, at which point she went into active labor (i.e., increased contractions in a narrow interval, complete effacement, increased dilation). That Terry was on opiates for part of this process may have affected her own experience of the contractions, as well as Exum's ability to detect them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Miranda does not change the\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    standard, even when applied to jail inmate medical claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Armor contends that Terry's\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claims must be dismissed because they \"exceed the scope\" of the Court's previous order, which allowed Terry to amend her complaint to cure her deficiently pled\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claim that the County and Armor had a widespread custom of ignoring inmates' serious medical needs. (Docket # 163 at 11-12; Docket # 127). Yet Terry has attempted to do just that. An amended pleading is permissible if it relates back to the original pleading, i.e., if \"the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out-or attempted to be set out-in the original pleading.\" Fed.

Terry has not wavered from her allegation that she did not receive medical care when she gave birth, unattended, in a jail cell. Since \"even significant changes to a complaint...can relate back so long as the defendant had fair notice of the substance of the new allegations from the outset,\" the Court finds that these amendments, all of which relate back to Terry's unassisted jail cell birth, gave the defendants adequate notice of the substance of the new allegations and policies at issue, and therefore are not prejudicial.\n    <em>\n     Supreme Auto Trans., LLC v.
