But that is not what this case is about. The narrow issue presented in this case is whether the content of Notices of Ineligibility issued by the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") denying the applications of approximately 87 Iranian refugees failed to comply with the Lautenberg Amendment and other applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' claims are suitable for class resolution, and GRANTS Plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The Court also GRANTS Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, finding that the Notices of Ineligibility denying Plaintiffs' refugee applications \"as a matter of discretion\" violate the Lautenberg Amendment and the\n   <em>\n    Accardi\n   </em>\n   doctrine. As discussed below, the Court sets aside the February 2018 Notices of Ineligibility pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20702\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706(2). DHS is ORDERED to issue notices containing their determinations to re-open processing or to deny Plaintiffs' refugee applications\n   <strong>\n    within 14 days of this Order.\n   </strong>\n   The Court takes no position on, and has no authority to review, the ultimate determination of Plaintiffs' applications, so long as any re-issued Notices comply with the Lautenberg Amendment and agency procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs bring this putative class action against DHS\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   challenging what Plaintiffs describe as an unprecedented mass denial of refugee status to approximately 87 Iranian Christians, Mandaeans, and other religious minorities who had applied for entry into the United States under the Vienna-based Lautenberg-Specter program and were told without further explanation that their applications were \"denied as a matter of discretion.\" The five named Plaintiffs are three Iranian refugees currently in Vienna, Austria, and two United States citizens who served as the U.S. tie for two of the\n   named Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The operative Complaint was filed on April 18, 2018, setting forth six claims for relief challenging the content of the Notices of Ineligibility issued to Plaintiffs in February 2018, which Plaintiffs argue fail to comply with the Lautenberg Amendment and applicable agency procedures.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF 1 (\"Compl.\"). In light of the time-sensitive nature of Plaintiffs' claims, the Court set an expedited briefing and hearing schedule on Plaintiffs' motions for class certification and partial summary judgment. ECF 59. The Court held a hearing on Plaintiffs' motions on June 22, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before addressing the merits of Plaintiffs' motions and DHS's overarching defense that Plaintiffs' claims are not justiciable, the Court provides an overview of the law governing the admission of Iranian refugees to the United States and the personal experiences of the named Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Refugee Admission and The Lautenberg Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The admission of refugees to the United States is authorized by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201157\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides in relevant part that the \"Attorney General may, in the Attorney General's discretion ... admit any refugee who is not firmly resettled in any foreign country, is determined to be of special humanitarian concern to the United States, and is admissible ... as an immigrant.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201157\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).

Accordingly, no foreign individual is entitled to resettlement in the United States under this statute. Moreover, \u00a7 1157 is silent with respect to judicial review of refugee status determinations. Courts have thus held that the absence of procedures for judicial review in section 1157\"demonstrate a Congressional intent to preclude judicial review at the behest of aliens beyond the borders of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Haitian Refugee Ctr., Inc. v.

Plaintiffs have satisfied the commonality requirement, as they share a common legal question: whether the Notices of Ineligibility violate the Lautenberg Amendment and applicable agency regulations. Moreover, the relief provided below with respect to Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment makes clear that commonality is satisfied, as the relief is the same-the Notices of Ineligibility impacting each class member shall be set aside and to the extent any Notice of Ineligibility is reissued it must comply with the law. DHS's argument that factual distinctions between the proposed class members\n   will \"change the outcome of the legal issues\" and will \"impede the generation of common answers\" is meritless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to Class Cert.

Thus, while commonality looks to the relationship between the class members, typicality focuses on the relationship between the proposed class representatives and the rest of the class. \"The test of typicality is whether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class members have been injured by the same course of conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolin v.

Without a reason for the denial, the applicants are left to guess at which factors and circumstances DHS considered. Any meaningful review of the denials becomes impossible because Plaintiffs are effectively shadowboxing against themselves. The February 2018 Notices of Ineligibility do not indicate any reason for the individualized denials-such as whether an applicant was rejected based on security concerns or eligibility reasons. Indeed, Plaintiffs' evidence that the applications of at least 38 of the individuals denied admission in February 2018 received identical Notices of Ineligibility raises the inference that the denials were not, in fact, individualized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bates Decl. \u00b6 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   DHS concedes that the statutory text and legislative history of the Lautenberg Amendment makes clear that Congress intended for a reason to be given upon denial of a refugee application whenever feasible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 22, 2018 Hearing Transcript at 37:14-29;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to MSJ at 13.

The Court need not determine whether DHS has the discretion to determine when it is feasible to give reasons for the denial under the Lautenberg Amendment, because in this case, DHS has failed to address the feasibility determination at all. DHS's argument that it determined that it was not feasible to give the Plaintiffs in this case reasons for the denials is nothing more than a \"trust me\" defense that lacks any evidentiary support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Meanwhile, Plaintiffs have provided evidence that the February 2018 Notices fail to meet the \"maximum extent feasible\" language because they fall below the floor required by Defendants' own regulations, policies and practices with respect to other refugee applicants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 12-15; Reply iso MSJ at 7.
