The case proceeded to a bench trial, which was held on November 3, 2015. ECF No. 77. At trial, CSXT relied on subsection (b)(4) of the 4-R Act to argue that the SC Valuation Act imposes another tax \"that is directed and targeted at railroads for disfavored treatment.\" Tr. 54:17-25. In the court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, ECF No. 86, the court found that the SC Valuation Act does not impose a tax within the meaning of subsection (b)(4).

The State asserts that section 12-37-3140(B) caps increases in the fair market value of real property subject to property tax to 15% during a five year assessment cycle.

The State first asserts that railroads are advantaged by an equalization factor that is applied to reduce the assessed value of railroad property, to include personal, intangible, and real property, before value is certified to the counties. Supp. Mem. in Support of J., 23. At trial, Taylor Ingram, utility assessment coordinator with the South Carolina Department of Revenue, testified that the 20% equalization factor has the effect of \"basically remov[ing] or exempt[ing] 20% of that assessment, and you are left with 80% that's now taxable.\" Tr. 153:24-54:1. Kerry G. Carnahan, employed by CSXT as director of property taxes, explained that the equalization factor \"is used to correct some of the inequities that result for different levels of assessment for other commercial/industrial and manufacturing property. So, for instance, I mentioned commercial/industrial property is assessed at six percent and we're assessed at nine-and-a-half percent. Manufacturing property is at ten-and-a-half percent. [The] 20 percent in part corrects that inequity in the different levels of assessment of comparable properties.\" Tr. 21:11-18. He also testified that the \"20%\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   equalization factor is designed to bring South Carolina law, at least in 1991, in conformity with federal law.\" Tr. 22:1-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The equalization factor applies to railroads but does not apply to commercial and industrial taxpayers. Tr. 69:12-14 (\"[P]roperties under the unit value are afforded an equalization factor that no other properties are afforded.\"). The evidence at trial showed that the equalization factor is used to eliminate discrepancies in the fair market value and other commercial and industrial properties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 70.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   CSXT responds that the equalization factor, which originally was calculated in 1991, should not be used to justify the State's refusal to extend the 15% cap to railroads in 2006. Reply, 7. CSXT further contends that the 20% equalization factor is not a \"benefit\" but a requirement of equal treatment under federal law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587011\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1136/#p1141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court disagrees. The 20% equalization factor is applied to both real and personal railroad property. No other taxpayer is entitled to assessment utilizing the 20% equalization factor. In the court's view, it may take the equalization factor into account in considering whether the State's discriminatory treatment of railroads is justified. As the Supreme Court has stated: \"It does not accord with ordinary English usage to say that a tax discriminates against a rail carrier if a rival who is exempt from that tax must pay another comparable tax from which the rail carrier is exempt.

The State argues that the combination of tax benefits afforded to railroads potentially offsets any increased property taxes. For the reasons stated regarding the 20% equalization factor, the tax exemptions afforded railroads weigh in favor of justifying the State's exclusion of CSXT from the SC Valuation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, the State observes that the sale of commercial and industrial property triggers an assessment that sets a fair market value on the property without regard to the 15% cap. Thus, \"lost\" value is recouped in whole or in part for the tax base at the time of sale. Supp. Mem. in Support of J., 26. The State further notes that real properties that undergo improvements go through partial reassessment to add the value of the improvements to the tax rolls\n   at fair market value.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2012-28-2710\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The State argues that railroad real property \"neither changes ownership with any regularity nor are there significant improvements made which would trigger reassessment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2012-28-2710\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to the State, the extension of the 15% cap to railroads would result in the suppression of fair market value that may never be recouped by counties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2012-28-2710\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At trial, the State's witness, Sanford Houck, Jr., explained that properties valued under the unit valuation concept \"[n]ever see sales, or very seldom do we see sales.\" Tr. 69:14-18. In fact, Houck testified that \"I can't think of a major railroad that has basically sold in recent history....\" Tr. 69:21-23. In regards to improvements, Callahan testified that CSXT has \"very few improvements.\" Tr. 43:18-21. Based on the testimony of Houck, the difference in ownership and improvements matter, because it allows for a reassessment of the property for the following year and to determine whether the 15% cap is triggered. Tr. 65-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The court finds the State's arguments, taken as a whole, to be persuasive. The State has shown sufficient justification for not extending the 15% cap to CSXT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As the State sufficiently provided justification for any discrimination arising under the 4-R Act, the court enters judgment in favor of the State.
