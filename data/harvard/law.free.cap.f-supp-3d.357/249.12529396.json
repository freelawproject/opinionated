Walker, Jr., (\"Plaintiff\") brings this action pursuant to Title XVI of the Social Security Act (the \"Act\"), seeking review of the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security (the \"Commissioner,\" or \"Defendant\") denying his application for supplemental security income (\"SSI\") or children's insurance benefits under the social security act. (Dkt. 1; Dkt. 4; Dkt. 5). This Court has jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Presently before the Court is the Commissioner's motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and Plaintiff's letter response. (Dkt. 15; Dkt. 20). For the reasons discussed below, the Commissioner's motion (Dkt. 15) is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff received SSI payments based on disability as a child. (Dkt. 11 at 10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Eligibility for these benefits was re-determined when Plaintiff reached the age of eighteen, at which time it was determined that Plaintiff was no longer disabled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This determination was upheld upon reconsideration by a State Agency Disability Hearing Officer, and Plaintiff thereafter filed a written request for a hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff also filed an application for child's insurance benefits, alleging disability prior to his twenty-second birthday. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

If so, the claimant is not disabled. If not, the ALJ proceeds to step two and determines whether the claimant has an impairment, or combination of impairments, that is \"severe\" within the meaning of the Act, in that it imposes significant restrictions on the claimant's ability to perform basic work activities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(c). If the claimant does not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments, the analysis concludes with a finding of \"not disabled.\" If the claimant does have at least one severe impairment, the ALJ continues to step three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At step three, the ALJ examines whether a claimant's impairment meets or medically equals the criteria of a listed impairment in Appendix 1 of Subpart P of Regulation No. 4 (the \"Listings\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(d). If the impairment meets or medically equals the criteria of a Listing and meets the durational requirement (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.909), the claimant is disabled. If not, the ALJ determines the claimant's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"), which is the ability to perform physical or mental work activities on a sustained basis, notwithstanding limitations for the collective impairments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The ALJ then proceeds to step four and determines whether the claimant's RFC permits the claimant to perform the requirements of his or her past relevant work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(f).

Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff attained the age of eighteen on December 26, 2011, and was eligible for supplemental security income benefits as a child for the month preceding the month in which he attained the age of eighteen. (Dkt. 11 at 14). Plaintiff had not yet attained the age of twenty-two at the time of\n   his application for child's insurance benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of obesity, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and mood disorder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listing 12.04 in reaching her conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a range of medium work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.967\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   can occasionally lift/carry up to 50 pounds, frequently 20. He requires a sit/stand option that allows individual to change position every 90 minutes for up to five minutes without leaving the workstation. He can occasionally stoop (bend) to the floor. He can perform simple unskilled work with a regular schedule. He can adjust to occasional changes in work setting. He cannot interact with the public and cannot perform teamwork. Occasionally, he can make work-related decisions. He requires up to three additional, short, less-then-5-minute, unscheduled breaks beyond normal scheduled breaks. He can work to meet daily goals, but not maintain an hourly, machine-driven, assembly line production rate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). At step four, the ALJ found that Plaintiff has no past relevant work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of housekeeping, laundry laborer, and hand packager.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The Commissioner's Determination is Supported by Substantial Evidence and Free from Legal Error\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court has reviewed the record and Plaintiff's letter response, and considered the findings made by the Commissioner at steps one through five of the sequential evaluation. The ALJ's initial determinations-that Plaintiff attained the age of eighteen on December 26, 2011, and was eligible for supplemental security income benefits as a child for the month preceding the month in which he attained the age of eighteen, and that Plaintiff had not yet attained the age of twenty-two at the time of his application for child's insurance benefits-were favorable to Plaintiff, and cannot be a basis for remand. The ALJ's step two determination also is favorable to Plaintiff, as the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had severe impairments, including obesity, ADHD, and mood disorder. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The ALJ's step three determination was proper. The ALJ carefully considered the criteria of Listing 12.04. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16). The ALJ considered each of Plaintiff's severe impairments in the context of the \"paragraph\n   B\" criteria,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether Plaintiff's mental impairments resulted in at least two of the following: marked restrictions of activities of daily living; marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning; marked difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace; or repeated episodes of decompensation, each of extended duration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). The ALJ evaluated each of these four categories separately and cited to specific exhibits in the record supporting her determinations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ's conclusions that Plaintiff: had mild restrictions in his activities of daily living; moderate difficulties in social functioning; moderate difficulties for concentration, persistence, or pace; and had no episodes of decompensation for an extended duration, are supported by the medical record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Similarly, the ALJ considered whether the criteria of \"paragraph C\" were satisfied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Accordingly, the ALJ's step three determination is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The ALJ's RFC finding also is supported by substantial evidence. For example, the ALJ assessed all of the opinion evidence in the record, including the consultative examinations ordered by the ALJ. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19). The ALJ first discussed the comprehensive psychological exam performed in June 2014, at the request of Plaintiff's ACCESS-VR counselor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18). The examiner opined that Plaintiff would have problems involving high interactions with others and had poor frustration tolerance and difficulty sustaining effort. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 267-75). The ALJ afforded this opinion \"some weight,\" based on the specialty, and also because it was noted that Plaintiff put forth poor effort on the tests. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.967\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.967\">\n    at 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"As detailed above, testing indicated that Mr. Walker did not engage in testing of ability. As a result, his performance on the WAIS-IV and WRAT4 are likely underestimates of his true abilities.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.967\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (test results not interpretable \"because of Mr. Walker's high level of random responding. Based on other testing, it appears likely that this resulted from Mr. Walker either responding randomly to questions and/or taking an uncooperative test-taking approach.\") ). The ALJ therefore explained that in assessing the RFC, she relied more heavily on Plaintiff's school records, which showed consistent low-average to average cognitive abilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18). The Court has reviewed the June 2014 psychological exam and finds that the ALJ's weighing of the examiner's opinion was proper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frazer v. Comm'r of Soc.

Dr. Toor found that Plaintiff could: continuously lift and carry up to twenty pounds and occasionally lift and carry up to fifty pounds; sit, stand, and walk for thirty minutes without interruption; sit, stand, and walk for a total of four hours each in an eight-hour workday; and continuously perform all postural activities (climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, crawling).

Accordingly, the ALJ's step five determination is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On November 1, 2018, Plaintiff's mother, on behalf of Plaintiff, filed a letter response to Defendant's motion. (Dkt. 20). In\n   the letter, Plaintiff explained that the record contains several inaccuracies regarding Plaintiff's activities. Specifically, contrary to the record, Plaintiff contends that he does not play sports, he does not have the reading level or computer skills of an adult, he was never bitten by a dog or injured his hand in a fight, he was not employed by Marshall's Department Store (\"Marshall's\"), and he does not sell drugs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court has reviewed the written determination and the RFC which, as noted above, is supported by substantial evidence. To the extent any of the information highlighted by Plaintiff is in fact false, it does not appear from the written determination that the ALJ relied on any of this information in assessing the RFC. In other words, the issues raised by Plaintiff do not have any impact on the Court's review of the Commissioner's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Many of the above-mentioned issues raised by Plaintiff were covered at the administrative hearing, where Plaintiff testified under oath. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11 at 440-41). To the extent Plaintiff ever claimed he possessed a driver's license, that issue was resolved at the administrative hearing, where he testified that he never had a driver's license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 443). Accordingly, the ALJ would not have considered Plaintiff's possession of a driver's license when assessing his RFC. Further, at the administrative hearing, based on Plaintiff's testimony and records from VESID, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff previously worked at Washington Inventory Service, Spamas Data Center, and Marshall's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 443-44). Plaintiff worked at all of these places \"very brief[ly],\" and the ALJ ultimately determined that Plaintiff had no past relevant work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 444). Indeed, Plaintiff's mother, who was under oath at the hearing, also testified that Plaintiff worked at Marshall's through VESID. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 459-60). In other words, Plaintiff's claim in his letter response that he never worked at Marshall's is belied by his own sworn testimony and the testimony of his mother, both of whom apparently agreed that Plaintiff spent at least some time working at Marshall's. Regarding Plaintiff's participation in sports, Plaintiff testified at the administrative hearing that he does not work out (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 447); accordingly, the ALJ was aware at the time she assessed the RFC that Plaintiff no longer participated in athletic pursuits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, as to Plaintiff's drug use, Plaintiff testified at the administrative hearing that he used to sell drugs (marijuana), but no longer engages in that type of activity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 453-54). Whether Plaintiff used to sell drugs is not a factor the ALJ took into account when assessing Plaintiff's physical or mental RFC, or his credibility finding.

The Court has reviewed that treatment note, which indicates that in August 2012, Plaintiff engaged in swimming and football for exercise. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 325). To the extent that statement was inaccurate, any such error was harmless. Plaintiff's physical RFC is supported by substantial evidence and was assessed based on his physical abilities as they existed at the time of the written determination, which the ALJ knew did not include exercise.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
