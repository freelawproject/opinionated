At the CSE meeting, the parties discussed what class size was appropriate for M.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The parties dispute whether the CSE concluded a 15:1+1 (fifteen students, one special education teacher, and one teaching assistant) class size was appropriate, or whether the CSE merely discussed placing M.S. in a 15:1+1 class. Nonetheless, the Parent at the CSE meeting testified she left the meeting under the impression that the class size would be 15:1+1. In addition, the Parent visited the school at the end of June 2016 and met with the teachers, who reiterated that the class size would be 15:1+1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    June 2016 IEP\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On August 17, 2016, the Parents sent a letter to Michael Rosen, the District's Director of Pupil Personnel Services, stating they were removing M.S. from public school and intended to enroll M.S. at Eagle Hill for the 2016-2017 school year, where M.S. had attended the previous school year. The Parents disagreed with the CSE's recommendations and believed, among other things, that the District failed to recommend an appropriate smaller class for M.S. In addition, the Parents stated they had not received a copy of the IEP and were not able to review the CSE's final recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In response, the District sent the Parents a copy of the IEP dated June 9, 2016, and a prior written notice, also dated June 9, 2016, which the Parents received on approximately August 30 or 31, 2016. The June 2016 IEP recommended M.S. for a 12:1+1 special class placement for English, math, social studies, and science. The prior written notice likewise states: \"Based on the information presented the committee recommends a special class, 12-1+1 for English, Social Studies, Science, and Math, with related services as per the IEP.\" (Parents Ex. C at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Despite what the June 2016 IEP and the prior written notice recommended, it is undisputed the District was unable to provide a 12:1+1 class size for M.S. at the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year. Moreover, the District contends the references to a 12:1+1 class size were clerical errors carried over by using the prior year's IEP as a template. The Parent testified that when she saw that the IEP included a 12:1+1 class size, she \"got confused,\" and thought the District had either made a mistake or changed their recommendation. (Tr. at 1287).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Due Process Complaint and Resolution Meeting\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   M.S. began the 2016-2017 school year at Eagle Hill on September 6, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On September 26, 2016, the Parents filed a due process complaint requesting a\n   due process hearing because the District failed to provide M.S. a FAPE for the 2016-2017 school year. One of the bases for the Parents' request was that the District failed to recommend an appropriate class size. Specifically, the September 26, 2016, due process complaint states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The District recommended a 12:1+1 class for MS. However, MS has been in a highly intensive 4:1 tutorial class at least two periods per day with four students and one teacher while at Eagle Hill. The District merely stated as its rationale: \"[b]ased on the information presented to the committee [sic] recommends a special class, 12-1+1.\" The District did not consider any other class size options for MS. Moreover, when the Parents visited the proposed program they learned the Student's class would have 15 students, not 12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The District failed to develop an IEP that it could implement for the Student. The District's teacher told the Parent that its seventh grade classes contain 15 students, not 12. The District developed an IEP that recommended a 12:1:1 for the Student, but according to its staff it did not have a program that could implement the IEP.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Parents Ex. A at 7-8) (alterations in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The District held a resolution meeting on October 7, 2016, at which Mr. Rosen stated the provision for a 12:1+1 class was a mistake, and the IEP should have read that the class size was 15:1+1. Whereas Rosen testified that the IEP was corrected to reflect the 15:1+1 class size as part of the resolution meeting, the Parent who attended the resolution meeting testified she did not agree to change the IEP at the resolution meeting and did not sign any consent form to change the IEP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   According to the Parent, Rosen said he would change the class size in the IEP. Rosen also testified that at some point in mid-October after the resolution meeting, the District developed a second IEP that changed the class size from 12:1+1 to 15:1+1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    October 2016 IEP\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On October 21, 2016, the District provided a due process response. Its letter stated, \"It is the post-Resolution Session IEP that is the relevant IEP to be examined for its appropriateness in the instant hearing.\" (Dist. Ex. 3 at 1). As to the Parents' claim that the District failed to recommend an appropriate class size for M.S., the District responded: \"To the extent that the 2016-2017 IEP misidentified the class sizes recommended for student, such mistake was corrected at the Resolution Session and the correct size of special education classes are identified on the IEP issued as a result of the Resolution Session.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Parents state they did not receive a copy of the IEP referenced in the October 21, 2016, due process response letter until November 1, 2016. Attached to the October 2016 IEP was a cover letter dated October 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The revised October 2016 IEP recommended a class size of 15:1+1 (except for one mention of the class size in the comments to the IEP, which still read 12:1+1). The District also sent an updated prior written notice, dated June 9, 2016, which states: \"Based on the information presented the committee recommends a special class, 15-1+1 for English, Social Studies, Science, and Math with related services as per the IEP.\" (Dist. Ex. 1 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On November 1, 2016, the Parents signed an enrollment agreement with Eagle Hill for the 2016-2017 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Hearing and Decisions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On December 5, 2016, the Parents filed a second due process complaint, this time alleging a deprivation of FAPE based on the October 2016 IEP. The Parents contended that the District failed to have an IEP it could implement at the start of the 2016-2017 school year because it could not offer the 12:1+1 class size it had recommended in the June 2016 IEP. Moreover, the Parents contended the District had changed the recommendation to a 15:1+1 class size, which they felt was too large to provide M.S. the support she needed. The December 5, 2016, due process complaint states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   When the Parents received the IEP on August 30, 2016, they believed that the District's recommendation was a 12:1:1 class based on the discussions at the IEP meeting and based on what the IEP stated. The Parents only learned that the District planned to change the IEP recommendation when they attended the resolution session. However, they required this information prior to the start of the school year in order to make an informed decision of what to do for the 16/17 school year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (Parents Ex. LL at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The IHO consolidated the Parents' two due process complaints and held six hearings. At one of the hearings, the IHO entered the October 2016 IEP into evidence over the Parents' objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On April 23, 2017, the IHO issued a decision finding the District had provided M.S. a FAPE. The IHO held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   While it is apparent that the District did not intend to implement the 12:1+1 class size provision of the IEP it developed on 6/9/16, it is equally clear that this class size was not acceptable to the parent. Even if the IEP had not been \"corrected\" and it could have been provided, that class size ratio was not acceptable to the parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (IHO Dec. at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Parents appealed, and on July 5, 2017, the SRO reversed the IHO's decision. The SRO held there was insufficient evidence that the District had provided the Parents with the October 2016 IEP during the resolution period, which ended on October 26, 2016. Therefore, the SRO, relying on\n   <em>\n    R.E. v. N.Y.C.

According to the SRO, because the District had offered no evidence that it could provide a 12:1+1 class size, the District failed to offer M.S. a FAPE.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In federal court, parties seeking review of administrative decisions in cases brought under the IDEA usually do so by motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Viola v.

Nevertheless, the District argues under\n   <em>\n    R.E. v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ.\n   </em>\n   it was permitted to amend the June 2016 IEP to correct a good faith error: the 12:1+1 class size it allegedly inadvertently carried over from the previous year's IEP. Further, the District argues it properly amended the IEP by (i) orally telling a Parent at the October 7, 2016, resolution meeting that it intended to modify the class size recommended in the June 2016 IEP, (ii) sending a letter on October 21, 2016, confirming the change, and (iii) modifying its own version of the June 2016 IEP during the resolution period to reflect the correct class size.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court disagrees. Even if\n   <em>\n    R.E. v. N.Y.C.

New York regulations specifically require that a parent \"receive a copy of the document that amends or modifies the IEP.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Comp.%20Codes%20R.%20%26%20Regs.%20tit.%208%2C%20%C2%A7%20200.4\">\n    N.Y.

Allowing the District to unilaterally amend the IEP without sending the Parents a copy of the IEP would \"undermine [the IEP's] function of giving notice of the services the school district has agreed to provide and measuring the student's progress toward the goals outlined in the IEP\" and \"vitiate[ ] the parents' right to participate\n   at every step of the IEP drafting process.\"\n   <em>\n    M.C. by and through M.N. v.

Even if the Parent left the CSE meeting with the impression that the CSE had recommended a 15:1+1 class size, she testified that when she received the June 2016 IEP on August 30 or 31, 2016, which explicitly recommended a 12:1+1 class size, she was confused, and thought the District had either made a mistake or changed its recommendation. The Parent's confusion is understandable given that in addition to the provisions in the IEP, the prior written notice also stated the class size would be 12:1+1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In addition, the September 26, 2016, due process complaint evidences the Parents' understanding that the District was recommending a 12:1+1 class size: the complaint does not identify the June 2016 IEP class size as an error, but does identify as an error the fact that the June 2016 IEP states that M.S. was not taking ADHD medication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   If anything, the confusion caused by the District's alleged error emphasizes the need for an accurate, written IEP, upon which, as the Second Circuit has clearly stated, the Parents can rely. \"The IEP is a 'formal, written offer [that] creates a clear record that will do much to eliminate troublesome factual disputes ... about when placements were offered, what placements were offered, and what additional education assistance was offered to supplement a placement, if any.' \"\n   <em>\n    M.C. by and through M.N. v.
