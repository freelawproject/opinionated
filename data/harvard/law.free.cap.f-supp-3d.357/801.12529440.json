Sukup argues that paddle sweeps existed at the time, including French Patent Application No. FR8805249A (published as FR 2,630,620) in 1988, by Jean Carrouget. Sukup argues the paddles of the Carrouget device engage grain on the floor of the grain bin and move it through an opened bottom of the hood towards the well of the grain bin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Sukup contends this is the \"critical\" feature Dixon identified in distinguishing prior art during the original prosecution and subsequent reexamination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Carrouget patent was never disclosed to nor considered by the USPTO, and Sukup argues Sioux Steel's constructions are aimed at distinguishing the '930 patent from this \"knock out\" prior art.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.

He also states that the circular design is inherent because the behavior of grain when allowed to free-fall by gravity into a pile forms a cone-shaped mass, which has a base that is circular in shape.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Sioux Steel does not deny that there are other structures used for storing grain, but contends that a grain bin is different than a \"flat storage structure,\" which is expressly defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   29 C.F.R. 1910.272(c). Another structure is a \"square bolted bin\" in which the floor is cone-shaped, allowing the grain to be completely emptied via gravity. At the time the '930 patent was issued, Sioux Steel contends only one type of structure was known in the art as a \"grain bin\" in the context of flat bottom reclaim systems, such as the one disclosed in the '930 patent. Such structures were cylindrically-shaped and could be partially emptied by gravity through a center well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Sioux Steel argues the mechanisms of the '930 patent and language used to describe it are consistent with this definition. For instance, it states that the sweep is constructed so that one end is pivotably\n   positioned at the center of the grain bin and the other end is positioned adjacent the wall of the grain bin. This allows the sweep to rotate around in a circle. Sioux Steel contends that for the invention to work, i.e., empty the grain bin, the grain bin must be circular. It also relies on the specification, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   The grain bin 13 may be of any typical construction having wall structure 17, floor or floor structure 18 for supporting a quantity of grain G, and a roof structure 19 coacting with the wall and floor structures 17, 18 to define the interior 15. Thus, for example, the grain bin 13 may be constructed of metal with the wall structure 17 having a substantially cylindrical shape and with the roof structure 19 having a substantially conical shape covering the upper end of the cylindrical wall structure 17.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Doc. No. 38-1 at 6. In discussing the background of the invention, the patent states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Systems for unloading grain bins typically include a discharge auger positioned under the floor of the grain bin for conveying grain from a well or sump in the floor of the grain bin to a discharge point outside the grain bin. The grain falls by gravity into the well into the discharge auger. Once the level of grain falls below a certain level, it will no longer fall through the well by gravity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9067629\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/1364/#p1368\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The object of the invention is: \"to provide a safe, efficient unloading system for unloading that portion of grain stored within a grain bin that will not fall by gravity into the loading well.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Sukup argues that there is no need to construe \"grain bin\" beyond \"a structure for storing grain\" because it is consistent with the ordinary and customary meaning.

The first and most important evidence is the language of the claim itself. Second, the court looks to intrinsic evidence from the remainder of the patent. Third, the court considers the patent prosecution history.

No. 38-6. If Dixon had intended to limit the \"grain bin\" referenced in the '930 patent in such a way, he could have expressly said so, especially because he described other characteristics of the grain bin, i.e., having a well in the floor. Sioux Steel relies primarily on Maness' declaration that at the time of the invention, the term \"grain bin\" was understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art to be a cylindrical structure. This is extrinsic evidence, which I find unnecessary for construction given that the claim language and specification provide a sufficient basis to construe the term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8948489\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/1303/#p1313\">\n    415 F.3d at 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that expert testimony is useful for providing background on the technology at issue or explaining how an invention works, but that \"conclusory unsupported assertions by experts as to the definition of a claim term are not useful to a court.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   I also reject that part of Sioux Steel's proposed construction regarding the means by which a grain bin is emptied - \"can be emptied, at least partially, by gravity through a center well.\" The specification provides \"[t]he floor has at least one well or sump opening ...\" and refers to \"well (or wells)\" throughout, without identifying their location as \"center.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

As such, I decline to construe \"grain bin\" to contain Sioux Steel's proposed limitation, as the patent itself does not limit the term in such a way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Based on the claim language and specification, I find that the appropriate construction of grain bin is \"a structure for storing grain having an interior for holding a quantity of grain, having a floor within said interior for supporting said quantity of grain, and having a well in said floor for allowing grain to be unloaded from said interior.\" This language comes directly from the preambles, which I find limiting,\n   but only to extent described therein, and which is consistent with the specification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

It relies on the preambles, which identify that the grain bin has a well that allows the grain to be unloaded \"therethrough.\" It also cites the specification language that the floor of the grain bin \"has at least one well or sump opening 25 therein for allowing grain G to pass therethrough and be unloaded from the interior 15 of the grain bin 13.\" Doc. No. 38-1 at 6. Finally, Sioux Steel cites Figure 1 of the '930 patent, which shows grain flowing through the floor of the grain bin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Sukup argues that Sioux Steel's proposed construction would render the language in the preambles superfluous because those aspects of well are already encompassed in the preambles. Doc. No. 43 at 15. Moreover, Sukup argues that Sioux Steel improperly seeks to narrow the construction of the term to an \"opening\" rather than a structure having an opening.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It uses a sump as an example. While sumps in basements form an opening, the sump itself is a structure and water on a basement floor enters the sump through the opening. No one mistakes the sump as the opening rather than the structure itself. Similarly, Sukup argues that a well forms an opening to receive grain, but an opening (a void) is a product of the surrounding structure of the well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Sioux Steel argues that Sukup's proposed construction fails to acknowledge that \"well\" requires an \"opening\" even though Claims 1 and 14 state that the grain bin floor has \"a well in said floor for allowing grain to be unloaded from said interior of said grain bin therethrough.\" Doc. No. 50 at 12-13 (citing Doc. No. 38-1 at 7). It states that a \"well\" as used in the '930 patent is defined by its opening and is not dependent on \"structure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Moreover, it disagrees with Sukup's argument that a purported \"absence of structure\" or negative claim limitation in not allowed. Sioux Steel cites the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure, which states, \"[t]he current view of the courts is that there is nothing inherently ambiguous or uncertain about a negative limitation. So long as the boundaries of the patent protection sought are set forth definitely, albeit negatively, the claim complies with the [statutory] requirements.\" Doc. No. 57 at 5 (citing MPEP 2173.05(i) ). Sioux Steel also takes issue with the word \"receive,\" as it contends the grain passes through the well rather than the well \"receiving\" the grain. Doc. No. 50 at 13. It contends that Sukup's use of the word \"receive\" would allow it to claim that other \"structures\" that \"receive\" grain, such as conveyors and other devices, could constitute a \"well\" under Sukup's proposed construction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sioux Steel contends the intrinsic evidence of the '930 patent (recognizing an opening in the grain bin floor) is contrary to that concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

While I appreciate that a \"well\" requires some structure, I find that the structure can be understood by a construction that specifies a well is an opening in the grain bin floor. I agree with Sioux Steel that it is the opening in the floor that is crucial to the construction because the claim and specification describe the grain passing \"therethrough.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 38-1 at 6-7 (\"the floor 18 has at least one well or sump opening 25 therein for allowing grain G to pass therethrough and be unloaded from the interior 15 of the grain bin 13\" and \"having a well in said floor for allowing grain to be unloaded from said interior 15 of said grain bin therethrough\") ).

The parties' arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Sioux Steel argues the claim phrase related to the elongated hood should be construed as a whole, rather than individual parts. In support of its position, it notes that the claims recite a sweep having an \"elongated frame\" having two ends, with one end located adjacent to the well around which the sweep rotates and having an \"elongated hood.\" With regard to\n   the other end of the frame, Sioux Steel notes that the specification says it should be \"preferably positioned adjacent the wall structure 17 of the grain bin 13.\" It argues that the frame/hood must be extended between these two ends (the well and the wall) in order to cover the grain bin floor as it rotates around the well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Sioux Steel also relies on the specification language referring to the hood as a \"shroud.\" Because the hood covers the paddles (except at the open bottom and open mouth of the sweep), Sioux Steel argues there are two lateral portions (side walls) and a top panel. With regard to \"panel,\" Sioux Steel relies on the Oxford Dictionary of Mechanical Engineering, which defines it as \"1. A sheet of metal, plastic, or other material held in a frame\" or \"2. A basic element of a framework in the form of a triangle, square, or other shape.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 42-9. It contends the top panel is one basic element of the overall framework or hood. For these reasons, it argues that \"an elongated hood having a top panel, a first side wall, and a second side wall\" should be construed to mean \"an extended cover or shroud that has a part above the paddles and two lateral portions.\" Doc. No. 42 at 26. It contends that \"frame\" does not require construction but agrees with Sukup that it means \"a supporting structure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Sukup argues it is improper to construe a phrase that includes numerous structural limitations as a single claim term because it risks not giving meaning to all of the structural limitations in the claim language. Doc. No. 43 at 17. Sukup argues that \"elongated,\" \"hood,\" \"top panel,\" and \"side wall\" should all be construed separately. Sukup relies heavily on the prosecution history, arguing that Dixon had to significantly limit the scope of the claims by adding structural limitations in order to distinguish cited prior art.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dixon amended the claim to further define \"an elongated housing\" and housing including \"a top panel, a first side wall, and a second side wall.\" Sukup notes that Dixon referred to these parts as \"critical limitations of amended claim 1\" when arguing for allowance of the patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 38-2 at 72. Sukup argues \"to fall within the scope of the claims, a paddle sweep must have more than just any elongated hood; the elongated hood must have a top panel and two side walls as claimed.\" Doc. No. 43 at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Sukup also argues that the top panel and two side walls are claim limitations that must be given meaning and that Sioux Steel cannot seek to broaden the claim now.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Finally, Sukup argues that the specification also supports construing \"top panel\" and \"side wall\" separately.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It points out that Dixon chose to describe the hood by referencing its constituent parts (top panel, first side wall and second side wall). These parts are even labeled separately in the figures with reference numerals 39, 41 and 43. The written description further identifies these structural limitations separately.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In response, Sioux Steel argues that its definition accounts for all claim terms because the \"part above the paddles\" refers to the top panel and \"two lateral portions\" refers to a first side wall and a second side wall. It argues that different claim elements need not be construed as \"separate and distinct\" structures where the claim does not require such a limitation. It contends that the \"elongated hood\" does not have to have distinct, separate structures, and that the top panel can be any number of shapes - domed, circular, oval triangular, obelisk or even tepee-shaped - and still fall within the scope of the claim. For instance, it illustrates how its construction could read on Sukup's sweep with respect to the top panel and side walls:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   With regard to Sukup's proposed construction of breaking down each element, Sioux Steel argues this destroys the context of the disputed phrase by relying on dictionary definitions and limits the scope of the '930 patent to the preferred embodiment. Doc. No. 50 at 16. It turns to Maness' declaration, which states that the inventor's use of \"metal hood or shroud\" in the specification is an expansive phrase indicating that the \"elongated hood\" element should not be limited to the structure shown in the preferred embodiment, but could be constructed in many different shapes/configurations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   To the extent I find that the phrase \"an elongated hood having a top panel, a first side wall, and a second side wall\" should be construed in separate parts, Sukup argues that \"elongated,\" \"hood,\" \"top panel\" and \"side wall\" should all be separately construed. While Sioux Steel's position is that they should be construed as one, I will consider its alternative arguments addressing Sukup's proposed constructions for the individual terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Regarding \"elongated,\" Sukup's proposed construction is: \"extending the length of; long in proportion to width.\" Doc. No. 43 at 18-19. Sioux Steel does not believe the term needs to be construed in isolation, but to the extent the court finds it necessary, it proposes: \"extended.\" Doc. No. 42 at 26. Sukup argues that Sioux Steel's proposed construction is inconsistent with the ordinary and customary meaning of the term which refers to the length of a structure, not just an extension. Doc. No. 43 at 19. It cites three cases in which courts construed elongated by referencing length in relation to width.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. Sioux Steel argues that elongated should be construed as an adjective, not a verb.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 42 at 26. It further argues that there is no requirement that the hood be of any particular length, only that it be elongated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It contends Sukup's definition is typically used in the medical field and that such a definition is inconsistent with the claim language here as the claim does not compare length of the hood in relation to its width in any way.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   With regard to \"frame,\" the parties appear to agree that it means \"a supporting structure.\" Sioux Steel, however, proposes \"an extended supporting structure\" be used for the term \"elongated frame.\" Even though \"elongated frame\" is proposed by Sukup, Sukup also directs the court to its separate constructions for \"elongated\" and\n   \"frame.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent the terms are separated, Sioux Steel argues \"frame\" need not be construed by the court. Doc. No. 42 at 26, n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Regarding \"hood\" or \"elongated hood,\" Sioux Steel's proposed construction is an extended cover or shroud, while Sukup's proposed construction for \"hood\" only is \"a protective cover.\" Therefore, the parties are in agreement with regard to the \"cover\" aspect. Sukup relies on the specification and prosecution history for its construction. Doc. No. 43 at 22. It notes that the specification expressly refers to the hood as a \"protective cover\" for the paddles:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   The hood or shroud formed by the frame 33 is preferably shaped and sized so that the paddles 59 are covered except at the opened bottom 45 and mouth 47 thereof to provide a protective cover extending over the top and at least a portion of the sides of the sprockets 49, 51, the chain 57, and the paddles 59 to provide safety and protection as will now be apparent to those skilled in the art.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Doc.

Chapman\n   does not teach shielding its slats (defined by paddles by the Examiner) and, in fact, exposes nearly all of its slats at both the top and bottom with only a few of the slats being covered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   It is believed that though Chapman calls element 56 a protective cover, there is contrary evidence to its protection purpose or abilities and instead is simply a stabilizing enhancement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   This basis for element 56, combined with a complete lack of any statements by Chapman as to what is being protected, while clearly showing pictures of the slats being substantially non-shielded, as related to silage or grain, can only lead one skilled in the art to the understanding that Chapman is not teaching a paddle shielding housing analogous to that claimed by the applicant. As such, no one in the art of augers would ever look to Chapman to find a protective cover or shield for a grain material sweep and instead would remain with the open faced design typically associates with auger sweeps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Doc.

To the extent that Sukup's use of the word \"protective\" is to express that it prevents grain from entering the hood except at desired locations, Sioux Steel argues that concept is embraced by the claim language \"elongated hood ... having an opened bottom\" through which the paddles engage the grain. For these reasons, Sioux Steel argues that the \"elongated\n   hood\" extends over the top and at least a portion of the sides of the paddles, which is embraced by its construction of \"a cover or shroud.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The next disputed terms are \"top panel\" and \"side wall.\" Sukup argues these should be construed separately. As to \"top panel,\" Sukup proposes: \"a top wall that protects the paddles from grain.\" Doc. No. 43 at 25. For \"side wall,\" it proposes: \"a lateral wall that controls the amount of grain that enters the housing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Again, Sukup relies on the prosecution history in support of its proposed constructions.

It points out that the applicant did distinguish between a \"top panel\" and \"side wall,\" however. Specifically, Sukup notes that the claimed \"elongated hood having a top panel\" was distinguished over prior art because of the protective or \"shielding\" function it provided that was not present in the prior art. \"Side wall\" was used to similarly distinguish the prior art because the applicant emphasized the \"ability to use a pair of side walls to only expose a portion of the paddles, which controls the amount of grain entering the housing to prevent the housing from climbing the grain pile and to relieve stress on the chain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.

It argues that Sukup's proposal adds a functional limitation not required by the claim and adds unneeded complexity by equating or substituting panel with wall. It contends that panel is best known to be an element or portion of a larger object. With regard to \"side wall,\" Sioux Steel proposes: \"a lateral portion of the hood.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It notes that Claim 6 recites the \"open mouth\" of the first side wall which \"allow[s] grain to enter said hood.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It argues that it is the mouth that allows or controls the grain entering the hood.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Sukup points out that Sioux Steel's proposed construction of \"top panel\" would include a portion of the \"side wall\" that is above the paddles, as illustrated below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Doc. No. 43 at 30. It argues that this proposed construction is inconsistent with the intrinsic evidence and Sioux Steel's own proposed construction of \"side wall.\" Sukup notes that the parties agree on the \"lateral\" component and that Figure 3 depicts a \"lateral portion of the hood\" as including that portion of the wall that extends above the paddles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31. Under Sioux Steel's proposed construction, the portion of the \"side wall\" that is both a \"lateral portion of the hood\" and \"above the paddles\" would fall within Sioux Steel's proposed constructions of both a \"top panel\" and a \"side wall.\" Sukup argues that \"top panel\" must be construed to recite structure as different than the structure described as a \"side wall.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. For these reasons, Sukup argues Sioux Steel's proposed construction must be rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Analysis and Final Construction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Claim 1 references both an \"elongated frame\" and an \"elongated hood.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 38-1 at 7-8 (\"an elongated frame for position on said grain supported on said floor of said grain bin, said frame having a first end and a second end, said first end of said frame being positioned adjacent said well in said floor of said grain bin; said frame including an elongated hood having a top panel, a first side wall, and a second side wall, and an opened bottom.\"). I find that \"elongated frame\" and \"elongated hood\" should be construed and that \"top panel\" and \"side wall\" also require separate construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   With regard to the elongated aspect of \"elongated frame\" and \"elongated hood,\" Sioux Steel proposes it does not need construction, but offers \"extended\" as an alternative. Sukup argues that \"extended\" is insufficient because it does not indicate how far and in what direction (length in proportion to width). In construing \"elongated frame\" and \"elongated hood,\" I note that it is not the measurement or proportions that matter, but the fact that it extends far enough so that all paddles fall beneath the hood. The claims, specification and prosecution history all emphasize that the paddles engage the grain only through the opened bottom of the hood of the frame. If the hood was not designed to cover the length of the frame, the paddles would likely engage grain elsewhere.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 54 at 76-82 (discussing Maness' testimony in which he acknowledged that the hood should extend the length of the frame).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, I find that \"elongated frame\" should be construed as: \"a supporting structure that extends over the entirety of the paddles and chain of the conveyor sweep.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   With regard to \"hood,\" the dispute centers on whether \"protective\" can be used to describe it. By stating that the hood extends the length of the frame and is composed of a top panel, a first side wall, and a second side wall, I find that the protective nature of the hood is inherent. I do not find that \"protective\" needs to be expressly used in the construction, as doing so would confuse structure with a function that is not expressly claimed. While the protective nature of the Dixon device was used to distinguish it from the Chapman device in the prosecution history, I note that the protective feature primarily related to how far the hood (or more precisely, the side walls) extended towards the floor to cover the paddles or slats.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 38-3 at 141 (\"Chapman is not teaching a paddle shielding housing analogous to that claimed by the applicant.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   This concept is addressed by Claim 14(e), which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   a plurality of spaced apart paddles attached to said belt for engaging grain on said floor of said grain bin through said opened bottom of said hood of said frame, said first and second side walls extending downwardly from said top panel, said first and second side wall laterally shielding portions of said paddles extending above said belt and positioned between first and second wheels, and second side wall having a bottom edge spaced further from said top panel than a bottom edge of said first side wall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Doc. No. 38-1 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   With regard to top panel and side wall, I find that these terms must be included in the construction of hood as they describe the components that make up the hood. In other words, \"hood\" in the context of the '930 patent refers to a top panel and two side panels. Therefore, I find that \"elongated hood\" should be construed to mean \"a cover or shroud extending the length of the frame that is comprised of a top panel, a first side wall and a second side wall.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   I further find that top panel and the side walls must be separately construed given that the parties advocate for two very different meanings. Sioux Steel proposes to construe side wall as\n   <em>\n    a lateral portion\n   </em>\n   of the hood. I disagree that a \"side wall\" should be construed in such a way that it could be divided by an invisible line marking the top of the paddles underneath so that a lateral wall could be considered part \"top panel\" and part \"side wall\" as illustrated below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Sioux Steel argues that nothing in the patent suggests that top panel and side walls must be mutually exclusive. I disagree, given that the claim defines a hood by three separate parts and the side walls are described as extending \"from the top panel.\" Doc. No. 38-1 at 6. Had they not been mutually exclusive, there would be no need to separately name them and include them in the claims. I also disagree with Sukup's construction of side wall because it focuses on the function rather than the claimed structure. This aspect of side wall is covered by Claim 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 38-1 at 8 (\"The unloading system of claim 1 in which the lower end of said first side wall of said hood of said frame has an opened mouth for allowing grain to enter said\n   hood.\"). Because the parties agree as to the lateral aspect, and I find that the lateral portion of the hood cannot be conceptually divided into a top panel and side wall, I find that the proper construction for side wall is \"the lateral part of the hood.\" This construction clarifies that the entire lateral part of the hood constitutes the side wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   As for top panel, the parties disagree as to whether it is a \"wall\" that protects or shields the paddles from grain (Sukup's position) or a \"part\" of the hood above the panels (Sioux Steel's position). I have already rejected Sioux Steel's position that any lateral part of the hood can constitute the top panel. I also note that the claim declined to use the word \"wall\" to describe the top part of the hood.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Innova/Pure Water, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9202616\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/381/1111/#p1115\">\n    381 F.3d at 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"when an applicant uses different terms in a claim it is permissible to infer that he intended his choice of different terms to reflect a differentiation in the meaning of those terms.\"). Therefore, I find the appropriate construction for top panel is \"the medial part of the hood.\" Taken together, the constructions for top panel and side wall indicate that the \"elongated hood\" is composed of three parts: two lateral parts and one medial part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     E.

Without the gear box and belt means, the motor would merely run without causing the wheel or sprocket to rotate. If the claimed function was solely to provide power, perhaps the motor on its own would be the appropriate corresponding structure. However, the parties agree that the claimed function of power means is \"for rotating one of said wheels [wherein the wheel may be a sprocket].\" On the other hand, I find that Sukup's proposed construction goes too far, especially with regard to belt drive means. The parties did not request construction of this term. In construing the corresponding structure, I have also chosen to exclude the additional functions that the gear box and belt drive means provide as identified in Sukup's proposed construction and the specification. These are: \"reducing the speed or revolutions per minute of the output shaft of the motor 65 and changing the axis or rotation of the output shaft of the motor 65\" (gear box) and \"transferring power from the gear box 67 to the first shaft 53\" (drive belt means). In sum, I find the appropriate construction of the corresponding structure for the claimed function of power means is \"a motor, a gear box and a belt drive means.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     F.

The phrase \"for causing said frame to rotate\" is ambiguous as to the way the frame is meant to rotate. The phrase \"about said well\" clarifies that the function of the drive means is to rotate the frame about said well and not around itself or in some other manner. Therefore, I find the appropriate construction of the claimed function is \"for causing said frame to rotate about said well.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Corresponding Structure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The parties essentially disagree over whether the corresponding structure for the drive means includes the gear box. The relevant description in the specification states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   The sweep conveyor 27 preferably includes drive means 79 for causing the frame 33 to rotate about the well 25. The drive means 79 may include one or preferably two drive wheels 81 mounted to the second end 37 of the frame 33 for being rotated by the power means 63 and for drivably engaging the floor 18 of the grain bin 13 and/or any grain G supported on the floor 18 of the grain bin 13 to rotate the frame 33 about the well 25. The drive means 79 preferably includes a gear box 83 coupled between the drive wheels 81 and one end of the second shaft 55 for being rotated by the second shaft 55, for reducing the speed or revolutions per minute of the second shaft 55, for changing the axis of the rotation, and for rotating the drive wheel 81 in response to the rotation of the first sprocket 49 by the power means 63, etc., as will now be apparent to those skilled in the art.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Doc. No. 38-1 at 7. Notably, one function the gear box performs is \"rotating the drive wheel.\" While there are numerous other functions, I find that it is an essential structure for performing the claimed function \"for causing said frame to rotate about said well.\" The specification makes it clear that the gear box is what causes the drive wheel to rotate, which is what causes the frame to rotate about said well. Therefore, it should be included in the corresponding structure for the claimed function. For these reasons, the corresponding\n   structure is construed as \"one or two drive wheels and a gear box.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     G.

No. 1 in Case No. 3:18-cv-3017-LTS. That case was transferred to this district on February 21, 2018, and the parties jointly moved to consolidate the cases.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. Nos. 16 and 20. I granted the motion and directed that all filings be made in Case No. 3:17-cv-3073-LTS.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 21.

No. 43 at 20. It is confusing why Sukup has proposed this as a separate term as it appears that Sukup would prefer \"elongated\" and \"frame\" to be construed separately and that Sioux Steel would prefer \"elongated frame\" to be construed together to the extent the court does not find it appropriate to construe it within the longer phrase \"an elongated hood having a top panel, a first side wall and a second side wall.\" The same situation exists with regard to \"hood.\" In any event, because Sukup refers to the separate definitions, I will primarily focus on those and note any arguments by Sioux Steel for construing any of the terms together. Alternatively, Sukup has stated it would have no objection to the following constructions of \"elongated frame\" and \"elongated hood,\" which Maness agreed with during his deposition:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n    - \"Elongated frame\" - a frame that extends over the entirety of the paddles and chain of the conveyor sweep\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-214\">\n    - \"Elongated hood\" - a hood having a top panel, a side wall, a second side wall, and an opened bottom, that all extend over the entirety of the paddles and chain of the conveyor sweep.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-215\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. No. 58 at 4, n.1. Maness has since indicated that he was referring only to the preferred embodiment when he agreed with those definitions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc.
