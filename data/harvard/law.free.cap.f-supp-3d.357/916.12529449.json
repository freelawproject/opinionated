Litigation Activity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Alaska Logistics first contends that \"Newtok waived its immunity by asserting counterclaims against Alaska Logistics.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   It notes that a tribe may waive its immunity by \"tak[ing] actions indicating consent to the litigation,\" and that \"participation in a lawsuit can 'effect a\n   waiver for limited purposes.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Alaska Logistics contends that courts have held that conduct similar to Newtok's litigation activity constitutes a limited waiver of sovereign immunity. Alaska Logistics first notes that when a tribe files suit in state or federal court, it waives sovereign immunity as to its own claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alaska Logistics further contends that \"federal courts have held that, by initiating a lawsuit in state or federal court, a tribe also waives its sovereign immunity with regard to counterclaims asserted by a defendant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   It cites several cases to support this proposition. In\n   <em>\n    Quinault Indian Nation v. Pearson for Estate of Comenout\n   </em>\n   , a tribe brought an action against several tribal members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   After one member's death, his estate asserted counterclaims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ninth Circuit concluded that \"claims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence and sounding in recoupment can be sustained as counterclaims against a tribe\" without violating the tribe's sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Tohono O'odham Nation v. Ducey\n   </em>\n   , a tribe filed suit in federal district court, and the director of the Arizona Department of Gaming asserted several counterclaims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court concluded that the tribe had waived its sovereign immunity with respect to those counterclaims that did not \"venture outside the subject of the original cause of action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alaska Logistics next cites\n   <em>\n    Battle Mountain Band v. United States Bureau of Land Management\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v. Seneca County.\n    <footnotemark>\n     76\n    </footnotemark>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Battle Mountain Band\n   </em>\n   , a court held that a tribe waived its sovereign immunity as to an intervenor's cross-claims that involved the \"exact issue\" raised by the tribe's claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in\n   <em>\n    Cayuga Indian Nation\n   </em>\n   , a court held that \"mirror-image counterclaims are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   precluded by sovereign immunity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Alaska Logistics also cites\n   <em>\n    United States v. Oregon\n   </em>\n   , in which the Ninth Circuit concluded that the Yakima tribe had waived its sovereign immunity though its litigation activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States had initiated an action to apportion a fishery, and the Yakima Tribe had intervened. The parties reached an agreement that provided for continuing jurisdiction in the district court. The State of Washington later intervened, asking the district court to enjoin the\n   tribe's fishing. The\n   <em>\n    Oregon\n   </em>\n   court concluded that such an injunction would not be barred by the tribe's sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Circuit Court analogized the underlying suit to an equitable in rem action, and concluded that the district court could enjoin any interference with the fishery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, by intervening in this equitable action and expressly agreeing to submit later-arising issues to federal court, the tribe \"assumed the risk that any equitable judgment secured could be modified if warranted by changed circumstances\" and \"that [it] would be bound by an order it deemed adverse.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The cases cited by Alaska Logistics indicate that a tribe may effect a limited waiver of sovereign immunity through its litigation activity. None of these cases, however, addresses whether a tribe waives its sovereign immunity as to an opposing party's claims when the tribe files counterclaims in response to those claims.\n   <em>\n    Quinault, Tohono O'odham, Battle Mountain Band\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Cayuga\n   </em>\n   all address situations in which a tribe asserted that tribal sovereign immunity barred an opposing party's counterclaims; in each of these cases, it was the tribe that initiated the litigation.\n   <em>\n    Tohono O'odham, Battle Mountain Band\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Cayuga\n   </em>\n   suggest only that a tribe's filing of a lawsuit \"can constitute a limited waiver with respect to issues the [tribe] itself has put at issue.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ninth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Quinault\n   </em>\n   does not support even that limited proposition; the Circuit Court held that the Quinault Indian Nation did not waive its immunity even as to a counterclaim that did not \"go beyond the contours of the Nation's suit,\" reasoning that the tribe \"did not consent to any counterclaims.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Quinault\n   </em>\n   court did state that \"counterclaims to recoup damages arising from the same transaction or occurrence as a tribe's claims do not violate the tribe's sovereign immunity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Alaska Logistics' claims do not sound in recoupment; Alaska Logistics seeks \"[d]amages in an amount exceeding $231,391,\" which would constitute \"affirmative relief\" from Newtok rather than \"an offset to [Newtok's] requested relief.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Oregon\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit concluded that a tribe waived its sovereign immunity where, as here, the tribe elected to participate in litigation that it did not initiate. After intervening in the initial litigation, however, the tribe in\n   <em>\n    Oregon\n   </em>\n   \"entered an agreement expressing its unequivocal consent to submit issues to federal court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   Newtok has not entered into such an agreement; moreover, it has asserted its sovereign immunity defense throughout this litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit has expressed reluctance to apply the\n   <em>\n    Oregon\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning in distinguishable contexts; subsequent cases have characterized\n   <em>\n    Oregon\n   </em>\n   as \"test[ing] the outer limits of [the Supreme Court']s admonition\n   against implied waivers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the authorities Alaska Logistics cites do not establish that Newtok waived its tribal sovereign immunity as to the claims Alaska Logistics has asserted against it by asserting counterclaims against Alaska Logistics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court has found few other cases addressing tribal sovereign immunity and the effect of litigation conduct analogous to that at issue here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, several courts have addressed whether similar conduct constitutes a waiver of\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   sovereign immunity. In\n   <em>\n    Mescalero Tribe v. State of New Mexico\n   </em>\n   , a tribe filed an action against the state of New Mexico; the state responded by filing an answer and counterclaim while also \"argu[ing] that it had Tenth and Eleventh Amendment immunity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    91\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Tenth Circuit considered whether the state had waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity by filing a counterclaim, and concluded that it had not. The court acknowledged that a state may waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity, but noted that such waiver must be \"unequivocal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n   It then concluded that the state's continued assertion of its Eleventh Amendment immunity was \"hardly consistent with the kind of unequivocal waiver necessary to waive that immunity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other courts have reached similar conclusions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court is unaware of any Ninth Circuit case that has held that a tribe waives its sovereign immunity as to the claims in an opposing party's complaint by asserting counterclaims. Furthermore, any waiver of tribal sovereign immunity \"must be unequivocal and may not be implied.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    95\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Newtok's counterclaims were accompanied by its assertion that Alaska Logistics' claims were barred by sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the absence of controlling precedent, the Court finds the\n   <em>\n    Mescalero Tribe\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning persuasive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    97\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Newtok has not waived\n   its sovereign immunity through its litigation activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Forum Selection Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Alaska Logistics next contends that Newtok waived its immunity by agreeing to the forum selection clause in the proposed Transportation Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    98\n   </footnotemark>\n   No United States Supreme Court opinion or published Ninth Circuit opinion has addressed whether a forum selection clause constitutes a waiver of a tribe's sovereign immunity. In\n   <em>\n    C &amp; L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Oklahoma\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that a tribe waived its sovereign immunity by consenting to arbitration and to the enforcement of arbitral awards in Oklahoma state court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    99\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    C &amp; L Enterprises, Inc.\n   </em>\n   court rejected the tribe's contention \"that an arbitration clause simply 'is not a waiver of immunity from suit' \":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The clause no doubt memorializes the Tribe's commitment to adhere to the contract's dispute resolution regime. That regime has a real world objective; it is not designed for regulation of a game lacking practical consequences. And to the real world end, the contract specifically authorizes judicial enforcement of the resolution arrived at through arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    100\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   While the opinion addressed only the effects of an arbitration clause, the\n   <em>\n    C &amp; L Enterprises, Inc.\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning would also seem to apply to a forum selection clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Even assuming, however, that a forum selection clause may in some circumstances constitute a waiver of a tribe's sovereign immunity, there is no indication here that Newtok agreed to a forum selection clause that \"manifest[ed] the tribe's intent to surrender immunity in 'clear' and unmistakable terms.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    101\n   </footnotemark>\n   The clause was included in the proposed Transportation Agreement that Alaska Logistics submitted with its bids.\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n   In relevant part, the clause states that \"[a]ny action brought by either party to enforce any term or provision of this contract shall be commenced in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle, as appropriate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n   Elsewhere, however, the proposed Transportation Agreement is characterized as an agreement \"by and between Alaska Logistics, LLC ... (\"Carrier\"), and Goldstream Engineering, acting for the Newtok Village Council ... (\"Shipper\").\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    104\n   </footnotemark>\n   The last page of the proposed Transportation Agreement includes signature lines with space for two signatories: Alaska Logistics, identified as the \"Carrier,\" and \"Goldstream Engineering for [Newtok Village Council],\" identified as\n   the \"Shipper.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    105\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if the proposed Transportation Agreement were binding on Goldstream, reading the proposed Transportation Agreement as a whole, it is not apparent that the forum selection clause would be binding on Newtok. While the document characterizes Goldstream as \"acting for the Newtok Village Council,\" the forum selection clause's reference to \"either party\" suggests that the clause binds\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the two parties to the agreement - which are identified elsewhere as \"Carrier\" Alaska Logistics and \"Shipper\" Goldstream. There is no indication that Newtok itself was a \"party\" to the proposed Transportation Agreement; unlike the agreement at issue in\n   <em>\n    C &amp; L Enterprises, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the proposed Transportation Agreement does not appear to have been signed by the tribe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    106\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the clause does not constitute an \"unmistakable\" manifestation of Newtok's intent to waive its sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    107\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Jurisdictional Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In the alternative, Alaska Logistics contends that it should be permitted to take jurisdictional discovery on the sovereign immunity issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    108\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alaska Logistics contends that the Mertarvik construction project \"has spanned for over a decade and has involved dozens of state and federal agencies as well as numerous private contractors,\" and that \"Newtok has routinely waived its sovereign immunity, by contract, to qualify for government grants or enter into agreements with various contractors\" as part of the project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    109\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Alaska Logistics contends that it \"has a reasonable basis to believe that Newtok has waived its sovereign immunity in other contracts or grant applications with government agencies and private contractors, and that some of those waivers may extend to Alaska Logistics['] claims and counterclaims to counterclaims.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    110\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Alaska Logistics does not point to any \"pertinent facts bearing on the question of jurisdiction [that] are in dispute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    111\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, it contends that Newtok may have entered into a contract with another entity in which it waived its sovereign immunity as to a broad range of claims that might extend to Newtok's claims. To support this contention, Alaska Logistics cites contracts between Newtok and two other entities involved with the Mertarvik construction project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    112\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, both contracts waive sovereign immunity only as to disputes between the contracting parties, and only as to disputes related to the contracts in question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    113\n   </footnotemark>\n   While it is possible that Newtok has effected a broad waiver of sovereign immunity in relation to the Mertarvik construction project, Alaska Logistics' request for jurisdictional discovery is \"based on little more than a hunch that it might yield jurisdictionally relevant facts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    114\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Alaska Logistics will not be permitted\n   to take jurisdictional discovery on the sovereign immunity issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Alaska Logistics' \"Counterclaims to Counterclaims\" are Redundant.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Newtok asks the Court to strike Alaska Logistics' \"Amended Answer to Newtok's Counterclaims and Plaintiff's Counterclaims to Counterclaims.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    115\n   </footnotemark>\n   Newtok contends that \"the Federal Civil Rules do not contemplate any pleading that might be styled as a 'counterclaim to a counterclaim.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    116\n   </footnotemark>\n   Newtok further contends that \"the Court should strike the pleading because it is largely redundant as to [Alaska Logistics'] original complaint.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    117\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, Alaska Logistics cites several cases in which courts have held that \"counterclaims to counterclaims\" are permissible under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    118\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Alaska Logistics does not address Newtok's contention that the pleading is redundant. Because the Court concludes that Alaska Logistics' pleading should be stricken pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f), the Court assumes without deciding that \"counterclaims to counterclaims\" are permissible under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 12(f), a court may \"strike from a pleading ... any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\" A claim is redundant if it repeats another claim in the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    119\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" 'Redundant' allegations are those that are needlessly repetitive or wholly foreign to the issues involved in the action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    120\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Alaska Logistics' \"claims and counterclaims\" consist of claims and allegations that are almost identical to those in its Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    121\n   </footnotemark>\n   This portion of Alaska Logistics' pleading is redundant under Rule 12(f). The inclusion of counterclaims in Alaska Logistics' amended answer that are identical to Alaska Logistics' original claims would unnecessarily complicate this proceeding and would prejudice Newtok.\n   <footnotemark>\n    122\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Newtok's Motion to Strike will be granted as to the redundant portions of the pleading at Docket 25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    123\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In light of the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED that Newtok Village's Motion to Dismiss at Docket 18 is GRANTED.
