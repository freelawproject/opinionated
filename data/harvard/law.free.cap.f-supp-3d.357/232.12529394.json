Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last met the insured status requirements of the Act on\n   December 31, 2011. (Dkt. 5 at 20). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since January 28, 2011, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of \"fibromyalgia, Sjogren's syndrome, depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of cocaine and marijuana dependence were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). With respect to Plaintiff's representations that she suffered from lupus and greater trochanteric bursitis, the ALJ concluded that these were not medically determinable impairments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 12.04, 12.06, 14.09D, and 14.10 in reaching her conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a range of light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 416.967(b), with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   can lift, carry, push and pull 20 pounds occasionally and 10 pounds frequently; sit for six hours and stand and/or walk six hours in an eight-hour workday but must be able to alternate at will between sitting and standing. She can frequently balance and stoop; frequently handle and finger; and occasionally kneel, crouch and crawl; and have occasional exposure to vibrations. Further, [Plaintiff] can understand, remember and carry out simple, routine, repetitive instructions and tasks; maintain attention and concentration sufficient for such tasks with customary breaks; and make simple work related decisions commensurate with such tasks. In addition, [Plaintiff] can work in a low stress environment (meaning one with no supervisory responsibilities; no independent decision making required except with respect to simple, routine work related tasks; no work at production rate pace; and no more than minimal changes in work routines, processes or settings); and can have occasional interaction with supervisors, coworkers and the general public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). At step four, the ALJ found that Plaintiff had no past relevant work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of envelope addresser, stuffer, and painter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Remand of this Matter for Further Proceedings is Necessary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to reverse or, in the alternative, remand this matter to the Commissioner, arguing that (1) the ALJ erred by not explaining the basis of the step three finding that Plaintiff did not meet or equal Listing 14.10(A), and (2) the ALJ erred by assessing Plaintiff's RFC without a useful medical opinion. (Dkt. 8-1 at 1). For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the ALJ failed to adequately consider whether Plaintiff's Sjogren's syndrome meets the requirements of Listing 14.10(A), and that this error necessitates remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Step Three Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the ALJ's step three analysis was deficient because she did not examine in detail the requirements of Listing 14.10(A) and the evidence that Plaintiff met this Listing.

Sjogren's syndrome may be associated with other autoimmune disorders (for example, rheumatoid arthritis or SLE); usually the clinical features of the associated disorder predominate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144451\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/5/493/#p507\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14.00(7)(a)(ii). In this case, at step three, the ALJ addressed Listing 14.10:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   I have given particular attention to Listing 14.10, Sjogren's syndrome.

Plaintiff contends that because she made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that the requirements of Listing 14.10 were met, the ALJ was required to more than merely paraphrase the requirements at step three of the sequential analysis. (Dkt. 8-1 at 12-14). Plaintiff points specifically to evidence that she presented demonstrating the involvement of two or more body systems, including her musculoskeletal system, eyes, hair, and extremities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). Plaintiff further contends that the involvement of the musculoskeletal system was at least of a moderate level, as evidenced by the ALJ's limiting Plaintiff to light work with additional accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16). Finally, Plaintiff contends that she presented evidence that at least two constitutional symptoms were involved, including severe fatigue and malaise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). Defendant responds that although the ALJ could have provided more detail in support of her step three finding, remand is not required because other portions of the ALJ's decision supports that the step three finding is supported by substantial evidence.

Dec. 1, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court has reviewed the record and the written determination and concludes that the ALJ erred by failing to further explain her conclusion that Plaintiff did not meet the requirements of Listing 14.10(A). As an initial matter, the written determination contains a discussion of some evidence relevant to the requirements for Listing 14.10(A). For example, the written determination acknowledges the involvement of Plaintiff's musculoskeletal system, as well as her reports of fatigue and malaise. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 5 at 24 (lab results were positive for Sjogren's syndrome, and Plaintiff had trigger points, tenderness, and pain, but good range of motion and strength);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25 (Plaintiff reported severe fatigue to her primary care provider);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25 (\"She reported diffuse body pain from head to toe that was worse towards the end of the day and with activity.\") ). The ALJ found Plaintiff's allegations regarding the severity of her musculoskeletal pain not credible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24, 26-27). However, it is unclear to the Court how the ALJ concluded that the involvement of this system did not rise to the moderate level, particularly because the ALJ assessed an RFC that includes several physical limitations for tasks involving the musculoskeletal system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). Similarly, it is unclear to the Court why the ALJ found that Plaintiff failed to meet the requirement of exhibiting two constitutional symptoms or signs. As noted by the ALJ in the written determination, at least some of Plaintiff's complaints of fatigue and discomfort were borne out by examinations. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25 (explaining that laboratory results were positive for Sjogren's syndrome, Plaintiff had multiple trigger points and her joints were tender throughout, and examinations were positive for swelling and tenderness) ). In other words, the Court is unable to glean from the\n   written determination how the ALJ arrived at the conclusion that Plaintiff's musculoskeletal pain, as well as her complaints of fatigue and malaise, fail to satisfy the requirements of Listing 14.10(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Further, other requirements of Listing 14.10(A) are not addressed, including evidence of additional body systems affected by Plaintiff's Sjorgen's syndrome, such as her eyes, hair, and extremities. The lack of discussion on these points is problematic, as the medical record contains evidence that these systems were implicated on an ongoing basis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 5 at 342 (in July 2013, Plaintiff complained of numbness and tingling);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 351-52 (in May 2013, Plaintiff was \"[p]ositive for alopecia, photosensitivity, malar rash\" and \"[p]ositive for numbness and tingling\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 359 (in January 2010, Plaintiff appeared acutely ill and weak, and an examination of her ears, nose, mouth and throat revealed that mucous membranes were dry);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   at 402 (in April 2013, Plaintiff reported burning, fatigue, numbness, and tingling);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 520 (in July 2014, Plaintiff reported chronic fatigue, marked hair loss, weight gain, blurred vision, numbness and tingling in her upper extremities, photosensitivity, and \"fairly significant dry eye,\" which she believed was a side effect of her medications);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 527 (in October 2014, Plaintiff reported chronic fatigue, hair loss, weight gain, dry eye and mouth);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 578 (in May 2016, Plaintiff complained of dry eyes and dry mouth) ). The Court further notes that there is evidence in the record of Plaintiff's mental impairments (which the ALJ concluded qualified as \"severe\"), as well as gastrointestinal issues. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 5 at 384, 388, 392). None of this evidence is discussed by the ALJ in the written determination, and the ALJ's failure to engage in a meaningful discussion of why these impairments did not qualify as additional body systems affected by Plaintiff's Sjogren's syndrome was error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flake,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207017355\">\n    2016 WL 7017355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20165893\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist.

(Dkt. 13-1 at 20). In support of this argument, Defendant points to evidence in the record wherein Plaintiff did not report dry eyes, alopecia, or a neurological impairment, or where physical examinations did not support the existence of these symptoms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21). However, when there is conflicting evidence in the record as to whether Plaintiff meets a particular listing, the ALJ must do more than state in a conclusory fashion that Plaintiff's impairments do not meet the listing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flake,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207017355\">\n    2016 WL 7017355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20165893\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist.

Further, the ALJ assessed several physical limitations in the RFC, which tend to support the involvement of Plaintiff's musculoskeletal system, and the medical record clearly demonstrates the involvement of other body systems, as required by the regulation. Without additional explanation by the ALJ as to how she concluded that Plaintiff does not meet the requirements of Listing 14.10(A), the Court is unable to assess whether the ALJ's conclusion is supported by substantial evidence. At the very least, based on the above-mentioned evidence in the record, the ALJ should have more carefully explained her reasoning as to why Plaintiff did not meet the requirements of Listing 14.10.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hendricks v.
