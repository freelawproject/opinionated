(Compl. \u00b6 7, Dkt. No. 1.) The family planned to vacation in Washington, D.C., for spring break. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Shebleys' two older children sat together in row 12, and the Shebleys sat with their youngest child in row 16. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.) Eaman placed the youngest child in a \"booster\" seat atop the airplane seat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) When flight attendant Eroll Agacaolli walked down the aisle to check that the passengers were secured with seatbelts, Mohamad politely asked for over-the-shoulder straps for the Shebleys' youngest child, as portrayed on the United website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Agacaolli replied that the airline did not provide such straps. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Mohamad offered to show Agacaolli the picture on the United website on his phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While Agacaolli was looking at Mohamad's phone, another flight attendant, Alicia Heyes, approached Eaman and informed her that her child could not be seated in the booster. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Eaman replied, \"Okay,\" and asked whether the airline would provide over-the-shoulder straps instead. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Heyes repeated that the child could not be seated in the booster. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Eaman said that she was not aware that she could not use the booster, especially because the Shebleys had been permitted to bring the booster on the plane by other United staff members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Eaman asked, \"is it safer for my daughter to be without a booster?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Heyes again did not answer the question, instead repeating a third time that the child could not be seated in the booster. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At this point, Agacaolli told the Shebleys to deboard the plane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Mohamad asked why, but Agacaolli simply repeated his request that they deboard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.) Eaman removed the booster from her daughter's seat, but Agacaolli and Heyes did not notice, as they had already started walking away from the Shebleys towards the cockpit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Two passengers approached the Shebleys and stated that they had witnessed the Shebleys follow the flight attendants' instructions and sit with fastened seatbelts the entire time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) The Shebleys' children began to feel anxious and cry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Later, Heyes returned and saw the Shebleys seated with their seat belts fastened and the booster removed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Heyes said nothing, then walked back to the cockpit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thirty minutes later, flight attendant Jen Moore approached Eaman and asked what was going on. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Eaman explained that the other flight attendants had left about an hour ago after instructing them to deboard and without answering any of their questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Moore then requested that Eaman deboard the plane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Mohamad told Moore that he was Eaman's husband and that he wanted to know why she was being asked to leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) Moore replied that a supervisor would speak to them off the plane and again requested that the Shebleys deboard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Mohamad again asked why but received no response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A male flight attendant then approached and told the Shebleys to leave the plane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Mohamad asked him why, and the male flight attendant answered that the Shebleys had not followed instructions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.) Another passenger told the male flight attendant that the Shebleys had already removed the booster as requested and that the other flight attendants had left an hour before and not returned since then. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) The male flight attendant again said that the Shebleys had not followed instructions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) And Eaman and the other passenger again replied that the Shebleys had followed instructions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) The male flight attendant said that if the Shebleys left the plane, they could discuss it further. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) He then motioned for Captain Mathew Wagner to approach the Shebleys and speak to them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Captain Wagner informed the Shebleys that he had been given full authority over the safety of the plane and that the flight attendants had notified him that the Shebleys had not followed instructions regarding their child. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) The Shebleys replied that they had followed instructions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Another passenger also told Captain Wagner that the Shebleys had followed instructions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Mohamad explained that he asked about over-the-shoulder straps for their child, but the flight attendants did not answer him and left. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) Mohamad reiterated that they had followed instructions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Captain Wagner then told the Shebleys to deboard the plane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) When Mohamad asked why, Captain Wagner responded that it was his decision and he would give them more details on the jetway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) Eaman asked whether the decision was based on discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Captain Wagner responded that it was a flight safety issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Shebleys left the plane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) On the jetway, Captain Wagner told them that he would have frightened the other passengers if he had given them an explanation on board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) He then told a story about how a passenger had disobeyed instructions on a U.S. Airways plane that crashed in the Hudson River, before concluding that he needed the Shebleys to follow instructions no matter what. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) Mohamad insisted that they had followed instructions and that Captain Wagner's explanation was irrelevant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) Captain Wagner apologized for the inconvenience and said nothing further. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) Ultimately, the Shebleys gathered their children and belongings and boarded a different flight to Washington D.C. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Based on these allegations, the Shebleys assert that Defendants discriminated against them by removing them from their flight.

Moreover, the Shebleys asked no less than five times why they had to deboard, but the flight attendants repeatedly refused to answer. Later, the Shebleys were given a variety of reasons-their failure to follow instructions, the captain's discretion, and \"a flight safety issue.\" But even after leaving the plane, the Shebleys did not receive a reasonable explanation regarding how they had failed to follow instructions or caused a flight safety issue. The extreme response to the Shebleys' behavior creates a plausible inference that they were subjected to intentional racial discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Irving v.

The Shebleys originally argued that Defendants must comply with Title VI because they received federal financial assistance under the Air Transportation Safety and Systems Stabilization Act (the \"Act\"), P.L. 107-42.

The motion is denied as to Count II. Plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint, conduct limited fact discovery, and strike portions of Defendants' reply brief (Dkt. No. 33) is granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiffs are granted leave to amend an amended complaint that remedies the pleading deficiencies with respect to Count III within 28 days. The requests for leave to conduct limited fact discovery and to strike portions of Defendants' reply brief are denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    For present purposes, United Airlines, Inc. and United Continental Holdings, Inc. are referred to collectively as \"United,\" and together with SkyWest Airlines, Inc., as \"Defendants.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Traditionally, \u00a7 40127(a) has been invoked by the United States Department of Transportation (\"DOT\") in enforcement actions.
