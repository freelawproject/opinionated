Cities are obliged to evaluate each of these factors to determine whether they are impediments and develop strategies for addressing them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.154\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Clawback Documents all describe the requirements of the new AFH rule. They also set out preliminary steps the City will need to take to identify the impediments to fair housing in New York City, data it will need to collect to prepare its AFH, and potential issues with HUD metrics and assessment criteria as applied to New York City. The documents also contain some preliminary analyses utilizing HUD data and criteria. City officials have testified that deliberations regarding the AFH submission to HUD involved multiple agencies and required collaboration among agencies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 470-4, Excerpts from Deposition Transcript of Matthew Murphy (\"Tr.\") at 101:7-21, 102:18-103:3.) The City also has made clear that the Clawback Documents do not reflect any final decisions by the City as to its AFH approach or any contributing factor. (Declaration of David Quart (\"Quart Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 7-13.) All of the documents contain \"next steps\" slides that, among other things, indicate that policy recommendations as to how to use the AFH, how to set goals, how to compile data, and how to measure low and high opportunity areas need to be formulated. The Clawback Documents list a number of these HUD-provided\n   \"contributing factors\" and summarize issues to consider when evaluating how they affect fair housing goals. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , NYC 0105039.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In connection with the Court's re-review of these documents, neither party disputes that the Clawback Documents are pre-decisional. Nor do they dispute that the documents reflect deliberative content. They disagree on the outcome of the\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   balancing factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court first addresses the relevance factor. Plaintiffs correctly state that relevant evidence includes information specific to the challenged Community Preference Policy, including information reflecting the City's motivation in adopting and maintaining the policy. Likewise, information suggesting that race-based views were a significant factor \"in the position taken by the municipal decision-makers themselves or by those to whom the decision-makers were knowingly responsive\" with respect to the Community Preference Policy is relevant.\n   <em>\n    Winfield v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-cv-05236 (LTS) (DCF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206208564\">\n    2016 WL 6208564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 24, 2016). Plaintiffs contend that community opposition to fair housing was race-based and that the City's Community Preference Policy was designed to placate such opposition and mitigate perceived fears of or resistance to racial integration in neighborhoods of opportunity posed by the building of affordable housing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Factors to be considered in establishing discriminatory intent of the City in implementing and maintaining the Community Preference Policy include: whether the official action bears more heavily on one race than another, the decision's historical background, the specific sequence of events leading up to the decision, departures from normal procedure, substantive departures, and contemporary statements by members of the decision-making body.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p267\">\n    429 U.S. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p267\">\n    97 S.Ct. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p267\">\n    50 L.Ed.2d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Yonkers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773118\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/1181/#p1221\">\n    837 F.2d 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1221 (2d Cir. 1987). While nothing in the Clawback Documents discusses the Community Preference Policy or even the extent of race-based opposition to affordable housing, it is nonetheless relevant to establishing what the City may have known in 2015 or earlier about race-based opposition to affordable housing. That the presentations are merely a preliminary overview of the City's prospective AFH submission does not render them irrelevant; rather, the nature of the document (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a draft containing preliminary thoughts about the assessments the City would need to make to comply with the new AFH rule) affects the weight of the document - its place on the relevance spectrum - and influence on the balancing test. Likewise, that the presentations do not reflect analysis of the racial impact of the Community Preference Policy on affordable housing applicants or the Policy's impact on the demographics of community districts does not render them irrelevant for purposes of the first\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   factor - it goes to the weight of this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs point to pages within the Clawback Documents in which, they claim, the City makes the observation that community opposition is a contributing factor or impediment to fair housing. In actuality, HUD designated community opposition as a contributing factor that each municipality must consider when creating its AFH under the new rule. But, in any event, this Court does not make any decisions as to the import of the document or any information in it as to liability - this Court's review of the document content and relevance is made solely for the purpose of assessing its discoverability under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs also point to issues noted by the City with respect to the Community Opposition \"contributing factor.\" One issue is that \"Both low and higher income areas don't necessarily support integration (anti-displacement, ethnic solidarity).\" Another issue in relation to publicly supported housing is described as \"Opposition can be high in higher opportunity areas (e.g. Queens, Staten Island) except for senior housing.\" Plaintiffs contend that the issues identified by HPD with respect to the HUD-specified factor of \"Community Opposition\" reflects a recognition by the City that opposition to affordable housing in some neighborhoods is race-based. Because Plaintiff allege that one purpose of the Community Preference Policy is to address racially-motivated resistance to affordable housing development, Plaintiffs argue that the recognized issues are relevant and support their theory of liability. Plaintiffs point to other information in the documents that they deem relevant to establishing a history of segregation in New York City, disproportionate development across community districts, and lack of community revitalization strategies. As mentioned above, this Court previously circumscribed the relevance factor in a manner that Judge Swain found too narrow. Based on Judge Swain's Order, relevance must be construed broadly. That the City disputes Plaintiffs' allegations, characterization of the meaning of the documents, and import of the documents does not render them irrelevant for discovery purposes. In light of the broader definition of relevance, and based on the content in the documents mentioned above, this Court finds that the relevance factor weighs in favor of disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court considers the second\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   factor - availability of other evidence - for each of the Clawback Documents.\n   <em>\n    Noel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206786238\">\n    2018 WL 6786238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted by Judge Swain, the depth of inquiry as to availability may vary based on where the relevance factor falls on that spectrum.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206786238\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs argue that the presentations call into question or supplement testimony of key witnesses on whether they had been briefed on (1) whether getting community support for residential racial integration is difficult and (2) whether getting community support for fair housing is difficult, among other issues. While the City rightly points out that Plaintiffs had a full opportunity to depose witnesses on the topic of community support or opposition to fair housing, and that other information on these topics has been provided, it is unclear to what extent there are other documents that might refresh a witness's knowledge and memories on these topics. In light of the Court's reevaluation of the relevance factor, and the supplemental information provided by Plaintiffs as to the necessity of the documents in light of other information learned in discovery, this factor weighs in favor of disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court evaluates the third\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   factor - seriousness of issues in the case - differently than it did in February in light of Judge Swain's December 12 Order. Specifically, the Court does not consider or import the fifth factor in its assessment of this factor. Because discrimination cases are objectively serious, this factor weighs in favor of disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The fourth\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   factor looks to the role of government in the litigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206786238\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This refers, specifically, to the government's role in the allegedly unlawful conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Favors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2011319831\">\n    2013 WL 11319831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12. As this Court previously found, the fourth factor favors disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Lastly, the Court weighs the first four factors as a group against the fifth factor - the potential chilling effect that disclosure will have on government employees. As this Court has previously recognized,\n   a key rationale for the deliberative process privilege is the need to ensure the effective functioning of our government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizens Union of City of N.Y.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263993\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/269/124/#p169\">\n    269 F.Supp.3d at 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . City officials cannot engage in open, productive deliberations about how to best address the City's fair and affordable housing needs if all communications are subject to disclosure. It is in all parties' interests - including the interests of Plaintiffs and all other individuals who seek affordable housing in New York City - to allow the City to engage in the candid exchange of ideas and opinions concerning the future of its fair and affordable housing policies and how best to comply with federal regulations. In light of this Court's recalibration of the first four factors against the fifth factor, the Court finds that the balance, though a close call, weighs in favor of disclosure of the Clawback Documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. Chart of Issues Regarding Housing Connect (NYCPRIV00548)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This document is a chart that summarizes issues raised by developers regarding Housing Connect and the marketing process for affordable housing units. It contains HPD's assessment of those issues and possible responses to developers and was used to facilitate discussions on possible improvements to the marketing process. The City produced this document in redacted form to Plaintiffs. The redacted columns contain preliminary thoughts and potential responses to the issues raised by the developers. In looking at the first\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   factor, the Court notes that the issues raised in the document do not pertain to the Community Preference Policy. Rather, they concern potential changes to the marketing and lease-up process. This information is relevant background information - understanding the marketing and lease-up process for affordable housing is important to Plaintiffs' disparate impact analysis. However, given the nature of the information in the document (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , deliberations and not a description of the City's final position as to the issues), it falls on the lower range of the relevance spectrum. Thus, this factor weighs only slightly in favor of disclosure. The second factor, however, availability of other information, weighs against disclosure. Plaintiffs have had a full opportunity to learn the actual marketing and lease-up processes for affordable housing, as well as how the Community Preference Policy fits into those processes. The City already has produced the final marketing guidelines that were in place during the applicable period. The City also has provided information about the lease-up process. Moreover, Plaintiffs deposed the Assistant Commissioner in charge of marketing, Margaret Brown, the Director of Operations who oversaw policy changes to the marketing process, Emily Osgood, and the Director of Marketing, Victor Hernandez. Plaintiffs had the redacted document and could have questioned these deponents about the document and related topics. Thus, as there was other evidence available regarding this minimally relevant information, the second\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   factor weighs against disclosure. The third and fourth factors weigh in favor of disclosure. When the first four factors are weighed against the fifth factor, however, the balance tips against disclosure and in favor of upholding the privilege. Nothing in the document bears on motivations for the policy at issue, nor would disclosure improve Plaintiffs' knowledge of the actual marketing guidelines and lease-up process used during the applicable period. The potential chilling effect of exposing internal deliberations on an issue of little relevance to this case and the information Plaintiffs already have on the guidelines and lease-up process inform this Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV. Documents Concerning East New York Plan (NYCPRIV00726 and 01023) and Inwood NYC Action Plan (NYCPRIV00885)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Document 00726 is an email chain discussing HPD's East New York plan, portions of which have been produced. The redacted portions discuss research on income levels, affordability requirements for housing on public sites in the neighborhood, and how HPD might provide subsidies for private sites in order to keep the housing affordable and best serve the community. The first\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   factor weighs against disclosure. HPD's discussions and deliberations on income levels and affordability in East New York are not relevant to the issues in this litigation. None of the redacted information goes to motivations for adopting and maintaining the Community Preference Policy or even circumstantial information touching on the\n   <em>\n    Arlington Heights\n   </em>\n   factors referenced above. The second factor - availability of other information - also weighs against disclosure. Plaintiffs have received data about developments in East New York and the income criteria applied to those developments. Plaintiffs have had the opportunity to question former Deputy Commissioner for Neighborhood Strategies, Daniel Hernandez, former Deputy Commissioner for Strategy Research and Communications, David Quart, as well as former HPD Commissioner Vicki Been on how income levels for projects are determined as well as subsidies provided by HPD in connection with affordable housing developments. Also, the final version of the East New York plan is publicly available, so Plaintiffs are aware of HPD's final decisions on the matters being discussed in the redacted portions of the email. The third and fourth factors weigh in favor of disclosure. When the first four factors are balanced against the fifth factor, the balance tips against disclosure. Again, there were various other avenues by which Plaintiffs could have obtained this minimally relevant information. The potential chilling effect of exposing internal deliberations on an issue of little relevance to this case and the information Plaintiffs already have concerning the East New York Plan inform this Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Document 01023 is a draft of the East New York Affordable Housing Strategy. For the same reasons discussed above, the balance of the\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   factors weighs against disclosure. The Court finds that the first two factors weigh against disclosure, the third and fourth weigh in favor of disclosure, and that the first four factors balanced against the fifth factor ultimately weighs against disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Document 00885 is a draft of the Inwood NYC Action Plan - Housing Section. The deliberative material in this document consists of comments as well as draft language, some of which does not appear in the final publication (which Plaintiffs have). For the same reasons set forth above with respect to the East New York plan documents, the first\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   factor weighs against disclosure. The second factor too weighs against disclosure, given that the final version of the Inwood NYC Action Plan - Housing Section is publicly available and that Plaintiffs have had the opportunity to depose individuals with knowledge of the plan. The Court finds that the first two\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   factors weigh against disclosure, the third and fourth weigh in favor of disclosure, and that the first four factors balanced against the fifth factor ultimately weighs against disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     V. Decision Memo Regarding Certain ULURP Applications (NYCPRIV00399)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This document is a memorandum to the Mayor requesting that he make a\n   decision regarding what the Administration's policy will be regarding certain ULURP applications in the mandatory inclusionary housing (\"MIH\") program. The Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (\"ULURP\") is a standardized procedure whereby applications affecting land use in New York City are publicly reviewed. Potential modifications to the ULURP application process have no bearing on the claims in this case. Therefore, the first\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   factor weighs against disclosure. The second factor also weighs against disclosure, as Plaintiffs already have information on the ULURP process in place during the relevant period. The third and fourth\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in favor of disclosure. When the first four factors are balanced against the fifth factor, disclosure is not warranted. Plaintiffs could have again questioned Deputy Commissioner Hernandez, Deputy Commissioner Quart, and Commissioner Been, on ULURP issues during their depositions. Therefore, both the first and second prongs of\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   weigh against disclosure. The potential chilling effect of exposing internal deliberations on an issue of little relevance to this case and the information Plaintiffs already have concerning the ULURP process inform this Court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     VI. Additional Documents Protected by the Deliberative Process Privilege and Not Challenged by Plaintiffs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This Court, in its February 1 decision, additionally held that NYCPRIV00183 and NYCPRIV00731 were protected from disclosure by the deliberative process privilege. Although Plaintiffs do not challenge this Court's ruling as to these two documents, the Court nevertheless reevaluates its analysis in light of Judge Swain's December 12 Order. Document 00183 is a draft memorandum to the Mayor requesting that he make a decision regarding whether to announce a commitment that HPD would finance 10,000 housing units for homeless households. Document 00731 is a draft of a presentation created to brief the New York State Legislature on proposals that HPD wanted to implement regarding tax and rent regulation issues. Neither document contains information relevant to this litigation. Therefore, the first\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   factor weighs against disclosure as to both documents. To the extent Plaintiffs wish to obtain public remarks made by the Mayor to the Legislature and debates about tax and rent regulation, they may obtain this information. Plaintiffs also have access to the final decision made by the Mayor about the number of homeless households that would be financed. Thus, factor two weighs against disclosure. The third and fourth\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in favor of disclosure. When the first four factors are balanced against the fifth factor, disclosure is not warranted as to either document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court reverses its prior rulings on the Clawback Documents but sustains its prior rulings as to the remainder of documents addressed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Plaintiffs objected to this Court's determination that the deliberative process privilege protected the following documents from disclosure: Bates Nos. 21052-21089, 22822-22859, a multi-page document commencing with Bates No. 53095, 56994-56997, and NYCPRIV Nos. 00017, 00218, 00242, 00393, 00399, 00548, 00726, 00885, 01023, 01556, and 01648.
