Walker, United States District Judge\n   The Plaintiff, National Fire Adjustment Company, Inc., seeks a declaratory judgment stating that the Defendant, Eric Cioppa, cannot enforce 24-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1476, which requires that public adjusters adhere to a 36-hour waiting period before soliciting business from Maine citizens or offering a contract for public adjustment services. According to Plaintiff, the statute violates Plaintiff's first amendment speech rights. The parties request a judgment on a stipulated record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   National Fire Adjustment Company, Inc. (\"Plaintiff\" or \"NFA\") provides licensed public insurance adjustment services for clients who have suffered property damage in the State of Maine.\n   <em>\n    Stip. Facts\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. NFA holds an active resident adjuster license from the State of Maine's Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   It is the nature of NFA's business to enter into contracts with property owners after the property owners suffer a loss insured by an insurance company. When a property owner retains NFA's services, NFA's employees provide loss-adjustments services to the property owner, which services, ideally, will provide the property owner with a method for adjusting (placing a value on) the insured loss that is more favorable to the property owner than the method used by adjusters employed or contracted by the property owner's insurance company. By providing this service, NFA's adjusters (sometimes called \"public adjusters\") help ensure that property owners settle coverage claims with their insurance companies for fair value.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. In return for their services, public adjusters charge a fee to the policyholder. The fee is usually a percentage of the overall damage recovery paid by the insurance company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Since 1997, through the Maine Insurance Code, the State of Maine has restricted the ability of public adjusters to solicit business within a 36-hour window following a loss. In its current form,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the so-called \"36-Hour Rule\" reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Solicitation.\n   </strong>\n   An adjuster seeking to provide adjusting services to an insured for a fee to be paid by the insured may not solicit or offer an adjustment services contract to any person for at least 36 hours after an accident or occurrence as a result of which the person might have a potential claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   24-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1476(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When it reviewed the merits of the proposed legislation, and in the course of deliberations that resulted in amendments to the 36-Hour Rule, the Legislature did not consider or rely on any factual findings of\n   fraudulent, misleading, intrusive, or otherwise concerning communications by public adjusters.\n   <em>\n    Stip. R.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant Eric Cioppa is the Superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. The Maine Bureau of Insurance is one of five agencies within the State of Maine's Department of Professional and Financial Regulation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. The Maine Bureau of Insurance regulates the State's insurance industry, including by licensing insurance adjusters and imposing discipline for violations of the State's insurance laws.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. In addition to other duties, Superintendent Cioppa is charged with protecting consumers from misleading or fraudulent business activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Adjusters in Maine must be licensed and are governed by a comprehensive state regulatory scheme to protect the public from misleading or fraudulent business activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. Among other tools in his enforcement arsenal, Superintendent Cioppa is authorized to revoke, suspend, place on probation, or otherwise limit the licensure of adjusters, and to impose civil penalties and restitution orders, for violations of any law enforced or rule adopted by the Superintendent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Superintendent Cioppa has imposed discipline on public adjusters, including suspensions from practice and civil penalties, for violations of the 36-Hour Rule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. For example, in October 2012, Superintendent Cioppa suspended a public adjuster's license for 30 days and ordered him to pay a $ 500 civil penalty because he had violated the 36-Hour Rule. The adjuster left two telephone messages concerning his services for property owners who experienced a fire-related loss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   NFA has two employees who work as adjusters in Maine, both of whom are duly-licensed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Superintendent Cioppa is not aware of any evidence that NRA's Maine-based adjusters have engaged in any false or misleading statements in their communications with clients regarding NFA's public insurance adjustment services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. NFA has instructed its adjusters in Maine to adhere to the 36-Hour Rule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. NFA's public adjusters in Maine are presently adhering to the 36-Hour Rule to avoid discipline by the Superintendent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. NFA's public adjusters in Maine have created time-keeping and alert systems to ensure that they wait the full 36 hours after a fire before contacting a property owner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition to the foregoing stipulated facts, the parties have stipulated to the following facts concerning the impact of the 36-Hour Rule on public insurance adjustment services. Accordingly, the Court accepts it as established that the first 36 hours after a fire are a critical time for public adjusters to communicate with potential clients about their services; that the first 36 hours after a fire can be stressful, hectic, and traumatic for property owners who have suffered damage; that property owners may relocate to temporary housing immediately after a fire loss, so that there may be a very short period of time for a public adjuster to locate and communicate with the policyholder; that property owners may agree to cleaning or tear-down services immediately after suffering a property loss, impeding the ability of public adjuster to assess the value of the loss; and that, by logical extension, NFA public adjusters' adherence to the 36-Hour Rule is causing NFA's public adjusters to lose business on an ongoing basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-12, 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Performing public insurance adjusting services for policyholders in accordance with Maine law is a lawful business activity and is not inherently misleading.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff argues the 36-Hour Rule violates the First Amendment because it is a\n   \"content- and speaker-based restriction on speech [that] is presumptively unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.\" Pl.'s Mot. for Disposition of Liability Issues by Judgment on a Stip. R. at 2, ECF No. 21 (\"Pl.'s Mot.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. In the alternative, Plaintiff argues the Rule imposes burdens that either do not advance the State's interest or sweep more broadly than necessary to achieve the stated interest. Pl.'s Mot. at 2; Complaint \u00b6 44. Defendant argues the 36-Hour Rule directly advances a substantial governmental interest and is no more burdensome than is necessary to serve that interest.

R. at 7 (\"Def.'s Mem.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the States from, among other things, abridging the freedom of speech.\n   <em>\n    Janus v.

Pl.'s Mot. at 7-8. I am not entirely persuaded that the 36-Hour Rule imposes any message bias as between public adjusters and insurance company adjusters. As Defendant observes, Def.'s Mem. at 8, public adjusters and insurance company adjusters stand in different positions because the insurance company adjusters work at the invitation of the property owner. Should an insurance company adjuster arrive and communicate with the property owner within 36 hours of a covered loss, he or she will do so in fulfillment of a contractual obligation to do so, not opportunistically to solicit a contract for adjustment services. On the other hand, it is at least conceivable that the insurance company adjuster could take steps that compromise, or possibly even settle, a claim for coverage within the 36-hour window, while the property owner is presumed to be experiencing a great deal of emotional disturbance. Consequently, it is at least conceivable\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the 36-Hour Rule might not be even-handed in some instances because, oddly enough, it sweeps too narrowly by not constraining insurance company adjuster speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although I am not convinced on the basis of the stipulated record that the 36-Hour Rule was designed to favor one speaker over another, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Virginia Board of Pharmacy\n   </em>\n   (invalidating restrictions on pharmacy price advertisement),\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   (invalidating message-based sign regulation), and\n   <em>\n    Sorrell v.

On the first of these issues, I conclude that the Rule advances a privacy interest, although some of the argument advanced by Defendant is not helpful on that point (see below). In addition, the Rule advances the interest in professional regulation and consumer protection; specifically, the creation of a buffer period in which property owners cannot compromise their rights through a contingent-fee contract. Therefore, I reach the issue of permeability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant argues the 36-Hour Rule is exceptionally permeable to speech activity. Specifically, Defendant states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-40\">\n   The 36-Hour Rule limits only the soliciting or offering of an \"adjustment services contract ... to an insured for a fee\" during the 36-hour period. The statute does not prohibit a public adjuster from communicating with victims (e.g., via direct discussion or dissemination of generic best-practices information; responding to consumer-initiated contacts; engaging in promotional advertising or untargeted mailers to the public; etc.)-so long as the adjuster does not solicit or offer a fee-for-service contract during that time. Further, the public adjuster would be unimpeded in asking the victim if it would be okay for the adjuster to take pictures of the scene, or to recommend that the victim preserve certain things (i.e., not to immediately agree with the company adjuster to cleaning or tear-down services).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Def.'s Mem. at 9-10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In reply, Plaintiff argues that the actual language of the 36-Hour Rule is not that permissive. Pl.'s Mot. at 9. Plaintiff has a point. The Rule states that public adjusters \"may not solicit or offer an adjustment services contract.\" 24-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1476(1). The Legislature's use of the disjunctive \"or\" reflects its understanding that solicitation is not the same thing as making an offer. Black's Law Dictionary tells us that the term \"solicitation\" includes \"[a]n attempt or effort to gain business,\" and provides as an example attorney advertisements. Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   It is an age-old maxim that a statute must be construed according to its ordinary meaning, \"for were a different rule to be admitted, no [person], however cautious and intelligent, could safely estimate the extent of his [or her] engagements, or rest upon his own understanding of a law, until a judicial construction ... had been obtained.\"\n   <em>\n    Green v. Biddle\n   </em>\n   , 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 1, 89-90,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6136159\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/21/1/\">\n    5 L.Ed. 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1823). Consistent with this maxim, a Maine court construing the 36-Hour Rule would treat the question as one of law, would give the words \"their plain and ordinary meaning,\" and would seek to avoid treating words and phrases as mere \"surplusage.\"\n   <em>\n    Passamaquoddy Water Dist. v. City of Eastport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11837752\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/710/897/\">\n    1998 ME 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11837752\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/710/897/\">\n    710 A.2d 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 899. Based on my reading of the 36-Hour Rule, the\n   ban on \"solicitation\" is exceedingly broad and acts as a powerful deterrent to even educational outreach activity within the 36-hour window. In my view, it is extremely unlikely that the average property owner through an exercise of common sense would regard educational outreach activity as anything other than solicitation. If offense was taken by a property owner, and if Defendant received a complaint, it seems to me that Defendant would be equally hard-pressed to draw clear lines between educational speech and solicitation speech, especially where the speaker is only present on the scene to serve a commercial interest. In any case, Plaintiff's speech rights should not rest precariously on how Defendant chooses to characterize certain speech when the distinction between the two, in the world of three dimensions, appears to be tissue thin. I expect that Defendant likewise would prefer a less slippery footing upon which to ground his enforcement and disciplinary actions. The benefit of giving words in the statute their plain and ordinary meaning, is that the public charged with knowledge of and compliance with its prohibitions do not need to guess correctly as to the meaning that the official charged with its enforcement may give it. The people of Maine are governed by laws, not by the intention of legislators or the state officials charged with enforcement of the laws. The text of the statute is the law, even if, as Defendant urges, it is not what was intended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Were it otherwise, it would be like emperor Caligula posting edicts high up on the pillars, so that they could not easily be read.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In short, it stands to reason that Plaintiff does not believe it can communicate with property owners to share its knowledge or describe its services during the 36-hour period without getting scorched. Moreover, given Defendant's argument, it is apparent that Defendant perceives the need to make some allowances for the communication of information related to loss adjustment services. Defendant has also agreed to a stipulation that the burden is significant from an economic perspective. Still, it does not necessarily follow that Plaintiff's inability to strike while the iron is hot is offensive to the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   While I accept that the 36-Hour Rule imposes an opportunity cost for Plaintiff - the parties have stipulated to that effect - I nevertheless conclude that, to the extent the 36-Hour Rule prohibits the actual offer of a public adjustment contract, the 36-hour delay is an \"incidental\" imposition that serves a substantial consumer protection interest. However, I also conclude that the ban on all solicitation activity, temporary as it may be, is an excessively paternalistic prior restraint on speech and, as such, sweeps more broadly than is necessary to serve the stated interests. Public adjusters are not attorneys subject to the heightened professional standard at work in\n   <em>\n    Ohralik\n   </em>\n   , and their services are lawful and not inherently misleading. Moreover, the privacy concern has been given little weight in other cases involving bans on direct solicitation activity. In my view, the interests in professional regulation and\n   privacy do not support the temporary ban on solicitation speech. While it is understandable that many individuals would prefer not to receive solicitation of this kind shortly after suffering a loss, there are others who may welcome and benefit from the public adjuster's message. Those who are offended by such activity are, of course, free to express their view and turn away unwelcome callers. Our free speech rights demand a certain degree of personal fortitude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, in terms of the interest in consumer protection, prohibiting the offer of contract for 36 hours and allowing for rescission for another 48-hours is a fully adequate means of serving that interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is not necessary to ban all solicitation as well. Permitting lawful solicitation that is not inherently misleading, while prohibiting conduct that involves closing a contract, in my view achieves the balance commanded by the Free Speech Clause or, more precisely, the intermediate-scrutiny, commercial-speech wax applied to the Free Speech Clause (and discussed in three concurring opinions) in\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson.\n   </em>\n   I therefore grant Plaintiff partial relief, solely with respect to the prohibition against solicitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff's request for judgment on the stipulated record is granted in part and denied in part.
