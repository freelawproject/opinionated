WEINSTEIN, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At 10 p.m. one evening in Brooklyn, plaintiff, with his wife and new-born baby, were preparing for sleep. He was confronted at his front door by four armed uniformed police officers without a warrant seeking to enter his home. They had been directed to investigate a report of possible child abuse. He blocked their entry and, according to the officers' testimony, pushed one of the officers. They pushed him to the floor, handcuffed him, and, according to his testimony, beat him. The child was fine-the report of abuse came from a distraught relative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury faced a question repeatedly posed in today's society: what should the \"good citizen,\" and the \"good police officer,\" do in such a situation?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The jury found in favor of the defendants. Fee and cost assessments are now before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The fact that a plaintiff may ultimately lose his case is not in itself a sufficient justification for the assessment of fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes v.
