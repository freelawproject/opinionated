Wright, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this dispute arising from Defendants' temporary removal of Plaintiff Dwight D. Mitchell's children from his custody, Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' 25-count amended complaint. (Dkts. 15, 24.) For the reasons addressed below, the Court grants Defendants' motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are New Jersey residents Mitchell and his three children, X.M., A.M., and B.M. (collectively, the individual plaintiffs) and Stop Child Protection Services from Legally Kidnapping (SCPS), an association of parents who have been affected by Minnesota's child-protection services. The individual plaintiffs, along with Mitchell's then-wife Tatiana Litvinenko and her child, M.L., lived in Minnesota fromat least February 2014 to July 2014. Defendants are Dakota County, Dakota County Social Services (DCSS), nine Dakota County officials, and three State of Minnesota officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims arise from a February 16, 2014 incident in which police responded to a call from the Mitchell family's babysitter. The babysitter relayed to police X.M.'s allegations that Mitchell had inflicted corporal punishment on him. Police took the children from their home to the police station for questioning, where both X.M. and A.M. alleged that Mitchell had spanked them on prior occasions. County officials also reached out to Eva Campos, Mitchell's ex-wife and the biological mother of X.M., A.M., and B.M.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Campos alleged that Mitchell had abused the children, and she encouraged officials to pursue legal action against Mitchell in Minnesota, instead of in the children's home state of New Jersey. In response to Campos's allegations, DCSS removed X.M., A.M., and B.M. from Mitchell's custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Susan Boreland subsequently commenced a Child in Need of Protection or Services (CHIPS) proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mitchell accepted service of the CHIPS petition and attended an emergency protective hearing on February 26, 2014. In May 2014, Mitchell entered an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in response to a criminal charge for malicious punishment of a child. At a July 10, 2014 settlement conference for the CHIPS proceeding, Mitchell agreed to a court order prohibiting him from using corporal punishment in exchange for regaining physical custody of A.M. and B.M. On July 21, 2014, Mitchell and his family returned to New Jersey without X.M. On December 4, 2015, the state court dismissed the CHIPS petition against Mitchell. The following day, DCSS returned X.M. to Mitchell's custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege numerous instances of misconduct by Defendants between February 2014 and December 2015. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants were unlawfully motivated to separate Mitchell from his children, conspired to transfer custody to Mitchell's ex-wife, and made racially disparaging comments during their interactions with Mitchell.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants forced Litvinenko to move out of Mitchell's Minnesota house during the CHIPS proceeding, threatening that Litvinenko would lose custody of her child, M.L., if she did not leave. Finally, according to Plaintiffs, Defendants submitted unreliable accusations to the Minnesota court in the CHIPS proceeding and concealed a court order indicating that New Jersey-not Minnesota-was the proper jurisdiction for the CHIPS proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the present action, Plaintiffs' amended complaint alleges 25 counts against Defendants, including constitutional, federal, and state law claims. Counts 1 through 6, advanced by all plaintiffs, allege that several Minnesota child-protection statutes are facially unconstitutional because they are void for vagueness and violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The remaining 19 counts are advanced only by the individual plaintiffs. Counts 7 through 12 allege that the same Minnesota child-protection statutes challenged in Counts 1 through 6 are unconstitutional as applied to the individual plaintiffs. Counts 13 and\n   14 allege that Dakota County's policies caused civil rights violations. Counts 15 through 17 allege that state and county officials engaged in conspiracies to terminate Mitchell's parental rights. Counts 18 through 24 are state law claims, alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and false imprisonment. Count 25 is a request for declaratory relief against Dakota County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the amended complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). A defendant may challenge the plaintiff's complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction either on its face or on the factual truthfulness of its averments. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Titus v. Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11933354\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/4/590/#p593\">\n    4 F.3d 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593 (8th Cir. 1993). Here, Defendants assert a facial challenge to subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a facial challenge, the nonmoving party \"receives the same protections as it would defending against a motion brought under Rule 12(b)(6).\"\n   <em>\n    Osborn v.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the complaint must allege sufficient facts that, when accepted as true, state a facially plausible claim to relief.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

When determining whether the complaint states such a claim, a district court accepts as true all factual allegations in the complaint and draws all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    Blankenship v. USA Truck, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225274\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/852/#p853\">\n    601 F.3d 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 853 (8th Cir. 2010). The factual allegations need not be detailed, but they must be sufficient to \"raise a right to relief above the speculative level\" and \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl. Corp. v.

All of the alleged actions involve the exercise of the state and local officials' judgment. When investigating child-abuse accusations and making case-management decisions, state and local officials necessarily must balance the parents' interest in the care and management of their children with the state's interest in the welfare of children. Because the state-law claims implicate only discretionary functions, Minnesota has not waived the state or local officials' sovereign immunity to this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   For the reasons addressed above, this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over Counts 18 through 24, the tort claims asserted against Dakota County and the state and county officials in their official capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Common-Law Official Immunity for Individual-Capacity Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants argue that they are immune from personal liability for Counts 18 through 24 under the common-law doctrine of official immunity. The individual plaintiffs counter that such immunity has been statutorily waived because Defendants submitted false reports in the CHIPS proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Official immunity is a common-law doctrine that protects public officials from personal liability for state-law tort claims.\n   <em>\n    Mumm v.

Under Minnesota law, public officials are entitled to official immunity unless the plaintiff shows either that a public official failed to perform a ministerial duty, performed that duty negligently, or committed a willful or malicious wrong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schroeder v.

Malice is not present if a defendant's conduct (1) objectively was legally reasonable, (2) was performed in good faith, or (3) did not violate a \"clearly established\" right.\n   <em>\n    Gleason v. Metro. Council Transit Operations\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11982691\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/563/309/#p318\">\n    563 N.W.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 318 (Minn. Ct. App. 1997). As neither party argues that Defendants' conduct was ministerial, the question before the Court is whether the amended complaint alleges malicious conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   First, the allegations regarding Defendants' negligent investigation of accusations and Defendants' negligent training and supervision of social workers do not rise to the level of malicious behavior. These allegations invoke a negligence standard and are, by definition, not intentional. Because the malice exception to official immunity requires an intentional commission of an act, the amended complaint's allegations of negligence do not qualify for this exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, the amended complaint alleges that Defendants submitted unreliable accusations to the Minnesota court presiding over the CHIPS proceeding, pursued the CHIPS proceeding with the aim of terminating\n   Mitchell's parental rights, and removed Mitchell's children from his custody. These allegations fall short of malice because Defendants provide a basis for their actions that objectively is legally reasonable. Defendants assert that they commenced the CHIPS proceeding in furtherance of the state's well-established interest in protecting children and preventing child abuse. Indeed, Minnesota's child-protection statutes expressly contemplate that these proceedings may result in the removal of a child and termination of parental rights if it is in the child's best interests. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 260C.001. Therefore, Defendants' actions-pursuing a CHIPS proceeding and presenting to the state court the accusations against Mitchell-are grounded in an objectively, legally reasonable basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Third, the amended complaint alleges that, during the CHIPS proceeding, Defendants concealed documents relating to proper jurisdiction. This alleged act also does not qualify as malicious conduct. Mitchell had both access to these documents and the ability to present these documents to the Minnesota court. Moreover, as the amended complaint concedes, Mitchell presented these documents to the Minnesota court. It simply does not follow that Mitchell had a right, let alone a \"clearly established\" right, to have\n   <em>\n    Defendants\n   </em>\n   present this information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In summary, because all Defendants against whom the state-law claims were brought are entitled to immunity in their individual and official capacities, this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over Counts 18 through 24. Defendants' motions to dismiss Counts 18 through 24 are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Declaratory Relief (Count 25)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that Count 25's request for declaratory relief fails because there is no underlying cause of action on which to predicate the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA) gives courts \"within their respective jurisdictions\" the power to \"declare rights, status, and other legal relations.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20555.01\">\n    Minn.
