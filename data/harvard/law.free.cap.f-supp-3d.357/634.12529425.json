As set forth in the affidavit, the interview between federal law enforcement officials and Cooperator 3\n   took place on October 19, 2016. The officials then conducted their physical surveillance of 15269 Troester Street on October 20 and 21, 2016. The officials thereafter sought a search warrant on October 25, 2016, which was issued the same day. Thus, Baytops's assertion that \"all of the facts alleged in the affidavit were at least a month old at the time the search warrant was issued\" is not supported by the actual allegations in the affidavit.

For example, Baytops contends that the affidavit does not contain any information about him from the confidential informants, and that there is no corroborating information that he was engaged in drug trafficking at that location.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1200611\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/846/241/#p243\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    But as even a casual reader would gather from the affidavit, the focus of the law enforcement surveillance and subsequent search of the house was Richardson's purported narcotics trafficking.
