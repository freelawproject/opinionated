For the same reasons, the court sustains the Department's decision that the Shanghai Port Charges were double counted in the Department's calculation of a surrogate value for GTC's brokerage and handling and ocean freight expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    E. Issues Remaining in this Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Two issues remain undecided with respect to GTC's margin: (1) whether the deductions from EP and CEP starting prices for Chinese value-added tax were lawful, and (2) whether charges other than the Shanghai Port Charges were double counted in the Department's calculation of a surrogate value for brokerage and handling and international freight expenses. Only one issue remains undecided with respect to Double Coin: whether the court\n   should permit Commerce to reconsider the 0.14%\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   margin it assigned to Double Coin in the Remand Redetermination, due to the decision of the Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Diamond Sawblades\n   </em>\n   . The court addresses these three issues below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    1. Commerce Unlawfully Made Deductions from GTC's EP and CEP Starting Prices for Value-Added Tax\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In calculating export price or constructed export price of the subject merchandise, Commerce is directed by the Tariff Act to make certain additions to, and deductions from, the starting prices used for determining the \"U.S. price,\" i.e., either the export price or the constructed export price, of the subject merchandise. Some of these adjustments are made to achieve a \"tax neutral\" comparison between U.S. price and normal value. Among the upward tax-related adjustments, which reduce a dumping margin, are upward adjustments in U.S. price to account for import duties imposed by the country of exportation that have been rebated (i.e., duty drawback), or not collected, by reason of the exportation of the merchandise to the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 772(c)(1)(B) of the Tariff Act, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(1)(B). Such duties are added to the U.S. price to allow a tax-neutral comparison with the home market price of the foreign like product, which presumably includes import duties, such as duties on materials used in production in the exporting country. If the import duties are \"irrecoverable,\" i.e., not rebated or avoided by reason of the exportation, the duties presumably are included in the U.S. price, and no upward adjustment or downward adjustment is made, the price comparison already being tax-neutral. As explained below, the Tariff Act treats domestic value-added taxes of an exporting country in a way similar to its treatment of import duties imposed by an exporting country; i.e., a dumping margin potentially may be reduced for value-added taxes imposed on a finished good, or the materials used to produce it, if those taxes are refunded or avoided due to the exportation of the good. But under the statutory scheme, a domestic value-added tax, whether or not refunded or avoided by reason of the exportation of the finished good, does not increase a dumping margin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In contrast, a downward adjustment, which increases a dumping margin, generally is made to the U.S. price under the \"export tax\" provision, to adjust for an export tax, duty, or other charge imposed on the exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States, if included in the U.S. price. Section 772(c)(2)(B) of the Tariff Act, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B). A tax subject to this provision is presumed to be present in the price of the exported subject merchandise but, by definition, is not present in the price of the foreign like product in the home market.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The plain meaning of the provision illustrates this point. Section 772(c)(2)(B) directs Commerce to reduce the price used to establish EP and CEP by \"the amount, if included in such price, of any\n   <em>\n    export\n   </em>\n   tax, duty, or other charge imposed by the exporting country\n   <em>\n    on the exportation of the subject merchandise\n   </em>\n   to the United States, other than an export tax, duty, or other charge described in section 1677(6)(C) of this title.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added). In contrast, a domestic value-added tax\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   presumed to be included in the price of the subject merchandise\n   <em>\n    and also\n   </em>\n   in the price of the foreign like product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Therefore, the Tariff Act does not make a downward adjustment in U.S. price for a domestic value-added tax, as no such adjustment is necessary or appropriate to achieve tax-neutrality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Even though 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B), by its plain meaning, does not address taxes such as import duties or value-added taxes incurred by producers in the exporting country, Commerce resorted to this provision in the Final Results to make downward, i.e. margin-increasing, adjustments to the prices used for determining the U.S. price, i.e., the export price or constructed export price, of GTC's subject merchandise. Commerce made these downward adjustments for irrecoverable value-added taxes included in the prices of materials used to make GTC's subject merchandise.\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 28. Commerce erroneously reasoned that \"irrecoverable\" VAT, by which it meant VAT not rebated by reason of exportation of the finished good, \"amounts to\" an \"export tax, duty or other charge imposed on exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States\" within the meaning of that term as used in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted) (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   There is no record evidence in this case demonstrating that China imposed on the subject merchandise an export tax or anything resembling one. The record shows that the PRC value-added tax is incurred by an OTR tire producer in the PRC by the inclusion of this tax in the prices of materials used in domestic production, regardless of whether the finished tire is sold for domestic consumption or export. It also shows that at least some of that tax is rebated, refunded, or avoided if the tire is sold for export. The fact that a domestic value-added tax incurred on materials used in producing OTR tires in China might not be fully refunded by reason of exportation of the finished tire does not convert any unrefunded portion of such a tax from a domestic value-added tax into an export tax. In other words, irrecoverable VAT is still VAT, not an export tax. When reduced to its basics, the rationale Commerce adopted in the Final Results appears to have been that irrecoverable value-added tax, which is a domestic tax incurred on materials used in production in the exporting country, somehow becomes an export tax simply because it is irrecoverable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In the Remand Redetermination, Commerce decided that its deductions from GTC's U.S. prices, as effected in the Final Results, were correct and should be maintained in the Remand Redetermination.\n   <em>\n    Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   12. This decision is contrary to the record evidence and the intent Congress expressed in the Tariff Act. Whether recoverable or not, a domestic value-added tax is not properly the subject of a downward, margin-increasing adjustment under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In contesting the Final Results, GTC claimed,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the Department's deductions from U.S. price were unauthorized by the plain language of the statute.\n   <em>\n    CMA I\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201325\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d at 1344-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Qingdao Qihang\n   </em>\n   , 42 CIT at ----, 308 F.Supp.3d at 1338-47, this Court analyzed the plain meaning, statutory history, and legislative history of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B).\n   <em>\n    Qingdao Qihang\n   </em>\n   concluded that Congress, in enacting that and related provisions in the Tariff Act, intended that a domestic value-added tax imposed by an exporting country on subject merchandise or the materials used to produce it, whether or not \"recoverable\" by reason of exportation of the subject merchandise, would not increase a dumping margin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the opinion explained that the application of \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) does not depend on whether or not the exporting country is treated by Commerce as a nonmarket economy country, as are China and Vietnam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Qingdao Qihang\n   </em>\n   opinion noted that Congress, when enacting 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c) and its related provisions, addressed the precise question of how a domestic tax such as a value-added tax, imposed by the exporting country directly upon an exported good or the components used to produce that good, would affect a dumping margin. The court pointed out that Congress intended that VAT avoided or refunded by reason of exportation of the subject merchandise, i.e., \"recoverable\" VAT, would have the potential to reduce a dumping margin. It explained that prior to the enactment of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (\"URAA\"), the Tariff Act contained a provision that potentially increased U.S. price by the amount of recoverable VAT, thereby reducing a dumping margin, while the export tax provision, in the ordinary instance, would increase a dumping margin.\n   <em>\n    Qingdao Qihang\n   </em>\n   , 42 CIT at ----, 308 F.Supp.3d at 1340-41. The former increased U.S. price (and thereby reduced a dumping margin) by \"the amount of any taxes imposed in the country of exportation directly upon the exported merchandise or components thereof, which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, by reason of the exportation of the merchandise to the United States, but only to the extent that such taxes are added to or included in the price of such or similar merchandise when sold\n   in the country of exportation.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(d)(1)(C) (1982). The provision generally was understood to apply to recoverable value-added tax imposed by the country of exportation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Federal-Mogul Corp. v.

It noted that Congress used distinctly different language in the export tax provision than it used in the provision addressing recoverable domestic taxes (such as VAT taxes) that are imposed by the exporting country directly on the exported subject merchandise or the materials used to produce it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Congress, therefore, could not have intended that a VAT tax imposed directly upon an exported good or the components thereof, which it addressed in the domestic tax provision, would also fall within the scope of the export tax provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Qingdao Qihang\n   </em>\n   opinion further explained that after enactment of the URAA, the statute converted the upward adjustment to U.S. price for recoverable VAT to a downward adjustment in normal value, whether determined by price in the comparison market or by constructed value, thereby again providing that recoverable VAT, in the ordinary instance, would lower a dumping margin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT at ----, 308 F.Supp.3d at 1339-44. The opinion went on to discuss that under the URAA, goods exported from NME countries do not get the benefit of the lowering of the margin for recoverable VAT because normal value in those proceedings ordinarily is determined by the special procedures of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c), not by home market price or by constructed value.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT at ----, 308 F.Supp.3d at 1344-46.

The opinion explained that in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B), which pertains to U.S. price, not normal value, Congress made no distinction between market economy and nonmarket economy countries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT at ----, 308 F.Supp.3d at 1344-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Jiangsu Senmao Bamboo and Wood Indus.

Commerce stated in the Final Issues and Decision Memorandum as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   In a typical VAT system, companies do not incur any VAT expense; they receive on export a full rebate of the VAT they pay on purchases of inputs used in the production of exports (\"input VAT\"), and, in the case of domestic sales, the company can credit the VAT they pay on input purchases for those sales against the VAT they collect from customers. That stands in contrast to the PRC's VAT regime, where some portion of the input VAT that a company pays on purchases of inputs used in the production of exports is not refunded. This amounts to a tax, duty, or other charge imposed on exports\n   <em>\n    that is not imposed on domestic sales\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 28 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted). The Issues and Decision Memorandum cited no factual basis for its finding that Chinese irrecoverable VAT \"amounts to\" a tax, duty, or other charge imposed on exports \"that is not imposed on domestic sales,\" and the Remand Redetermination is also defective in this respect. There is no record evidence that could support such a finding, and it is hard to imagine that there could be such evidence. If all value-added tax incurred on domestic sales were \"recoverable,\" then it would appear that the taxation scheme would produce no revenue for the government on domestic sales, defeating the purpose of a VAT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Remand Redetermination relies on a finding that \"[i]n this case, the record demonstrates that the Chinese VAT system can result in companies [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] having un-refunded or irrecoverable VAT, in which some portion of the VAT that a company pays on purchases of inputs used in the production of exports of subject merchandise is not refunded,\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   9. This reliance is misplaced. A value-added tax that a domestic producer incurs on its domestic sales but does not avoid entirely on its export sales is not the same as a tax, duty, or charge imposed on the exportation of the good. In\n   the Remand Redetermination, as in the Final Results, the Department's illogical rationale appears to be that for purposes of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B), irrecoverable Chinese VAT is an \"export tax, duty, or other charge\" that is \"imposed by the exporting country on the exportation\" of the good simply because it is irrecoverable. See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. Commerce emphasizes the term \"charge\" as used in the statutory phrase \"export tax, duty, or other charge,\" noting the lack of a statutory definition, and claims entitlement to \"deference\" for its \"reasonable\" interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9 (\" '[E]xport tax, duty, or other charges' includes 'a cost that arises as the result of export sales,' consistent with other cases interpreting the word 'charges.' \") (footnote omitted). But the question of whether Chinese value-added tax is a \"tax\" or, alternatively, some form of \"other charge\" is not the question posed by this case. To the contrary, the question is whether the Department's statutory interpretation is reasonable. Because it contravenes the plain meaning, statutory history, and legislative history of \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B), it is not. An agency interpretation that disregards the clearly expressed intent of Congress is not a reasonable one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In summary, Congress had a specific intent with respect to VAT imposed by an exporting country on subject merchandise or the materials used to produce it. Congress did not intend that irrecoverable VAT, i.e., VAT that was not refunded or avoided by reason of exportation of the good, would increase a dumping margin (although it did intend that\n   <em>\n    recoverable\n   </em>\n   VAT, in some circumstances not present here, could reduce a dumping margin). In addition, Commerce erred in finding, without any evidentiary support, that Chinese irrecoverable VAT is a tax not imposed on the domestic good. In its redetermination in response to this Opinion and Order, Commerce must take the appropriate corrective action to remove from the calculation of GTC's margin its downward EP and CEP adjustments for VAT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Commerce concluded in the draft results that of the eight costs, all but two-cost (3), \"AMS Charge,\" and cost (5), \"Chassis Usage Charges\"-were double counted, having \"appeared in both ocean freight and shipping and handling charges.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Commerce removed the other six costs from the ocean freight cost calculation. Commerce reasoned that the \"AMS Charge\" referred to the cost of providing manifest information to U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the Automated Manifest System (\"AMS\") and, accordingly, \"are necessarily charged by the freight forwarder and not a port charge covered by\n   <em>\n    Doing Business.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.

The effect of this change was to increase the 11.24% margin for GTC determined in the draft remand redetermination to 11.33%.\n   <em>\n    Compare Draft Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   16-17,\n   <em>\n    with Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   39-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Commerce, relying on information submitted during the remand proceeding by the petitioner, concluded that four of the costs in question were related to activities in the United States occurring after ocean transport and therefore were not included in the brokerage and handling costs covered by the\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   report. These were cost (2), the Traffic Mitigation Fee, cost (3), the Chassis Usage Charges, cost (5), ISD Handling Charges, and cost (7), the \"Clean Truck Fee.\"\n   <em>\n    See Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   15-17. Commerce found that the Chassis Usage Charges were \"additional charges for renting the chassis to support and transport full container loads transported via ocean freight at the destination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (footnote omitted). It concluded that the ISD handling Charges \"are not related to on-ocean services, but rather are charged by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) for inspection of cargo entering the United States\" and therefore are \"not covered by\n   <em>\n    Doing Business.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (footnote omitted). Commerce added that the Traffic Mitigation Fee and Clean Truck Fee \"are not expenses related to on-ocean services, but, rather, are post-ocean pass-through fees specific to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In commenting on the Department's draft remand redetermination, GTC objected that the costs Commerce associated with post-ocean transport are more appropriately valued under U.S. inland truck freight,\n   <em>\n    see Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   35-36, and GTC renews that objection before the court, GTC's Comments 15-16. GTC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   argues that \"Commerce refused to exclude costs that it found related to services undertaken in the United States based on a technicality: 'the scope of the remand permits the Department only the discretion to evaluate fees potentially double counted with the surrogate for PRC brokerage and handling.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (\n   <em>\n    quoting Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   37 n.174). The Remand Redetermination also gave a second reason for rejecting the argument that the costs Commerce associated with post-ocean transport were not double counted: \"Regardless, the use of a 'fully loaded' international freight SV [surrogate value] renders this question moot.\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   37 n.174. The court finds both of these reasons unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Commerce was not precluded by\n   <em>\n    CMA I\n   </em>\n   from considering whether alleged double counting occurred between the brokerage and handling surrogate value and the ocean freight costs. Commerce reopened the record during the remand proceeding, accepted new information during that proceeding and, following its issuance of its draft for comment by the parties, changed its position on most of the costs it determined to have been double counted in the draft, based on the new record information. Because the Department's latest decision on double counting raises a new issue, GTC must be given the opportunity to object to the Department's new determination on double counting, which stemmed from the new information Commerce admitted to the record. Accordingly, Commerce must consider GTC's objection that four cost categories (i.e., cost (2), the \"Traffic Mitigation Fee,\" cost (3), the \"Chassis Usage Charges,\" cost (5), \"ISD Handling Charges,\" and cost (7), the \"Clean Truck Fee\") appear to overlap with domestic transportation costs that would be included in the prices reflected by the Descartes price lists Commerce used to calculate GTC's U.S. inland freight costs.\n   <em>\n    See Prelim. Surrogate Value Mem.\n   </em>\n   16, Attach. X (explaining that Commerce added U.S. inland freight costs-based on the Descartes price lists-to ocean freight costs to calculate \"a total freight value for shipments entering through both East and West coast ports\"). Commerce has not reached a valid determination that the cost categories GTC identified as double counted are separate from charges incurred during inland transportation in the United States, and it cannot be permitted to avoid this obligation by citing what it narrowly considered to be the scope of the court's order in\n   <em>\n    CMA I\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The second reason Commerce gave-that the Department's international freight surrogate value was a \"fully loaded\" cost-is not adequately demonstrated.\n   <em>\n    See Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   12-13, 17. Commerce stated that the \"international freight surrogate value did not encompass only ocean freight, but also all post-exportation expenses incurred to deliver the merchandise to the unaffiliated customer (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , ocean freight, U.S. inland freight charges, U.S. brokerage and handling expenses, etc.) - a 'fully-loaded' transportation charge.\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   12-13 (footnote omitted). But in its Remand Redetermination, Commerce failed to explain why certain \"ocean freight\" charges identified in the Descartes quotes were not accounted for again in the \"U.S. inland freight\" charges, which were derived from separate Descartes price lists.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Commerce found that the \" 'Automated Manifest System (AMS) Charge,' 'Chassis Usage Charges,' 'ISPS- Int'l Ship and Port Security Charges,' 'ISD Handling Charges,' 'Traffic Mitigation Fee,' 'CTF- Clean Truck Fee,' and 'Documentation Charges' are unique to ocean freight\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   activities at the U.S. destination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (emphasis added). If any of these \"ocean freight\" costs also are encompassed\n   by the \"U.S. inland freight\" costs, it would appear that they were double counted in the Department's \"fully loaded transportation charge\" calculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Commerce engaged in a complex calculation, and used multiple sources of data, to determine the transportation-related and logistics-related costs for deduction under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(A). That provision requires Commerce to determine the \"additional costs, charges, or expenses ... which are incident to bringing the subject merchandise from the original place of shipment in the exporting country to the place of delivery in the United States.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(A). It must do so as accurately as possible based on the record information. On remand, therefore, Commerce must review and reconsider all aspects of its determination that only one cost identified by GTC was double counted and may not rely on its narrow conception of the scope of the court's previous order of remand to refuse to consider whether costs were double counted. In summary, Commerce must ensure that no costs are double counted either as between (1) brokerage and handling (based on the\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   report) and ocean freight (based on the Descartes quotes), or (2) ocean freight (based on the Descartes quotes) and U.S. inland freight (based on the Descartes price lists).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Those arguments, as recounted in its opposition to the remand motion, were that: (1) Commerce lacked authority to issue a \"country-wide\" rate such as the PRC-wide rate, being limited by the statute to assigning individual margins and an all-others rate, (2) the Department's presumption of government control in China is no longer valid given the changes in China to the underlying factual basis that previously gave rise to that presumption, and (3) in this case,\n   Double Coin rebutted the presumption of government control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The court will deny the motion for a partial remand. Were the court to grant the motion, upon reconsideration the only rate Commerce reasonably could assign the PRC-wide entity on the record of the fifth review would be the 0.14% rate Commerce assigned Double Coin in the Remand Redetermination. This result obtains under the relevant holding in\n   <em>\n    Diamond Sawblades\n   </em>\n   , as discussed below. Because Commerce has requested to reconsider only the rate it assigned Double Coin, and not the 105.31% rate assigned to the entire PRC-wide entity that Commerce left unchanged in the Remand Redetermination, no purpose would be served by granting defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   One of the holdings of\n   <em>\n    Diamond Sawblades\n   </em>\n   bears directly on this case and is intervening legal authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SKF USA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11092549\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/1022/#p1028\">\n    254 F.3d at 1028-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that an agency may seek remand in order to consider new legal decisions).\n   <em>\n    Diamond Sawblades\n   </em>\n   holds that the Tariff Act allows Commerce to assign the rate it assigns to the PRC-wide entity to a cooperative respondent it selected as a mandatory respondent, provided the respondent fails to rebut the Department's presumption of control by the government of the PRC.\n   <em>\n    Diamond Sawblades\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275745\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/1304/\">\n    866 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1313 &amp; n.6.

That is not the case with the margin to be determined for GTC, which Commerce found not to be part of the PRC-wide entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The holding of\n   <em>\n    Thuan An\n   </em>\n   is one reason for the court's conclusion that only the 0.14% rate could be assigned to the PRC-wide entity. But there is another reason as well:\n   <em>\n    Thuan An\n   </em>\n   aside, the 0.14% rate is the only rate that reasonably could be applied to the PRC-wide entity according to the particular facts of the fifth review, whether or not the court holds that the rate to be assigned to the PRC-wide entity is required by statute to be an individual rate. Commerce explained that the PRC-wide entity consisted of Double Coin and any other exporter \"that has not established its eligibility for a separate rate\" by demonstrating independence from \"government control and influence.\"\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 10. But in the fifth review, no Chinese exporter or producer of OTR tires other than Double Coin was in a position to be determined to be part of the PRC-wide entity, with the result that the record contained no information on any part of the PRC-wide entity except for Double Coin. The administrative record for the fifth review confirms this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Initiation Notice\n   </em>\n   , Commerce announced that it initiated a review of five Chinese producers or exporters of OTR tires: Double Coin, GTC, Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber Co., Ltd.

Thus, the Department explicitly put the PRC-wide entity and all other interested parties on notice that the PRC-wide entity would be reviewed if one of the named exporters did not qualify for a separate rate. Thus, pursuant to Double Coin's failure to demonstrate a lack of\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   government control, the PRC-wide entity is subject to review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (footnote omitted). Although Commerce conceded that that the record contained no information \"with respect to the composition of the PRC-wide entity,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and although Double Coin was the only producer or exporter Commerce identified as a member of the PRC-wide entity, Commerce nevertheless seemed to imply that Double Coin was not the only reviewed exporter or producer the PRC-wide entity included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Having not demonstrated the absence of\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   control from the government over selection of its management, Double Coin constitutes a part of the PRC-wide entity.

The record does not support any such implication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As Double Coin argued in the review,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, and argues before the court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Double Coin's Br. 54-55, Commerce never requested any information from the government of the PRC or from any part of the PRC-wide entity other than Double Coin. In explaining the Final Results, Commerce did not dispute that in conducting the fifth review it did not request such information.\n   <em>\n    See Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 14. In its brief in response to this argument in Double Coin's Rule 56.2 motion, defendant does not dispute that in conducting the fifth review Commerce never requested information from the PRC government or from any other exporter or producer Commerce potentially could have deemed to be part of it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Response to Mots. for J. on the Admin. R. 39-40 (Dec. 7, 2015), ECF No. 60 (\"Def.'s Br.\"). As a factual matter, only four exporters or producers of OTR tires specifically were included in the fifth review: two were cooperating mandatory respondents and the other two were unexamined respondents (and were assigned GTC's margin). Therefore, if the PRC-wide entity can be presumed to include any exporters or producers of OTR tires other than Double Coin, they cannot be identified and do not appear in the record of the review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In opposing Double Coin's Rule 56.2 motion, defendant points out that \"Commerce did not preclude a company from participating in this review, nor did it preclude a company from seeking a review of a part of the PRC-wide entity.\" Def.'s Resp. 39;\n   <em>\n    see Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 14. This argument does not address the problem posed by the limited record evidence. That one or more additional Chinese exporters or producers\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have participated in the review, and, had they done so, might have been found to be part of the PRC-wide entity, does not change the record fact that none actually did. As a result, the only record information relevant to determining a rate for the PRC-wide entity was the information pertinent to Double Coin. Commerce acknowledged that the record lacked any information on the non-Double Coin portion of the PRC-wide entity: \"[t]he Department must calculate a single rate for the PRC-wide entity, and in this review, we do not have the necessary information,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , sales and production data, from the remaining unspecified portion of the PRC-wide entity.\"\n   <em>\n    Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   When \"necessary information is not available on the record\" and there is no failure to cooperate, Commerce may resort to \"facts otherwise available\" without an adverse inference (to which information Commerce refers as \"neutral\" facts otherwise available).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a). Here, the only information on the record that reasonably could serve as facts otherwise available for determining a rate for the PRC-wide entity is Double Coin's information. While it might be argued that it would be reasonable for Commerce to use information pertinent to GTC for this purpose, this argument would be unconvincing for the reason the court mentioned earlier. While both sets of data pertain to the current (fifth) review, Double Coin's information is representative of the PRC-wide entity while the information of GTC, which Commerce excluded from the PRC-wide entity, is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In conclusion, the only rate supported by the record evidence that Commerce reasonably could apply to the PRC-wide entity-and therefore to Double Coin-were the court to grant the requested partial remand, would be one equivalent to the 0.14% margin Commerce already determined for Double Coin in the Remand Redetermination. Because Commerce assigned that rate to Double Coin in the Remand Redetermination and does not seek to reconsider the 105.31% rate it assigned to the PRC-wide entity (except with respect to Double Coin), granting defendant's motion for a partial remand would serve no purpose. The court, therefore, must deny this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

But as the court has discussed, it would not be permissible for Commerce to assign an AFA-based rate to the PRC-wide entity in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    This is in contrast to the review at issue in\n    <em>\n     Diamond Sawblades\n    </em>\n    , in which 21 companies in addition to ATM were specifically included in the PRC-wide entity.\n    <em>\n     Diamond Sawblades\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275745\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/1304/\">\n     866 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1309 n.2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
