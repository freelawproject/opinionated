Defendants ask the Court to dismiss Plaintiff Cynthia Harvey's class action complaint alleging breach of contract and violation of the Consumer Protection Act (\"CPA\"), chapter 19.86 of the Revised Code of Washington (\"RCW\"). ECF No. 48. Harvey, a purchaser of Defendants' Ambetter health insurance policy, claims Defendants \"misrepresented and made material omissions regarding the coverage actually provided by [their] Ambetter policy, which did not deliver the insurance services for which the [Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner] approved [the] filed rates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Defendants argue Harvey fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For the following reasons, the Court grants the motion in part and denies it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 29, 2018, Harvey filed a Second Amended Complaint on behalf of herself and a putative class of Ambetter policyholders alleging Defendants breached their contracts and violated the CPA by misrepresenting and making material omissions regarding the coverage actually provided by their Ambetter policy, which did not deliver the insurance services for which the Insurance Commissioner approved the premiums.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The complaint alleges Defendants \"target low-income customers who qualify for substantial government subsidies while simultaneously providing coverage well below both what is required by law and what [they] represent[ ] to customers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. \"[T]he provider network [Defendants] represented was available to Ambetter policyholders was in material measure, if not largely, fictitious. Members have difficulty finding - and in many cases cannot find - medical providers who will accept Ambetter insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants \"misrepresent[ ] the number, location, and existence of purported providers by listing physicians, medical groups, and other providers - some of whom have specifically asked to be removed - as participants in their network and by listing nurses and other non-physicians as primary care providers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Defendants have even copied entire physician directories into their purported network lists for some areas, and have, in fact, listed medical students as part of their primary care provider network.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants \"listed those providers as being part of their network even though those providers were not actually part of the provider network for Ambetter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The complaint alleges \"Defendants fail to disclose the true limitations of the coverage provided by its Ambetter policies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. \"Defendants' sales materials omit the fact that [they] do[ ] not adequately monitor their network of providers. The Ambetter documentation also fails to disclose that [Defendants] do[ ] not consistently provide access to 'medically necessary care on a reasonable basis' without charging for out-of-network services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, \"Defendants routinely deny coverage for medical services, claiming that the provider did not show sufficient diagnostic evidence that the care was necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. \"As a result of [Defendants] failing to pay providers for legitimate claims, a large number of medical providers reject Ambetter insurance, further reducing the provider network available to Ambetter's members.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. \"Defendants' provider network was and is so limited that holders of Ambetter policies would have to travel long distances to see a medical provider, if one legitimately within Defendants' network could be found at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Harvey purchased Defendants' Ambetter policy in December 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. In doing so, Harvey relied in part on Defendants' Ambetter plan brochure and plan summary.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22. These documents represent that the healthcare providers listed in Defendants' online directory are in network.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The documents \"also purport to describe generally what services are covered and what are not, but are misleading by failing to indicate how few in-network providers would be available.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. \"For example, they indicate that emergency room services would be covered, although out-of-network charges might be incurred for out-of-network providers working in an otherwise covered emergency room. They fail to disclose, however, that in the Spokane area, during 2017, they had zero emergency room physicians who were in-network.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Because Defendants failed to disclose that the limitations of the network coverage actually provided by the Ambetter policy fell far short of what they represented, Plaintiff ... was forced to incur a charge of $1,544 for treatment received from an emergency room doctor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants also failed to cover individual elements of Harvey's healthcare visits because they were out of network.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"For example, Plaintiff ... received services from a covered doctor on March 17, 2017, but then received a bill from the lab used by that doctor. Similarly, Plaintiff ..., who has been identified as high risk for colorectal cancer, was advised by Coordinated Care to get a colonoscopy. Colonoscopies are within the preventive services required by the [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act] to be included in coverage and are identified as covered in [Defendants'] Preventive Care brochure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. \"When she got the colonoscopy from a covered doctor, however, her claims for two of the technicians involved in the procedure were denied.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Harvey used Defendants' grievance and appeal process for each denial of coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. \"In many cases, her appeal was ultimately successful, indicating that the initial denial of her claims was invalid. However, she was forced to complete the process of appeal, while providers were sending her bills and deeming her a credit risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Putative class members \"have had similar experiences, as admitted by Defendants in their May 17, 2018 letter to policyholders.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   One putative class member \"attempted to schedule an appointment with someone listed as a primary care physician on the provider network, only to find out that the person was a nurse practitioner\" while \"[a]nother person listed as a physician provider was a medical student.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24. Another putative class member \"is a 60-year-old widow with medical issues\" who \"has consistently encountered difficulties with finding a medical provider willing to accept the Ambetter plan,\" which means \"[s]he has to drive extraordinary distances to find a provider within Ambetter's network, an ordeal which can be insurmountable given her medical condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The complaint alleges that, on December 12, 2017, the Insurance Commissioner ordered Coordinated Care to stop selling the 2018 Ambetter policy, finding \"sufficient evidence to indicate that the Company failed to monitor its network of providers, failed to report its inadequate network to the Insurance Commissioner, and failed to file a timely alternative access delivery request to ensure that consumers receive access to healthcare providers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. \"The Insurance Commissioner intervened after receiving over 100 consumer complaints regarding a lack of doctors in the Ambetter policy network and other deficiencies and after doing its own investigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. The Insurance Commissioner declared \"Coordinated Care is legally required to provide access to 'medically necessary care on a reasonable basis' without charging for out-of-network services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. And the Insurance Commissioner ordered Coordinated Care to \"no longer send customers 'surprise' bills, including charges for out-of-network care.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Harvey alleges Defendants breached their insurance contracts by \"failing to provide accurate information regarding their provider networks, failing to provide a sufficient network of providers, denying valid claims, failing to pay providers for valid claims, and collecting premiums while failing to provide an adequate network of providers that included emergency room physicians, labs used by in network providers and the like.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. Harvey alleges she and the putative class \"suffered damages as a direct and proximate result of Defendants' breach of contract, consisting of all of the amount of the premiums they paid as well as the amounts they paid pursuant to improper billings by Defendants and expenses incurred in seeking or obtaining medical services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Harvey alleges Defendants engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in conducting its insurance business by \"failing to have sufficient providers within the Ambetter network as represented, ... failing to pay legitimate medical claims on behalf of their insured, ... failing to provide the benefits and coverage represented by Defendants to be within the plan, ... failing to address Plaintiff's ... complaints, ... violating [applicable statutes and regulations], and ... omitting material facts regarding the benefits and coverage of Ambetter policies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. Harvey alleges \"[a]s a direct and proximate result of Defendants' unfair acts or practices, Plaintiff and Class members suffered injury in fact by paying insurance premiums but failing to receive benefits, paying out-of-pocket costs for services covered but not provided by the Ambetter plan, and spending time and money locating and traveling to providers willing to accept the Ambetter plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For each claim, Harvey seeks compensatory or actual damages equal to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   i.

[is] not challenging the reasonableness of the rates filed with the Insurance Commissioner. Had [Defendants] actually delivered the insurance services for which its filed rates were approved by the [Insurance Commissioner], Plaintiff ... would not assert a claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The complaint alleges both Centene Management and Coordinated Care are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Centene Corporation, which is not a defendant to this civil action. ECF No. 48 at 2-4. Under a management services agreement between them, Centene Management \"effectuates, controls and handles the operations\" of\n   Coordinated Care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Specifically, Centene Management \"provides the services necessary to manage the business operations\" of Coordinated Care and \"assumes responsibility for program planning and development, management information systems, financial systems and services, claims administration, provider and enrollee services and records, case management, care coordination, utilization and peer review, and quality assurance/quality improvement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"To all intents and purposes the activities of Coordinated Care have been abdicated to Centene [Management] ... which entirely controls the activities of Coordinated Care.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Coordinated Care is \"a shell and alter ego\" of Centene Management, and the two \"operate so in concert and together in a common enterprise and through related activities so that the actions of one may be imputed to the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss Harvey's complaint on September 12, 2018. ECF No. 50. Harvey responded in opposition to the motion and Defendants replied in support of it. ECF Nos. 56, 58.

For breach of contract, the goal of compensatory damages is \"not a mere restoration to a former position, as in tort, but the awarding of a sum which is the equivalent of performance of the bargain-the attempt to place the plaintiff in the position he would be in if the contract had been fulfilled.\"\n   <em>\n    Rathke v.

Thus, regardless of labels, a full refund of health insurance premiums could be a proper measure of damages to the extent it is less than or equal to the contract expectancy. But Harvey has not alleged such facts here. Therefore, the Court concludes that, for Harvey's breach-of-contract claim, the proper measure of compensatory damages based on the benefit-of-the-bargain rule is a sum equivalent to performance of the contract that places Harvey and the putative class in the position they would occupy if Coordinated Care had fulfilled the contract rather than breached it. Harvey shall amend the complaint to make this correction no later than November 30, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, Coordinated Care argues it lacks notice of what damages it allegedly caused because Harvey's theories of damages leave \"undefined\" exactly what premiums were paid and what out-of-pocket expenses were incurred. ECF No. 50 at 18. Coordinated Care is incorrect. Construing the complaint in the light most favorable to Harvey and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor, the Court concludes she alleges a facially plausible breach-of-contract claim. Moreover, the Court concludes Harvey bases this claim on viable theories of damages that are familiar under Washington state law-compensatory damages equal to the benefit of the bargain had the contract not been breached, the difference between the contract price and the reduced value of the services received, or the out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a result of the breach. Harvey need not allege precise figures of premiums paid and out-of-pocket expenses incurred for Coordinated Care to receive fair notice of what damages it allegedly caused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Considering all, the Court concludes Harvey states an adequate breach-of-contract claim against Coordinated Care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Second Amended Complaint,\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 50\n   </strong>\n   , is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The breach-of-contract claim against Centene Management Company LLC is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   For the breach-of-contract claim against Coordinated Care Corporation, the\n   <strong>\n    proper measure\n   </strong>\n   of compensatory damages based on the benefit-of-the-bargain rule is a sum equivalent to performance of the contract that places the injured party in the position he or she would occupy if the contract had been fulfilled rather than breached.
