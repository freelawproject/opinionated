INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 26, 2017, Plaintiff Kristopher Gordon filed this shareholder derivative action, on behalf of nominal Defendant Banc of California (\"Banc\"), for breach of fiduciary duty against Defendants Robert D. Sznewajs, Halle J. Benett, Jonah Schnel, and Jeffrey Karish. (Dkt. 1 [Complaint].) Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint, (Dkt. 31), and thereafter the parties stipulated to allow Plaintiff to file an amended complaint in lieu of the Court ruling on the motion to dismiss, (Dkts. 38, 39). On February 6, 2018, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), asserting three causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and gross negligence. (Dkt. 41 [FAC].) Plaintiff names all of the same Defendants and three additional Defendants: John Grosvenor, Richard J. Lashley, and Douglas H. Bowers (together, \"Individual Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court is Banc's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's FAC. (Dkt. 55 [hereinafter \"Mot.\"].) Also before the Court are the Individual Defendants' motions to dismiss, which assert alternative grounds to dismiss the FAC, (Dkts. 56, 60), as well as a motion to strike certain allegations in the FAC, (Dkt. 58). For the following reasons, Banc's motion is GRANTED, and the other pending motions are DENIED as moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is a current shareholder of Banc. (FAC \u00b6 20.) Banc is a Maryland corporation with its principal place of business in Santa Ana, California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Banc had nine directors (\"the Directors\" or \"the Board\") when Plaintiff filed this action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145.) Plaintiff named six of the Directors as Individual Defendants: (1) Robert D. Sznewajs, a director since 2013 and Chair of the Board of Directors since January 2017, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22), (2), Halle J. Benett, a director since 2013, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23), (3) Jonah Schnel, a director since 2013, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24), (4) Jeffrey Karish, a director since 2011, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25), (5) Richard J. Lashley, a director since February 2017, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26), and (6) Douglas H. Bowers, a director and CEO since May 2017, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27). John Grosvenor has been Banc's General Counsel and Corporate Secretary since August 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Three of Banc's current Directors are not named as defendants in this action-Kirk Wycoff, Mary Curran, and Bonnie G. Hill. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 18, 2016,\n   <em>\n    SeekingAlpha\n   </em>\n   .com published a blog post written by an anonymous blogger entitled \"BANC: Extensive Ties To Notorious Fraudster Jason Galanis\n   Make Shares Un-Investable,\" (\"the Aurelius Blog\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43; Dkt. 55-3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"opinion\" piece alleged a web of relationships between Galanis, Banc's then-CEO Steven Sugarman, and Banc's then-Lead Independent Director Chad Brownstein. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 43-54.) The blog post also referred to Schnel, Karish, Benett, and Sznewajs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Later that day, Banc issued a press release in response to the Aurelius Blog (\"October 2016 Press Release\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56; Dkt. 55-4.) The October 2016 Press Release stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Company's Board of Directors has been aware of matters relating to Jason Galanis including certain claims he had made suggesting an affiliation with members of the Company, its Board, and/or its Executive team. The Board, acting through its Disinterested Directors, immediately initiated a thorough independent investigation led by Winston &amp; Strawn, and has received regular reports including related to regulatory and governmental communications over the past year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (FAC \u00b6 56; Dkt. 55-4 at 31.) The press release also stated that \"Banc of California and its Disinterested Directors will make further facts publicly available as appropriate.\" (FAC \u00b6 56.) On October 19, 2016, Banc filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), with a copy of the October 2016 press release attached. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) Also on October 19, 2016, Grosvenor reiterated several statements from the October 2016 Press Release on a conference call with investors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 27, 2016, the Directors formed a Special Committee consisting of Sznewajs, Schnel, Karish, Benett, and Eric Holoman, a former director, to investigate the allegations in the Aurelius Blog. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-62, 64-65.) On October 30, 2016, the Special Committee retained WilmerHale, an outside law firm, to conduct an independent investigation to address certain issues raised by the Aurelius Blog and a letter sent to Banc by KPMG, Banc's independent auditor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61, 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Subsequently, on January 23, 2017, Banc issued a press release stating that, \"[w]hile certain work remains to be completed, to date WilmerHale's inquiry has not found any violation of law. In addition, contrary to the claims in the blog post, the inquiry has not found evidence that Jason Galanis has any direct or indirect control or undue influence over the Company,\" (\"January 2017 Press Release\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67; Dkt. 55-5 at 32.) The January 2017 Press Release also stated that the Special Committee had determined that the October 2016 Press Release \"contained inaccurate statements,\" including: (1) the investigation was \"not initiated by the Board of Directors,\" but rather, \"by Company management,\" (2) the October 2016 Press Release \"characterized the investigation as 'independent' without disclosing that the law firm conducting the investigation had previously\n   represented both the Company and the Company's CEO individually,\" and (3) the statement that \"the Board or a group of 'Disinterested Directors' had received 'regular reports including related to regulatory and governmental communications' ... overstated both the degree to which the Company had been in contact with regulatory agencies about the subject matter referenced in the blog post, as well as the involvement of the directors in oversight or direction of the inquiry.\" (FAC \u00b6 67.) The January 2017 Press Release also disclosed that the SEC had \"issued a formal order of investigation directed at certain of the issues that the Special Committee is reviewing,\" and had served a subpoena on Banc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 9, 2017, Banc issued another press release announcing WilmerHale's final report to the Special Committee, which \"confirmed its earlier conclusion that the inquiry has not found any violation of law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.) The investigation also concluded that \"Galanis had no indirect or direct control or undue influence over [Banc],\" and that \"no loans or related party transactions had impaired the independence of any director.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 55-6 at 34.) In this same time period, Sugarman resigned from all positions at Banc, Holoman and Brownstein left Banc, and other senior personnel left or were terminated. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 68, 73-75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The FAC also contains allegations from lawsuits filed by several former top Banc executives against Banc, including former Executive Vice Chairman Jeffrey Seabold, Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff Carlos P. Salas, and Managing Director of SBA Lending Heather Endresen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-90, 151.) The FAC also references allegations and a declaration by Sugarman in a related \"Securities Class Action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91-100, 151.) Some of these allegations concern Banc's decision in January 2017 to \"scale back\" its 2016 bonus pool by reducing certain employee bonuses and reversing $7.8 million in such bonus accruals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 104, 107.) Plaintiff alleges this action improperly credited the accruals towards Banc's earnings for the first quarter of 2017, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), which had the effect of increasing Banc's pre-tax earnings for the quarter ending on March 31, 2017, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 113-14). Banc disclosed this action in its Form 10-Q filed on May 10, 2017, which was signed by Bowers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 112, 122.) However, Plaintiff alleges that based on certain Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") guidance, \"[i]f based on information available to Banc management on March 1, 2017, management believed it was likely that some or all of the incentive compensation bonuses accrued at December 31, 2016 would not be paid, such amounts should have been reversed as of December 31, 2016, prior to issuance of Banc's 2016 financial statements, rather than being reversed in the financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 116-18.) Plaintiff alleges this action amounts to an intentional misstatement of Banc's financial statements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120.) Banc's 2016 Form 10-K was allegedly signed by Lashley, Benett, Karish, Schnel, and Sznewajs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125.) Endresen alleges that Lashley \"was central in making the decision to reassess the bonus accruals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff concedes that he did not make a pre-suit demand on the Board to institute this action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139.) Instead, he commenced this action and alleges that any pre-suit demand on the directors would have been futile because \"[a] majority of the current Board is so personally and directly conflicted or so personally or directly committed to the decisions in dispute that they cannot reasonably be expected to respond to a demand in good faith and within the ambit of the business judgment rule.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 142-43). Plaintiff\n   alleges that demand is futile with regards to three decisions made by the Directors: (1) the decision to issue the October 2016 Press Release, permitting Grosvenor to repeat the false statements therein, or the Board's response to that Press Release, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146), (2) the Special Committee's decision not to act in response to Sugarman's request for an investigation into Benett. Schnel, Karish, and Sznewajs's alleged conflicts of interests, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149), and (3) the decision to \"manipulate\" the earnings in the first quarter of 2017, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of the claims asserted in the complaint. The issue on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is not whether the claimant will ultimately prevail, but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims asserted.\n   <em>\n    Gilligan v. Jamco Dev.

Rule 12(b)(6) is read in conjunction with Rule 8(a), which requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). When evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the district court must accept all material allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Moyo v.
