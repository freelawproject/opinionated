[ECF No. 133]. The Court has reviewed the Motion, the record, arguments of counsel, and is otherwise fully advised. For the reasons that follow, Maryland Casualty's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This dispute centers on the proper construction of an insurance policy. According to the allegations in the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff/Counter-Defendant Allied World National Assurance Company (\"Allied World\") is an insurance company. Allied World insured Doctor's Associates, Inc., (\"DAI\") under a general liability umbrella policy (the \"Allied World Policy\"). There is no dispute that DAI was covered under the terms of the Allied World Policy at all relevant times. For the purposes of this litigation, Maryland Casualty contends (and Allied World does not dispute in its Response) that Allied World is properly considered a subrogee of DAI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 133, at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Fortune Constr. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9331103\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/1260/\">\n    320 F.3d 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1270 n. 13 (11th Cir. 2003) ].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DAI is the national franchisor of Subway brand restaurants. During the relevant period, DAI granted several Subway franchises to Florida entities, who subsequently assigned or ran their franchises pursuant to DAI's franchise agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   DAI also entered into a business relationship with Family Development Partners (\"FDP\") under the terms of a \"Development Agreement.\" Under the Development Agreement, FDP would provide consulting services to DAI for operation of South Florida Subway franchises. The Development Agreement expressly stated that FDP was not an employee or partner to DAI; it was an independent contractor employed specifically to develop and service Subway restaurants. The Development Agreement also required that FDP purchase general liability insurance and name DAI as an additional insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant/Counter-Plaintiff Maryland Casualty insured FDP under policy no. PAS 04964476 (the \"Maryland Casualty Policy\"). The Maryland Casualty Policy contained a commercial general liability coverage form agreeing to \"pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' \" when the\n   insurance applied. [ECF No. 132-2, at 159]. Section II designates who is an insured, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    SECTION II - WHO IS AN INSURED\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. Each of the following is also an insured:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   e. Any person or organization with whom you agree, because of a written contract, to provide insurance such as is afforded under the policy, but only with respect to liability arising out of your operations, \"your work\" or facilities owned or used by you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   This provision does not apply:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (1) To any vendor, concessionaire, lessor of leased equipment, grantor of a franchise, engineer, architect or surveyor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) Unless the contract has been signed prior to the date of \"bodily injury\", \"property damage\", or \"personal or advertising injury.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [ECF No. 132-3, at 84]. The Maryland Casualty Policy goes on to state that those FDP contracted with would be included as insureds \"only in connection with liability arising out of the operation of [its] business; [and] only to the extent that coverage is afforded to that person or organization by 'underlying insurance....' \" [ECF No. 132-3, at 168].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties dispute how or if each of these contracts-the Allied World Policy, the Maryland Casualty Policy, and the Development Agreement-provide coverage for the Subway franchises and their employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Underlying Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On September 14, 2011, while the Development Agreement was in force, an employee at one of the South Florida Subway restaurants was injured during a robbery. At the time of the incident, DAI was the franchisor of that Subway, and Subway Two, Inc., (\"Subway Two\") was the franchisee. The employee sued to recover damages for his injuries (the \"Farooq Action\"). The Farooq Action carried two theories alleging DAI's liability as franchisor of Subway Two: that DAI was vicariously liable for Subway Two's negligence and that DAI was negligent for failing to provide proper security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   DAI obtained a release from the litigation after Allied World funded a settlement. The settlement, in part, provided that 75% of the funds were for the release of FDP and others to resolve DAI's vicarious liability. However, DAI was not sued on a theory of vicarious liability as to FDP and FDP was not a defendant in that action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. This Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Allied World now brings this subrogation suit against Maryland Casualty, seeking to recover fees incurred in the Farooq Action, including attorney's fees and settlement funds incurred in obtaining the release for FDP. Maryland Casualty argues it had no duty to defend DAI (or Allied World) and thus is not obligated to indemnify Allied World. Maryland Casualty filed a cross-claim for declaratory relief against FDP and a counterclaim against Allied World. [ECF No. 55]. The Court previously dismissed certain claims in the Amended Complaint, leaving only (1) Allied World's Claim for Breach of Contract against Maryland Casualty; (2) Allied World's Claim for a Declaration Regarding Maryland Casualty's Duty to Defend and Indemnify; and (3) Maryland Casualty's\n   Counter-Claim and Cross-Claim. [ECF No. 77]. The Court also dismissed other Cross-Plaintiffs/Defendants (FDP and its officers) to Maryland Casualty's Cross-Claims, leaving only Maryland Casualty and Allied World as parties to this litigation. [ECF No. 130]. Maryland Casualty now moves for summary judgment against Allied World.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

One key difference between these cases and the instant action is that here no separate endorsement or other later-attached amendment exists to further clarify the parties' relationship as to the extent of coverage for a \"grantor of a franchise.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pekin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=366%20Ill.%20Dec.%20780\">\n    366 Ill.Dec. 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=980%20N.E.2d%201139\">\n    980 N.E.2d at 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But in any event, the Court has not identified a case finding the phrase \"grantor of a franchise\" to be ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Allied World's final argument, that the subsections of Section II make coverage ambiguous, is also meritless. Sections II(2)(e)(1) and (2) are divided by the disjunctive \"or.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 132-3, at 84 (\"This provision does not apply: (1) To any vendor, concessionaire, lessor of leased equipment, grantor of a franchise, engineer, architect or surveyor;\n   <strong>\n    or\n   </strong>\n   (2) Unless the contract has been signed prior to the date of 'bodily injury', 'property damage', or 'personal or advertising injury.' \") (emphasis added) ]. According to Allied World, this creates ambiguity because it requires reading the alternatives separately, with the practical effect of excluding a grantor of a franchise from coverage under (1), but including it under (2) if the contract was signed before the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Insurance policies are to be read \"in their ordinary sense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A &amp; M Gerber Chiropractic LLC v. GEICO Gen. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523455\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/1318/#p1337\">\n    291 F.Supp.3d 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1337 (S.D. Fla. 2017) (\"The 'terms of an insurance policy should be taken and understood in their ordinary sense and the policy should receive a reasonable, practical and sensible interpretation consistent with the intent of the parties-not a strained, forced or unrealistic construction.' \") (citing\n   <em>\n    Siegle v. Progressive Consumers Ins.

Here, the disjunctive only requires reading alternatives separately insofar as their application to any given party. In other words, the disjunctive gives alternative ways a party may be covered or not covered. It does not require a party to evaluate whether it falls under both of the subsections if it clearly falls under one. So, if DAI is excluded under subsection (1), that suffices to exclude coverage; continuing on to read the remainder of the subsection to determine if coverage exists elsewhere forces a \"strained ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   construction\" that contravenes the parties' intent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9419554\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/819/732/#p736\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court therefore finds that, in this context, the phrase \"grantor of a franchise\" is not ambiguous.
