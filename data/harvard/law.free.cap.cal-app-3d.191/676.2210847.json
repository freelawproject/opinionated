Rptr. 623] whether the trial court erred in admitting expert opinion testimony that appellant had committed child sexual abuse. We conclude the court erred, but the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">John C. appeals from an order declaring his twin children Christine and Michael to be dependent children of the juvenile court (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 300). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">Two separate petitions, filed by the Marin County Department of Social Services and later amended to conform to proof, alleged that John had sexually molested Christine and Michael when they were three years old. At the hearing on the petitions the department presented testimony by a psychiatrist, Dr. David Corwin, who had examined the children on one occasion. Over John\u2019s objection the court permitted Dr. Corwin to testify he believed the twins\u2019 claims that John had molested them.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Dr. Corwin\u2019s conclusion was based primarily on \u201cwhat the children told me\u201d and \u201cthe way in which they told me.\u201d Specifically, he relied on the consistency of their reports of abuse and the manner in which they reported the abuse, their demonstrations of emotion during the interview, the absence of any deprecation of their father, their demonstrated ability to discriminate between events that did or did not occur, their behavior with anatomically correct dolls, and the general \u201cair of realism\u201d in their assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">The department also presented opinion testimony by a therapist and two social workers that the twins\u2019 claims of abuse by John were true. The social workers\u2019 opinions were based on the manner in which the twins reported the abuse; the therapist\u2019s opinion was based on her assertion that \u201cchildren don\u2019t lie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The children, who were five and one-half years old at the time of the dependency hearing, also testified. They described numerous acts of sexual abuse by John.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The court ruled that the twins had been sexually abused. The court\u2019s dispositional order included findings that (1) John had stuck his finger in Christine\u2019s vagina and anus, had put his penis on or near her vaginal and anal openings, and had made Christine play with his penis, and (2) John had put his penis on or near Michael\u2019s anus, had played with Michael\u2019s penis, and had had Michael play with John\u2019s penis. The court declared the children to be dependent children of the juvenile court, placed them in the custody of their mother under the department\u2019s supervision, afforded John supervised visitation, and required counseling for all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">John challenges the admission of the expert opinion testimony that the children\u2019s claims of abuse were truthful. He asserts two reasons why the testimony should have been excluded,  First, he argues the testimony should have been subjected to the <em>Kelly-Frye </em>test for admission of evidence based on a new scientific method of proof, requiring a showing that the procedure has been generally accepted as reliable in the scientific community in which it was developed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 24 [130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240]; <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C. Cir. 1923) 293 Fed. 1013 [34 A.L.R. 145].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n                   Second, he argues the admission of the testimony identifying him as the perpetrator contravened <em>In re Cheryl H. </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 1098, 1118-1120 [200 Cal.Rptr. 789], which prohibits such testimony because it draws inferences about conduct by a third party based primarily on hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Our opinion in <em>In re Amber B., supra, post, </em>page 682, concludes that the practice of detecting child sexual abuse by (1) observing a child\u2019s behavior with anatomically correct dolls, and (2) analyzing the child\u2019s reports of abuse, is a new scientific method of proof which is subject to the requirements of <em>Kelly-Frye. </em>In the present case the experts relied on these same two factors to detect sexual abuse (although there does not appear to have been as much reliance on play with dolls as in <em>Amber B.).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>For the reasons we state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>in <em>Amber B., </em>the trial court erred when it admitted the expert opinion testimony without first requiring a showing of general acceptance in the relevant scientific community in accordance with <em>Kelly-Frye.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">There was also error under <em>Cheryl H. </em>to the extent the experts identified John as the person who abused the children. As in <em>Cheryl Ft., </em>this testimony impermissibly drew inferences about conduct by a third party based primarily on hearsay. <em>(In re Cheryl H., supra, </em>153 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1118-1120.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Unlike in <em>Amber B., </em>however, the error was harmless. This case is different because the children testified and the trial judge provided a detailed oral explanation of her ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Three elements of the court\u2019s explanation demonstrate the error was harmless. First, the court said flatly that it found the children to be \u201cbelievable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Second, the court accepted the basic premise of John\u2019s defense, yet still found abuse. John asserts the children\u2019s mother, Connie, along with the therapist and two social workers, were the sources of the abuse claims. According to John, Connie\u2019s \u201cbizarre and unusual preoccupation and attitude toward sexual matters,\u201d combined with \u201cleading and suggestive examinations\u201d by the therapist and two social workers, caused the children to believe they had been abused when in fact they had not. The court said it agreed Connie was \u201cobsessed ... with her interest in sex,\u201d and theorized Connie had been \u201ctantalated [szc] by what happened.\u201d The court also agreed that some of the children\u2019s testimony incorporated \u201cthings that adults had said to them.\u201d In spite of this, however, the court still found there had been sexual abuse. The court\u2019s comments indicate its acceptance of the basic premise of John\u2019s defense would not have benefitted him had the expert opinion testimony been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Third, the court did not accept all of Dr. Corwin\u2019s testimony. Dr. Corwin testified that the \u201cmost reliable\u201d and \u201cbelievable\u201d of the children\u2019s claims were Michael\u2019s description of anal intercourse and Christine\u2019s claims of vaginal and digital intercourse and fellatio. The court ruled, however, that there was insufficient evidence to conclude John had performed anal or vaginal intercourse with either child. This indicates the court relied on the generally \u201cbelievable\u201d testimony of the children, rather than the improperly admitted expert opinion testimony, to determine there had been sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">In view of the court\u2019s characterization of the children as believable, its acceptance of the basic premise of John\u2019s defense without ruling in his favor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>and its rejection of Dr. Corwin\u2019s most forcefully asserted conclusions, it is not reasonably probable a result more favorable to John would have been reached in the absence of the erroneous admission of the expert opinion testimony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].) The error does not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">II-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Low, P.
