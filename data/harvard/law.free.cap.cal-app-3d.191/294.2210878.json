(Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 340.5.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We consolidate these petitions for decision because they raise the identical issue. The trial court overruled the demurrers because it concluded that a factual question was raised by the retroactive application of the limitations period, namely, whether the plaintiff had a reasonable time within which to file his complaint. We do not think the issue here raises a question of fact; rather, the constitutionality of retroactive application of the statute must be determined by the court. We conclude that the statute applies, barring the action. Accordingly the writ must issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Matthew\u2019s complaint alleges that he was bom on July 19,1971, that defendants\u2019 negligence in providing prenatal and delivery care caused him to suffer \u201cbirth brain injuries\u201d resulting in his total paralysis and inability to speak, and that some of the injuries will be permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">He filed his complaint on July 26, 1985, through his aunt, Lorrie Koehler, as guardian ad litem. He alleges his parents failed or refused to bring an action on his behalf. The complaint was filed slightly more than 14 years after the alleged negligence and injuries occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">When Matthew was bom, the applicable statute of limitations for medical malpractice was four years from date of injury or one year from actual or constructive discovery, whichever first occurs, subject to tolling during minority. (Former \u00a7\u00a7 340.5, 352.) But section 340.5 was amended in 1975. The amendment has been constmed by the decision in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Haines </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 883 [226 Cal.Rptr. 547, 718 P.2d 909]. It gives a minor plaintiff either three years from the date of injury, or, if the injury occurred before the plaintiff was six years old, until the plaintiff\u2019s eighth birthday\u2014 whichever period is longer\u2014to file the action. The period is subject to tolling (according to the statute as constmed in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Haines, supra) </em>for (1) fraudulent collusion of parent with health care provider, (2) intentional concealment of injury by health care provider,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or (3) presence of a foreign body in the person of the victim. It is not subject to tolling, or more precisely, accrual of the cause of action is not postponed, until discovery of the injury. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 901.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The complaint sets forth none of the statutory conditions recited above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>to toll the period. It instead alleges: \u201cBecause of his condition, even with the exercise of reasonable diligence under the circumstances, plaintiff was unable to discover that his injuries might be the result of the negligence of the defendants until very shortly before this Complaint is being filed. [U] Plaintiff is bringing this action through his present guardian ad litem, ... because his parents failed and/or refused to bring such an action on his behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Well settled law, disputed by no party here, establishes that retrospective application of a shortened limitations period is permissible provided the party has a reasonable time to avail himself of his remedy before the statute cuts off his right. <em>(Rosefield Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1935) 4 Cal.2d 120, 122 [47 P.2d 716]; <em>Liptak </em>v. <em>Diane Apartments, Inc. </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 762, 774; see generally 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Actions \u00a7\u00a7 331, 428, pp. 360-361, 461-462.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The doctrine of retrospectivity of limitations statutes is one of constitutional dimension. In California, statutes of limitations, being procedural, are normally retroactively applied to accrued causes of action; but the court must inquire whether, in a given case, that retrospective application may violate due process by in effect eliminating the plaintiff\u2019s right. If the time left to file suit is reasonable, no such constitutional violation occurs, and the statute is applied as enacted. If no time is left, or only an unreasonably short time remains, then the statute cannot be applied at all. This analysis is set forth clearly in <em>Rosefield Packing Co., supra, </em>pointing out the question is one of constitutionality; the statute may not operate immediately to cut off the accrued remedy \u201cor within so short a time as to give the party no reasonable opportunity to exercise his remedy\u201d; if the statute does so operate it is unconstitutional. <em>(Rosefield Packing Co., supra, </em>4 Cal.2d at p. 122.) Further, the issue is one of law for appellate resolution. In <em>Rosefield, </em>retrospective application left the plaintiff \u201cpractically an entire year\u201d to bring suit after enactment of the amendment <em>(id. </em>at p. 123); \u201c[t]here can be no doubt but that this was a reasonable time . ...\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Decisions applying this general principle of retrospectivity when reasonable have handled the analysis in a similar fashion. (E.g., <em>Liptak </em>v. <em>Diane Apartments, Inc., supra, </em>109 Cal.App.3d 762; <em>Eden </em>v. <em>Van Tine </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 879, 886 [148 Cal.Rptr. 215, 12 A.L.R.4th 856].) Both <em>Liptak </em>and <em>Eden </em>quote this instructive language from <em>Rosefield Packing-. </em>\u201cWhether there was reasonable time in these cases is <em>not a matter committed to the discretion of the trial court. </em>The question is one of constitutionality of the statute____\u201d <em>(Rosefield Packing Co., supra, 4 </em>Cal.2d at p. 124, italics added.) What <em>Rosefield </em>m* ' in saying the issue of reasonable time is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>committed to the trial court\u2019s discretion, is that the matter is a question of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The <em>Eden </em>court specifically says that under <em>Rosefield </em>the issue is one of law. (83 Cal.App.3d at p. 887.) Further, <em>Young </em>v. <em>Haines </em>also treats the issue as one of law, pointing out in a footnote that the plaintiff there had five years after the amendment to section 340.5 to bring suit, and saying \u201cThis is a reasonable time in which to sue.\u201d (41 Cal.3d at p. 891, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Plaintiff here seeks to rely on the decision in <em>Whiteside </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 854 [195 Cal.Rptr. 349], which held a minor\u2019s action under the statute was brought within a reasonable time, and was not barred, on these facts: the child was bom April 7, 1962; he was allegedly injured in June 1971 at about age nine; he attained majority on April 7, 1980, and brought the lawsuit on December 4, 1980, within one year of attaining majority. As here, he alleged his parents had refused to allow a lawsuit to be brought on his behalf. The <em>Whiteside </em>court concluded (1) the plaintiff\u2019s action was brought within a reasonable time of his attaining majority; (2) the shortening of the period by the 1975 amendment could not be applied to him. As reason for the latter conclusion the court said, \u201cWhere, as here, an unemancipated minor\u2019s natural parents refuse to secure the appointment of a guardian ad litem, the minor has no choice but to await his majority when he can, for the first time, institute an action.\u201d (147 Cal.App.3d at p. 857.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The <em>Whiteside </em>holding is correct in the light of the traditional requirement, discussed above, that the statute of limitations cannot be retrospectively applied if it does not leave the plaintiff a reasonable time in which to sue. The facts there were such that application of the statute would have left the plaintiff no time to sue, since he was injured at age nine and was thirteen years old in 1975 when the statute was amended, so that the amendment occurred after plaintiff\u2019s eighth birthday and more than three years after the injury, thus entirely eliminating the cause of action. Accordingly, under the constitutional analysis discussed above, the court could simply have found that it violated due process to apply the statute to Whiteside, and instead applied former law giving plaintiff a year after attaining majority in which to bring suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">But the reasoning of <em>Whiteside </em>cannot stand after <em>Young. Whiteside </em>imports into this restrictively drafted statute a tolling provision until a reasonable time after majority for those minors whose parents declined to file suit. No such exception is set forth in the enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number><em>Young, </em>under compulsion of the equal protection clause, accorded to minors the same three tolling benefits vouchsafed to adults by the statute. But with that single exception, section 340.5 was approved as written. Specifically, the court said that the former statute of limitations applicable to minors no longer applies in Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA) actions. \u201c[T]he conclusion that the Legislature intended to restore a common law tolling provision which it had abolished five years previously is untenable.\u201d <em>(Young </em>v. <em>Haines, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 896.) It would be inconsistent with this binding Supreme Court precedent to engraft onto the statute a tolling provision for children of parents who refuse to sue, for such an interpretation would essentially reenact, for those minors, the former law tolling such statutes until majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In declining to read into section 340.5 a delayed discovery provision as to minors, <em>Young </em>discussed at length the financial crisis impelling enactment of MICRA, including this limitations provision, and the particular problems arising from long delayed lawsuits by minors, and interpreted the statute to effect the Legislature\u2019s legitimate concerns with costs and inequities in trying lawsuits based on long past events.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\"><em>Young </em>emphasized that \u201c[w]here the plaintiff is a minor, it is the knowledge or lack thereof of the parents which determines when the cause of action accrues. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 890, fn. 4.) Although that statement in context referred to issues other than retrospectivity, it rests on an underlying principle applicable here as well as there: that the minor must depend upon his legal custodians to protect his interests, and finds no exception in section 340.5 for situations where they fail to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Although seemingly harsh, this principle is consistent with the minor\u2019s general legal situation which renders him dependent upon his parents\u2019 or legal guardian\u2019s judgment for his entire well-being in every respect. To create a particular exception where the bringing of a lawsuit is concerned is to provide a benefit for potential underage malpractice plaintiffs not accorded to minors generally who would avoid the results of their custodians\u2019 unwise choices on their behalf. Except in egregious situations calling for interference with legal custody, the parents, not the courts, make decisions for the minor. The decision to file a malpractice action is one such decision. Nowhere in the statute is there language authorizing special exceptions for the minor whose parents simply refuse to sue when, perhaps, some person would conclude they should.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Nor is a court in any event well situated to judge the wisdom of the parental choice to sue or not to sue. We are not inclined to hold as a matter of law that a lawsuit is always the best use of family resources and energy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Nor are we inclined, or authorized, to take over the decisions relative to the care of minors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><em>Young </em>compels us to apply MICRA as written, except where constitutional considerations override the statute. Here no such considerations apply,  The time left to plaintiff to sue, four years, is clearly reasonable in light of <em>Young </em>and <em>Rosefield. </em>Therefore the statute applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We conclude the instant action is barred as a matter of law, unless plaintiff can amend his complaint to establish a statutory tolling exception. We note that the trial court may grant leave to amend to allege facts establishing such an exception (as was done in <em>Young), </em>but plaintiff will be held to the facts legitimately established during discovery, on possible later summary judgment proceedings.
