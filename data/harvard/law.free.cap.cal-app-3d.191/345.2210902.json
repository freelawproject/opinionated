Each of them has appealed from a judgment which was entered upon the jury\u2019s verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">On each of their respective appeals, <em>Howe </em>and <em>Clark </em>contend that: \u201cThe prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct during the course of his closing argument which violated appellant\u2019s federal constitutional rights and warrants reversal of his convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">It is argued by each of them that the charged misconduct occurred during the prosecutor\u2019s closing jury argument by (1) his comment upon defendants\u2019 failure to testify at trial, and (2) by telling the jury that defendants were \u201crobbers\u201d and \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201ctherefore must have had the intent to commit the kidnap for robbery and robbery charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">It is first noted that no objection, or request for an appropriate jury admonition, was made at the trial as to either of the assignments of misconduct. In our opinion had such been made, and acted upon, any conceivable prejudice to defendants would have vanished. Under such circumstances, we are told by <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 27-36 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468], that the claimed misconduct may not be raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Moreover, the first claimed prosecutorial misconduct was the following statement: \u201cNow, was the movement in this case of the person caused with the specific intent to rob him and was that intent to rob existent at the time that the kidnapping commenced? That question is one that is clearly answered by the circumstantial evidence in this case, by the reasonable, logical, common sense interpretation of what occurred here. We don\u2019t have in this case statements of the defendant saying that, \u2018My state of mind was such and such,\u2019 or, \u2018My state of mind was this and that.\u2019 That would be direct evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">\u201cWe have the circumstances which attest to their actions that prove what their specific intent was, and what are those circumstances in this case to serve the specific intent? Well, number one, we have the defendant Clark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>getting into the car with a knife in his hand. His first words are, \u2018Cooperate or you\u2019re going to get hurt,\u2019 and then immediately says, \u2018Hand over your wallet.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u201cWhat does that show? That shows that he entered the car with the intent to rob Mr. Peters, you know, and let\u2019s backstep a bit and look at the totality of the picture here and not just these isolated bits and pieces of evidence, but the whole picture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\"><em>Howe </em>and <em>Clark </em>had admitted kidnapping the victim of their crimes. While in our opinion the existence of <em>Griffin </em>misconduct <em>(Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 609 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 85 S.Ct. 1229]) was doubtful, a <em>lack </em>of prejudice to defendants <em>Howe </em>and <em>Clark </em>seems certain. \u201cAnyone who seeks on appeal to predicate a reversal of conviction on error must show that it was prejudicial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Archerd </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 615, 643 [91 Cal.Rptr. 397, 477 P.2d 421].)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">And since the evidence had clearly established that <em>Howe </em>and <em>Clark </em>were <em>kidnappers </em>and <em>robbers, </em>it necessarily follows that they were \u201crobbers and criminals\u201d as they were described by the prosecutor. Here there was neither misconduct, nor prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The remaining contention of defendants <em>Howe </em>and <em>Clark </em>is that: \u201cAppellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel at sentencing when his attorney erroneously conceded the court had no discretion but to sentence appellant to a life term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\"><em>Howe </em>and <em>Clark </em>had been convicted by a jury\u2019s verdicts of kidnapping for the purpose of robbery in violation of Penal Code section 209, <em>subdivision (b). </em>The jury also found, among other things, that both <em>Howe </em>and <em>Clark </em>had personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon in the crime\u2019s perpetration, thus authorizing a sentence enhancement of one year for each of them. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">On the subsequent sentencing proceedings the trial court stated: \u201cMr. Clark, you\u2019re in front of me for sentencing [on] the charge of kidnapping for robbery and personal use of a deadly or dangerous weapon as well as the prior convictions. Probation is going to be denied. Your statutory eligibility is quite limited. You have a long criminal record. There were threats of great harm to the victim, pattern of violent conduct involved here, and probation is denied. I\u2019m going to impose on [the kidnapping for robbery count] the term of life imprisonment which is required by law. On the enhancement for use of a deadly weapon ... it\u2019s ordered by the court that you serve a period of one year in the state prison system for that----[Y]our prior convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>tions as an adult are numerous, frequent and of increasing seriousness____ [T]he crime involved threats of great bodily harm and there was a high degree of viciousness and callousness exhibited by the defendant____That would then be for your sentence, Mr. Clark ... one year for the use of a deadly weapon, and then the life sentence____</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\u201cFor Mr. Howe, you are here for a conviction ... of kidnapping for robbery ... with personal use of a deadly or dangerous weapon____There\u2019s nothing to indicate probation would be warranted. You have a terrible record. This is a terrible crime, and a history of state prison commitments. ... [T]he kidnapping for robbery, I\u2019m going to impose the sentence that I\u2019m required to by law of the life term. On the enhancement on that term for use of a deadly or dangerous weapon, I\u2019m going to impose one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">Earlier in the sentencing proceedings the following had occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-13\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Then I would be prepared to hear any remarks that counsel might wish to make ... and any comments you have, Mr. Berger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-14\">\u201cMr. Berger [attorney for Clark:]: Well, in view of the charge, the sentence is set by law. <em>You have no discretion on the 209(b) </em>[our italics], so I have nothing I can add.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-15\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Mr. Shelby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-16\">\u201cMr. Shelby [attorney for <em>Howe]: That\u2019s likewise my position on 209(b) </em>[our italics]. There\u2019s nothing I can add because it was a determinate sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-17\">It is the respective statements of counsel which form the basis of the instant contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-18\">Initially, it will be noted that both defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment <em>with </em>possibility of parole, according to Penal Code section 209, <em>subdivision (b), </em>which both counsel relied upon in making their here criticized comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-19\">Penal Code section 209, <em>subdivision (b), </em>provides: \u201cAny person who kidnaps or carries away any individual to commit robbery <em>[without </em>death or bodily harm] <em>shall </em>be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life <em>with possibility of parole.\u201d </em>(Our italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-20\">We are provided with no authority and we, ourselves, have found none, holding that the sentence of life imprisonment <em>with </em>possibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>parole provided by Penal Code section 209, <em>subdivision (b), </em>is other than <em>mandatory.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Penal Code section 7, subdivision (16), states that \u201cwords\u201d must be construed \u201caccording to the context and the approved usage of the language.\u201d The approved usage of the word <em>\u201cshalP </em>is the meaning of <em>\u201cmust\u201d; </em>it is \u201cused to express what is mandatory.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Intemat. Diet. (3d ed.) p. 2085.) And, it is held that \u201c \u2018shall\u2019 is mandatory unless otherwise apparent from the context.\u201d <em>(Caminetti </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1941) 16 Cal.2d 838, 842 [108 P.2d 911].) No legislative purpose is seen of a meaning other than <em>\u201cmandatory\u201d </em>in the enactment of Penal Code section 209, <em>subdivision (b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Marsh </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 134 [202 Cal.Rptr. 92, 679 P.2d 1033], lends no aid to the arguments of <em>Howe </em>and <em>Clark. </em>There Marsh, a juvenile, was convicted of a Penal Code section 209 kidnapping <em>with </em>\u201cbodily harm,\u201d under <em>subdivision (a) </em>calling for life imprisonment <em>without </em>possibility of parole. The high court, finding no statutory \u201cspecific prohibition\u201d thereof, simply held (p. 144) that the trial court \u201ccould strike ... the bodily harm allegation, thereby reducing the kidnapping sentence to life <em>with </em>possibility of parole, which carries a minimum parole eligibility term of seven years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Defense counsel of the present case are not reasonably to be faulted for correctly stating to the trial court the apparent applicable law. No \u201cineffective assistance\u201d of counsel is seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">And were we, arguendo, to find the claimed ineffectiveness of counsel, we should be obliged to find it harmless because of the trial court\u2019s views of the seriousness of defendants\u2019 crimes. It is not reasonably probable that a result more favorable to <em>Howe </em>and <em>Clark </em>would have occurred in the absence of the assumed ineffectiveness of counsel. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 22, 1987.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
