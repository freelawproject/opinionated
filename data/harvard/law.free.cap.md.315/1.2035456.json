The charges involved specific complaints of five unrelated clients. A Petition for Disciplinary Action was filed in the Court of Appeals on August 7, 1987. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Singleton, a member of the Maryland Bar since June 20, 1974, is currently suspended from the practice of law. Pursuant to Md.Rule BV9(b), we referred the charges for hearing to Judge Thomas Ward of the Baltimore City Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">In a Memorandum of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which we shall summarize, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City found the following violations against Respondent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">1. Singleton violated the Code of Professional Responsibility,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Disciplinary Rules (DR) l-102(A)(5)-(6), DR 6-101(A)(3) and DR 7-101(A)(l)-(8) in his representation of Emilie Underwood. The trial court found that Singleton was retained by Underwood on behalf of the heirs of the estate of Clarence Veney in 1977. Veney had been seriously injured, and later died, allegedly the result of an accident involving a Metropolitan Transit Authority bus in Baltimore City. Singleton \u201cfailed to file suit timely,\u201d \u201cfailed to investigate the case in an efficient and competent manner,\u201d \u201cfailed to keep in touch with his client,\u201d and \u201ceven failed to return her file long after many years have passed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">2. As to the Complaint of Warren M. Smith, Petitioner sustained the charges of violations of DR 1-102(A)(4)-(6), DR 2-110(A)(2), DR 6-101(A)(3) and DR 7-101(A)(l)-(3). The trial court found that Singleton, \u201cafter being retained by Warren Smith for the purpose of obtaining his divorce, failed to take any meaningful action towards the eventual resolution of this retention.\u201d The court elaborated that, \u201che failed to keep Mr. Smith informed of progress, and those reports he did make were either inaccurate or downright dishonest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>3. As to the Complaint of Phyllis Gaither, Petitioner sustained the charges of violations of DR 2-110(B)(2), DR 5-105(A), DR 6-101(A)(3), DR 7-101(A)(l)-(3) and DR 7-104(A)(2). The background of these charges shall be set forth in Part I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\">4. As to the Complaint of Charles D. Smith, Petitioner sustained the charges of violations of DR 1-102(A)(5)-(6), DR 2-110(B)(2), DR 6-101(A)(3), DR 7-101(A)(l)-(3) and DR 9-102(B)(4). Charles D. Smith retained Singleton in February, 1985, in connection with the alleged wrongful termination of his employment from Conrail. Mr. Smith gave the respondent a copy of a transcript of an administrative hearing which had been held concerning the termination. The trial court found \u201cthe evidence clearly shows that Mr. Singleton failed to take any action whatsoever with respect to his client, failed to file suit, and failed to even return the transcript of testimony after having been suspended from the general practice of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">5. Singleton violated rules DR 1-102(A)(3), (5) \u2014 (6), DR 6-101(A)(3), DR 7-101(A)(l)-(3), DR 9-102(B)(l), (3)-(4) in his representation of Christopher Kelly-El. The background of these charges shall be set forth in Part II.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Generally, these charges consist of a series of continuing violations of neglect, misconduct and failure to withdraw from employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Singleton filed no exceptions in regard to the trial judge\u2019s findings. The Commission has excepted only as to the findings in the Gaither and Kelly-El matters. We have carefully reviewed the record, and the accompanying exhibits. We find that there is clear and convincing evidence sufficient to sustain Judge Ward\u2019s findings as to the above violations, and limit our discussion to the Commission\u2019s exceptions. <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Collins, </em>295 Md. 532, 548, 457 A.2d 1134, 1142 (1983) (the findings of fact made by the hearing judge must be based on clear and convincing evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In the complaint of Phyllis Gaither, the Commission alleged that Singleton represented Mr. Gaither in a divorce proceeding, by filing a complaint on January 80, 1985, and then later prepared an answer on behalf of Mrs. Gaither. Singleton allegedly accepted $180.00 for the preparation of this answer. The answer was prepared so as to appear that she was representing herself in the case. On May 5, 1986, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City dismissed the divorce action pursuant to Md.Rule 2-507. The Commission maintained that Singleton failed to withdraw from the case despite his indefinite suspension from the practice of law on January 80, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The Commission charged Singleton with violating DR 1-102, entitled \u201cMisconduct,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">(A) A lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">(5) Engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">(6) Engage in any other conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Upon review of the above charges, the trial judge made the following factual findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">The main evidence to sustain this charge indicates that the case was dismissed under Maryland Rule 2-507 on or about May 5, 1986. In fact, Mr. Singleton was suspended from the general practice of law on January 80, 1986, long before Rule 2-507 was executed. Rule 2-507 says that in the event that there have been no pleadings or other activities in a pending case for a period of more than one year, then the matter shall be dismissed by the clerk without further request under Rule 2-507. This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>what occurred on May 5, 1986. However, for Mr. Singleton to have taken any action with respect to this rule would have been in clear violation of DR 2-110.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">As a result, the trial judge refused to sustain the charges with respect to DR l-102(A)(5)-(6). The Commission argues that the judge erred in this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The hearing judge\u2019s findings are prima facie correct and will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Willcher, </em>287 Md. 74, 77, 411 A.2d 83, 85 (1980); <em>Bar Association of Baltimore City v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 516, 307 A.2d 677, 680 (1973). Here, the Commission has demonstrated that Respondent violated DR l-102(A)(5)-(6), and that the trial judge\u2019s conclusion was in error. There was substantial evidence that Singleton neglected Mr. Gaither\u2019s divorce action prior to his suspension from the practice of law in January, 1986. Although Singleton maintains that he had not received attorney fees from Mr.. Gaither, and that he accepted money from Mrs. Gaither only as payment of her husband\u2019s fee, this does not justify the fact that the case was inactive prior to Singleton\u2019s suspension. In addition, Singleton failed to advise Mr. Gaither that he had been suspended and that the client should obtain other counsel to handle the matter. As stated by the circuit court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">Mr. Singleton\u2019s failure to competently handle an uncomplicated, uncontested divorce on behalf of his client, Mr. Gaither, has resulted in the mess that occurred. Not only did he fail to promptly prosecute the case on behalf of his client, but he failed to clarify his relationship with his client\u2019s wife, Mrs. Gaither, the defendant in that case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW\">We are satisfied that Singleton\u2019s representation of Mr. Gaither constitutes \u201cconduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d and \u201cthat adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law.\u201d <em>See </em>DR l-102(A)(5)-(6). Therefore, the Commission\u2019s exceptions as to the Gaither complaint are granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">In connection with the complaint of Christopher Kelly-El (Kelly-El), the Commission excepted to the circuit court\u2019s failure to find violations of DR l-102(A)(3)-(4) and DR 9-102(A) with reference to the Respondent\u2019s alleged conversion to his own use of the funds of his client.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Kelly-El retained Singleton in September, 1981, in relation to a claim for injuries he sustained in a supermarket, Superpride Markets. Respondent allegedly falsely represented to Kelly-El that he had filed a case in court on his behalf. In addition, the Commission charged that Singleton settled the claim in November, 1985, without the client\u2019s authorization. After receiving an insurance settlement of $3,500.00, he failed to inform Kelly-El of the receipt of the settlement money.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Respondent allegedly misappropriated and converted to his own use the funds of his client. Finally, in August, 1986, Kelly-El was paid $2,165.87 by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Singleton in connection with the claim against Superpride Markets.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The trial judge made the following factual determinations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">Mr. Kelly-El was quite adamant that he had never received the first memorandum of settlement, and he was equally adamant under cross-examination from Mr. Singleton that he had never authorized the settlement in the first place. This Court finds that Mr. Kelly-El\u2019s testimony is more than persuasive. The testimony also clearly indicates that Mr. Singleton had little or no contact with his client during his entire period of representation, and he excuses his actions in this regard by claiming that Mr. Kelly-El didn\u2019t have a telephone or that his telephone was disconnected. Not only is this denied in part by Mr. Kelly-El, but it is clear that Mr. Singleton never made any real attempt to contact Mr. Kelly-El by mail or by personal contact, despite the fact that his client was still living at the same address throughout all these years. Again, the Court finds Mr. Kelly-El\u2019s testimony convincing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The Commission\u2019s exception to the trial judge\u2019s refusal to find violations of DR 1-102(A)(4) and DR 9-102(A) is based solely on Singleton\u2019s failure to submit responses to the Commission\u2019s Request for Admissions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>quest no. 40 stated, \u201cYou converted to your own use some or all of the settlement proceeds which belonged to Mr. Kelly-El without his permission or authorization.\u201d The Commission maintained that Respondent\u2019s failure to answer constitutes a conclusive admission pursuant to Md.Rule 2-424(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because there was testimony concerning the deposit of the insurance settlement proceeds into an escrow account, the circuit court was unwilling to find misappropriation violations based on the failure to respond to request no. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Upon consideration of the charges relating to misappropriation of Kelly-El\u2019s settlement money, the trial judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">It is true that it is admitted that in his representation of Mr. Kelly-El, Mr. Singleton misappropriated and converted to his own use the funds of his client represented by the insurance company settlement. However, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>evidence to indicate what facts Bar Counsel is relying on for this conclusion. Mr. Singleton\u2019s own testimony, which seems to be borne out by the other facts of the case, is that the check was deposited in his firm\u2019s escrow account, where it stayed until distributed. There is no evidence that this money was misappropriated or used by Mr. Singleton for any other purpose. To presume this would be a guess. Therefore this charge is not sustained [referring to DR 1-102(A)(4) only].<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN\">As to the contested charges relating to DR 9-102(A), the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">This court is convinced from the testimony (which was contested) that Mr. Singleton testified truthfully that Mr. Kelly-El signed an agreement, an example copy of which was placed into evidence, that indicated that he promised to pay Mr. Singleton \u00e1 fee of one-third of any gross amount collected and which further gave Mr. Singleton or his firm \u2018my power of attorney to execute any and all documents connected with the claim that I could properly execute.\u2019 Therefore, while it is clear that Mr. Singleton was not authorized to settle the matter and did so improperly, it is also equally clear that he apparently had the right to affix his client\u2019s signature to the negotiable instrument which was then placed in an escrow account awaiting distribution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Under these circumstances, the trial judge\u2019s findings as to misappropriation of client\u2019s funds were not clearly erroneous. We agree that there was no evidence that Singleton converted the funds for his own use. Furthermore, there was evidence that the $3,500 settlement check was deposited in an \u201cidentifiable bank account.\u201d The trial judge was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the best position to weigh the testimony concerning the deposit of the monies into the firm\u2019s escrow account. We find no basis for disturbing this finding. As to the charges of violations of DR 1-1Q2(A)(4) and DR 9-102(A), the Commission\u2019s exceptions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">We have consistently reaffirmed the principle \u201cthat sanctions imposed in disciplinary proceedings against an attorney are not for the purpose of punishing the individual, but are intended as protection to the public.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. </em>Kemp, 303 Md. 664, 680, 496 A.2d 672, 680 (1985); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Velasquez, </em>301 Md. 450, 459, 483 A.2d 354, 359 (1984). The severity of the sanction generally depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Babbit, </em>300 Md. 637, 642, 479 A.2d 1372, 1375 (1984). In determining the degree of discipline to be imposed, it is proper \u201cnot only to consider such circumstances as might mitigate or extenuate the offense, lout also proper to consider the attorney\u2019s prior history of misconduct and any antecedent sanctions which may have been imposed.\u201d <em>Maryland State Bar Association, Inc. v. Phoebus, </em>276 Md. 353, 362, 347 A.2d 556, 561 (1975); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Commission v. Marano, </em>306 Md. 792, 799, 511 A.2d 512, 515 (1986) (the fact that counsel has not heeded prior admonitions is a serious factor to be taken into consideration in determining sanction); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Haupt, </em>306 Md. 612, 614, 510 A.2d 590, 591 (1986) (repeated serious neglect warrants disbarment); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Howard, </em>299 Md. 731, 737, 475 A.2d 466, 469 (1984); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Heinzs, </em>293 Md. 193, 197, 442 A.2d 570, 572 (1982); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Pollack, </em>279 Md. 225, 238, 369 A.2d 61, 68 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In <em>Phoebus, </em>respondent was charged with five specific instances of \u201cneglect of legal matter[s] entrusted to him,\u201d as violations of disciplinary rule 6-!01(A)(8). Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>had previously been suspended on two prior occasions for similar misconduct. In mandating the sanction of disbarment, we reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">The Respondent\u2019s utterly inexcusable and persistent neglect, manifested over a substantial period of time, when coupled with a consideration of the prior suspensions imposed upon him for the same or similar conduct, conclusively demonstrates that he lacks the required capacity to continue to practice law and establishes his unworthiness to hold himself out to the public as a practitioner in the profession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">276 Md. at 366, 347 A.2d at 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The Commission recommends disbarment as the proper sanction. This proceeding involves the third petition in this State resulting in findings of professional misconduct against Singleton. Under the circumstances of the present case, and upon careful review of the entire record, we find no alternative other than to impose the severe sanction of disbarment. Consistent with <em>Phoebus, </em>Singleton is guilty of gross and persistent neglect. The trial court\u2019s finding of 39 disciplinary violations involving five unrelated clients is clear evidence of such neglect, and is indicative of the cumulative nature of the violations. No mitigating or extenuating circumstance for Singleton\u2019s misconduct has been presented. The fact that Singleton may have been in poor health during the relevant time periods does not justify or mitigate the severity of the continuing violations. The trial record does not substantiate Singleton\u2019s claim that his misconduct was attributable to physical illness. No expert witnesses were produced. His failure to communicate with clients and notify them of his suspension is just one example of gross neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">There is ample indication that Singleton has utterly failed to heed the warnings of his two prior suspensions, and of an earlier private reprimand, and has continued to commit serious disciplinary violations. Such sanctions were obviously ineffective in undertaking to correct the seriousness of his prior proven neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>In fulfilling ouif obligation to protect the public, we conclude that disbarment is the appropriate sanction. Therefore, the name Herbert Louis Singleton, Jr. shall be stricken from the rolls of those entitled to practice law in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE BV 15c FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST HERBERT LOUIS SINGLETON, JR.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-12\">. Singleton was suspended indefinitely with the right to reapply for admission, and has been suspended indefinitely on an unconditional basis. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v.

Kelly-El retained Samuel A. Tucker in July, 1986 to contact Singleton and to determine the status of his cases. The trial judge noted, \"The complainant read in the paper that Mr. Singleton had been suspended from the practice of law, and as a result of that, he retained Sam Tucker, Esquire, as new counsel.\u201d Kelly-El acknowledged receipt of the check from Singleton on August 20, 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b48-9\">.

On October 2, 1987, Singleton suffered from encephalitis, glaucoma and heart and blood pressure problems. In fact the circuit court proceedings were continued until October 28, 1987, to allow Mr. Singleton more time to prepare his defense, and to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>p\u00edete the requested discovery.
