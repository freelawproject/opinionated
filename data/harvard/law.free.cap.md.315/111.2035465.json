Vol.) Article 81, Section 12F-1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>section of the Code, also known as the \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d law, is a legislative device for granting property tax relief to low-income taxpayers. The term \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d is used to characterize the law which is intended to protect the taxpayer\u2019s household income from property tax overload similar to the manner in which an electrical circuit breaker protects the wiring in a taxpayer\u2019s home from current overload. Stated another way, when the taxpayer\u2019s residential property tax bill reaches a set percentage of his annual income, the circuit breaker is automatically activated so that the state government grants him relief from the excess tax load. Maryland grants relief in the form of a credit on the low-income taxpayer\u2019s income tax bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">This law reflects a legislative determination that low-income homeowners should not be forced to sell their homes to satisfy property tax deficiencies. This legislative program is particularly significant in granting relief to elderly taxpayers, whose property has appreciated while their income has remained fixed. However, relief is also available to any taxpayer, regardless of age, whose income is depressed in a particular year. Critical to a determination of whether a taxpayer is entitled to a tax credit is the amount of his annual gross income, which term is defined in \u00a7 12F-l(a)(6) of Article 81 and provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">\u201cGross income\u201d means total income from all sources, for the calendar year immediately preceding the taxable year, whether or not included in the definitions of gross income for federal or State tax purposes, including but not limited to benefits under the Social Security Act or Railroad Retirement Act as these acts may be amended from time to time, the aggregate of gifts in excess of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>$300, alimony, support money, nontaxable strike benefits, public assistance received in cash grants, pensions, annuities, unemployment insurance benefits, and workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. <em>The term includes the net income received from business, rental, or other endeavors. </em>A loss from business, rental or other endeavor may not be used in the determination of gross income. The term does not include any income tax refund received from the State or the federal government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In order to place this issue in proper focus, we recite the salient facts. In 1984, Horace E. Belcher, Jr., the appelleetaxpayer, borrowed a substantial amount of money for purposes of investment. Belcher invested the money in various stocks and realized a substantial profit. In particular, he earned $5,879.00 in dividends and $7,036.00 in long term capital gains for a total income of $12,915.00. In that year, Belcher paid $7,580.00 in interest charges on the funds he borrowed, and spent $150.00 to obtain various types of investment advice. These expenses left Belcher with a net income of $5,185.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">When Belcher filed his 1984 Maryland tax return, he also filed an application for a homeowners\u2019 property tax credit. Belcher reported his net income of $5,185.00 on this application and was initially granted a tax credit of $1,186.30 which reduced his real property tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Shortly thereafter, however, the Homeowners\u2019 Tax Credit Office (Credit Office), a division of the State Department of Assessments and Taxation (the Department), conducted an audit of Belcher\u2019s return and determined that his tax credit should be reduced to $171.59. The Credit Office\u2019s position was that Belcher should have reported $12,915.00 rather than $5,185.00 as his income. The Credit Office determined that Belcher\u2019s combined expenses of $7,730.00 should not be considered in determining the amount of property tax credit to which Belcher was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Belcher remitted the difference between the original tax credit and the adjusted tax credit, a total of $1,014.71, and appealed the adjustment to the Property Tax Assessment Appeal Board for Baltimore County (the Board). The Board found in favor of Belcher and remanded the case to the Credit Office for recomputation of the tax credit. The Department appealed this ruling to the Maryland Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The Maryland Tax Court ruled as a matter of law that Belcher\u2019s investment activities constituted an \u201cendeavor\u201d as that term is utilized within the statute. Accordingly, the Tax Court held that Belcher was entitled to report the net income he derived from his investment activities on his application for the Maryland homeowners\u2019 property tax credit. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County affirmed the Tax Court in all respects, ruling that an \u201cendeavor\u201d is an \u201cactivity for profit other than traditional business.\u201d The Department appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari prior to consideration by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Before this Court, the Department suggests that the tax credit statute, like a tax exemption provision, should be strictly construed in favor of the State. Further, the Department asserts that the taxpayer has the burden of establishing his entitlement to the tax credit and must overcome the presumption that the taxing power of the state is not relinquished. As the Department sees it, the management of one\u2019s personal stock portfolio is not \u201cbusiness, rental, or other endeavors.\u201d Belcher has allegedly failed to establish that the legislature intended that the term \u201cother endeavors\u201d encompasses his personal investment activities. Thus, the Department concludes that the gross income derived from Belcher\u2019s investment activities must be utilized in calculating Belcher\u2019s tax credit entitlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The Department further contends that the rules of statutory construction preclude a finding that the legislature intended to extend the statute to the circumstances of this case. First, the Department asserts that a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>interpretation of the phrase \u201cbusiness, rental, or other endeavors\u201d connotes an activity in which \u201csome sort of service or goods [are] offered to the public.\u201d Since Belch-er\u2019s activities were strictly personal, they do not qualify under this phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Next, the Department suggests that the circuit court\u2019s ruling that \u201cother endeavors\u201d includes any activity for profit is erroneous. The Department contends that such a broad meaning renders the antecedent words \u201cbusiness\u201d and \u201crental\u201d superfluous. The Department argues that <em>ejusdem </em>generis, a principle of statutory interpretation, requires that \u201cother endeavors,\u201d a general term, be limited in definitional scope to that given the antecedent term \u201cbusiness.\u201d The Department concludes that since management of one\u2019s own stock portfolio is not a \u201cbusiness\u201d it is, by virtue of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>not an \u201cendeavor.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Finally, the Department contends that a broad reading of \u201cother endeavors\u201d will place an unmanageable administrative burden on the Credit Office. The Department asserts that the total number of tax credit applications reviewed by the credit office will diminish by virtue of the fact that more time will have to be spent deciding whether particular activities are \u201cother endeavors\u201d and whether the expenses arising in the course of these \u201cother endeavors\u201d are properly deductible in calculating net income.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Belcher, on the other hand, seeking to have the judgments of the lower courts affirmed, filed a <em>pro se </em>brief with the Court, from which we glean the following arguments. Belcher\u2019s primary contention is that the \u201cother endeavors\u201d referred to in \u00a7 12F-l(a)(6) do not have to constitute a \u201cbusiness\u201d in the traditional sense of one offering goods or services to the public at large in order to qualify under the statute. If this Court adopts the Department\u2019s narrow definition of \u201cother endeavors,\u201d Belcher suggests that the economic implications will force him to terminate his profit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>able investment activities. Belcher proffers that if his tax credits are reduced by $1,014.17, as the Department wishes, he will be unable to pay the full amount of his property taxes. In this regard, Belcher contends that he would be in no worse financial condition if he were to cease investing and seek out the public assistance benefits which he would then be qualified to receive. From Belcher\u2019s standpoint, it is difficult to believe that the legislature structured the tax credit program so as to discourage persons like himself from engaging in profitable activities. Rather, he asserts that the proper inquiry under the circuit breaker statute is two-fold: (1) is there a profit motive for the endeavor, and, (2) are the related expenses ordinary and necessary to conduct the endeavor.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Under the facts presented in this case we agree with the courts below that Belcher\u2019s investment activity constitutes \u201cother endeavors\u201d as that term is used within \u00a7 12F-l(a)(6). We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The standard of review to be applied in cases appealed from the Maryland Tax Court is set forth in Md.Code (1957, 1980 Repl.Vol., 1987 Cum.Supp.) Art. 81, \u00a7 229(o) which provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe circuit court shall affirm the Tax Court order if it is not erroneous as a matter of law and if it is supported by substantial evidence appearing in the record.\u201d In accord with this statutory directive, the proposition is well established in the caselaw of this Court that \u201ca reviewing court is under no statutory constraints in reversing a Tax Court order which is premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Ramsey, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 834, 490 A.2d 1296, 1301 (1985). (Citations omitted). We agree with the lower courts that the issue presented in this appeal presents a solitary question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">It is recognized in both the common law and by legislative directive that exemptions from taxation are to be strictly construed in favor of the State; to doubt an exemption is to deny it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>It is a firmly established principle of law that exemptions from taxation are not favored, but are strictly construed in favor of the State____ Therefore, before any claimant can obtain an exemption, it is encumbent [sic] upon him to show affirmatively that the alleged exemption has been clearly allowed by law. If there is a real doubt upon the subject, that doubt must be resolved in favor of the State. It is only where the. deliberate purpose of the Legislature to grant an exemption is expressed in clear and unequivocal terms that a claim to an exemption can be maintained. <em>City of Baltimore v. Grand Lodge of Masons, </em>60 Md. 280, 282, 283. The rule of strict construction of tax exemptions does not call for strained or unreasonable construction to the extent of being adverse to the real legislative intention, for the judicial interpretation must always be in accordance with the actual meaning of the lawmaking power. But an exemption claim cannot be sustained unless it is shown to be within the spirit as well as the letter of the exemption law. (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-6\"><em>Pittman v.

Moreover, Maryland Code (1957, 1980 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>RepLVol.) Article 81, \u00a7 9(a), expressly provided that property tax exemptions be strictly construed. <em>Accord </em>Maryland Code (1986) \u00a7 7=101 of the Tax-Property Article. This rule of strict construction is one bom of necessity; it is a rule designed to provide continuity between those provisions which grant real property tax exemptions and Article 81, \u00a7 8(1), which provides that all real properties in this state shall be subject to assessment and taxation <em>to the fullest extent possible under the law. Accord </em>Md.Code (1986) \u00a7 6-101(a)(2) of the Tax-Property Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">This rule of construction is equally applicable when tax credits are implicated. Although tax exemptions and tax credits can be distinguished in their manner of operation, their effect on the state is the same: a reduction in the amount of revenues passing to the state. <em>See Warlick, </em>272 Md. at 545, 325 A.2d at 590; 63 Op.Att'y Gen. 38, 40 (1978); 60 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 732, 735 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Notwithstanding that \u00a7 12F-1 must be strictly construed, this Court's primary objective is to \u201cdiscover and to carry out the real legislative intention.'' <em>Maryland Medical Service, Inc. v. Carver, </em>238 Md. 466, 477-78, 209 A.2d 582, 588 (1965). <em>See also Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628 (1987); <em>Comptroller v. Mandel Re-Election Com., </em>280 Md. 575, 578-80, 374 A.2d 1130, 1132 (1977) <em>quoting State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 348 A.2d 275 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 942, 96 S.Ct. 1680, 48 L.Ed.2d 185 (1976); <em>Dep\u2019t of Assess. &amp; Tax. v. Glick, </em>47 Md.App. 150, 156-57, 422 A.2d 34, 37-88 (1980). Nevertheless, the rule of strict construction should not be utilized to defeat the intent of the legislative body. <em>See e.g., Atlantic, Gulf v. Dep\u2019t of Assess &amp; T., </em>252 Md. 173, 183, 249 A.2d 180, 186 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Our cases make clear that the primary source for determining legislative intent is the language used in the statute. <em>See Giant of Md. v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>267 Md. 501, 511, 298 A.2d 427, 433 (1973), and cases cited therein. In the context of this case, we must \u201cascertain whether the language of [\u00a7 12F- -1] clearly and unambiguously inelude[s] the claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>items by words used in their ordinary and popularly understood meaning. A court cannot extend the scope of [a tax credit] by giving to the language creating it a forced, strained, and unnatural construction.\u201d <em>Perdue, </em>264 Md. at 232, 286 A.2d at 167 (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">As indicated, our focus in this case is on the words \u201cother endeavors.\u201d Unfortunately, the legislature did not provide a definition of the term \u201cother endeavors\u201d within the circuit breaker provisions. We further note that the phrase \u201cnet income received from business, rental, or other endeavors\u201d is unique among the definitions of gross income in the circuit breaker provisions of our sister states, and thus, we are not aided by looking to other statutes. Accordingly, we turn to commonly recognized definitions of \u201cendeavor.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 748 defines \u201cendeavor\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">2. To work with set purpose: make an effort ... a serious determined effort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 473 (5th ed. 1979) defines the word:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlJ\">To exert physical and intellectual strength toward the attainment of an object. A systematic or continuous effort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">As we see it, Belcher\u2019s investment activities were clearly an endeavor within the ordinary and popularly understood meaning of that term. The Department asserts, however, that the meaning of \u201cother endeavors\u201d is limited by the rules of statutory construction, in particular, by the rule of <em>ejusdem generis. </em>Sutherland says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">The doctrine of ejusdem generis is an attempt to reconcile an incompatibility between specific and general words so that all words in a statute ... can be given effect, all parts of a statute can be construed together and no words will be superfluous. If the general words are given their full and natural meaning, they would include the objects designated by the specific words, making the latter superfluous. If, on the other hand, the series of specific words is given its full and natural meaning, the general words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>are partially redundant. The rule \u201caccomplishes the purpose of giving effect to both the particular and the general words, by treating the particular words as indicating the class, and the general words as extending the provisions of the statute to everything embraced in that class, though not specifically named by the particular words.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Sutherland, <em>Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47.17 (N. Singer 4th ed. 1985). (Footnotes omitted). On the other hand, the general words will not be restricted in meaning if upon a consideration of the context and the purpose of the particular statutory provisions as a whole it is clear that the general words were not used in the restrictive sense. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 47.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">As we see it, application of the rule of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>in the manner suggested by the Department, is unreasonable under the circumstances, and will render the words \u201cother endeavors\u201d superfluous. If \u201cother endeavors\u201d must be a business, as the Department contends, then \u201cother endeavors\u201d is subsumed within the meaning of business. This result is in contravention of the fundamental rule of construction that a statute should be construed so that all words therein are given effect, <em>see e.g., Sinai Hosp. v. Dep\u2019t of Employment, </em>309 Md. 28, 39-40, 522 A.2d 382, 388 (1987); Sutherland, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 47.21, and is inconsistent with our perceptions of the legislative intent. In light of the purpose and operation of the circuit breaker program as a whole, we are certain that the letter and the spirit of \u00a7 12F-1 is furthered by classifying Belcher\u2019s investment activities as \u201cother endeavors\u201d within the meaning of the statute. It is this net income amount which reflects Belch-er\u2019s <em>true ability to pay property taxes, </em>and therefore this amount must be utilized in calculating Belcher\u2019s tax credit entitlement. Belcher has pursued his investment activities in good faith and should not be discouraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The alternative would be to deny Belcher the tax credits and thereby raise his property tax liability. Under the circumstances presented, we see no lawful basis for deny<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>ing Belcher the same tax credits that a taxpayer engaged in a traditional \u201cbusiness\u201d would be entitled to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">As we see it, Belcher was engaged in investment activity to earn a profit. The record, and Belcher\u2019s federal tax returns, reveal that this activity was his sole source of income in 1984. Moreover, Belcher demonstrated a commitment to this type of investment activity for a substantial period of time. The mere fact that Belcher was not providing goods or services to the public is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the judgment of the circuit court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-12\">. The legislative history of the circuit breaker program can be briefly summarized. In Acts of Md.1963, ch. 883, \u00a7 2, the several counties and municipal corporations of this state were given the authority to enact ordinances, in their discretion, to provide tax credits on the basis of age, income, and value of property of the taxpayer. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957, 1965 Repl.Vol.) Art. 81, \u00a7 12D. In 1967, the legislature added \u00a7 12F to Art. 81 which made tax credits mandatory for homeowners who were over sixty-five years of age and whose income was under $5,000. Tax credits for disabled homeowners were discretionary. <em>See </em>Acts of Md.1967, ch. 142, \u00a7 4. Section 12D remained in effect. In 1970 a legislative study was conducted in regard to the effectiveness of the mandatory tax credit program. <em>See </em>Maryland Legislative Council Committee on Taxation and Fiscal Matters 202 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>(1970). Ultimately, \u00a7 12F was repealed and \u00a7 12F-1 was enacted in its place. <em>See </em>Acts of Maryland 1974, ch. 750, \u00a7 4. This latter provision mandated that tax credit entitlement be based on income rather than age. Further, the state would reimburse the local jurisdictions for revenues lost by virtue of the tax credit program. The property tax laws of Maryland have now been compiled in the Tax-Property Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland as enacted by ch. 8, Laws of Maryland, 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\">.
