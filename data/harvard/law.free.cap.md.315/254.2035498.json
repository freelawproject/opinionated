In 1965, pursuant to this enactment, Burning Tree Country Club, a golf club in Montgomery County, Maryland, entered into a 10-year agreement with the State to maintain its land as open spaces in exchange for a favorable tax assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In 1974, the General Assembly, by Ch. 870 of the Acts of 1974, amended Art. 81, \u00a7 19(e), to provide that country clubs which discriminated \u201cin granting membership or guest privileges based upon the race, color, creed, sex or national origin of any person or persons\u201d could not qualify for the preferential tax assessment. Ch. 870 provided two exceptions to the prohibition against sex discrimination: the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d provision and the \u201cperiodic discrimination\u201d provision. Ch. 870 stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">\u201cThe provisions of this section with respect to discrimination in sex shall not apply to any club whose facilities are operated with the primary purpose, as determined by the Attorney General, to serve or benefit members of a particular sex, nor to clubs which exclude certain sexes on certain days and at certain times.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In 1975, Burning Tree, which restricts its membership to men and permits only members and their male guests to use its facilities, extended its open spaces agreement with the State for another ten years. In 1978, the Attorney General of Maryland, pursuant to his authority under \u00a7 19(e)(4), determined that the sex discrimination ban in Ch. 870 was inapplicable to Burning Tree because it was operated with the primary purpose of serving one sex. In 1981, Burning Tree entered into a 50-year \u201copen spaces\u201d agreement with the State. From 1974 to the present, Burning Tree has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>been the only country club to benefit from the primary purpose provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In 1983, Stewart Bainum<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Barbara Renschler brought suit, as taxpayers and, in Ms. Renschler\u2019s case, as a woman seeking membership in Burning Tree, to have the primary purpose provision declared unconstitutional on the ground that it violated Art. 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, known as the Equal Rights Amendment or E.R.A. That case reached this Court and was decided in <em>Burning Tree Club v. Bainum, </em>305 Md. 53, 501 A.2d 817 (1985). A majority of the Court held that the primary purpose provision violated the E.R.A., <em>Burning Tree Club v. Bainum, supra, </em>305 Md. at 85-88, 501 A.2d 817 (opinion of Judge Rodowsky), 88-102, 501 A.2d 817 (opinion of Judge Eldridge joined by Judge Cole and Judge Bloom), 501 A.2d at 833-842. A somewhat different majority of the Court, however, held that the primary purpose provision was not severable from the language of Ch. 870 prohibiting sex discrimination, <em>Burning Tree Club, </em>305 Md. at 80-84, 501 A.2d at 830-833 (opinion of Chief Judge Murphy, joined by Judge Smith and Judge Orth), 305 Md. at 88, 501 A.2d at 835 (opinion of Judge Rodowsky). The Court\u2019s conclusion, therefore, was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">\u201c[t]he invalid primary purpose provision is not severable from the prohibition against sex discrimination so that the latter falls, together with the then completely superfluous periodic discrimination provision.\u201d 305 Md. at 83-84, 501 A.2d at 832.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The result of that decision was to permit Burning Tree to continue receiving its tax benefit while also maintaining its discriminatory policies. Within six weeks of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Burning Tree Club v. Bainum, </em>a bill was introduced in the General Assembly to reinstate the prohibition against sex discrimination by country clubs receiving the tax assessment benefit. The bill, as amended during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the legislative process, was ultimately enacted as Ch. 334 of the Acts of 1986. Ch. 334 as codified states in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfT\">\u201c(a) <em>In General </em>- \u2014 Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, if a country club that meets the qualifications of \u00a7 8-212 of this subtitle allows or practices discrimination based on race, color, creed, sex or national origin in granting membership or guest privileges, the country club may not make an agreement under this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\">\u201c(b) <em>Exception </em>\u2014 If the country club excludes certain sexes on specific days or at specific times on the basis of sex, the country club does not discriminate under subsection (a) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Subsection (b) of Ch. 334 is, in essence, the periodic discrimination provision which had not been specifically challenged in the prior litigation but which this Court struck down as \u201ccompletely superfluous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">On June 23, 1986, the Supervisor of Assessments for Montgomery County, acting pursuant to the new statute, notified Burning Tree that effective July 1, 1986, the country club\u2019s lands would be assessed at their full cash value because of the club\u2019s discriminatory membership policies. On June 30, 1986, Burning Tree and two of its members filed the present action in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County against the State of Maryland, the Governor, the Attorney General, and the State Department of Assessments and Taxation, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its complaint, Burning Tree asserted (1) that Chapter 334 was intended to have only prospective effect and did not affect Burning Tree\u2019s current 50-year \u201copen spaces\u201d contract with the state; (2) that if Chapter 334 was held to affect Burning Tree\u2019s current contract, it violated Art. 1, \u00a7 10 (the Contract Clause) of the United States Constitution; (3) that Chapter 384 was a special law prohib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ited by Article III, \u00a7 33, of the Maryland Constitution; (4) that Chapter 334 violated Burning Tree\u2019s members\u2019 freedom of association rights under the United States Constitution; and (5) that the periodic discrimination exception in Chapter 334 violated the E.R.A. and that the unconstitutional language was not severable from the overall prohibition of sex discrimination in Chapter 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">On July 21, 1987, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to the first four contentions but granted summary judgment in favor of Burning Tree as to the contention that the periodic discrimination provision violated the E.R.A. In addition, the circuit court agreed with Burning Tree that the periodic discrimination provision was not severable from the overall prohibition on sex discrimination in Ch. 334. The circuit court\u2019s conclusions were embodied in a declaratory judgment. While an injunction had been prayed for, the circuit court, for some unexplained reason, did not issue one, even though Burning Tree had not paid all its taxes due and had prevailed with respect to its E.R.A. contention.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The State and Burning Tree filed cross-appeals to the Court of Special Appeals, and, before any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, both sides filed in this Court petitions for a writ of certiorari. Thereafter, this Court granted both petitions. In this Court, Burning Tree advances the same five contentions made in the circuit court and set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>We shall, in agreement with the circuit court, reject the first four of Burning Tree\u2019s arguments. As to the fifth argument, we agree with the circuit court and with Burning Tree that the periodic discrimination provision violates the E.R.A. Nevertheless, we shall hold that the invalid periodic discrimination provision is severable from the broad prohibition against sex discrimination contained in Ch. 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The first issue before us is whether Ch. 884 of the Acts of 1986 addresses only future contracts and is therefore inapplicable to the 50-year contract entered into by the State and Burning Tree in 1981. Burning Tree argues that the plain language of Ch. 334, particularly the words \u201cmay not make an agreement under this subtitle,\u201d addresses only future contracts and does not affect clubs with existing agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The court below, after examining the legislative purpose and history of Ch. 334, concluded that the statute was intended to apply to contracts in force at the time it was enacted. The court noted that the statute would not apply retroactively to the tax benefits Burning Tree had already received under the contract prior to Ch. 834\u2019s enactment. We agree with the circuit court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The background and legislative history of the phrase in Ch. 884, \u201cmay not make an agreement under this subtitle,\u201d refutes Burning Tree\u2019s argument that the language applies only to future agreements. Art. 81, \u00a7 19(e), as reenacted in 1974, stated in relevant part as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0s\">\u201c4. <em>In order to qualify under this section, </em>the club shall not practice or allow to be practiced any form of discrimination in granting membership or guest privileges based upon the race, color, creed, sex, or national origin of any person or persons.... The provisions of this section with respect to discrimination in sex do not apply to any dub whose facilities are operated with the primary purpose, as determined by the Attorney General, to serve or benefit members of a particular sex, nor to the clubs which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>exclude certain sexes only on certain days and at certain times. If the Attorney General determines that a pattern of discrimination is evident in any club, he shall negotiate a consent agreement with that club to cease such discrimination. If that club breaches or violates the consent agreement or refuses to enter a consent agreement, then the Attorney General shall issue a cease and desist order to that club. If the club breaches or violates the terms of the cease and desist order, the tax exemption, tax credit or beneficial assessment shall be withdrawn,____ Further, any club which fails to qualify as a country club under paragraph (4) because the club has engaged in discrimination is not liable for unpaid taxes provided for in paragraph (7)____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">\u201c(7) <em>If prior to the expiration of the agreement, </em>or any extension thereof, ... <em>said property </em>ceases to be used as, or <em>fails to qualify as, a country club, </em>whichever is the earlier date, the unpaid taxes ... become due and payable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">This was the statutory language in effect when the current contract was entered into.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">In 1985, as part of the on-going recodification process which began in 1973, Art. 81 was revised and the relevant passages were placed in \u00a7\u00a7 8-214 and 8-215(d) of the Tax-Property Article of the Code. Those sections provide as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">\u201c\u00a7 8-214. Same \u2014 Discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">\u201c(a) <em>In General. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, if a country club that meets the qualifications of \u00a7 8-212 of this subtitle allows or practices discrimination based on race, color, creed, sex, or national origin in granting membership or guest privileges, the country club <em>may not make an agreement </em>under this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-10\">\u201c(b) <em>Exceptions. </em>\u2014 If the facilities of a country club that meets the qualifications of \u00a7 8-212 of this subtitle are operated with the primary purpose of serving or benefiting members of a particular sex or if the country <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>club excludes certain sexes on specific days or at specific times on the basis of sex, the country club does not discriminate under subsection (a) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\">\u201c\u00a7 8-215. Same \u2014 Determination of discrimination and consent agreements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">\u201c(d) <em>Assessing on failure to comply. </em>\u2014 (1) If a country club fails to comply with an order issued under subsection (c) of this section, the country club may not be assessed as a country club under \u00a7 8-213 of this subtitle until the Attorney General determines that the country club complies with the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">(2) A country club that has failed to comply with an order issued under subsection (c) of this section shall be assessed as if there were no agreement under \u00a7 8-213 of this subtitle. However the country club is not liable for the unpaid taxes described in \u00a7 8-216 of this subtitle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">According to the Revisor of Statutes, the language of \u00a7\u00a7 8-214(a) and 8-215(d) was \u201cnew language derived without substantive change\u201d from former Art. 81, \u00a7 19(e). Re-visor\u2019s Note to \u00a7\u00a7 8-214 and 8-215. The Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 8-214 adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">\u201cAlso in subsection (a) of this section, the phrase \u2018may not make an agreement under this subtitle\u2019 is substituted for the former phrase \u2018in order to qualify under this section\u2019 for clarity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">This Court has consistently taken the view that \u201c \u2018the revisor\u2019s note is a useful guide to the legislative purpose underlying [a] change in statutory language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nationwide v. USF &amp; G, </em>314 Md. 131, 147, 550 A.2d 69, 77 (1988), quoting <em>Rohrbaugh v. Estate of Stern, </em>305 Md. 443, 450, 505 A.2d 113 (1986). That the revised language at issue here created no substantive change is further underscored by the principle that \u201c \u2018a language change effected during the course of formal code revision accomplishes no substantive change absent the clearest legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Na</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>tionwide v. USF &amp; G, supra, </em>314 Md. at 147, 550 A.2d at 77, quoting <em>McGarvey v. State, </em>311 Md. 233, 242, 533 A.2d 690 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The only effect of the decision by this Court in <em>Burning Tree v. Bainum, supra, </em>was to eliminate the word \u201csex\u201d from \u00a7 8-214(a) and to eliminate the exceptions in \u00a7 8-214(b) to the prohibition against sex discrimination. Ch. 334 of the Acts of 1986 re-enacted \u00a7 8-214, making only two changes. It deleted the invalid \u201cprimary purpose\u201d provision from \u00a7 8-214(b) and it restored the word \u201csex\u201d to \u00a7 8-214(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201c(a) <em>In General </em>\u2014Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, if a country club that meets the qualifications of \u00a7 8-212 of this subtitle allows or practices discrimination based on race, color, creed, sex or national origin in granting membership or guest privileges, the country club may not make an agreement under this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">(b) <em>Exception </em>\u2014 If the country club excludes certain sexes on specific days or at specific times on the basis of sex, the country club does not discriminate under subsection (a) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">What this background makes clear is that the language at issue here \u2014 \u201cmay not make an agreement\u201d \u2014 is not new language in Ch. 334. It first appeared in the 1985 revision of Art. 81 and was intended to have the same meaning as the words \u201cin order to qualify under this section\u201d in Art. 81, \u00a7 19(e)(4)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">It is apparent that, under Art. 81, \u00a7 19(e), \u201cqualifying\u201d is an ongoing process, not merely an initial step, and that a club may \u201cfail to qualify\u201d at any time during the course of the agreement and have its \u201ctax benefit or preferential assessment ... withdrawn.\u201d This is underscored by the administrative construction of Art. 81, \u00a7 19(e). In response to the 1974 enactment, the Attorney General\u2019s Office investigated the discriminatory practices of all country clubs, regardless of whether their assessment agreements predat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ed July 1,1974, the date of the legislative enactment. Thus the Attorney General\u2019s understanding of Art. 81, \u00a7 19(e), and his practice in enforcing it, was that it applied to clubs with existing agreements. The administrative construction of a statute is, of course, entitled to weight. <em>See, e.g., Sinai Hosp. v. Dep\u2019t of Employment, </em>309 Md. 28, 46, 522 A.2d 382 (1987); <em>Balto. Gas &amp; Elec. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>305 Md. 145, 161, 501 A.2d 1307 (1986), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Moreover, the words \u201cmay not make,\u201d as codified in \u00a7 8-214, are linked to the enforcement machinery described in \u00a7 8-215. Clearly the language of \u00a7 8-215, which speaks of assessing country clubs \u201cas if there were no agreement under \u00a7 8-213 of this subtitle,\u201d contemplates enforcement against clubs with existing contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Finally, Burning Tree\u2019s construction would entirely defeat the purpose of Ch. 384. Ch. 834 was enacted within six months of, and in response to, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Burning Tree Club v. Bainum, supra. </em>The sponsor of the bill was Senator Bainum, whose lawsuit had attempted to deprive Burning Tree of its tax assessment benefit. The Legislature\u2019s obvious intent was to reenact the prohibition against sex discrimination and make it applicable to existing contracts. If we were to hold Ch. 334 inapplicable to existing contracts, no country club under a current \"open spaces\u201d contract would be required to alter discriminatory policies until its contract expired. In the case of Burning Tree, the club would continue to receive its tax benefit until the year 2031. It is implausible that the General Assembly would move with such alacrity to enact a ban on sex discrimination which would have no effect for such a long period.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In <em>State Commission on Human Relations v. Amecom Div., </em>278 Md. 120, 360 A.2d 1 (1976), this Court held that an antidiscrimination statute applied to existing contracts, rejecting an argument that the statute was not applicable to employees under employment contracts entered into before the statute passed. The Court said, \u201cthe purpose of [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>statute] may only be adequately served by retroactive application with regard to the date of formation of the contract____ [G]iving [the statute] effect only with regard to contracts of employment entered into after [the date of the statute] would mean that an employee of long standing would find the [statutory] remedy unavailable while a new employee could receive its benefits. Such an absurd result could not have been intended____\u201d 278 Md. at 127, 360 A.2d at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Similarly, in the present case, the legislative purpose of eliminating state support for discrimination would only be adequately served by making Ch. 334 applicable to current as well as future contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Burning Tree next argues that applying Ch. 334 to Burning Tree\u2019s present contract with the State impairs the obligation of the contract in violation of the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution, Art. I, \u00a7 10, which provides that \u201cno State shall ... pass any ... Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.\u201d Burning Tree contends that Ch. 334\u2019s prohibition against sex discrimination imposes a unilateral change in the contractual obligation between the State and Burning Tree. According to Burning Tree, when the 50-year contract was entered in 1981, the primary purpose exception was part of the law and the contract. The removal of the primary purpose exception by Ch. 334, the argument continues, imposes a much heavier obligation upon the club than it agreed to undertake when it signed the contract, thereby violating the Contract Clause. In our view, however, Ch. 334 does not impair the obligation of contract in violation of the Contract Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">It is a fundamental principle that contracts are subject to the public policies and valid laws existing at the time and place in which they are made. Thus the Supreme Court stated in <em>Abilene National Bank of Abilene v. Dolley, </em>228 U.S. 1, 5, 33 S.Ct. 409, 410, 57 L.Ed. 707, 709 (1913): \u201cContracts made after the law was in force, of course, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>made subject to it, and impose only such obligations and create only such property as the law permits.\u201d Consequently, courts in a wide variety of contexts have refused to enforce contractual provisions which conflicted with laws or public policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Otis &amp; Co. v. Securities and Exchange Comm., </em>323 U.S. 624, 638, 65 S.Ct. 483, 490, 89 L.Ed. 511, 522 (1945); <em>United States v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>310 U.S. 16, 28, 60 S.Ct. 749, 756, 84 L.Ed. 1050, 1059 (1940); <em>Gable v. Colonial Ins. Co., </em>313 Md. 701, 704, 548 A.2d 135, 136 (1988); <em>Lee v. Wheeler, </em>310 Md. 233, 243, 528 A.2d 912, 917 (1987); <em>Jennings v. Government Employees Ins., </em>302 Md. 352, 488 A.2d 166 (1985); <em>Budget Rent-A-Car v. Raab, </em>268 Md. 478, 482-483, 302 A.2d 11, 13-14 (1973); <em>Baxter v. Wilburn, </em>172 Md. 160, 162-164, 190 A. 773, 775 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The Maryland Equal Rights Amendment, enacted in 1972, mandated equality of rights under the law and rendered state-sanctioned sex-based classifications suspect. Decisions by this Court prior to 1981 made it clear that sex-based classifications were generally forbidden by the E.R. A. <em>See, e.g., Rand v. Rand, </em>280 Md. 508, 515-516, 374 A.2d 900 (1977); <em>Md. St. Bd. of Barber Ex. v. Kuhn, </em>270 Md. 496, 506-507, 812 A.2d 216 (1973). The E.R.A. and the judicial decisions construing it represent the law and public policy of the State. Every Maryland contract entered with the State government since the enactment of the E.R.A. has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>been subject to the constitutional provision and the judicial decisions under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">In addition, Ch. 870, enacted in 1974, among other things, denied tax benefits to country clubs that discriminated on the basis of sex. This provision was constitutional, and the 1981 contract was made subject to it as well. The fact that this particular language later became ineffective on sever-ability grounds does not alter its status as a valid public policy to which the contract was subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Ch. 870 also created a sex-based classification, permitting clubs operated with the primary purpose of serving one sex to continue receiving tax benefits. This provision violated the E.R.A. and was invalid from its inception. <em>Burning Tree v. Bainum, supra, </em>305 Md. at 84, 501 A.2d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Contracting parties are presumed to be \u201cmindful of the existing law.\u201d <em>Wright v. Commercial Sav. Bank, </em>297 Md. 148, 153, 464 A.2d 1080, 1083 (1983). Yet, despite the E.R.A. and this Court\u2019s decisions that sex-based classifications under state law were constitutionally suspect, Burning Tree purportedly relied on the invalid primary purpose provision when entering into the 1981 contract. Burning Tree now claims that Ch. 334 imposes new and onerous obligations of which it was unaware when it contracted in 1981. But Ch. 334 imposes no obligation on Burning Tree that was not imposed by valid laws and public policy in effect in 1981. It simply restores the language banning sex discrimination which was part of the law to which the contract was subject in 1981. The Contract Clause does not bind the State to carry out the terms of a statute which was unconstitutional. Such a result would violate the principle that courts will not enforce invalid terms; it would give greater weight to a contracting party\u2019s unwarranted reliance on an invalid statute than to the actual laws and public policies of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Apart from our rejection of Burning Tree\u2019s Contract Clause argument on the ground that it ignores the law and public policy existing at the time the contract was made, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>do not believe that Burning Tree\u2019s argument prevails under traditional Contract Clause analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Energy Reserves Group v. Kansas Power &amp; Light, </em>459 U.S. 400, 411, 103 S.Ct. 697, 704, 74 L.Ed.2d 569, 580 (1985), articulated the approach to be used in considering contract clause arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">\u201cThe threshold inquiry is \u2018whether the state law has, in fact operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.\u2019 <em>Allied Structural Steel v. Spannous, </em>438 U.S. 234, 244 [98 S.Ct. 2716, 2722, 57 L.Ed.2d 727] (1978)____ If the state regulation constitutes a substantial impairment, the State, in justification, must have a significant and legitimate public purpose behind the regulation, <em>United States Trust Co. [v. New Jersey], </em>431 U.S. [1], at 22 [97 S.Ct. 1505, 1517, 52 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977) ], such as the remedying of a broad and general social or economic problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">\u201cOnce a legitimate public purpose has been identified, the next inquiry is whether the adjustment of \u2018the rights and responsibilites of contracting parties [is based] upon reasonable conditions and [is] of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying [the legislation\u2019s] adoption.\u2019 <em>United States Trust Co., </em>431 U.S. at 22 [97 S.Ct. at 1517].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-9\"><em>See Chevy Chase S &amp; L v. State, </em>306 Md. 384, 416, 509 A.2d 670 (1986); <em>Robert T. Foley v. W.S.S.C., </em>283 Md. 140, 389 A.2d 350 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">We shall assume, arguendo, that Ch. 334 does operate as a substantial impairment of the contractual relationship between Burning Tree and the State. But, as the above quotation makes clear, a finding of substantial impairment is merely a threshold step; it does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the Contract Clause has been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">If the State has \u201ca significant and legitimate public purpose behind the regulation ... such as the remedying of a broad and general social or economic problem,\u201d and if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>means employed by the State are \u201cappropriate to the public purpose,\u201d then even a substantial impairment will not violate the Contract Clause. <em>Energy Reserves Group v. Kansas Power &amp; Light, supra, </em>459 U.S. at 411-412, 103 S.Ct. at 704-705, 74 L.Ed.2d at 581. The public purpose behind Ch. 334 was the elimination of state-sanctioned sex discrimination. The significance and legitimacy of this purpose is beyond doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Furthermore, the means employed in Ch. 334 are reasonable and necessary to carry out the purpose of the statute. The Supreme Court has cautioned that, \u201c[w]hen the State is a party to the contract, \u2018complete deference to a legislative assessment of reasonableness and necessity is not appropriate because the State\u2019s self-interest is at stake.\u2019 \u201d <em>Energy Reserves, supra, </em>459 U.S. at 412-413 n. 14, 103 S.Ct. at 705 n. 14, quoting <em>United States Trust Co. v. New Jersey, </em>431 U.S. 1, 26, 97 S.Ct. 1505, 1519, 52 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977). Nevertheless, the means employed in this case are not arbitrary or oppressive. Ch. 334 does not even prohibit Burning Tree from discriminating. It simply provides that, if Burning Tree continues to discriminate, its property will be assessed in the same manner as the property of other taxpayers in the area. On the other hand, Ch. 334 gives Burning Tree the choice of retaining its preferential tax assessment by discontinuing its discriminatory policies. Finally, Ch. 334 in no way requires Burning Tree to reimburse the State for any of the tax advantages it enjoyed in years previous to the enactment. The elimination of sex-discrimination was not a subterfuge for the State to extricate itself from a financial obligation. In our view, the statute imposes no greater impairment than was necessary to remove the imprimatur of the State from sex discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Burning Tree contends that Ch. 334 is a \u201cspecial law\u201d passed in violation of Art. Ill, \u00a7 33, of the Maryland Constitution. Art. Ill, \u00a7 33, provides that the General Assembly \u201cshall pass no Special Law, for any case, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>which provision has been made, by an existing General Law____\u201d This Court has identified a \u201cspecial law\u201d as \u201cone that relates to particular persons or things of a class, as distinguished from a general law which applies to all persons or things of a class.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. B. &amp; O.R. Co., </em>113 Md. 179, 183, 77 A. 433 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Burning Tree\u2019s special law argument is that Ch. 870, enacted in 1974, created a class of clubs that were permitted to discriminate on the basis of sex while enjoying the \u201copen spaces\u201d tax benefit. That class was composed of Burning Tree, which wholly discriminates on the basis of sex, and those clubs that engage in periodic discrimination. Burning Tree argues that, among all the members of that class, Ch. 334 imposes a burden only on Burning Tree, as the others remain exempt because of the periodic discrimination provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The short answer to Burning Tree\u2019s argument is that, because in Part Y of this opinion we invalidate the periodic discrimination provision, Burning Tree is not the only club in its self-described class that will be forced to change its policies or lose its tax benefit. Even if we were not to invalidate the periodic discrimination provision, however, Ch. 334 as enacted would not be a \u201cspecial law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">In <em>Cities Service Co. v. Governor, </em>290 Md. 553, 567, 431 A.2d 663 (1981), this Court examined decisions applying \u00a7 33, concluding that \u201cno mechanical rules for deciding cases\u201d exist. Nonetheless, the Court enumerated several factors to be considered in deciding whether a statute is a \u201cspecial law.\u201d The Court reiterated the importance of these factors in <em>State v. Good Samaritan Hospital, </em>299 Md. 310, 473 A.2d 892 (1984). The factors include: whether \u201cthe underlying purpose of the legislation is to benefit or burden a particular class member or members\u201d; whether particular people or entities are identified in the statute; and what \u201cthe substance and \u2018practical effect\u2019 \u201d of a statute is and not simply its form. <em>State v. Good Samaritan Hospital, supra, </em>299 Md. at 330, 473 A.2d at 902; <em>Cities Service Co. v. Governor, supra, </em>290 Md. at 569, 431 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>672-673. Our past decisions have also considered whether particular entities or individuals sought and obtained special advantages under the legislation or if other similar entities or individuals were discriminated against by the legislation. <em>Cities Service Co., supra, </em>290 Md. at 570, 431 A.2d at 673. In deciding whether a law violates \u00a7 33 in applying to only certain members of a class, we have looked to whether the statute\u2019s distinctions are arbitrary or unreasonable. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, this Court has held that some enactments were not special laws even though they applied to only a single entity. Such laws are permissible where unique circumstances render the entity a class unto itself, <em>Cities Services Co., supra, </em>290 Md. at 568, 431 A.2d at 672, or where the enactment, although it affects only one entity currently, would apply to other similar entities in the future, <em>Reyes v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>281 Md. 279, 305-306, 380 A.2d 12 (1977); <em>Potomac Sand &amp; Gravel v. Governor, </em>266 Md. 358, 379, 293 A.2d 241 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">In light of these considerations, we turn to the merits of Burning Tree\u2019s assertion that it is the only member of its class which is singled out by Ch. 334. The underlying purpose of Ch. 334 was to eliminate state conferred benefits for clubs that discriminate on the basis of sex. The legislation was not aimed at benefiting or burdening Burning Tree or any other particular club. Neither Burning Tree nor any other club is singled out by name in the statute. Nor is Burning Tree the only club to which Ch. 334\u2019s prohibition on sex discrimination applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Contrary to Burning Tree\u2019s contention that it is the only entity affected by Ch. 334, the prohibition of sex discrimination in that enactment applies to all current and future country clubs with open spaces contracts, including the other members of Burning Tree\u2019s self-described class. While Ch. 334 purports to permit clubs to engage in sex discrimination on certain days or certain times, the prohibition against sex discrimination is otherwise applicable to all members of the class in such matters as membership, facilities, dues, etc. Thus, Ch. 334\u2019s prohibition against sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>discrimination does not apply solely to Burning Tree. Nor does the periodic discrimination exception in Ch. 384 exclude Burning Tree or any other club. If it were valid, it would be available to any entity, including Burning Tree, that otherwise qualifies and desires to take advantage of it. Simply because a law prohibits an activity that an entity engages in, and provides an exception which the entity does not want to take advantage of, does not render it a special law.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">This is clearly not a case where a single entity is affected by a law. Moreover, even if this were such a case, Ch. 334 would not be a special law. As noted above, laws affecting only a single entity have been upheld where they can apply, in principle, to other similarly situated entities. In <em>Reyes v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>we held that an act empowering the county government to sell bonds in order to acquire \u201cany sports stadium or sports arena in Prince George\u2019s County\u201d was not a special law. Although only one arena existed in Prince George\u2019s County at the time, we held the statute was not a special law because \u201cif the county wishes to acquire or finance other sports facilities in the county, it may do so.\u201d 281 Md. at 306, 380 A.2d at 27. Similarly, in <em>Potomac Sand &amp; Gravel v. Governor, supra, </em>a statute which prohibited dredging in Charles County wetlands was held not to be a special law even though it currently affected only one company. The Court said: \u201c[I]f others wished to dredge the wetlands of Charles County, they too would be prohibited from doing so.\u201d 366 Md. at 379, 293 A.2d at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The decision in <em>Cities Services, supra, </em>is not inconsistent. In that ease this Court held that a \u201cmass merchandiser exception,\u201d which exempted certain retail service stations from the State\u2019s retail gasoline station divestiture law, was a special law because it benefited a single entity. However, because of the qualifying dates contained in the exemption, the single entity affected by the statute was the only entity that could ever be helped by the exemption. This is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>true in the present case as, in the future, clubs with policies similar to Burning Tree\u2019s would be similarly affected by Ch. 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">We now turn to Burning Tree\u2019s claim that Ch. 334 infringes upon the club members\u2019 freedom of association rights under the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Recent decisions by the Supreme Court have distinguished two types of associational rights. <em>Board of Directors of Rotary International v. Rotary Club, </em>481 U.S. 537, 544-45, 107 S.Ct. 1940, 1945, 95 L.Ed.2d 474 (1987); <em>Roberts v. United States Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 617-618, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 3249-3250, 82 L.Ed.2d 462, 471 (1984). <em>See also New York State Club Ass\u2019n v. City of New York, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 2233-2234, 101 L.Ed.2d 1, 15-16 (1988). The first type, which has been called \u201cfreedom of expressive association,\u201d protects the right to associate \u201cfor the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment \u2014 speech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the exercise of religion. The Constitution guarantees freedom of association of this kind as an indispensable means of preserving other individual liberties.\u201d <em>Roberts v. United States Jaycees, supra, </em>468 U.S. at 618, 104 S.Ct. at 3249, 82 L.Ed.2d at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">The second type of associational right, \u201cfreedom of intimate association,\u201d protects \u201cchoices to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships ... against undue intrusion by the State because of the role of such relationships in safeguarding the individual freedom that is central to our constitutional scheme. In this respect, freedom of association receives protection as a fundamental element of personal liberty.\u201d <em>Roberts, supra, </em>468 U.S. at 617-618, 104 S.Ct. at 3249, 82 L.Ed.2d at 471. <em>See New York State Club Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 108 S.Ct. at 2233-2234, 101 L.Ed.2d at 15-16; <em>Rotary Club, supra, </em>481 U.S. at 544-45, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>107 S.Ct. at 1945, 95 L.Ed.2d at 484.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">In contending that Ch. 334 infringes its members\u2019 rights to freedom of association, Burning Tree does not expressly draw a distinction between the two types of associational rights. The club claims that it is seeking \u201cFirst Amendment protection,\u201d which may suggest that it is relying on freedom of expressive association.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The club, however, alleges no infringement of the types of activities which freedom of expressive association protects. Rather, the club asserts that its \u201csize, purpose, policies, selectivity, congeniality\u201d and exclusivity imbue it with associational rights. These are the characteristics listed in the <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Rotary Club </em>opinions as relevant in determining whether a group may enjoy intimate associational rights which would protect the group from antidiscrimination legislation. Therefore, when analyzed, Burning Tree\u2019s argument would appear to be based on freedom of intimate association.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The Supreme Court has neither precisely defined the scope of freedom of intimate association nor delineated the sort of relationships which enjoy its protection. The Court has stated, however, that \u201c[t]he personal affiliations that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>... suggest some relevant limitations on the relationships that might be entitled to this constitutional protection, are those that attend the creation and sustenance of a family.\u201d <em>Roberts, supra, </em>468 U.S. at 619, 104 S.Ct. at 3250, 82 L.Ed.2d at 472. The Court added (468 U.S. at 619-620, 104 S.Ct. at 3250-3251, 82 L.Ed.2d at 472):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">\u201cFamily relationships ... are distinguished by such attributes as relative smallness, a high degree of selectivity in d\u00e9cisions to begin and maintain the affiliation, and seclusion from others in critical aspects of the relationship. As a general matter, only relationships with these sorts of qualities are likely to reflect the considerations that have led to an understanding of freedom of association as an intrinsic element of personal liberty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">How far the protection extends beyond familial relationships is unclear. In <em>Roberts, </em>the Court stated (468 U.S. at 620, 104 S.Ct. at 3251, 82 L.Ed.2d at 473):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">\u201c[T]he Constitution undoubtedly imposes constraints on the State\u2019s power to control the selection of one\u2019s spouse that would not apply to regulations affecting the choice of one\u2019s fellow employees____ Between these poles, of course, lies a broad range of human relationships that may have greater or lesser claims to constitutional protection from particular incursions by the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">This language suggests that relationships should be viewed along a continuum from most to least intimate, with the most intimate associations afforded the greatest protection from government interference and the least intimate afforded lesser protection. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Private Club Membership \u2014Where Does Privacy End and Discrimination Begin?, </em>61 St. John\u2019s L.Rev. 474, 490 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">In <em>Rotary Club, supra, </em>481 U.S. at 545, 107 S.Ct. at 1946, 95 L.Ed.2d at 484, the Court noted that it had \u201cnot held that constitutional protection is restricted to relationships among family members.\u201d Nevertheless, in no case has the Court actually extended the protection beyond the scope of familial relationships. For example, in <em>Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, </em>416 U.S. 1, 94 S.Ct. 1536, 39 L.Ed.2d 797 (1974), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Court held that a zoning ordinance which restricted occupancy of single-family dwellings to families or groups of no more than two unrelated persons did not infringe associational rights of six unrelated students who wanted to share a house. The Court said: \u201cThe ordinance places no ban on other forms of association, for a \u2018family\u2019 may, so far as the ordinance is concerned, entertain whomever it likes.\u201d <em>Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, supra, </em>416 U.S. at 9, 94 S.Ct. at 1541, 39 L.Ed.2d at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">In contrast, three years later, in <em>Moore v. City of East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977), the Court invalidated a zoning ordinance which limited occupancy to members of a single family but which defined \u2018family\u2019 so as not to include a grandmother living with her two grandsons. The Court stated that the municipality's reason for the ordinance, namely the alleviation of overcrowding, was inadequate to justify the intrusion \u201con choices concerning family living arrangements.\u201d 411 U.S. at 499, 97 S.Ct. at 1936, 52 L.Ed.2d at 537. The Court\u2019s plurality opinion explicitly distinguished <em>Belle Terre, </em>saying: \u201cThe ordinance [in <em>Belle Terrel </em>affected only <em>unrelated </em>individuals.... East Cleveland, in contrast, has chosen to regulate the occupancy of its housing by slicing deeply into the family itself.\u201d 431 U.S. at 498, 97 S.Ct. at 1935, 52 L.Ed.2d at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The Supreme Court in the <em>Rotary Club </em>case had little difficulty concluding that an anti-discrimination statute did not impair intimate associational rights. Despite the fact that Rotary membership was not open to the general public, and that the size of the local Rotary clubs varied widely, with some having fewer than 20 members, the Court pointed out that the Rotary Club\u2019s goal was to be inclusive, not exclusive, and to consistently grow in membership. Furthermore, the Club\u2019s activities were conducted publicly \u201crather than carrying on their activities in an atmosphere of privacy.\u201d <em>Rotary Club, supra, </em>481 U.S. at 547, 107 S.Ct. at 1947, 95 L.Ed.2d at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>While the above-mentioned factors led the Court to conclude that the challenged provision did not impair the associational rights of Rotary Club members, the Court\u2019s opinion left unanswered whether an organization such as Burning Tree might enjoy associational protection where the Jaycees and Rotary Club did not. In arguing that it does enjoy the protection, Burning Tree points to its size, approximately 440 members, and its founding as a small group of congenial men devoted solely to the game of golf. The club argues that it is selective in that individuals may not apply to join the club but must be proposed and seconded for membership by current members. A prospective member\u2019s background is carefully screened, making the admission process last at least one year. More candidates are proposed for membership than are actually admitted. Finally, the club points to its policy prohibiting discussion of business matters on the premises and the absence of non-golf activities at the club. Consideration of these factors does not, however, lead to the conclusion that the associational rights of Burning Tree\u2019s members have been unconstitutionally infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The size of Burning Tree\u2019s membership is not so small as to suggest that it is entitled to constitutionally protected intimate associational rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>New York State Club Ass\u2019n v. City of New York, supra, </em>the Supreme Court rejected a claim that New York City\u2019s Human Rights Law (N.Y.C.Admin.Code \u00a7 8-102(9) (1986)) was facially invalid. The law defined as a public accommodation subject to anti-discrimination provisions any club which \u201chas more than four hundred members, provides regular meal service and regularly receives payment for dues, fees, use of space, facilities, services, meals or beverages directly or indirectly from or on behalf of nonmembers for the furtherance of trade or business.\u201d In discussing the statute, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>noted (\u2014 U.S. at-, 108 S.Ct. at 2233, 101 L.Ed.2d at 15):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">\u201cThe clubs that are covered under the Law contain at least 400 members. They thus are comparable in size to the local chapters of the Jaycees that we found not to be protected private associations in <em>Roberts, </em>and they are considerably larger than many of the local clubs that were found to be unprotected in <em>Rotary, </em>some which included as few as 20 members.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The evidence in the record with respect to the other factors is also less than compelling. The assertion that club policy prohibits the discussion of business matters is not a sufficient basis for concluding that such discussions in fact do not take place. As for selectivity, while it appears the club will not take just anyone, it is unclear what selective criteria are required for admission other than being a male interested in golf. In short, Burning Tree has not established that it qualifies for the intimate associational rights described in <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Rotary Club.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Other courts have generally been reluctant to recognize constitutionally protected freedom of intimate association rights beyond family relationships. In <em>Concord Rod &amp; Gun Club, Inc. v. MCAD, </em>402 Mass. 716, 524 N.E.2d 1364, 1367 (1988), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts rejected a freedom of intimate association challenge to an administrative determination that a hunting and fishing club was a public accommodation subject to the state\u2019s anti-discrimination laws. The court applied the factors articulated in <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Rotary Club, </em>and concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">\u201cThe commissioner\u2019s findings leading to the conclusion that the Club does not have a selective process for admittance to membership establish with equal force that application of the anti-discrimination statute to the Club does not impair the members\u2019 rights of intimate association.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>In <em>Isbister v. Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz, Inc., </em>40 Cal.3d 72, 219 Cal.Rptr. 150, 707 P.2d 212 (1985), the Supreme Court of California held that the Boys\u2019 Club, a private Organization open to any boy but not to girls, did not enjoy intimate associational rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Commentators have differed somewhat as to the implications of <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Rotary Club </em>for various non-familial groups. One writer has stated (Comment, <em>Board of Directors of Rotary International v. Rotary Club of Duarte: Redefining Associational Rights, </em>1988 B.Y.U.L.Rev. 141, 152-153):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u201cWhether large, single-sex social organizations ... can be afforded protection as \u2018intimate associations\u2019 is no longer ... \u2018open to serious consideration.\u2019 Consequently, the freedom of \u2018expressive association\u2019 is now essentially the only available avenue for non-family type groups seeking constitutional protection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Professor William P. Marshall, in <em>Discrimination and the Right of Association, </em>81 Nw.U.L.Rev. 68, 82 (1986), pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">\u201cfew organizations are likely to merit protection as \u2018friendships\u2019 because the protectable interest does not derive from simple membership, acquaintance, or casual alliance. Even a small club with personal contact between all members is probably not sufficient to merit constitutional protection because the depth of commitment and strength of personal attachment between all members must be great to achieve any true semblance of intimacy.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Other commentators take the position that some non-familial associations are protected. <em>See, e.g., </em>Linder, <em>Freedom of Association after Roberts v. United States Jaycees, </em>82 Mich.L.Rev. 1878, 1886 (1984). Thus, Professor Linder states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">\u201ca state university regulation prohibiting single-sex organizations would be constitutionally suspect as applied to college fraternities or sororities. State regulation of private bridge clubs ... probably would be of even more dubious constitutionality.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab7\">Whatever the scope of freedom of intimate association under the federal constitution, there is little support in cases or commentary for the notion that the right extends to a sizable, all-male organization devoted to playing golf. There is even less support for the idea that the right would extend to protect that type of organization from the sort of governmental interference complained of here. If relationships are viewed along a continuum from most to least intimate with the most intimate <em>(i.e., </em>the family) having the greatest protection from interference by the State, we shall assume, for purposes of this case, that the Burning Tree Club is a more intimate organization than the Jaycees or Rotary, and that it may be protected from certain types of regulation which could be imposed upon the latter organizations. The particular government interference complained of here, however, is not as great as the interference at issue in <em>Roberts </em>and <em>Rotary Club. </em>In the present case, the State will simply withdraw a benefit from the club if it continues to discriminate, thereby placing the club on the same footing as comparably situated landowners. Under the case law dealing with organizations\u2019 claims of constitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>protected intimate associational rights, Ch. 334 would not appear to burden unconstitutionally any intimate associational rights of Burning Tree\u2019s members.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Burning Tree argues that the State is unconstitutionally withdrawing a benefit from the club, which is otherwise qualified to receive it, as a punishment for the club\u2019s exercise of its constitutional right of association. In making this contention, Burning Tree relies on two cases, <em>Speiser v. Randall, </em>357 U.S. 513, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958), and <em>Perry v. Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). In our view, and regardless of whether Burning Tree\u2019s argument is viewed as resting on freedom of expressive association or on freedom of intimate association, neither <em>Speiser </em>nor <em>Perry </em>supports Burning Tree\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In <em>Speiser, </em>the Supreme Court held unconstitutional California\u2019s practice of denying state tax exemptions to veterans who declined to take a loyalty oath. The exemptions were otherwise available to all veterans under California law. In striking down the California policy, the Court stated (357 U.S. at 519, 78 S.Ct. at 1338):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">\u201c[T]he denial of a tax exemption for engaging in certain speech necessarily will have the effect of coercing the claimants to refrain from the proscribed speech. The denial is \u2018frankly aimed at the suppression of dangerous ideas.\u2019 <em>American Communications Assn. v. Douds, supra </em>[339 U.S. 382] at 402 [70 S.Ct. 674, 686, 94 L.Ed. 925 (1972) ].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">In <em>Perry v. Sindermann, supra, </em>408 U.S. at 597, 92 S.Ct. at 2697, the Court held that a state government could not refuse to renew a teacher\u2019s contract solely because of his protected speech outside the classroom, as a government</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai5\">\u201cmay not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests \u2014 especially, his interest in freedom of speech. For if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>government could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to \u2018produce a result which [it] could not command directly.\u2019 <em>Speiser v. Randall, </em>357 U.S. 513, 526 [78 S.Ct. 1332,1342, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958) ]. Such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">While these cases stand for the proposition that the government generally may not deny benefits to persons because of the content of their speech, they are obviously distinguishable from the present case. In both <em>Speiser </em>and <em>Perry, </em>the state\u2019s action had a direct, chilling effect on the content of an individual\u2019s speech. In this case, the government is merely removing a tax benefit because of the club\u2019s discriminatory policies. No First Amendment free speech right is involved in the present case. We are unaware of any decision suggesting that the reasoning of <em>Speiser </em>and <em>Perry </em>extends to circumstances like those now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">A more analogous case is <em>Green v. Connally, </em>330 F.Supp. 1150 (D.D.C.), <em>aff'd </em>404 U.S. 997, 92 S.Ct. 564, 30 L.Ed.2d 550 (1971). In <em>Green, </em>the United States District Court upheld the denial of tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools against a challenge that the denial violated the schools\u2019 associational rights. The court distinguished <em>Speiser </em>in language equally applicable to the present situation (330 F.Supp. at 1166-1167):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\"><em>\u201cSpeiser </em>involved an affirmative requirement imposed as a condition of obtaining the tax exemptions provided for veterans by the state constitution. A statute made qualification for the exemption dependent on the filing of an oath that the applicant did not advocate the overthrow of the Government by force, violence or other lawful means. Although the statute was construed by the state court to deny exemptions only to claimants who engage in speech that may constitutionally be punished, it was enforced through procedures, placing the burdens of proof and persuasion on the taxpayers, that denied the procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>safeguards required by the due process clause, and were held to interfere with the veterans\u2019 present freedom of speech.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">\u201cIn the case before us exemptions and deductions would be denied not on account of beliefs and associations but on account of acts and practices constituting discrimination among students on account of race \u2014 acts contrary to a national policy that has constitutional ingredients. If schools sincerely terminate those harmful activities they may obtain the exemption. In <em>Speiser </em>the statutory scheme was offensive because it operated to chill speech that was permissible, because of fears that the veterans might be unable to establish its permissibility. It is not remotely suggested by intervenors that they fear lest their schools will undertake only activities that are innocent, <em>i.e., </em>not racially discriminatory, yet be wrongly condemned as discriminatory. <em>Speiser </em>certainly does not hold that a government acts impermissibly in withholding tax benefits from one who engages in activities that are reasonably and constitutionally deemed contrary to the government\u2019s policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">As in <em>Green, </em>the denial of tax benefits in the present case is not based on \u201cbeliefs and associations, but on account of acts and practices constituting discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AhE\">Furthermore, the connection between the denial of a government benefit and the protected activity is not as direct in the present case as it was in <em>Perry </em>and <em>Speiser. </em>In those cases the government benefit was available as a matter of course to all similarly situated individuals. In <em>Speiser, </em>all veterans were entitled to the tax exemption; in <em>Perry, </em>teachers routinely retained their teaching positions. In both cases the denial of the government benefit left the plaintiffs substantially disadvantaged in comparison with those similarly situated. In the present case, the tax benefit which Burning Tree enjoys is not generally available to comparable landowners. Thus, the removal of Burning Tree\u2019s benefit, rather than uniquely disadvantaging Burning Tree, simply puts the club on an equal footing with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>comparably situated landowners. The less direct the connection between the denied government benefit and the protected activity, the less likely it is that the denial violates the associational rights claimed by the party to whom the benefit is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">In <em>Regan v. Taxation With Representation, </em>461 U.S. 540, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983), the Supreme Court upheld the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s denial of tax-exempt status to organizations engaged in lobbying, rejecting Taxation With Representation\u2019s argument that the IRS\u2019s action denied the organization a benefit because of the exercise of First Amendment rights. The Court specifically distinguished <em>Speiser </em>and <em>Perry, </em>saying (461 U.S. at 545, 103 S.Ct. at 2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u201cTWR is certainly correct when it states that we have held that the government may not deny a benefit to a person because he exercises a constitutional right. <em>See Perry v. Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 597, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2697, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). But TWR is just as certainly incorrect when it claims that this case fits the <em>Speiser-Perry </em>model. The Code does not deny TWR the right to receive deductible contributions to support its non-lobbying activity, nor does it deny TWR any independent benefit on account of its intention to lobby. Congress has merely refused to pay for the lobbying out of public moneys.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">As in <em>Regan, </em>the State in the present case is not punishing or prohibiting the exercise of any associational rights which Burning Tree\u2019s members might possess. The State is simply declining to subsidize any organization that engages in certain discriminatory activities. Just because Burning Tree\u2019s members may have associational rights does not oblige the State to subsidize the exercise of those rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Other cases also support the view that a private entity\u2019s protected associational rights do not entitle the entity to government subsidies or endorsement of its activities. In <em>Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, </em>467 U.S. 69, 78, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 2235, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984), the Supreme Court rejected a claim that applying Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>to a law firm\u2019s hiring practices would infringe the firm members\u2019 rights of association, saying: \u201cInvidious private discrimination may be characterized as a form of exercising freedom of association protected by the First Amendment, but it has never been afforded affirmative constitutional protection,\u201d quoting <em>Norwood v. Harrison, </em>413 U.S. 455, 470, 93 S.Ct. 2804, 2813, 37 L.Ed.2d 723 (1973). In <em>Norwood </em>itself the Court rejected an argument that Mississippi was required to provide the same amount of assistance to private schools that it provided to public schools, regardless of whether the private schools practiced racial discrimination. The Court said (413 U.S. at 462-463, 93 S.Ct. at 2809):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">\u201c[A] State\u2019s special interest in elevating the quality of education in both public and private schools does not mean that the State must grant aid to private schools <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>without regard to constitutionally mandated standards forbidding state-supported discrimination. That the Constitution may compel tolerance of private discrimination in some circumstances does not mean that it requires state support for such discrimination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">These cases make it clear that governments are under no obligation to sanction, subsidize or support discrimination by private entities, and that the failure to subsidize discriminatory entities does not unconstitutionally burden their associational rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Finally, to whatever extent the State\u2019s denial of a preferential tax assessment is viewed as a burden on Burning Tree\u2019s members\u2019 rights of association, the State has a compelling interest justifying the imposition of such a burden. The Supreme Court has recognized that restricting associational rights \u201cmay be justified by regulations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.\u201d <em>Roberts v. United States Jaycees, supra, </em>468 U.S. at 623, 104 S.Ct. at 3252.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In <em>Bob Jones University v. United States, </em>461 U.S. 574, 103 S.Ct. 2017, 76 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983), the Supreme Court upheld the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s denial of tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory religious schools, saying, \u201cthe Government has a fundamental, overriding interest in eradicating racial discrimination in education____That governmental interest substantially outweighs whatever burden denial of tax benefits places on petitioners\u2019 exercise of their religious beliefs.\u201d 461 U.S. at 604, 103 S.Ct. at 2035, 76 L.Ed.2d at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The State of Maryland, as reflected in its Equal Rights Amendment and the numerous cases construing it, has made a commitment to equal rights for women which elevates the goal of eliminating state supported sex discrimination to a compelling state interest. That compelling interest outweighs whatever burden this tax assessment legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>may have imposed on Burning Tree\u2019s associational rights. Furthermore, the State\u2019s method of satisfying its interest is narrowly tailored to fulfill that purpose and is no more restrictive of associational freedoms than is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We now turn to Burning Tree\u2019s E.R.A. challenge to Ch. 334. Burning Tree asserts that it has standing to bring this challenge under the E.R.A., that the periodic discrimination provision of Ch. 334 violates the E.R.A., and that that provision is not severable from Ch. 334\u2019s prohibition against sex discrimination. The State argues that Burning Tree lacks standing to bring an E.R.A. challenge, that the periodic discrimination provision does not violate the E.R.A., and that, if it does, the provision is severable from the remainder of Ch. 334. We agree with Burning Tree that it has standing to bring the challenge and that the periodic discrimination provision violates the E.R.A. We agree with the State, however, that the provision is severable from the remainder of Ch. 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The State maintains that neither Burning Tree nor its individual members have standing to raise an E.R.A. challenge. First, the State reasons that the E.R.A. creates purely personal rights which cannot be asserted by a corporation like Burning Tree. Second, the State argues that the club and its individual members lack standing as taxpayers because they suffer no direct injury from the periodic discrimination provision. According to the State, Burning Tree and its members are trying to \u201cleapfrog\u201d or \u201cbootstrap\u201d standing in the hope that, if the periodic discrimination provision is ruled unconstitutional, it will also be held not severable from the remainder of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">With regard to the State\u2019s argument that a corporation cannot bring an E.R.A. claim other than in its capacity as a taxpayer, it has been said that whether constitutional protections are available to corporations as well as individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>\u201cdepends on the nature, history, and purpose of the particular provision.\u201d <em>First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 779 n. 14, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 1416-1417 n. 14, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). We note that this Court has entertained E.R.A. challenges brought by corporate entities. <em>See Condore v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>289 Md. 516, 425 A.2d 1011 (1981); <em>Massage Parlors, Inc. v. City of Balto, </em>284 Md. 490, 398 A.2d 52 (1979). In neither of those cases, however, was the question of standing raised before this Court. Because the parties in this case include two individual members of Burning Tree, who can certainly raise an E.R.A. challenge, and because we hold that both Burning Tree and its members have taxpayer standing to challenge Ch. 334, we need not decide whether the club would otherwise have standing to bring this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Under Maryland law, the doctrine of taxpayer standing is not as narrowly limited as it is under the law of some jurisdictions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cIn Maryland, taxpayers have standing to bring suit to challenge the constitutionality of a statute when the statute as applied increases their taxes.\u201d <em>Murray v. Comptroller, </em>241 Md. 383, 391, 216 A.2d 897, 901, <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 816, 87 S.Ct. 36, 17 L.Ed.2d 55 (1966). <em>See Inlet Associates v. Assateague House, </em>313 Md. 413, 440-441, 545 A.2d 1296, 1310-1311 (1988). In the instant case the State, acting pursuant to Ch. 334, has taken steps to increase the tax liability of Burning Tree by over $300,000. Clearly, Ch. 384 as applied increases Burning Tree\u2019s tax burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The State argues, however, that Burning Tree and its members lack standing because, according to the State, they suffer no direct tax injury from the challenged periodic discrimination provision. The State\u2019s position is factually incorrect. Burning Tree\u2019s tax burden is, indeed, greater as a result of the allegedly unconstitutional tax exemptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>granted to other country clubs by the periodic discrimination provision. <em>See, e.g., Murray v. Comptroller, supra, </em>241 Md. at 391, 216 A.2d at 901-902, in which a taxpayer was accorded standing to' challenge allegedly unconstitutional tax exemptions given to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">More generally, there is no requirement in Maryland law that the tax injury suffered in order to gain taxpayer standing must flow directly from the challenged portion of the statute. The State cites no Maryland case holding that a taxpayer, whose tax burden is increased by a statute, lacks standing to challenge that statute in its entirety when the allegedly unconstitutional portion does not, by itself, directly increase his tax burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Our decisions have not required the close nexus between the challenged portion of a statute and the tax burden incurred by the plaintiff which the State argues for here. All that we have required is that the taxpayers\u2019 tax burden be increased, or even threatened to be increased, by the challenged law.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Somewhat analogous to the present case is <em>Citizens Planning and Housing Ass\u2019n v. County Executive, </em>273 Md. 333, 329 A.2d 681 (1974), in which taxpayers were held to have standing to challenge the County Executive\u2019s reorganization of the Office of Planning and Zoning. The plaintiffs alleged that the county executive\u2019s acts violated the separation of powers provision in a county\u2019s charter. This Court accorded them standing even though they were clearly not directly injured by the county executive\u2019s alleged violation of separation of powers. Rather they were indirectly injured in that the county executive\u2019s alleged violation arguably led to inefficient government operations, thereby raising taxes. <em>See also James v. Anderson, </em>281 Md. 137, 377 A.2d 865 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Similarly, in <em>Gordon v. Baltimore, </em>258 Md. 682, 267 A.2d 98 (1970), this Court held that a taxpayer had standing to challenge Baltimore City\u2019s acceptance of library books in violation of the terms of a gift. Even though the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>was not directly affected by the illegal act, he was given standing because the City\u2019s action might increase his tax burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The cases in this Court generally stand for the principle that a taxpayer has standing to challenge a statute\u2019s constitutionality upon a showing that the statute, as applied, actually or potentially increases the plaintiff\u2019s tax burden. Therefore, Burning Tree has standing to challenge the periodic discrimination provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The E.R.A. states: \u201cEquality of rights under the law shall not be abridged or denied because of sex.\u201d In deciding whether Ch. 334 violates the E.R.A., we employ an analysis similar to that used in <em>Burning Tree Club v. Bainum, supra. </em>We must first determine whether state action is present and, if so, whether the periodic discrimination provision abridges equality of rights on the basis of sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">All of the opinions in <em>Burning Tree v. Bainum, </em>took the position that a finding of state action is necessary in order for there to be a violation of the E.R.A. 305 Md. at 73, 501 A.2d at 827 (Murphy, C.J.), 305 Md. at 86, 501 A.2d at 833-834 (Rodowsky, J.), 305 Md. at 90, 501 A.2d at 836 (Eldridge, J.). The State suggests that \u201c \u2018state action\u2019 is more difficult to find\u201d in the enactment of Ch. 334 because Ch. 334 \u201cdoes not confer a tax break \u2018pursuant to a statutorily created state administrative proceeding, in which it is determined that the private party is engaged in statutorily sanctioned sex discrimination.\u2019 \u201d (State\u2019s brief, p. 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In <em>Bainum, </em>however, a majority of this Court took the position that the enactment of legislation which on its face draws classifications based on sex is state action sufficient to invoke the E.R.A. Thus, Judge Rodowsky wrote: \u201c[T]he General Assembly has included in Ch. 870 a prohibition against discrimination based on sex. That legislation is state action. Obviously the equality \u2018under law\u2019 which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>E.R.A. guarantees embraces an enactment by the General Assembly.\u201d 305 Md. at 86, 501 A.2d at 833-834. Similarly, Judges Eldridge, Cole and Bloom expressed the view that \u201cCh. 870 on its face expressly draws classifications which implicate the E.R.A.\u201d 305 Md. at 92, 501 A.2d at 837. Ch. 334 in this case, as did Ch. 870 in <em>Bainum, </em>draws explicit distinctions based on sex. The statute distinguishes between sex discrimination and other types of discrimination, as well as between periodic gender-based discrimination and total gender-based discrimination. Thus, the enactment of Ch. 334 is itself state action.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">As to whether the periodic discrimination provision abridges equality of rights because of sex, the analytically indistinguishable <em>Bainum </em>case, once again, is our guidepost. In that case Judge Rodowsky found the primary purpose provision unconstitutional on its face because it \u201csingle[d] out for special exception from an otherwise uniformly applicable anti-discrimination measure private discrimination of a certain type \u2014 sex\u2014and to a certain degree \u2014total\u2014which neither the State nor a private club receiving a tax exemption could otherwise practice.\u201d 305 Md. at 85, 501 A.2d at 833. Judges Eldridge, Cole and Bloom expressed the same view, stating that Ch. 870 was fatally flawed in drawing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">\u201can express distinction between race, color, creed and national origin discriminations on the one hand, and sex discrimination on the other hand. It also expressly distinguishes between two types of sex discrimination, allowing sex discrimination when it is the \u2018primary purpose\u2019 of the club and disallowing it in other situations.\u201d 305 Md. at 92, 501 A.2d at 837 (Eldridge, J.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Ch. 334 fails in exactly the same way that Ch. 870 did. On its face Ch. 334 makes classifications using sex as a factor. First, the statute distinguishes between sex discrimination and other types of discrimination. Second, the statute creates a classification that distinguishes between discrimination on the basis of sex which is periodic (permitted) and discrimination on the basis of sex which is total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>(prohibited). Indeed, Judge Rodowsky\u2019s opinion in <em>Bainum </em>expressly stated that the periodic discrimination provision was invalid for the same reasons as the primary purpose provision. 305 Md. at 87, 501 A.2d at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">As the earlier <em>Bainum </em>case made clear, the burden of justifying these classifications falls upon the State. The level of scrutiny to which the classifications are subject is \u201cat least the same scrutiny as racial classifications.\u201d 305 Md. at 98, 501 A.2d at 840). The State\u2019s justifications for the statute are that: (1) there has been no showing that \u201ca substantial discrimination\u201d is at issue; (2) the periodic discrimination provision permits such activities as \u201call-male or all-female member guest tournaments and professional-amateur tournaments for women or men only\u201d; and (8) physical differences between men and women might affect the speed of their respective golf games, thereby justifying separate playing times in order to maximize efficient use of the golf facilities. (State\u2019s brief, pp. 28-28).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The State\u2019s first argument is without merit. The \u201cperiodic discrimination\u201d provision, on its face, permits the segregation of facilities on the basis of sex. Plainly, under prior holdings of this Court, state action providing for segregation based upon sex, absent substantial justification, violates the E.R.A., just as segregation based upon race violates the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Burning Tree Club v. Bainum, supra, </em>305 Md. at 95-98, 501 A.2d at 838-840. We reject the State\u2019s views that only a \u201csubstantial\u201d discrimination requires justification of the State, and that there was no substantial discrimination shown in this case. Any statute which discriminates on the basis of sex requires justification. The E.R.A. \u201cabsolutely forbids the determination of such \u2018rights,\u2019 as may be accorded by law, solely on the basis of one\u2019s sex.\u201d <em>Burning Tree Club v. Bainum, supra, </em>305 Md. at 70, 501 A.2d at 825 (Murphy, C.J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The State\u2019s arguments that Ch. 334 is justified because it permits all-male and all-female sports events and because it recognizes distinctions in the golf abilities of men and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>women are also unpersuasive. We need not here decide whether single-sex golf tournaments or similar practices, which the State would deem insubstantial, are permissible under the E.R.A. Nothing in the statute narrowly confines the permitted sex discrimination to such practices. In fact, single-sex golf tournaments may not even be encompassed by the periodic discrimination provision, which relates to excluding members of one sex on a \u201cday\u201d or \u201ctime\u201d basis but not an \u201cevent\u201d basis. The statute, on its face, permits a club to engage in periodic sex discrimination in any of its facilities for any reason at all. It would permit the exclusion of women, for example, on four or five days of the week, just so the exclusion is not for all seven days. In order to justify a racially or sexually discriminatory statute, it is not enough for the State to claim legitimate interests which it seeks to further. Under strict scrutiny, legislation must be narrowly tailored and precisely limited to achieving those legitimate ends. In an equal protection context, the Supreme Court said in <em>Dunn v. Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330, 343, 92 S.Ct. 995, 1003, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">\u201cIt is not sufficient for the State to show ... a very substantial state interest. In pursuing that important interest the State cannot choose means that unnecessarily burden or restrict constitutionally protected activity. Statutes affecting constitutional rights must be drawn with precision ... and must be \u2018tailored\u2019 to serve their legitimate objectives____And, if there are other, reasonable ways to achieve those goals with a lesser burden on constitutionally protected activity, a State may not choose the way of greater interference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Consequently, we conclude that the periodic discrimination provision of Ch. 334 violates the E.R.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The final issue is whether the periodic discrimination provision is severable from the remainder of Ch. 334. Resolving questions of severability \u201cinvolves ascertaining what would have been the intent of the Legislature had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>partial invalidity been known.\u201d <em>Burning Tree Club v. Bainum, supra, </em>305 Md. at 82, 501 A.2d at 832 (Murphy, C.J.). Certain principles are pertinent in determining that intent. One is the strong presumption \u201cthat a legislative body generally intends its enactments to be severed if possible.\u201d <em>O.C. Taxpayers v. Ocean City, </em>280 Md. 585, 600, 375 A.2d 541, 550 (1977). <em>See also Turner v. State, </em>299 Md. 565, 576, 474 A.2d 1297, 1303 (1984); <em>Cities Service Co. v. Governor, supra, </em>290 Md. at 575, 431 A.2d at 675. A second principle is that, \u201cwhen the dominant purpose of a statute may largely be carried out notwithstanding the invalid provision, courts will ordinarily sever the statute and enforce the valid portion.\u201d <em>Davis v. State, </em>294 Md. 370, 384, 451 A.2d 107, 114 (1982). <em>See also, Turner v. State, supra; Cities Service Co. v. Governor, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">In <em>Burning Tree Club v. Bainum, supra, </em>the majority concluded that it was not \u201cthe dominant purpose of the General Assembly ... to enact a bar against sex discrimination which was to operate absent the primary purpose provision.\u201d 305 Md. at 83, 501 A.2d at 832. The legislative history of Ch. 334, on the other hand, clearly shows that the \u201cdominant purpose\u201d of the General Assembly in enacting Ch. 334 was to reinstate sex as a prohibited basis for discrimination, regardless of the validity of the periodic discrimination provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Ch. 334 was introduced as S.B. 483 by Senator Bainum, a plaintiff in the <em>Burning Tree Club v. Bainum </em>case. As initially introduced the bill restored the language prohibiting sex discrimination which this Court struck down in <em>Bainum. </em>There was originally no periodic discrimination provision. On February 28, 1986, the Attorney General\u2019s office wrote to Senator Bainum in response to his request for an opinion as to the constitutionality of a bill containing the periodic discrimination provision. The Attorney General\u2019s letter stated that S.B. 483 would not be rendered unconstitutional by the periodic discrimination provision. The Attorney General reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\u201cthe \u2018periodic discrimination' provision was not challenged in the <em>{Bainum </em>] litigation and thus was not declared invalid. Thus, presumably it is still a part of existing law \u2014 although in a dormant state because it is an exception to a ban on sex discrimination that has been declared invalid and presently unenforceable. The proposed amendment to Senate Bill 483 would not reintroduce into the law the \u2018periodic discrimination\u2019 provision. It would simply leave in the law a provision that is already there and that has not yet been definitely judicially scrutinized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Although the Attorney General\u2019s analysis of <em>Bainum\u2019s </em>disposition of the periodic discrimination provision was incorrect,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the General Assembly did follow the Attorney General\u2019s advice. This shows that the inclusion of the periodic discrimination provision, rather than a dominant legislative purpose, was simply intended to be a reenactment of \u201ca provision that is already there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In a favorable Committee Report on Senate Bill 483, which became Ch. 334, the Bill\u2019s purpose was described as \u201creinstating] in the law the prohibition on sex discrimination by country clubs who receive the preferred country club assessment on their real property. The bill does this by removing the exemption to the prohibition. This exemption to the prohibition is that the primary purpose of the clubs may be ... serving or benefiting members of a particular sex.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201cLast December the Court of Appeals utilizing the severability concept struck down the prohibition on discrimination on account of sex, because it had the exemption for country clubs. This is the severability concept used by the courts, and it is the subject addressed in this bill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>This statement makes clear that the dominant purpose of the enactment was restoring the prohibition against sex discrimination. The failure to mention the periodic discrimination provision in the Report confirms that the General Assembly did not view the provision as an important addition.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">In a May 7,1986, letter from the Attorney General to the Governor, prior to his signing Ch. 834 into law, the Attorney General expressed the view that the periodic discrimination provision would be severable. The Attorney General reiterated his view as to the <em>Bainum </em>decision\u2019s effect on the periodic discrimination provision and stated as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">\u201cThis letter [of Feb. 28] was distributed to members of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee and the Counsel to the General Assembly appeared before the Committee on February 28, 1986 to explain the advice. At that time, <em>the Committee Chairman specifically asked whether Senate Bill 483 would be severable from the periodic discrimination exemption and was advised that it would be. </em>The severability issue was also raised when Senate Bill 488 was before the House Ways and Means Committee ... as members debated whether an amendment to the bill was needed to insure its constitutionality.... After the February 28, 1986 letter of advice was distributed to committee members, the decision was apparently reached that it was not necessary to amend the bill or add a severability clause____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201cIn light of this legislative history, it is our opinion that Senate Bill 483 is constitutional and would be severable from the periodic discrimination provision of \u00a7 8-214....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The General Assembly\u2019s being informed that the periodic discrimination provision would be severable, further buttresses the conclusion that the dominant purpose of Ch. 884 was to prohibit sex discrimination, regardless of the presence or absence of the periodic discrimination provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>We hold, therefore, that the periodic discrimination provision is invalid and severable. The prohibition against sex discrimination in \u00a7 8-214 of the Tax-Property Article remains viable and applicable to Burning Tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION.

Bainum, </em>305 Md. 53, 501 A.2d 817 (1985) <em>(Burning Tree I) </em>that the so-called \u201cperiodic discrimination\u201d provision violates the E.R.A. It does so in light of the majority view of <em>Burning Tree I </em>that the \u201cperiodic discrimination\u201d provision violated the E.R.A. Of course, Burning Tree\u2019s position in this respect is taken, not from conviction that <em>Burning Tree I </em>was correct, but rather to lay the underpinning for its argument that the \u201cperiodic discrimination\u201d provision cannot be severed from the remainder of Chapter 334 and, hence, the entire act is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The E.R.A. declares that \u201c[EJquality of rights under the law shall not be abridged or denied because of sex.\u201d I agree with the position taken by Chief Judge Murphy in announcing the judgment of the Court in <em>Burning Tree I, </em>in which Judges Smith and Orth concurred. There, he recognized that the E.R.A. was prompted by the long history of denial of equal rights for women. The E.R.A., he said, \u201cflatly prohibits gender-based classifications, either under legislative enactments, governmental policies, or by application of common law rules, in the allocation of benefits, burdens, rights and responsibilities as between men and women.\u201d 305 Md. at 64, 501 A.2d 817. He pointed out that our cases, and those of other jurisdictions having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>similar E.R.A. provisions in their constitutions, clearly indicate that they prohibit <em>unequal </em>treatment imposed by law as between the sexes. <em>Id. </em>at 70, 501 A.2d 817. He noted that these cases shared a common thread \u2014 \u201cthey generally invalidate governmental action which imposes a burden on one sex but not the other, or grants a benefit to one but not the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The equality between the sexes mandated by the E.R.A., he said, is of \u201crights\u201d of individuals \u201cunder the law,\u201d as to which the E.R.A. absolutely forbids their determination solely on the basis of one\u2019s sex. <em>Id. </em>In this formulation there must be a denial or abridgement of equal rights under the law as between men and women, absent which the E.R.A. has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">In enacting Chapter 334, and including the \u201cperiodic discrimination\u201d provision as an exception to the general proscription against sex discrimination in the granting by country clubs of \u201cmembership and guest privileges,\u201d the legislature manifestly determined that it was not inconsistent with the E.R.A. or with the general prohibition against sex discrimination, to permit, on an equal basis, the exclusion of one sex, or the other from the club\u2019s activities or facilities \u201con specific days or at specific times.\u201d The obvious purpose of this provision \u2014 one of long duration in the operation of country clubs which antedates by many years the enactment of the E.R.A. \u2014 is to permit country clubs participating in the open space program to hold \u201cmen\u2019s or women\u2019s golf or tennis tournaments, or to ... [permit] men\u2019s or women\u2019s days or times on the course or courts, or to otherwise ... [permit] the continuance of time allocations that traditionally had been treated as reasonable and nondiscriminatory even though based on sex classification.\u201d Plainly the exception does not smack of a nefarious state-sponsored scheme to invidiously discriminate against men or women solely on account of their sex; it simply does not apportion or distribute benefits or burdens unequally among the sexes within the contemplation of the E.R.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Of course, I recognize that a statutory provision, although couched in gender neutral terms, may be applied in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>an <em>invidiously </em>discriminatory manner and thus constitute a violation of the E.R.A. While I agree with the Court that the provision could have been more narrowly and artfully drawn, it is not <em>facially </em>at odds with the E.R.A. In my view, neither the legislature in proposing the E.R.A. or the people in adopting the amendment ever dreamed that it would be taken to such extreme lengths as to, in effect, virtually mandate a form of \u201ctogetherness\u201d desired by neither sex. Such an interpretation, I think may well threaten to undermine the continuing acceptance of the E.R.A. itself, a dreadful result indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">If the \u201cperiodic discrimination\u201d provision is unconstitutional, I do not agree that it is severable from the remainder of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The majority recites, and then relies upon, the principle that \u201ca legislative body generally intends its enactments to be severed if possible.\u201d Majority opinion at [297]. That is a valid principle, and it is backed up by Article 1, \u00a7 23, Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.). What the majority here apparently overlooks, but what a different majority did not overlook in <em>Burning Tree I, </em>is that the principle does not apply when the invalid portion of a statute is an exception to a prohibition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">A long established principle of statutory construction in determining severability questions, is that where the Legislature enacts a prohibition with an excepted class, and a court finds that the classification is constitutionally infirm, the court will ordinarily not presume that the Legislature would have enacted the prohibition without the exception, thereby extending the prohibition to a class of persons whom the Legislature clearly intended should not be reached. <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 82 [501 A.2d 817], quoting from <em>State v. Schuller, </em>280 Md. 305, 319, 372 A.2d 1076 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">To the same effect, <em>see </em>2 Sutherland <em>Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 44.13 (4th ed.), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>When an exception, exemption, proviso, or any clause which limits the scope of an act\u2019s applicability is found to be invalid, the entire act may be void on the theory that by striking out the invalid exception the scope of the act has been widened and therefore cannot properly represent the legislative intent. To extend the scope of an act\u2019s operation by invalidating a provision of limitation while allowing the remainder to continue in effect invites criticism on the ground that it amounts to judicial legislation. (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">During the 1988 session of the General Assembly, after this Court had made clear that this was the law followed in Maryland, House Bill 844 was introduced to amend Art. 1, \u00a7 23 of the Maryland Code by adding the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">The presumption of severability of statutes under this section applies even if the invalid portion of a statute is an exception to a prohibition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The bill did not pass. The law remains as it was. The first part of ch. 334 constituted a general prohibition of the practice of discrimination. The second part may be considered an exception to the general prohibition. There is, therefore, no presumption of severability in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The presumption, even when applicable, serves only as an aid in determining probable legislative intent. And, as this Court pointed out in <em>O. C. Taxpayers v. Ocean City, </em>280 Md. 585, 375 A.2d 541 (1977), we look not to the actual intent of the legislature in passing the statute, but rather to what would have been the intent of the legislative body if it had known that the statute could be only partially effective. In the context of the case before us, the question is whether the legislature would have imposed the absolute ban of the first section of the statute had it known that the exception in the second section would be declared invalid. I cannot say with any confidence that the legislature would have done so, and therefore I decline to legislate by the scalpel of severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>I am struck by the fact that when the legislature considered ch. 334 in 1986, it had just been through this entire exercise with the same statute. By ch. 870 of the Acts of 1974, the legislature had imposed upon participating country clubs a general prohibition against discrimination, immediately followed by exceptions for clubs primarily intending to benefit a particular sex, and clubs which excluded certain sexes only on certain days and at certain times. On December 23,1985, just prior to the opening of the 1986 session of the General Assembly, this Court held the primary purpose exception was unconstitutional and, specifically stating that the Court would not indulge a presumption of severability when the invalidated statute was an exception to a general prohibition, refused to sever. The Court said that \u201csevering the primary purpose provision would make the prohibition against sex discrimination operate as to single-sex country clubs and thereby enlarge [the] prohibition beyond its reach as enacted.\u201d <em>Burning Tree I, </em>305 Md. at 82, 501 A.2d 817. Six weeks later, the bill we now consider was introduced. It is inconceivable to me that the legislature could have misunderstood the clear language of <em>Burning Tree I </em>when it set about \u201cfine tuning\u201d the exception in an effort to make it constitutional. The legislature did not make a radical change in an effort to escape this Court\u2019s decision of non-severability. Quite the contrary, it employed the same approach it had previously taken, simply deleting the primary purpose clause from the exception. If ever a legislative body had a right to believe that if its second attempt at defining an exception also proved lacking, it simply would be sent back to the drafting board, and not suffer the enactment of a prohibition far more sweeping than it had approved, it was the General Assembly of 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The exception in Chapter 334 was intended, I believe, to be an integral part of the bill. Its genesis does not date to the drafting of the 1986 Act, but to a Senate amendment to the 1974 Act. The legislators apparently did not wish to pass a bill that would preclude country clubs from holding men\u2019s or women\u2019s golf or tennis tournaments, or from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>establishing men\u2019s or women\u2019s days or times on the course or courts, or to otherwise proscribe the continuation of time allocations that traditionally had been treated as reasonable and non-discriminatory even though based on sex classification. When the 1974 Act was declared unconstitutional, and Senate Bill 483 was introduced, the exception was included in the original draft. Constituents then reminded their representatives of the need for the exception.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Senate Budget and Taxation Committee Floor Report assured the membership that passage of the bill would not affect the ability of the clubs to \u201chave such activities as men\u2019s/women\u2019s days or tournaments.\u201d Every member of the 1986 General Assembly voting for Senate Bill 483 had the right to assume that the bill would either survive as a whole or fail as a whole, and to be confident that we would not rewrite their legislation into the unlimited prohibition they had twice attempted to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The method by which the legislature structured the exception is also significant. It did not say, as the majority suggests by the use of the term \u201cperiodic discrimination,\u201d that discrimination was generally proscribed but that certain discrimination would be permitted. Instead, the legislature proscribed discrimination based on sex, and then defined discrimination so as not to include exclusion of either sex on specific days or at specific times. The prohibition of \u201cdiscrimination based on sex\u201d in subsection (a) is no broader than the specific definition of that term contained in subsection (b). I can think of no more obvious way to change the intent of the legislature than to judicially excise the limiting definition while leaving the balance of the statute intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Whether the legislature would have enacted Senate Bill 483 with no limiting definition of what it meant by sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>discrimination is entirely conjectural. The system of property tax assessment agreements that this legislation would affect is obviously perceived as beneficial to the State and its political subdivisions. In addition to the preservation of open spaces, there are obvious economic advantages that I believe the legislature could find significantly outweigh the tax concessions made. The history of this legislation indicates that the General Assembly did not wish to impose unnecessary and unwanted restrictions on country clubs, or to unnecessarily disturb an arrangement that is of benefit to the State. My best judgment is that if made aware the exception was overly broad, the legislature would have attempted to spell out an exception that would largely comport with existing practices of the country clubs and at the same time satisfy this Court's legitimate concern with overbreadth. I cannot say with any measure of confidence that the legislature would have passed this bill without the definition subsection that spelled out its true intent, and I therefore respectfully dissent from the holding that the statute is severable.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">MURPHY, C.J., joins in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-6\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>the letters of Doctor Luther Gray, past president of Congressional Country Club, and Mr. Jerome Powell on behalf of the Chevy Chase Club, contained in the record of the legislative history of Senate Bill 483, Department of Legislative Reference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
