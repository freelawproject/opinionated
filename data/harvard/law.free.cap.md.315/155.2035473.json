In particular, we are presented with the question of which party carries the burden of persuading the trier of fact in regard to whether the interceptor was or was not acting under the direction and supervision of a Maryland investigative or law enforcement officer and was or was not gathering evidence about one of the listed criminal activities in compliance with \u00a7 10-402(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">The Maryland General Assembly adopted the Act in 1977. <em>See </em>Ch. 692, Acts of 1977. It is first and foremost a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>criminal statute. Section 10-402 outlines what is \u201cunlawful\u201d and \u201clawful\u201d under the Act and, in parts pertinent to our consideration here, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">(a) <em>Unlawful acts. </em>\u2014 Except as otherwise specifically provided in this subtitle it is unlawful for any person to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">(1) Wilfully intercept, endeavor to intercept, or procure any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">(2) Wilfully disclose, or endeavor to disclose, to any other person the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this subtitle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">(3) Wilfully use, or endeavor to use, the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">(b) <em>Penalty. </em>\u2014 Any person who violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of a felony and is subject to imprisonment for not more than 5 years or a fine of not more than $10,000, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">(c) <em>Lawful </em>acts.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-11\">(2) It is lawful under this subtitle for an investigative or law enforcement officer acting in a criminal investigation or any other person acting at the prior direction and under the supervision of an investigative or law enforcement officer to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication in order to provide evidence of the commission of the offenses of murder, kidnapping, gambling, robbery, any felony punishable under the \u201cArson and Burning\u201d subheading of Article 27, bribery, extortion, or dealing in controlled dangerous substances, including violations of Article 27, \u00a7 286B or \u00a7 287A, or any conspiracy or solicitation to commit any of these offenses, or where any person has created a barricade situation and probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>cause exists for the investigative or law enforcement officer to believe a hostage or hostages may be involved, where the person is a party to the communication or one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to the interception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Section 10-410, which provides for civil liability as an additional enforcement mechanism, sets forth both the civil cause of action and an affirmative defense in the form of \u201cgood faith reliance on a court order or legislative authorization .... \u201d It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">(a) <em>Civil liability. </em>\u2014 Any person whose wire, oral, or electronic communication is intercepted, disclosed, or used in violation of this subtitle shall have a civil cause of action against any person who intercepts, discloses, or uses, or procures any other person to intercept, disclose, or use the communications, and be entitled to recover from any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">(1) Actual damages but not less than liquidated damages computed at the rate of $100 a day for each day of violation or $1,000, whichever is higher;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">(2) Punitive damages; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">(3) A reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and other litigation costs reasonably incurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">(b) <em>Defense. </em>\u2014 A good faith reliance on a court order or legislative authorization shall constitute a complete defense to any civil or criminal action brought under this subtitle or under any other law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">Section 10-410(a) makes clear that in order for a plaintiff to maintain a civil action the defendant must have acted \u201cin violation\u201d of the Act The focal issue at trial in this case was whether the conduct of defendants-appellees, Gregory Seitz (Seitz) and William Kisby (Kisby), came, in fact, within the scope of \u00a7 10-402(e)(2), and thus was not \u201cin violation\u201d of the Act. The facts adduced on this issue and their significance were, of course, fiercely disputed at trial. Since this particular trial issue underlies the one we address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>here, and relates directly to whether Seitz and Kisby carried the burden of production of evidence of compliance, we will recount the evidentiary facts that support the jury finding of compliance with \u00a7 10-402(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The record reveals that the case arose out of a 1982-1983 investigation conducted by the New Jersey State Police (NJSP) into allegations that individuals who were not licensed by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were extorting money from licensed junket operators who sought to run gambling junkets into Atlantic City, New Jersey, casinos. Seitz, an NJSP officer, was working undercover in conjunction with the investigation, posing as a licensed junket operator. During the course of the investigation, it became apparent to Seitz that he would have to travel to Maryland to meet with plaintiff-appellant, Sigmund Kassap a/k/a Captain John Doyle, a Maryland resident. It was believed that in this meeting Kassap would furnish evidence of crimes of extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Sometime around 15 July 1983, Seitz\u2019s superior, NJSP officer William Kisby, contacted then First Lieutenant Robert Graham (Graham), Assistant Commander of the Maryland State Police (MSP) Special Services Division and MSP\u2019s designated intelligence liaison officer, to seek the assistance of MSP and to determine if it would be lawful for Seitz to record his meeting with Kassap. At trial Graham testified that from the information related to him by Kisby, he determined that the criminal activity being investigated by NJSP might also involve extortion under Maryland law. Graham then authorized the tape recording of the meeting. The trial transcript suggests that from that point on, Graham, and other MSP officers, became actively involved in what could be viewed as a \u201cjoint\u201d investigation. Graham testified that this involvement was not only to assist NJSP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>with its investigation, but was also carried out as part of MSP\u2019s own investigation. He further testified that \u201c[t]his was as much a Maryland case as it was a New Jersey case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">On 20 July 1983, Seitz met with Kassap and others at the Pimlico Hotel in Baltimore. Seitz recorded the meeting on an NJSP Nagra recording device which may or may not have been previously registered with the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Seitz evidenced his prior consent to the recording through introduction at trial of an MSP \u201cCONSENT TO USE OF EAVESDROP EQUIPMENT\u201d form signed by Seitz and dated 20 July 1983. Also on the morning of the 20th, prior to the meeting, Kisby had met with Graham and other MSP officers to discuss plans for visual surveillance and security at the Pimlico Hotel. The MSP provided a surveillance team that maintained visual surveillance of the Pimlico Hotel both before and during the meeting. The team recorded the surveillance using still photography and videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">On 21 February 1985, Kassap filed a civil suit under \u00a7 10-410 against Seitz and others. He alleged a violation of the Act. Kisby was later joined as a defendant. The case was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (John Fader, II, J., presiding). The jury returned a verdict in favor of Seitz and Kisby. Kassap noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Before argument in that court, we brought the matter here by writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">It is well established that the broad concept of \u201cburden of proof\u201d consists of at least two component parts: the burden of production (also referred to as the duty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>going forward with the evidence) and the burden of persuasion. <em>Montgomery Co. Fire Bd. v. Fisher, </em>298 Md. 245, 256, 468 A.2d 625, 630-631 (1983). In the recent case of <em>Commodities Reserve Corp. v. Belt\u2019s Wharf, </em>310 Md. 365, 368 n. 2, 529 A.2d 822, 823 n. 2 (1987), Judge Rodowsky, writing for the Court, noted Dean McCormick\u2019s analysis of the practical distinctions between the respective burdens.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">\u2018The burden of producing evidence on an issue means the liability to an adverse ruling (generally a finding or directed verdict) if evidence on the issue has not been produced. It is usually cast first upon the party who has pleaded the existence of the fact, but ... may shift to the adversary when the pleader has discharged his initial duty. The burden of producing evidence is a critical mechanism in a jury trial, as it empowers the judge to decide the case without jury consideration when a party fails to sustain the burden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u2018The burden of persuasion becomes a crucial factor only if the parties have sustained their burdens of producing evidence and only when all of the evidence has been introduced. It does not shift from party to party during the course of the trial simply because it need not be allocated until it is time for a decision. When the time for a decision comes ... [t]he jury must be told that if the party having the burden of persuasion has failed to satisfy that burden, the issue is to be decided against him. If there is no jury and the judge finds himself in doubt, he too must decide the issue against the party having the burden of persuasion [C. McCormick, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 336, at 947 (3d ed. 1984)].\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Kassap\u2019s primary challenge on appeal is to the trial court\u2019s denial of a proposed instruction which would have placed on Seitz and Kisby the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the fact that their electronic surveillance complied with \u00a7 10-402(c)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Put otherwise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Kassap objects because the jury instructions placed on him the burden of persuading the jury that Seitz and Kisby did not comply with \u00a7 10-402(e)(2). While a plausible argument can be made on behalf of Seitz and Kisby that, contrary to Kassap\u2019s assertion, the jury instruction taken as a whole, <em>see Pressley v. State, </em>295 Md. 143, 152, 454 A.2d 347, 353 (1988), in fact, placed on them the full burden of production and persuasion on the issue, we accept <em>arguendo </em>Kassap\u2019s view of the jury instructions as correct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We hold, however, that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury as requested was not error since (as we will explain) Seitz and Kisby labored only under the duty of producing sufficient evidence to meet Kassap\u2019s prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>case of a violation of the Act. At no time did they bear the burden of persuasion on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Kassap\u2019s view of the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof is simple and straightforward: once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case, <em>i.e., </em>produced legally sufficient evidence of a willful interception of a private conversation, the burden of both production of the evidence and persuasion on the issue of compliance with \u00a7 10-402(c)(2) shifts to the defendant. He contends that \u00a7 10-402(c)(2) is an exception to the general statutory prohibition against electronic surveillance which has not been consented to by all participants to the conversation. It is incumbent on the party claiming the benefit of the exception, the argument continues, to prove that his or her conduct comes within the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Seitz and Kisby dispute that \u00a7 10-402(c)(2) operates as an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d type of statutory exception. They argue, in essence, that a defendant\u2019s duty is to meet plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case with evidence legally sufficient to show compliance with \u00a7 10-402(c)(2). Once this is accomplished, noncompliance becomes an element of proof of a violation of the Act. Proof by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation has occurred is, of course, the fundamental responsibility of the plaintiff. They also assert that in a criminal prosecution under the Act, once the defendant produces evidence of compliance with \u00a7 10-402(c)(2), the prosecution is constitutionally obligated to bear the risk of nonpersuasion on the issue. Since the Act is a penal statute, they argue, the burdens of persuasion with regard to criminal and civil liability should be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">As we prepare to assess these arguments, we note that the Act does not offer a formula for allocating the various burdens of proof. Nor have any reported opinions of this Court or the Court of Special Appeals previously addressed this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">We have often recognized that the Act finds its genesis in and is substantially patterned after Title III of the Omnibus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2521 (Title III). <em>Ricks v. State, </em>312 Md. 11, 15, 537 A.2d 612, 614, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 109 S.Ct. 90, 102 L.Ed.2d 66 (1988), and cases cited therein. Thus, we have on occasion sought guidance from federal eases interpreting or applying Title III. <em>See Ricks, </em>312 Md. at 21-24, 537 A.2d at 616-618; <em>Adams v. State, </em>289 Md. 221, 424 A.2d 344 (1981); <em>State v. Mayes, </em>284 Md. 625, 635-638, 399 A.2d 597, 603-605 (1979). Section 2511(1) of Title III and \u00a7 10-402(a) of the Act are substantially similar in what both define as \u201cunlawful.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Also both the Act and Title III contain one-party consent provisions that provide for exceptions to the general statutory prohibitions. Subsections (c) and (d) of \u00a7 2511(2) of Title III give broad allowance to interceptions when one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Unlike its federal counterpart, however, \u00a7 10-402(c)(2) of the Act limits permissible instances of one-party consent to interceptions by \u201can investigative or law enforcement officer acting in a criminal investigation or any other person acting at the prior direction and under the supervision of an investigative or law enforcement officer\u201d in order to \u201cprovide evidence of the commission of\u201d certain listed offenses. The Maryland one-party consent provision is substantially more restrictive and affords greater protection from surreptitious electronic surveillance than does its counterpart in Title III. <em>See </em>Gilbert, <em>A Diagnosis, Dissection, and Prognosis of Maryland\u2019s New Wiretap and Electronic Surveillance Law, </em>8 U.Balt.L.Rev. 183, 194 (1979). Recognizing this disparity, however, we may, nonetheless, look to federal case law to observe the role of the one-party consent provision in relation to the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Seitz and Kisby direct us to <em>Consumer Electronic Products v. Sanyo Elec., Inc., </em>568 F.Supp. 1194 (D.Colo.1983), and <em>By-Prod Corporation v. Armen-Berry Co., </em>668 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>956 (7th Cir.1982). <em>Consumer Electronic Products, </em>involved a counterclaim, for damages, by a defendant (ESP), alleging that the plaintiffs (CEPI) company president had unlawfully tape recorded a telephone conversation with the president of ESP. CEPI admitted that the conversation was recorded but contended that it did not violate Title III because its conduct was lawful under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(d). The court granted CEPFs motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the counterclaim, holding that ESP did not set forth any facts to establish its contention that CEPI had violated Title III or acted outside the one-party consent exception. The court acknowledged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\">[s]imply taping a telephone conversation is not a violation of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510=2520. Plaintiff will fall within the \u2018one-party consent' exception unless ESP can show that the interception was made for the purpose of committing a criminal, tortious or other injurious act. <em>The burden of proof is on the party making the allegation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><em>Consumer Electronic Products, </em>568 F.Supp. at 1196 [emphasis supplied].</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>By-Prod Corp., supra, </em>also involved a defendant (Ar-men-Berry) asserting a counterclaim for damages alleging a violation of Title III. In that case a corporate officer of By-Prod recorded a telephone conversation between himself and an employee of Armen-Berry. In dispute was the question of whether the officer came within the one-party consent exception. The facts showed the officer would come within the exception unless Ms purpose was criminal, tortious, or otherwise injurious. Judge Posner, writing for the Court, reasoned</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">[a] person not acting under color of state law may, without violating Title III of the Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, intercept a telephone call to which he is a party unless the purpose of the interception is to commit an act that is criminal or tortious under federal or state law, or \u2018any other injurious act.\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>By-Prod, </em>668 F.2d at 969. In affirming the federal district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for <em>By-Prod, </em>the court held that \u201cArmen-Berry had the burden of proving unlawful purpose\u201d and that \u201cno evidence of such intent was presented below____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In each of these cases, the court read the one-party consent exception in conjunction with the general prohibitions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(1). We agree with Seitz and Kisby that each court treated the one-party consent provision as qualifying the scope of the general prohibitions and thus \u201cviewed [it] as [an] aspect'... of the basic definition of the violation rather than as a so-called affirmative defense exception____\u201d Appellees\u2019 Brief at 16. We also note that in both <em>Consumer Electronic Products </em>and <em>By-Prod Corp., </em>the parties who claimed to come within the one-party consent exception did present some evidence of compliance with that provision. This supports Seitz and Kisby\u2019s position that they, as defendants, do bear the burden of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Kassap, on the other hand, guides us to <em>United States v. McCann, </em>465 F.2d 147 (5th Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Kelly v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 927, 93 S.Ct. 2747, 37 L.Ed.2d 154 (1973). In this case, McCann and a codefendant were charged with and convicted of unlawfully intercepting wire communications in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(l)(a). On appeal they argued, among other things, that the trial court should have dismissed the indictment because the government failed to negate all statutory exceptions outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511. The Fifth Circuit rebuffed this argument, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">It was not necessary to recite in the indictment that the interceptions were made without consent. If the appellants believed that they came within the consent exception it was incumbent upon them to prove this fact. As was said in <em>McKelvey v. United States, </em>260 U.S. 353, 357, 43 S.Ct. 132, 134, 67 L.Ed. 301 (1922), \u2018an indictment * * founded on a general provision defining the elements of an offense, * * *, need not negative the matter of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>exception made by a proviso or other distinct clause, whether in the same section or elsewhere and * * * it is incumbent upon one who relies on such an exception to set it up and establish it.'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 162. Kassap places a great deal of emphasis on the declaratory language in <em>McCann </em>requiring a party who believes that he or she comes within the one-party consent exception to prove it. This proof would encompass, by Kassap\u2019s reading, both the burden of production and persuasion. We do not read <em>McCann </em>so broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">First, the case may be limited to the holding that an <em>indictment </em>need not negate all statutory exceptions to Title III. Second, even giving credence to the proposition that one who relies on the one-party exception must prove it, that proposition does not necessarily require the proponent of the exception to persuade the jury that there was consent to the interception. <em>McCann </em>does not distinguish between the burden of production of evidence and the burden of persuasion. And unlike the cases of <em>Consumer Electronic Products </em>and <em>By-Prod, </em>the court here found that there was \u201cabsolutely no foundation in the evidence supporting a defense based on consent____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162. It would be perfectly consistent with <em>Consumer Electronic Products </em>and <em>By-Prod </em>to interpret the language in <em>McCann </em>as requiring one who claims to have the consent of a participant to the intercepted conversation to produce evidence of that consent. In sum, we believe the federal cases reviewed support Seitz and Kisby\u2019s construction of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">We also accept Seitz and Kisby\u2019s second argument: that allocation of the various burdens of proof should remain the same under the Act regardless of whether the proceeding is in the criminal or civil arena. The Act proscribes certain activity which may give rise to civil or criminal liability, or both. The major difference between proving civil liability and proving criminal liability is the quantum of proof (the measure of the burden of persuasion) necessary to establish each. Obviously, it is constitutionally impermissible for a state to require a criminal defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>to disprove an element of an offense with which the defendant is charged. <em>Patterson v. New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 97 S.Ct. 2819, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977); <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975). And the ultimate burden of persuading the fact-finder that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt always remains with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In keeping with <em>Patterson </em>and <em>Mullaney, </em>in a criminal proceeding under the Act, once the defendant produces legally sufficient evidence of compliance with \u00a7 10-402(c)(2) to raise it as a triable issue, it would be incumbent upon the State to persuade the jury otherwise. Since a plaintiff in a civil proceeding also seeks to prove a violation of the Act-one which is by definition comprised of the same elements as a criminal violation \u2014 we see no reason to alter the allocation of the burden of persuasion simply because the violation is being addressed in a civil rather than criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Additionally, we recognize that in determining which party bears the burden of persuasion, a court may take into account a variety of factors, including consideration of what is fair under the circumstances. <em>See McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 337 at 952 (3d ed. 1984); 9 <em>Wigmore on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 2486 at 291 (Chadbourne rev. 1981). We believe that fairness dictated that Kassap bear the risk of nonpersuasion on the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The burden of persuasion is only important when the fact-finder\u2019s mind is in equipoise. Thus, that burden would have played a critical role in the case before us only if the jury\u2019s collective mind was in equal balance on the issue of whether Seitz and Kisby came within the one-party consent provision. In other words, equipoise on this issue would have meant that the jury was neither persuaded nor unpersuaded as to whether Seitz and Kisby\u2019s conduct violated the Act. Since it was Kassap who sought to change the status quo, and it was Kassap who bore the ultimate burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>persuading the jury that Seitz and Kisby did in fact violate the Act, fairness to all parties involved required placing the risk of nonpersuasion on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We shall not further review the evidentiary facts; we have no doubt that Seitz and Kisby introduced sufficient evidence of compliance with \u00a7 10 \u2014 402(c)(2) to satisfy their burden of production. Thus, for the reasons we have indicated, Kassap as the plaintiff in this civil action was responsible for persuading the jury that Seitz and Kisby did not comply with the one-party consent provision and were, therefore, in violation of the Act. Consequently, the trial court did not err in declining to instruct the jury as Kassap requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Because of the decision we reach on this issue and because the verdict questions, answered by the jury in this instance, related only to the issue herein addressed,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we need not and do not address any other complaints raised by Kassap with regard to the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Kassap argues only the burden of proof portion of the rejected instruction, and that is the only part of it we address. We do not thereby intimate that we regard the instruction as correct in other respects. For example, the instruction assumes that if \u00a7 10-402(c)(2) is to apply, the offenses under investigation must be violations of Maryland law. The accuracy of that assumption is not involved in the case before us, and we do not decide that question, but it is not necessarily correct <em>See State v.

The jury answered each of these questions in the affirmative, and then, following the verdict sheet instructions, found for Seitz and Kisby without answering any of the remaining questions.
