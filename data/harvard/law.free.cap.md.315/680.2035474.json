Under the new statutory scheme, it is the responsibility of the State to specify and prove the value of the property destroyed to establish the proper classification of the offense. It is essential for the trier of fact to determine value where it is alleged that the property\u2019s worth is greater than $300.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Petitioner, Kip D. Spratt (Spratt), was charged and convicted of malicious destruction of property pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 111,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and damaging or tampering with an automobile, a 1977 Plym<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>outh Arrow.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During the trial held in the Circuit Court for Cecil County, the jury was not instructed to consider the value of the property involved. On April 6, 1987, the court imposed a sentence of three years imprisonment for malicious destruction of property, ordered the defendant to pay $250.00 to the Public Defender's Office, and to pay $925.00 to the victim as restitution. For sentencing purposes, the defendant's conviction for damaging or tampering with an automobile was merged. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion. We granted certiorari to consider whether a jury finding on value is necessary for imposition of a sentence for malicious destruction of property of a value of $300 or greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">At Spratt\u2019s trial, Theresa Ruckman (Ruckman), the owner of the 1977 Plymouth, testified concerning the value of the car. Ruckman. stated that prior to its being damaged the vehicle was worth \u201cat least a thousand dollars.\u201d Because she was unable to have the car repaired, it was sold for $75.00. According to the victim, the car was in good condition prior to the incident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Afterwards, the owner stated that two side view mirrors had been removed, the back window had been smashed, and in several places the body had been kicked in or dented.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The trial judge did not instruct the jury to make a finding as to the value of the damaged vehicle. Neither counsel objected nor sought such an instruction. Therefore, the jury convicted Spratt of the general offense of malicious destruction of property. At sentencing, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>I\u2019m satisfied that the car has a value of over $300.00. The testimony in the case by the young lady was that it was worth a thousand dollars; that it was in good working order, good condition. She couldn\u2019t repair it and she sold it only for $75.00. So, I\u2019m satisfied that the car was worth over $300.00, in order to satisfy the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The trial judge rejected Spratt\u2019s argument that the record was insufficient to support a conviction of the greater offense, and that the court was required to presume the value of the vehicle was less than $300.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Petitioner\u2019s primary argument is that a jury finding on value is necessary for imposition of a sentence for malicious destruction of property of a value of $300 or greater. The imposition of a sentence in excess of sixty days in the present case allegedly constituted an illegal sentence because the jury made no finding as to value. The State\u2019s position may be summarized as follows: \u201cThe Court of Special Appeals correctly determined that the amount of the value of the property destroyed by Spratt is merely a sentencing consideration and not an element of the offense.\u201d Because of the General Assembly\u2019s intention to treat the crime of malicious destruction of property as one offense, but with separate classifications in Art. 27, \u00a7 111(b) and (c), and due to the fact no jury finding was made as to value in the present case, we shall vacate Spratt\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>ch. 479, Laws of 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Effective July 1, 1985, the legislature altered the offense of malicious destruction of property as follows: If the property defaced, destroyed, injured or molested has a value of less than $300, a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment not exceeding sixty days or both may be imposed. If the property has a value of $300 or more, a fine not exceeding $2,500 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both may be imposed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain the actual intent of the General Assembly. <em>Comptroller v. American Satellite Corp., </em>312 Md. 537, 544, 540 A.2d 1146, 1150 (1988); <em>Dean v. Pinder, </em>312 Md. 154, 161, 538 A.2d 1184, 1188 (1988); <em>Blum v. Blum, </em>295 Md. 135, 140, 453 A.2d 824, 827 (1983). While the primary source from which to determine the intention is the language of the statute itself, commonly referred to as \u201cthe plain meaning rule\u201d of statutory interpretation, we note the plain-meaning rule \u201cis not a complete, all-sufficient rule for ascertaining a legislative intention----\u201d <em>Darnall v. Connor, </em>161 Md. 210, 215, 155 A. 894, 896 (1931); <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 511-14, 525 A.2d 628, 632 (1987). The \u201cmeaning of the plainest language\u201d is controlled by the context in which it appears. <em>Guardian Life Ins. Co. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>293 Md. 629, 642, 446 A.2d 1140, 1147 (1982); <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 514, 525 A.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">In <em>Kaczorowski, </em>we thoroughly analyzed the process of discovering the purpose, aim, or policy of a statutory provision. There, Judge Adkins writing for the Court, elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">When we pursue the context of statutory language, we are not limited to the words of the statute as they are printed in the Annotated Code. We may and often must consider other \u2018external manifestations\u2019 or \u2018persuasive evidence\u2019 including a bill\u2019s title <em>and function paragraphs, </em>amendments that occurred as it passed through the legislature, <em>its relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation, </em>and other material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>which becomes the context within which we read the particular language before us in a given case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><em>Id,., </em>309 Md. at 514-15, 525 A.2d at 632-33 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">As an example of external considerations, we have previously considered legislative history to assist in construing legislation that we did not identify as ambiguous or of uncertain meaning. <em>Ogrinz v. James, </em>309 Md. 381, 390, 524 A.2d 77, 82 (1987) (where a committee report was discussed). Here, we find it appropriate to briefly examine the relevant legislative history of Chapter 479 of the Laws of 1985. In its Committee Report, the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee noted, \u201cThe purpose of House Bill 1675 is to reduce the number of misdemeanor jury trials in this area of the law.\u201d <em>Summary of Comm. Rep. on H.B. 1675, </em>at 2 (1985). The stated \u201clegislative intent\u201d was phrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">The intent of House Bill 1675 is to alter the existing penalty for the malicious destruction of property by establishing a penalty for destroyed property with a value under $300 and to provide that the new penalty carries a maximum fine of $500 or a maximum imprisonment of 60 days or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-7\"><em>Id., </em>at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">In order to carry out this stated purpose, we hold that it is necessary for the trier of fact to make a finding as to value when the State is seeking a conviction under Art. 27, \u00a7 111(c). It was essential for the jury to be instructed as to value in the present case. Prior to the enactment of the 1985 amendments, neither \u00a7 111 nor any of its statutory predecessors referred to the amount of the value of the property destroyed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The present statutory scheme permits the State to proceed under the lesser offense, subsection (b), and avoid the possibility of a misdemeanor jury trial on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>the merits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, if the State wishes to pursue the more serious offense under subsection (c), it must specifically charge and prove the value of the destroyed property, greater than $300. The defendant is entitled to a finding by the trier of fact that the State\u2019s charge of the greater offense was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. We note that the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions provide for instructing the jury on value.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the evidence in the present case may have warranted a factual finding that the value of the property so destroyed or injured was more than $300.00, the jury was not instructed on this point. It was reversible error for the trial judge to sentence Spratt on the greater offense under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Maryland case law generally supports the notion that where a criminal statute separates the offense by a value determination, it is necessary for the State to prove value in terms of the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>Stanley v. State, </em>313 Md. 50, 91, 542 A.2d 1267, 1287 (1988) (In a case involving the charge of malicious destruction of property, Judge Adkins, writing for the court, reasoned \u201cTrice argues and the State concedes that there was no proof that the property destroyed exceeded $300 in value, so the two three-year sentences are improper.\u201d); <em>Felkner v. State, </em>218 Md. 300, 307, 146 A.2d 424, 429 (1958) (\u201cWhere, the statute measures the degree of the burglary by the value of the goods which were intended to be stolen, the evidence must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>permit the trier of facts reasonably to infer that it was intended to take goods of that value or more if there is to be a conviction.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Shipley v. State, </em>220 Md. 463, 466, 154 A.2d 708, 709 (1959) (\u201cIt is necessary for the State, in order to establish felonious intent in this case, to show that the defendant had an intent to steal goods worth $100 or more.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>see also Howard v. State, </em>240 Md. 699, 700-01, 213 A.2d 288, 289 (1965) (\u201cThe evidence in this case was clearly sufficient to permit the trier of fact to infer that appellant intended to steal the requisite $100 or more.\u201d); <em>McNeil v. State, </em>227 Md. 298, 300, 176 A.2d 338, 339-40 (1961); <em>Lane v. State, </em>60 Md.App. 412, 425-26, 483 A.2d 369, 376-77 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>302 Md. 570, 489 A.2d 1129 (1985) (where Court of Special Appeals approved of instructing jury as to value).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">As stated by Judge Orth in <em>Jackson v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 337, 348, 270 A.2d 322, 327-28 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>260 Md. 721 (1971), \u201cThe State must prove the value of the goods received to establish the punishment authorized and the classification of the offense\u201d to support a conviction of receiving stolen goods. <em>See also Smith v. State, </em>35 Md. App. 49, 53, 368 A.2d 1127, 1129 (1977) (\u201cIt seems clear to us that the appellant was charged originally with common law larceny, and the question of whether this was petit or grand larceny became a matter of proof at the trial.\u201d); <em>Rhodes v. State, </em>219 Md. 279, 282, 149 A.2d 16, 17 (1959) (In a court trial where the defendant was charged with receiving stolen goods of a value of more than $100, the determination of value by the trial judge \u201cwas one of fact and one the testimony undoubtedly allowed.\u201d); <em>Gazaille v. State, </em>2 Md.App. 462, 464-65, 235 A.2d 306, 307 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In a recent interpretation, the Court of Special Appeals reviewed the 1985 amendments to the malicious destruction of property statute. <em>Brooks v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 604, 515 A.2d 225 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>308 Md. 382, 519 A.2d 1283 (1987). <em>Brooks </em>involved the physical damage to an Ocean City summer house by an intruder. With the exception of the value of the food and drink consumed, no evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>offered to show the value of the property damaged. Appellant maintained that the evidence was insufficient to support a sentence of three years for malicious destruction of property. The court held that Brooks was properly sentenced under the statute as it existed as of the date of the offense, pursuant to Article 27, \u00a7 111 (1982), that the amendments to the statute did not apply retroactively, and \u201cit was not necessary for the State to prove the value of the property damaged.\u201d 68 Md.App. at 610, 515 A.2d at 228. Consistent with this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the present statutory scheme requires proof as to value.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Our review of other jurisdictions provides support for the principle that questions of value should generally be decided by the trier of fact. In <em>People v. Grass, </em>126 Ill.App.3d 540, 81 Ill.Dec. 693, 467 N.E.2d 393 (5th Dist.1984), the defendant was found guilty after a jury trial was held of criminal damage to property exceeding $300. Illinois\u2019 statute defining criminal damage to property contains a $300 threshold similar to the one found in the Maryland statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Illinois court held that where the evidence raised the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s use of force was reasonable, \u201cit was error not to include an instruction apprising the jury that it must affix the value of the property damaged for which defendant was criminally responsible in its verdict.\u201d <em>Id., </em>81 Ill.Dec. at 696-97, 467 N.E.2d at 396-97; <em>see also People v. Harden, </em>42 Ill.2d 301, 247 N.E.2d 404, 407 (1969). The court reasoned: \u201cWhile it is clear that the jury believed the defendant was guilty of criminal damage to property, we cannot say that it independently determined value upon which a proper sentence could be imposed.\u201d <em>Id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>81 Ill.Dec. at 697, 467 N.E.2d at 397. This interpretation is consistent with the Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">In <em>State v. Smith, </em>215 Kan. 865, 528 P.2d 1195, 1198 (1974) , the Kansas Supreme Court vacated a sentence imposed for felony criminal damage to property valued at $50 or more because the jury was not instructed nor required to make a finding as to value. Similar to the Maryland statute, the Kansas provision set forth separate offenses based on the value of the property damaged.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See also Commonwealth v. Pyburn, </em>26 Mass.App.Ct. 967, 527 N.E.2d 1174, 1175 (1988) (\u201c[I]f there is an allegation in a complaint or indictment that the value of the property so destroyed or injured exceeded one hundred dollars, as was claimed here, then the jury must be instructed that if they find the defendant guilty of wanton destruction or injury of property they must then determine if the value of the property so destroyed or injured exceeded one hundred dollars.\u201d); <em>State v. Powell, </em>452 A.2d 977, 978 (Me.1982) (In prosecution for aggravated criminal mischief, requiring element that the damage to property exceeded $1,000, \u201cthe exact value of property, either generally or on a given date, is not subject to judicial notice even though the value of the property is determined by trading in public markets.\u201d); citing 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 85 (13th ed. 1972); <em>State v. Tanner, </em>25 N.C.App. 251, 212 S.E.2d 695, 698 (1975) (Where there is no evidence or jury finding as to the amount of damage done to the car, the defendant should have been sentenced for the lesser offense.); <em>Hernandez v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number><em>State, </em>468 S.W.2d 387, 391 (Tex.Crim.App.1971) (The jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries amount to $50 or more.).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Here, the court should have instructed the jury to consider the value of the damaged vehicle, and to set forth in its verdict the value as less than or greater than the $300 statutory amount. Because no jury finding was made regarding the value of the automobile destroyed, Spratt\u2019s conviction and three year sentence under the greater offense of malicious destruction of property, Art. 27, \u00a7 111(c), was improper. However, the jury verdict of the general offense of malicious destruction of property does warrant a sentence under Art. 27, \u00a7 111(b). <em>See Stanley v. State, </em>313 Md. 50, 92-93, 542 A.2d 1267, 1287-88 (1988); <em>see also Brooks v. State, </em>314 Md. 585, 601, 552 A.2d 872, 880 (1989); <em>cf. United States v.
