United States, </em>151 U.S. 396, 408, 14 S.Ct. 410, 414, 38 L.Ed. 208 (1894). <em>See Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 121, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 1735, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986) (Burger, C.J., dissenting). Specifically, we are called upon to determine whether the prosecution\u2019s use of peremptory challenges in empaneling a petit jury in a criminal cause was constitutionally offensive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AdJ\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Robert William Gorman, a white man, was found guilty by a jury in the Circuit Court for Harford County of robbery with a deadly weapon and related offenses. At the selection of the jury, the prosecution, by the use of peremptory challenges, struck the only two black persons from the panel. Gorman was sentenced as a repeat offender to life imprisonment without parole. The judgments were affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Gorman v. State, </em>No. 897, September Term, 1985, filed 11 March 1986, unreported <em>(Gorman I). </em>This Court denied Gorman\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and denied his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Gorman looked to the Supreme Court of the United States by way of a petition for a writ of certiorari, and his petition was granted. That Court vacated the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and \u201cremanded the case to [that court] for further consideration in light of <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>Gorman v. Maryland, </em>480 U.S. 913, 107 S.Ct. 1363, 94 L.Ed.2d 680 (1987). Thereupon, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgments of the Circuit Court for Harford County, and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>Gorman v. State, </em>No. 897, September Term, 1985 (on \u2022remand) filed 17 July 1987, unreported <em>(Gorman II). </em>It explained its decision merely by noting that in <em>Gorman I </em>it had affirmed the judgments of the trial court upon reliance on <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 85 S.Ct. 824, 13 L.Ed.2d 759. But, it observed, <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 had overruled <em>Swain, </em>and, under <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314 [107 S.Ct. 708], <em>Batson </em>governed <em>Gorman I. Gorman II, </em>slip opinion at 1. \u201c[H]enee,\u201d it conceded, \u201cour reliance on <em>Swain </em>turns out to be erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The intermediate appellate court opined, \u201cOn the basis of <em>Batson, Griffith, </em>and [its own opinion in] <em>Chew v. State, </em>[71] Md.App. [681, 527 A.2d 332, <em>cert. granted, </em>311 Md. 301, 534 A.2d 369 (1987), which looked to <em>Batson </em>], the judgments must be reversed, and the matter remanded for a new trial.\u201d <em>Gorman II, </em>slip opinion at 1-2. The Court of Special Appeals denied the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We granted the State\u2019s petition and Gorman\u2019s conditional cross-petition for writs of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In providing for jury trial in criminal causes, Maryland, in general, adheres to the common law system of trial by an impartial jury of 12 persons who must unanimously agree on a verdict. <em>See </em>Maryland Rules 4-811(b) and 4-827(a); <em>State v. McKay, </em>280 Md. 558, 375 A.2d 228 (1977). This system comports with the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and with Article 21 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. at 211, 85 S.Ct. at 831; Maryland Rule 4-311(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In the empaneling of a petit jury the system provides, not only for challenges for cause, but for peremptory challenges. Md.Rule 4-313. \u201cThe peremptory challenge has been in use without scrutiny into its basis for nearly as long as juries have existed.\u201d <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 119, 106 S.Ct. at 1734 (Burger, C.J., dissenting). It was a venerable fixture at the common law and crossed the sea to become one of the most important of the rights in our federal and state systems. <em>Swain, </em>380 U.S. at 212-219, 85 S.Ct. at 831-835. Although the federal and Maryland Constitutions do not confer a right to peremptory challenges, \u201cthose challenges traditionally have been viewed as one means of assuring the selection of a qualified and unbiased jury.\u201d <em>Batson </em>476 U.S. at 91, 106 S.Ct. at 1720 (citation omitted). In <em>Swain, </em>after tracing the very old credentials of the peremptory challenge, the Court observed: \u201cThe persistence of peremptories and their extensive use demonstrate the long and widely held belief that peremptory challenge is a necessary part of trial by jury.\u201d 380 U.S. at 219, 85 S.Ct. at 835. \u201cThe denial or impairment of the right is reversible error without a showing of prejudice____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Throughout its long history, the description of the challenge as \u201cperemptory\u201d meant precisely what that adjective connoted in common usage \u2014 \u201cconclusive or absolute; decisive.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language 1817 (unabridged 2d ed. 1961). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1023 (5th ed. 1979) defines it as: \u201cImperative; final; decisive; absolute; conclusive; positive; not admitting of question, delay, reconsideration or of any alternative. Self-determined; arbitrary; not requiring any cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>to be shown.\u201d Thus, a peremptory challenge is, as <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>146 U.S. 370, 378, 13 S.Ct. 136, 139, 36 L.Ed. 1011 (1892), indicates Blackstone viewed it: \u201c[AJn arbitrary and capricious right; and it must be exercised with full freedom, or it fails of its full purpose.\u201d The Supreme Court found merit in the position that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUq\">[t]his system, ... in and of itself, provides justification for striking any group of otherwise qualified jurors in any given case, whether they be Negroes, Catholics, accountants or those with blue eyes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><em>Swain, </em>380 U.S. at 212, 85 S.Ct. at 831. <em>See </em>id. at 219-221, 85 S.Ct. at 835-836.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">In the <em>Swain </em>case, the defendant was black. There were only six black men on the final venire, and the prosecution peremptorily struck all six from the petit jury panel. A majority of the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in light of the nature and function of peremptory challenges, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">With these considerations in mind, we cannot hold that the striking of Negroes in a particular ease is a denial of equal protection of the laws. In the quest for an impartial and qualified jury, Negro and white, Protestant and Catholic, are alike subject to being challenged without cause. To subject the prosecutor\u2019s challenge in any par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>ticular case to the demands and traditional standards of the Equal Protection Clause would entail a radical change in the nature and operation of the challenge. The challenge, <em>pro tanto, </em>would no longer be peremptory, each and every challenge being open to examination, either at the time of the challenge or at a hearing afterwards. The prosecutor\u2019s judgment underlying each challenge would be subject to scrutiny for reasonableness and sincerity. And a great many uses of the challenge would be banned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU0\"><em>Id., </em>380 U.S. at 221-222, 85 S.Ct. at 836-837. Maryland accepted this concept and applied it. We flatly stated in <em>Brice v. State, </em>264 Md. 352, 366, 286 A.2d 132 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agro\">In short, the right to exercise the peremptory strike is unfettered and may be exercised by either party for any reason or indeed for no reason. Hunch, passing impression, appearance of the prospective juror, or any other consideration may lead to the exercise of the peremptory challenge and no inquiry may be made in regard to why it is exercised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">In <em>Brice </em>the State used 15 of its peremptory challenges. We declared: \u201cNo one may inquire in regard to the reason the State did this.\u201d <em>Id. See Parker v. State, </em>227 Md. 468, 470, 177 A.2d 426 (1962); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 143, 148-151, 262 A.2d 792 (1970). In the Supreme Court, the rule of <em>Swain </em>remained inviolate for 21 years, reflecting a view that had been embraced for over two centuries. And then came <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69, decided 30 April 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In <em>Batson </em>the Supreme Court reexamined part II of <em>Swain, </em>which concerned peremptory challenges. As we have seen, the Court in <em>Swain </em>had expressly stated that the prosecutor\u2019s challenge in a particular case was not subject to the demands and traditional standards of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Constitution of the United States.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Swain </em>adopted the presumption that in any particular case the prosecutor is using the state\u2019s peremptory challenges to obtain a fair and impartial jury to try the case before the court. Even though the defendant was black, this presumption, the Court opined, is not overcome because all blacks were removed from the jury thereby or that they were removed because they were black. In other words, the presumption was not rebuttable by the exercise of peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The Court\u2019s reexamination of <em>Swain </em>spawned a spate of opinions by the justices.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court did not jettison entirely the concept of peremptory challenges, as Marshall, J., would have it do. 476 U.S. at 102-103, 106 S.Ct. at 1725-1726 (Marshall, J., concurring). But seven of the justices overturned <em>Swain\u2019s </em>principle holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZfy\">the Constitution does not require in any given case a,n inquiry into the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for using his peremptory challenges to strike blacks from the petit jury panel in the criminal trial of a black defendant and that in such a case it will be presumed that the prosecutor is acting for legitimate trial-related reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\"><em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 100, 106 S.Ct. at 1725 (White, J., concurring). The majority ruled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>such use of peremptory challenges in a given case may, but does not necessarily, raise an inference, which the prosecutor carries the burden of refuting, that his strikes w\u00e9re based on the belief that no black citizen could be a satisfactory juror or fairly try a black defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 100-101, 106 S.Ct. at 1725. Initially, the burden is on the defendant to establish a prima facie case. <em>Id. </em>at 93-96, 106 S.Ct. at 1721-1723. \u201c[A] defendant may establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in selection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant\u2019s trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 106 S.Ct. at 1722-1723. <em>Id. </em>at 100-101, 106 S.Ct. at 1725. As we read this language in context, it appears that what the Supreme Court means by its use of words like \u201cprima facie case\u201d and \u201cinference\u201d is a rebuttable presumption of discriminatory use of peremptory challenges. <em>See Stanley v. State, </em>313 Md. 50, 60, 542 A.2d 1267, 1272 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The guidelines by which a criminal defendant can meet the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination are clearly set out. The defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">1) must show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group, and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant\u2019s race;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">2) is entitled to rely on the fact that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that permits those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">3) must show that those facts and any other relevant circumstances raise [a rebuttable presumption] that the prosecutor used that practice to exclude veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-10\"><em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96. This combination of factors in the empaneling of the petit jury establishes the requisite rebut-table presumption of purposeful discrimination. The trial judge must determine whether the defendant has made the requisite showing, considering all relevant circumstances. The Court expressed confidence that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>trial judges, experienced in supervising <em>voir dire, </em>will be able to decide if the circumstances concerning the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges creates a prima facie case of discrimination against black jurors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 97, 106 S.Ct. at 1723. If the trial judge finds that the defendant has failed to establish a prima facie case, there is no obligation on the prosecutor to offer any explanation for the use of a peremptory challenge and no entitlement on the part of the defendant to a hearing on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Once the trial judge determines that the defendant has made \u201ca prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation for challenging black jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court emphasized</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ark\">that the prosecutor\u2019s explanation need not rise to the level justifying exercise of a challenge for cause. But the prosecutor may not rebut the defendant\u2019s prima facie case of discrimination by stating merely that he challenged jurors of the defendant\u2019s race on the assumption\u2014 or his intuitive judgment \u2014 that they would be partial to the defendant because of their shared race.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201cNor may the prosecutor rebut the defendant\u2019s case merely by denying that he had a discriminatory motive or \u2018affirm[ing] [his] good faith in making individual selections.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 106 S.Ct. at 1723, quoting <em>Alexander v. Louisiana, </em>405 U.S. 625, 632, 92 S.Ct. 1221, 1226, 31 L.Ed.2d 536 (1972).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">The prosecutor therefore must articulate a neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried. The trial court then will have the duty to determine if the defendant has established purposeful discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-9\"><em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 98, 106 S.Ct. at 1723-1724 (footnotes omitted). White, J., in his concurring opinion, summarized the Court\u2019s holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">[U]sing peremptory challenges to strike blacks does not end the inquiry; it is not unconstitutional, without more, to strike one or more blacks from the jury. The judge may not require the prosecutor to respond at all. If he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>does, the prosecutor, who in most cases has had a chance to <em>voir dire </em>the prospective jurors, will have an opportunity to give trial-related reasons for his strikes \u2014 some satisfactory ground other than the belief that black jurors should not be allowed to judge a black defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 101-102, 106 S.Ct. at 1725. The majority declined to \u201cformulate particular procedures to be followed upon a defendant\u2019s timely objection to a prosecutor\u2019s challenges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99, 106 S.Ct. at 1724.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The State suggests that, in the case at hand, the matter of the propriety of the peremptory challenges exercised by it were not preserved for appeal inasmuch as Gorman accepted the jury as empaneled. At the time of the trial <em>Batson </em>had not been decided. Nevertheless, without the benefit of that decision, and with <em>Swain </em>and this Court\u2019s <em>Brice, </em>264 Md. 352, 286 A.2d 132, still in good grace, it seems that Gorman made known to the trial court, as best he could in the circumstances, that he was unhappy with the manner in which the State used its peremptory challenges. He did so at the trial and in a motion for a new trial. The court and the defendant noted that there was a case on the issue pending in the Supreme Court. On direct appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, the first question the defendant presented was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">Did the trial court err in allowing the case to proceed \u201cafter the prosecutor used his peremptory challenges to strike ... the black prospective jurors from the panel\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-9\"><em>Gorman I, </em>slip opinion at 1. In any event, even absent any timely objection by Gorman, the Supreme Court in <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, supra, </em>held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-10\">that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a \u201cclear break\u201d with the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>Id., </em>479 U.S. at 328, 107 S.Ct. at 716, 93 L.Ed.2d at 661. As we have seen, in granting Gorman\u2019s petition for certiorari, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Court of Special Appeals for consideration in light of <em>Griffith. </em>The \u201cnew rule\u201d, indeed constituting a clear break with the past, with which <em>Griffith </em>was concerned, was that announced in <em>Batson.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Gorman\u2019s case was not yet final when <em>Batson </em>was decided, and under the directive on remand, the case was still pending on direct review. Therefore, the <em>Batson </em>decision came into play. <em>See McClain v. State, </em>288 Md. 456, 464-470, 419 A.2d 369 (1980), and cases therein cited. As we noted in <em>McClain:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-4\">[N]o case has led us to refuse to apply a new rule to a case on direct review pending at the time of the formulation of the new rule in which the issue of the new rule was raised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 465, 419 A.2d 369. <em>See Potts v. State, </em>300 Md. 567, 577, 479 A.2d 1335 (1984). It follows that we decide the case at hand in light of <em>Batson, </em>and must determine whether the new rule announced therein is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The parties agreed that the issues presented in their petition and cross-petition respectively for the issuance of a writ of certiorari be consolidated into three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">1) Did the Court of Special Appeals misapply <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>to the circumstances of this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">2) Can Gorman assert a Sixth Amendment claim of fair cross-section deprivation in the composition of his jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">3) Did the Court of Special Appeals err in mandating a new trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\n<em>(A)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">It appears from the opinion in <em>Gorman II </em>that the Court of Special Appeals on remand simply assumed that the new rule of <em>Batson </em>applied to Gorman\u2019s trial. Since the general procedures spelled out in <em>Batson </em>had not been followed at the trial (of course, they could not because they were then not known), the. intermediate appellate court, without further ado, reversed the judgments and granted a new trial. We think that the matter must be probed a little deeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\"><em>Swain </em>and <em>Batson </em>were both decided in the same factual posture \u2014 a black defendant aggrieved by the peremptory striking by the State of all the black veniremen from the petit jury which was empaneled to try him. It is abundantly clear from the various <em>Batson </em>opinions that the Supreme Court was speaking only to that circumstance. The opinion of the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">This case requires us to reexamine that portion of <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202 [85 S.Ct. 824, 13 L.Ed.2d 759] (1965), concerning the evidentiary burden placed on a criminal defendant who claims that he has been denied equal protection through the State\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to exclude <em>members of his race </em>from the petit jury-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">476 U.S. at 82, 106 S.Ct. at 1714 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). Discussing the constitutional predicate for the new rule the majority said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-11\">[T]he Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race or on the assumption that <em>black jurors </em>as a group will be unable impartially to consider the State\u2019s case against a <em>black defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 89, 106 S.Ct. at 1719 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">The Court noted, in overruling <em>Swain, </em>that it had been decided in a black defendant \u2014 black juryman frame of reference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>Swain </em>required the Court to decide ... whether <em>a black defendant </em>was denied equal protection by the State\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges to exclude <em>members of his race </em>from the petit jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 90, 106 S.Ct. at 1719 (emphasis added). To establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1X\">the defendant first must show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire <em>members of the defendant\u2019s race.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 96, 106 S.Ct. at 1723 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). In short, the entire opinion of the Court is only in terms of black defendant \u2014 black juryman or members of the defendant\u2019s race. <em>See also </em>476 U.S. at 93, 94, 95, 106 S.Ct. at 1721, 1721, 1722.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Opinions filed by the other justices do not go beyond the black defendant \u2014 black juryman situation. <em>See </em>the concurring opinion of Justice White, <em>id. </em>at 100, 101, 102, 106 S.Ct. at 1725, 1725, 1725; the concurring opinion of Justice Marshall, <em>id. </em>at 102, 106 S.Ct. at 1725; the concurring opinion of Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Brennan, <em>id. </em>at 108, 106 S.Ct. at 1729; the concurring opinion of Justice O\u2019Connor, <em>id. </em>at 111, 106 S.Ct. at 1731. The dissenting opinion of Chief Justice Burger, joined by Justice Rehnquist, <em>id. </em>at 112, 106 S.Ct. at 1731, and the dissenting opinion of Justice Rehnquist, joined by the Chief Justice, <em>id. </em>at 134, 106 S.Ct. at 1742, do not suggest that the Court intended to reach further at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\"><em>Batson </em>leaves many significant unresolved issues awash in its wake. <em>See Chew v. State, </em>71 Md.App. at 703-717, 527 A.2d 332. Justice White, concurring, acknowledged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">Much litigation will be required to spell out the contours of the Court\u2019s equal protection holding today, and the significant effect it will have on the conduct of criminal trials cannot be gainsaid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-10\"><em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 102, 106 S.Ct. at 1725-1726. We have learned that it is not wise to prophesy what the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Court will do or to anticipate how it will rule when an unresolved question comes before it. We are content, as was the Supreme Court, to leave the determination of issues unresolved in <em>Batson </em>to future litigation. It is apparent that what spurred <em>Batson </em>was the Court\u2019s belief \u201cthat the practice of peremptorily eliminating <em>blacks </em>from petit juries in cases with <em>black defendants </em>remains widespread____\u201d 476 U.S. at 101, 106 S.Ct. at 1725 (White, J., concurring) (emphasis added). It was this discriminatory practice which the Court addressed and sought to remedy. The venerable concept of the peremptory challenge in other respects was left intact. The majority expressed its recognition \u201cthat the peremptory challenge occupies an important position in our trial procedures____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 106 S.Ct. at 1724. It did \u201cnot agree that [its] decision today will undermine the contribution the challenge generally makes to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98-99, 106 S.Ct. at 1724.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">We decline to go further than did the Supreme Court. The circumstances here were unlike those in <em>Batson. </em>Here the jurors who were peremptorily struck from the petit jury were black but the defendant was white. The prosecutor did not exercise his peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant\u2019s race. Thus <em>Batson\u2019s </em>first requirement for the establishment of a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in the selection of the petit jury was not met. <em>Batson\u2019s </em>new rule was simply not applicable\u00bb to Gorman\u2019s case. <em>Compare, Stanley v. State, </em>313 Md. 50, 542 A.2d 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">We observe that we are unable to conceive of a sound rationalization as to how the peremptory striking of blacks from the petit jury panel would deny a white defendant equal protection of the laws. In any event, the question was not answered in <em>Batson, </em>and we look forward to the final determination of that matter by the Supreme Court when it chooses to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">The answer to the first question presented to us is that the Court of Special Appeals did misapply <em>Batson </em>to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\n<em>(B)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Although the Supreme Court looked to the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law in deciding <em>Bat-son, </em>Gorman suggests that the constitutional rights to due process of law were violated by the peremptory challenges here. He suggests that <em>Peters v. Kiff, </em>407 U.S. 493, 92 S.Ct. 2163, 33 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972), is \u201c[i]nstructive on this issue.\u201d It is correct that in <em>Peters </em>Justice Marshall, in the opinion announcing the Court\u2019s judgment, and the two members of the Court who joined his opinion, appeared to conclude that a white defendant had standing to challenge racial discrimination against black jurors, grand or petit, and that on the merits, the State\u2019s actions violated the defendant\u2019s due process right to an impartial jury. 407 U.S. at 502-504, 92 S.Ct. at 2168-2169. But <em>Peters </em>did not involve the still recognized peremptory challenges. As <em>Gorman </em>points out, the case was decided on due process grounds because \u201cPeters had been indicated by an illegally composed jury.\u201d We have noted that <em>Batson </em>did not declare peremptory challenges <em>per se </em>unconstitutional. <em>Peters </em>spoke in terms of \u201c[ijllegal and unconstitutional jury selection procedures ...\u201d and of \u201cthe exclusion from jury service of a substantial and identifiable class of citizens .... \u201d 407 U.S. at 502, 92 S.Ct. at 2168. In the light of <em>Batson, </em>the action of the prosecutor here in the exercise of peremptory challenges simply did not evidence such racial discrimination as to amount to a violation of due process as envisioned in <em>Peters.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\"><em>Batson </em>was founded solely on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. <em>See </em>note 5, <em>supra. </em>The majority of the Court looked to this constitutional right even though Batson expressly refused to raise it, both in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court of Kentucky. 476 U.S. at 112, 106 S.Ct. at 1731 (Burger, C.J., dissenting). Batson disclaimed any reliance on the Fourteenth Amendment, pressing instead only a claim based on the Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 112-115, 106 S.Ct. at 1731-1733. The majority ignored the Sixth Amendment argument and proceeded to decision under the Fourteenth Amendment, much to the consternation of the Chief Justice. <em>Id. </em>at 113-118, 106 S.Ct. at 1731-1734. It did so without directing the parties, when granting certiorari, to brief the equal protection question in addition to the Sixth Amendment question, nor did the Court, as it sometimes does, direct reargument on the equal protection question following oral argument. <em>Id. </em>at 115-116, 106 S.Ct. at 1732-1733. None of the concurring opinions suggested that peremptory challenges were a Sixth Amendment concern. Justice Marshall said in his concurring opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">I wholeheartedly concur in the Court\u2019s conclusion that use of the peremptory challenge to remove blacks from juries, on the basis of their race, violates the Equal Protection Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 105, 106 S.Ct. at 1727. The Sixth Amendment was referred to in the opinion of the Court in footnote 1 at 82, 106 S.Ct. at 1714:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">Following the lead of a number of state courts construing their State\u2019s Constitution, two Federal Courts of Appeals recently have accepted the view that peremptory challenges used to strike black jurors in a particular case may violate the Sixth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">But in footnote 4 at 84-85, 106 S.Ct. at 1716 the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">In this Court, petitioner has argued that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to an impartial jury and to a jury drawn from a cross section of the community. Petitioner has framed his argument in these terms in an apparent effort to avoid inviting the Court directly to reconsider one of its own precedents. On the other hand, the State has insisted that petitioner is claiming a denial of equal protection and that-we must reconsider <em>Swain </em>to find a constitutional violation on this record. We agree with the State that resolution of petitioner\u2019s claim properly turns on application of equal protection principles and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>express no view on the merits of any of petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment arguments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">None of the authors of the concurring opinions voiced displeasure at the failure of the Court to consider Batson\u2019s Sixth Amendment arguments. Justice Rehnquist declared in his dissenting opinion, joined by the Chief Justice, that he did not see \u201chow [the use of peremptory challenges] violates the Equal Protection Clause,\u201d and then observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayx\">Nor does such use of peremptory challenges by the State infringe upon any other constitutional interests. The Court does not suggest that exclusion of blacks from the jury through the State\u2019s use of peremptory challenges results in a violation of either the fair-cross-section or impartiality component of the Sixth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 138, 106 S.Ct. at 1745. If there were any doubt about the application of the Sixth Amendment to peremptory challenges, it was resolved in <em>Lockhart v. McCree, </em>476 U.S. 162, 106 S.Ct. 1758, 90 L.Ed.2d 137 (1986), decided within a week after <em>Batson. </em>The Court held flatly that the fair-cross-section component of the Sixth Amendment did not apply to peremptory challenges. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">We have never invoked the fair-cross-section principle to invalidate the use of either for-eause or peremptory challenges to prospective jurors, or to require petit juries, as opposed to jury panels or venires, to reflect the composition of the community at large. The limited scope of the fair-cross-section requirement is a direct and inevitable consequence of the practical impossibility of providing each criminal defendant with a truly \u201crepresentative\u201d petit jury, ... a basic truth____ We remain convinced that an extension of the fair-cross-section requirement to petit juries would be unworkable and unsound, and we decline McGree\u2019s invitation to adopt such an extension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azk\"><em>Id., </em>476 U.S. at 173-174, 106 S.Ct. at 1764-1765.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">The answer to the second question presented to us is that Gorman may not assert, by way of peremptory challenges, a Sixth Amendment claim of fair-cross-section deprivation in the composition of his jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The third question, as argued, would come into play only if the rule of <em>Batson </em>applied so that the procedures spelled out therein must be followed. If so, the State urges, a reversal of the judgments of conviction and sentence would not be appropriate. A limited remand for compliance with the <em>Batson </em>procedures would suffice. Reversal of the judgments entered in the trial court would be called for only if, on remand, the judge found that the defendant made out a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination and the State failed to come forward with a neutral explanation. In light of our conclusion that <em>Batson </em>does not apply in the circumstances of this case, the question as presented is not reached. Of course, it follows from our holding that since the judgments of the trial court stand as not constitutionally tainted, a new trial is not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED;</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY ROBERT WILLIAM GORMAN.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">ELDRIDGE, J., dissents with opinion in which COLE, J., concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\">.

The majority also holds that the State\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to discriminate against black veniremen neither violates due process nor violates the right to an impartial jury under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">I do not agree with any of these holdings. The State\u2019s use of its peremptory challenges to strike the only two black persons from the jury in this case constituted a prima facie showing that the State had discriminated in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It required the State\u2019s Attorney to give an explanation for his conduct. <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). The fact that the defendant was not a black person should not relieve the State of its obligation to explain a prima facie showing of racially discriminatory action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, I believe that the prima facie racial discrimination in jury selection, without any explanation, violated the defendant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law and his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury. Finally, in my view, the State\u2019s action in this case is inconsistent with Articles 21 and 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The majority takes the position that the equal protection principles set forth in <em>Batson v. Kentucky, supra, </em>apply \u201conly\u201d to the \u201ccircumstance\u201d of \u201ca black defendant aggrieved by the peremptory striking by the State of ... black veniremen from the petit jury which was empaneled to try him.\u201d In so holding, the majority refrains from stating that the defendant lacks \u201cstanding\u201d to mount an equal protection challenge. Instead, the majority seems to proceed as if the State, even if purposely exercising peremptory challenges to exclude black veniremen from the jury, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause unless the defendant is also black. The majority\u2019s decision purports to be grounded upon substantive equal protection doctrine rather than a lack of standing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>It is clear, however, that the State violates the Equal Protection Clause when its agent deliberately uses peremptory challenges to exclude persons from jury service because of their race or color, regardless of the defendant\u2019s race or color. In <em>Batson v. Kentucky, supra, </em>after pointing out that \u201cthe defendant does have the right to be tried by a jury whose members are selected pursuant to nondiscriminatory criteria\u201d (476 U.S. at 85-86, 106 S.Ct. at 1717), the Supreme Court went on (476 U.S. at 87-88, 106 S.Ct. at 1717-1718):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">\u201cRacial discrimination in selection of jurors harms not only the accused whose life or liberty they are summoned to try. Competence to serve as a juror ultimately depends on an assessment of individual qualifications and ability impartially to consider evidence presented at a trial. <em>See Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co., </em>328 U.S. 217, 223-224 [66 S.Ct. 984, 987-88, 90 L.Ed. 1181] (1946). A person\u2019s race simply \u2018is unrelated to his fitness as a juror.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 227 [66 S.Ct. at 989] (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). As long ago as <em>Strauder, </em>therefore, the Court recognized that by denying a person participation in jury service on account of his race, the State unconstitutionally discriminated against the excluded juror. 100 U.S. at 308; see <em>Carter v. Jury Comm\u2019n of Greene County, supra, </em>[396 U.S. 320] at 329-330 [90 S.Ct. 518, 523-528, 24 L.Ed.2d 549 (1970)]; <em>Neal v. Delaware, supra, </em>[103 U.S. [370]] at 386 [26 L.Ed. 567 (1881)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">\u201cThe harm from discriminatory jury selection extends beyond that inflicted on the defendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire community. Selection procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from juries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice. See <em>Ballard v. United States, </em>329 U.S. 187, 195 [67 S.Ct. 261, 265, 91 L.Ed. 181] (1946); <em>McCray v.

Discrimination within the judicial system is most pernicious because it is \u2018a stimulant to that race prejudice which is an impediment to securing to [black citizens] that equal justice which the law aims to secure to all others.\u2019 <em>Strauder, </em>100 U.S. at 308.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">And later the Court again emphasized that \u201c[t]he core guarantee of equal protection, ensuring citizens that their State will not discriminate on account of race, would be meaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors on the basis of ... assumptions\u201d that \u201cblacks as a group are unqualified to serve as jurors\u201d or \u201cwill be biased,\u201d 476 U.S. at 97-98, 106 S.Ct. 1723. <em>See, </em>in addition, <em>Rose v.

Texas, </em>316 U.S. 400, 406, 62 S.Ct. 1159, 1162, 86 L.Ed. 1559 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">As a State\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges purposely to exclude blacks from the jury is obviously a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, the majority\u2019s holding in this case, however worded, analytically involves a matter of standing. The majority in effect holds that, under the circumstances of this case, the defendant has no standing to attack the State\u2019s prima facie violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">In holding that the defendant may not challenge the State\u2019s conduct, the majority apparently reasons that the defendant, who is white, is not aggrieved or suffered no injury from the State\u2019s discrimination against black veniremen. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The majority opinion proceeds on the unexamined assumption that <em>Batson </em>itself is dispositive of the equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>protection-standing issue in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In holding that, under the Equal Protection Clause, a white defendant has no standing to object to the racially discriminatory exclusion of black jurors, the majority states: \u201cWe decline to go further than the Supreme Court.\u201d Nevertheless, because both <em>Batson </em>and the case it overruled, <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 85 S.Ct. 824, 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965), concerned a black defendant\u2019s challenge to the racially discriminatory exclusion of black jurors, the Supreme Court had no occasion \u201cto go further\u201d than it did. <em>Batson </em>simply does not resolve the standing issue presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Equally troubling is the majority\u2019s emphasis on <em>Swain v. Alabama, supra, </em>and its unwillingness to go beyond the discredited doctrine of that case. The majority apparently believes that, since peremptory challenges were virtually unassailable under <em>Swain, </em>they remain so today unless <em>Batson </em>expressly provides otherwise. Since the Supreme Court has not yet explicitly ruled upon a white defendant\u2019s prima facie showing that the prosecution has struck black jurors solely on the ground of their race, the majority concludes that the white defendant may not question the State\u2019s discriminatory use of peremptory strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">This emphasis on <em>Swain </em>is inappropriate. The \u201cright\u201d to employ peremptory challenges, while perhaps important, is neither conferred by the federal Constitution, <em>Batson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>Kentucky, supra, </em>476 U.S. at 91, 106 S.Ct. at 1720, nor by the Maryland Constitution. Consequently, even <em>Swain </em>recognized that the use of peremptory challenges must yield when it conflicts with constitutional rights, 380 U.S. at 222-224, 85 S.Ct. at 837-838. Moreover, as the majority points out, peremptory challenges are considered important because they \u201ctraditionally have been viewed as one means of assuring the selection of a qualified and unbiased jury,\u201d <em>Batson v. Kentucky, supra, </em>476 U.S. at 91, 106 S.Ct. at 1720. It is unclear, however, why the use of peremptory challenges should remain immune from scrutiny when the State has apparently attempted to subvert these goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The majority\u2019s decision in this case is in accord with the so-called \u201csame-class rule,\u201d under which a criminal defendant is denied standing to bring a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to the exclusion of a juror unless the defendant and the juror are members of the same \u201ccognizable group.\u201d While many courts have adopted this rule,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>with contemporary understanding of equal protection of the laws, at least in the context of racial discrimination. For example, few enlightened persons would maintain that a white child is not injured when, as a result of discrimination against black children, he must attend a segregated school. In fact, on several occasions, the Supreme Court has entertained school desegregation cases that were brought on behalf of <em>all </em>children in a school district. <em>Columbus Bd. of Ed. v. Penick, </em>443 U.S. 449, 99 S.Ct. 2941, 61 L.Ed.2d 666 (1979), <em>aff'g </em>583 F.2d 787, 795 (6th Cir.1978); <em>Milliken v. Bradley, </em>418 U.S. 717, 722, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 3116, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974) (class of \u201c \u2018all school children in the City of Detroit, Michigan, and all Detroit resident parents who have children of school age\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See also Hamm v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, </em>230 F.Supp. 156 (E.D.Va.), <em>aff'd, </em>379 U.S. 19, 85 S.Ct. 157, 13 L.Ed.2d 91 (1964) (court entertained equal protection challenge, brought by blacks and whites, to statutes requiring that public records be kept on segregated basis). From an equal protection standpoint, \u201c[t]he vice ... is the State's placing its power and prestige behind a policy of racial classification.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Martin, </em>206 F.Supp. 700, 705 (D.La.1962) (Wisdom, J., dissenting), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>375 U.S. 399, 84 S.Ct. 454, 11 L.Ed.2d 430 (1964). All persons are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>injured when the State intentionally engages in racially discriminatory conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Nonetheless, in applying the same-class rule, some courts have relied on selected language from Supreme Court opinions. One such opinion is <em>Castaneda v. Partida, </em>430 U.S. 482, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977), which concerned a Mexican-American\u2019s allegations of systematic discrimination against Mexican-Americans in the selection of grand juries. In setting forth the elements that constitute a prima facie case of intentional discrimination, the <em>Castaneda </em>Court stated (430 U.S. at 494, 97 S.Ct. at 1280): \u201c[I]n order to show that an equal protection violation has occurred in the context of grand jury selection, the defendant must show that the procedure employed resulted in a substantial underrepresentation of his race or of the identifiable group to which he belongs.\u201d The Court reiterated this statement in <em>Rose v. Mitchell, supra, </em>443 U.S. at 565, 99 S.Ct. at 3005, a case concerning a black defendant\u2019s allegations of discrimination against blacks in the selection of grand jury foremen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, like <em>Batson, </em>both <em>Rose v. Mitchell, supra, </em>and <em>Castaneda v. Partida, supra, </em>involved the systematic exclusion of jurors belonging to the defendant\u2019s own group. Therefore, neither case decided the question presented in this case, namely, whether a criminal defendant belonging to one race has standing to challenge intentional racial discrimination against jurors of another race. <em>See United States v. Perez-Hernandez, </em>672 F.2d 1380, 1386 (11th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The United States Supreme Court case which did involve the same-class rule in the context of excluding black persons from juries was <em>Peters v. Kiff, </em>407 U.S. 493, 92 S.Ct. 2163, 33 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972). The Court rejected the same-class rule in that context, holding in <em>Peters </em>that a white defendant had standing to challenge racial discrimination against blacks in the selection of grand and petit juries. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The defendant in <em>Peters </em>asserted that such discrimination violated his Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection. In response, the State of Georgia argued that, because the defendant was not black, his conviction should not be disturbed. In two separate opinions, six Justices disagreed with the State\u2019s argument and held that the white defendant had standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Directing himself to \u201cthe commands of equal protection and of due process,\u201d 407 U.S. at 496, 92 S.Ct. at 2165, Justice Marshall, in the opinion announcing the Court\u2019s judgment in <em>Peters, </em>reasoned as follows (407 U.S. at 502-504, 92 S.Ct. at 2168-2169):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">\u201cIllegal and unconstitutional jury selection procedures cast doubt on the integrity of the whole judicial process. They create the appearance of bias in the decision of individual cases, and they increase the risk of actual bias as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">\u201cIf it were possible to say with confidence that the risk of bias resulting from the arbitrary action involved here is confined to cases involving Negro defendants, then perhaps the right to challenge the tribunal on that ground could be similarly confined. The case of the white defendant might then be thought to present a species of harmless error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">\u201cBut the exclusion from jury service of a substantial and identifiable class of citizens has a potential impact that is too subtle and too pervasive to admit of confinement to particular issues or particular cases. First, if we assume that the exclusion of Negroes affects the fairness of the jury only with respect to issues presenting a clear opportunity for the operation of race prejudice, that assumption does not provide a workable guide for decision in particular cases. For the opportunity to appeal to race prejudice is latent in a vast range of issues, cutting across the entire fabric of our society.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">\u201cMoreover, we are unwilling to make the assumption that the exclusion of Negroes has relevance only for issues involving race. When any large and identifiable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>segment of the community is excluded from jury service, the effect is to remove from the jury room qualities of human nature and varieties of human experience, the range of which is unknown and perhaps unknowable. It is not necessary to assume that the excluded group will consistently vote as a class in order to conclude, as we do, that its exclusion deprives the jury of a perspective on human events that may have unsuspected importance in any case that may be presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">\u201cIt is in the nature of the practices here challenged that proof of actual harm, or lack of harm, is virtually impossible to adduce____ In light of the great potential for harm latent in an unconstitutional jury-selection system, and the strong interest of the criminal defendant in avoiding that harm, any doubt should be resolved in favor of giving the opportunity for challenging the jury to too many defendants, rather than giving it to too few.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201cAccordingly, we hold that, whatever his race, a criminal defendant has standing to challenge the system used to select his grand or petit jury, on the ground that it arbitrarily excludes from service the members of any race, and thereby denies him due process of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Thus, in <em>Peters, </em>Justice Marshall and the two members of the Court who joined his opinion appeared to conclude that the defendant had standing under both the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause to challenge racial discrimination against black jurors and that, on the merits, the State\u2019s actions violated the defendant\u2019s due process right to an impartial jury. <em>Accord, Ford v. Kentucky, </em>469 U.S. 984, 985, 105 S.Ct. 392, 393, 83 L.Ed.2d 325 (1984) (Marshall, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Moreover, when a white defendant complains of racial discrimination against black jurors, it is largely irrelevant whether he is said to have suffered a violation of his right to equal protection or whether, because of the violation of the jurors\u2019 rights to equal protection, he is said to have been denied due process.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In either case, the opinion announcing the judgment of the Court in <em>Peters v. Kiff </em>makes it clear that the white defendant has standing to challenge the State\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Three other members of the Court concurred in the judgment in <em>Peters. </em>In this opinion, Justice White emphasized \u201cthe central concern of the Fourteenth Amendment with racial discrimination\u201d and \u201cthe strong statutory policy of [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 243,\u201d which implements the concerns of that Amendment, 407 U.S. at 507, 92 S.Ct. at 2170. Thus, while recognizing that his position was contrary to \u201cthe generally accepted constitutional view,\u201d 407 U.S. at 506, 92 S.Ct. at 2170, Justice White concluded that, under the Fourteenth Amendment<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and \u00a7 243, the white <em>Peters </em>defendant had standing to challenge racial discrimination against black jurors. 407 U.S. at 506-507, 92 S.Ct. at 2170.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>There is no distinction between the defendant in this case and the defendant in <em>Peters v. Kiff. </em>Because a majority of the Supreme Court clearly held that the white defendant in <em>Peters </em>had standing to challenge racial discrimination against black persons in the selection of his jury, the defendant in the present case should also be accorded standing to challenge the State\u2019s prima facie discrimination against black veniremen by the use of peremptory strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">This Court also has refused to apply the same-class rule to a defendant\u2019s argument that the exclusion of a particular group from juries violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In <em>Schowgurow v. State, </em>240 Md. 121, 128, 213 A.2d 475, 480 (1965), the Court held that, insofar as it requires demonstration of belief in God as a qualification for service as a grand or petit juror, Article 36 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights violated both the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since Schowgurow himself did not believe in a Supreme Being, he was a member of the same class as the excluded jurors. In <em>State v. Madison, </em>240 Md. 265, 213 A.2d 880 (1965), however, this Court held that, under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a defendant had standing to challenge the exclusion of nonbelievers even though he believed in God and, thus, did not belong to the same class as the excluded jurors. While the dissenters in <em>Madison </em>advocated the same-class rule (240 Md. at 279-280, 213 A.2d at 888-889), the Court relied on a number of decisions from other jurisdictions permitting a defendant to challenge the exclusion of a particular class regardless of whether the defendant himself belonged to that class. Furthermore, the Court recognized that premising the availability of the <em>Schowgurow </em>defense on whether the defendant did or did not believe in God would itself, in effect, run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>counter to principles of equal protection. Writing for the Court, Judge Reuben Oppenheimer stated (240 Md. at 274, 213 A.2d at 886):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">\u201cUnder the State\u2019s contention, while Schowgurow, a Buddhist, was held entitled to a new trial because he was indicted and tried by juries unconstitutionally selected, Madison, a member of the Apostolic faith, could not object to his indictment by a grand jury selected in the same unconstitutional manner. The only difference between the two men, in this respect, is the nature of their religious beliefs. Discrimination because of opinions about religion is one of the classic examples of denial of the equal protection of the laws. <em>Niemotko v. Maryland, </em>340 U.S. 268, 272-73 [71 S.Ct. 325, 95 L.Ed. 267] (1951); <em>Juarez v. State, </em>102 Tex.Crim. 297, 303-04, 277 S.W. 1091 (1925). If we were to uphold the State\u2019s contention in this case, the effect would be that pending indictments against persons who believed in a Supreme Being could not be successfully challenged, while indictments against others who do not have that belief would be dismissed. There would, in effect, be an unconstitutional discrimination in favor of non-believers as against believers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcX\">Similarly, the only difference between the defendant in the present case and the defendant in <em>Batson </em>is the color of their skin. Discrimination on the basis of race, however, is <em>the </em>classic example of a denial of equal protection. Therefore, under this Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Madison,- </em>it is inconsistent with principles of equal protection to hold that a black defendant may object to the State\u2019s purposeful use of peremptory challenges to remove black jurors, but that a defendant of any other racial group may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">In the context of a case such as this, the same-class rule apparently rests on the assumption that a jury, from which, black persons have been discriminatorily excluded, would never harbor prejudice against a white defendant. In other words, the same-class rule supposes that \u201cthere can be no racial prejudice between members of the same race,\u201d <em>Salisbury v. Grimes, </em>406 F.2d 50, 51 (5th Cir.1969). The suppo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>sition, however, is clearly false. <em>See Castaneda v. Partida, supra, </em>430 U.S. at 503, 97 S.Ct. at 1284, 1285 (Marshall, J., concurring), and sources cited therein; Note, <em>The Defendant's Challenge to Racial Criterion in Jury Selection, </em>74 Yale L.J. 919, 921-922 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">It is not difficult to conceive of instances in which jurors of a particular group might be inclined to discriminate against defendants of the same group. For example, during the 1960\u2019s, white civil rights workers frequently incurred the enmity of their fellow whites. As a result, a number of courts permitted white defendants who had been involved in voter registration or picketing to object to the exclusion of black jurors. <em>Allen v. State, </em>110 Ga.App. 56, 62-63, 137 S.E.2d 711, 715 (1964); <em>State v. Lowry, </em>263 N.C. 536, 544, 139 S.E.2d 870, 876, <em>cert. denied and appeal dismissed, </em>382 U.S. 22, 86 S.Ct. 227, 15 L.Ed.2d 16 (1965); <em>Bokulich v. Jury Commission of Greene County, Alabama, </em>298 F.Supp. 181, 185 (N.D.Ala.1968), <em>aff'd, </em>394 U.S. 97, 89 S.Ct. 767, 22 L.Ed.2d 109 (1969).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A similar problem might arise, for example, in cases in which the defendant is white but his attorney or his chief witness is black. <em>See </em>L. Magid, <em>Challenges to Jury Composition, </em>24 San Diego L.Rev. 1081, 1092 (1987). <em>See also Castaneda v. Partida, supra, </em>430 U.S. at 499, 97 S.Ct. at 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The invalidity of the assumptions underlying the same-class rule, however, is not the most important reason for according a defendant standing to challenge the State\u2019s racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges. As previously discussed, the State\u2019s exclusion of persons from jury service on racial grounds, by the exercise of peremptory challenges, is clearly a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. Such racial discrimination in jury selection \u201cviolates a defendant\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>equal protection because it denies him the protection that a trial by jury is intended to secure.\u201d <em>Batson v. Kentucky, supra, </em>476 U.S. at 86, 106 S.Ct. at 1717. In addition, the racially discriminatory conduct harms the persons excluded from jury service, harms the criminal justice system, and harms the entire community. It is the type of invidious discrimination which the Equal Protection Clause was specifically designed to prohibit, and which a court should not tolerate. In a criminal case the defendant, regardless of his own race, is normally the only party who can challenge the State\u2019s racial discrimination in the selection of the jury. Consequently, I would hold that the defendant in the present case has standing to challenge, under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause, the State\u2019s prima facie discriminatory exercise of peremptory challenges. I would reach the same conclusion under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">As pointed out in the majority opinion, the defendant Gorman also argues that the State\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to exclude all of the black veniremen from the jury denied him due process of law. The defendant specifically relies upon <em>Peters v. Kiff, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The majority seems to acknowledge that the defendant has \u201cstanding\u201d to challenge the State\u2019s action on due process grounds. Nonetheless, the majority rejects the defendant\u2019s due process argument, saying that \u201c[i]n the light of <em>Batson, </em>the action of the prosecutor here in the exercise of peremptory challenges simply did not evidence such racial discrimination as to amount to a violation of due process as envisioned in <em>Peters.\u201d </em>I totally fail to understand this reasoning by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\"><em>Batson v. Kentucky, supra, </em>reiterated the holdings of a multitude of prior cases that the United States Constitution \u201cforbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race,\u201d 476 U.S. at 89, 106 S.Ct. at 1719. <em>Peters v. Kiff, supra, </em>makes it clear that the State\u2019s exclusion of black persons from the petit jury, solely on account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>of their race, is unlawful under the Fourteenth Amendment and constitutes a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 243; moreover, the illegality of the jury composition in no way depends upon the defendant\u2019s race. As Justice Marshall stated in the opinion announcing the Court\u2019s judgment in <em>Peters, </em>407 U.S. at 497-498, 92 S.Ct. at 2166:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\u201cThis Court has repeatedly held that the Constitution prohibits such selection practices, with respect to the grand jury, the petit jury, or both. Moreover, Congress has made it a crime for a public official to exclude anyone from a grand or petit jury on the basis of race, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 243, and this Court upheld the statute, approving the congressional determination that such exclusion would violate the express prohibitions of the Equal Protection Clause. Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 25 L.Ed. 676 (1880). The crime, and the unconstitutional state action, occur whether he is white or Negro, acquitted or convicted. In short, when a grand or petit jury has been selected on an impermissible basis, the existence of a constitutional violation does not depend on the circumstances of the person making the claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Justice Marshall, joined by two other justices, went on to hold that the unlawful racial discrimination in jury selection denied the defendant due process of law, and that the defendant, without having to show \u201cactual bias\u201d in the jury or \u201cactual harm\u201d to himself, had standing to raise the due process violation, 407 U.S. at 501-505, 92 S.Ct. at 2168-2170. Justice White, joined by two other members of the Court, took the position that the State\u2019s exclusion of black persons from jury service violated the Fourteenth Amendment and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 243, and could be challenged by a white defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">What <em>Batson v. Kentucky, supra, </em>added was to lessen the evidentiary burden upon the criminal defendant when the State\u2019s alleged racial discrimination in jury selection took the form of peremptory challenges. As Justice Powell stated for the Court in the opening paragraph of <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 82, 106 S.Ct. at 1714, the case \u201cconcern[ed] the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>evidentiary burden placed on the criminal defendant\u201d who alleges discrimination in jury selection. Nothing in <em>Batson </em>modified the substantive holdings in <em>Peters v. Kiff </em>regarding the denial of the defendant\u2019s due process rights or general Fourteenth Amendment rights where the State excludes black persons from jury service.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In the instant case, when the State used its peremptory challenges to strike all of the black veniremen, there arose under the evidentiary standards of <em>Batson </em>a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under <em>Peters v. Kiff, supra, </em>the defendant, regardless of his race or color, is entitled to challenge the State\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>unlawful exclusion of black persons from the jury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>guarantee a criminal defendant the right to trial \u201cby an impartial jury.\u201d Several courts have held that the State\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to exclude persons of a particular race from the jury violates either the Sixth Amendment Right to an impartial jury or the equivalent state constitutional provision. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>State v. Superior Court, </em>157 Ariz. 541, 760 P.2d 541 (1988) (white defendant accorded standing to challenge under the Sixth Amendment the prosecution\u2019s use of peremptory challeng-es to exclude the only two black veniremen from the jury); <em>People v.

We held in <em>Evans </em>that the prosecutor had sufficiently explained his peremptory strikes so as to rebut the prima facie case of racial discrimination (304 Md. at 528, 499 A.2d at 1282), and we held in <em>Lawrence </em>that the defendant had failed to establish a prima facie case under the standards of the <em>Wheeler </em>and <em>Soares </em>opinions (295 Md. at 571, 457 A.2d at 1184). <em>See </em>the discussion in <em>Stanley v.

Consequently, I agree with the above-cited cases which hold that, under the constitutional guarantees of an impartial jury, a prima facie showing of discrimination against black veniremen because of their race, by the State in its use of peremptory challenges, shifts the burden to the State to show that the exclusion of the black veniremen was for reasons other than race.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Judge COLE has authorized me to state that he concurs with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\">.

Chestnut, </em>26 N.Y.2d 481, 488-491, 260 N.E.2d 501, 505-507, 311 N.Y.S.2d 853, 858-861 (1970), five white defendants and one black defendant alleged that blacks and Puerto Ricans had been systematically excluded from grand juries in Manhattan. The Court of Appeals of New York reached the merits in this case without discussing the defendant's standing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b466-9\">. In <em>Milliken v. Bradley, supra, </em>the NAACP was an additional plaintiff. Apparently out of concern that this association might lack standing under decisions such as <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972), the Court noted (418 U.S. at 722 n. 2, 94 S.Ct. at 3116 n. 2): \u201cThe standing of the NAACP as a proper party plaintiff was not contested in the trial court and is not an issue in this case.\u201d By contrast, the question of the class members\u2019 standing evidently did not trouble the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\">. <em>See also Alexander v. Louisiana, </em>405 U.S. 625, 92 S.Ct. 1221, 31 L.Ed.2d 536 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\">. In <em>Ford v. Kentucky, supra, </em>Justice Marshall characterized his opinion in <em>Peters v. Kiff </em>as concluding \"that a white male had standing under both the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to bring a racial-discrimination challenge to the state system used to select his grand and petit juries,\u201d 469 U.S. at 985, 105 S.Ct. at 393.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b470-6\">. In fact, Justice Marshall has written that, even when a black defendant objects to the systematic exclusion of black jurors, it makes little sense to conceive of the State\u2019s conduct solely as an equal protection violation. <em>Ford v. Kentucky, supra, </em>469 U.S. at 988, 105 S.Ct. at 395. Instead, according to Justice Marshall, such conduct also resembles a due process violation, \"for the defendant in these cases is not asking to sit on the jury but rather to be fairly treated by it.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\">. Justice White's reference to the Fourteenth Amendment as a whole, and not to any particular clause of the Amendment, further illustrates that, in a case such as this one, it matters little whether the defendant is said to have standing under the Equal Protection Clause as opposed to the Due Process Clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b470-8\">. Since the concurring opinion was limited to cases of racial discrimination, its approach is narrower than that of the opinion announcing the judgment of the Court. Under the latter opinion, a white defendant would have standing not only in cases of racial discrimination but also whenever \"any large and identifiable segment of the community is excluded from jury service,\" 407 U.S. at 503, 92 S.Ct. at 2169. <em>See also Ford v. Kentucky, supra, </em>469 U.S. at 985-986, 105 S.Ct. at 393 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>(Marshall, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). The present case, however, is concerned only with allegations of racial discrimination. Consequently, under the circumstances of this case, the differences between the two opinions in <em>Peters </em>are essentially irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\">. <em>But compare Alexander v. State, </em>160 Tex.Crim. 460, 274 S.W.2d 81, <em>cert. denied, </em>348 U.S. 872, 75 S.Ct. 108, 99 L.Ed. 686 (1954) (in prosecution arising out of labor dispute, white defendant, who had organized union that was 75% black, could not challenge indictment on ground of discrimination against blacks in grand jury selection).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\">. In <em>State v. Madison, supra, </em>this Court reached a similar conclusion, holding that the unconstitutional exclusion of a particular group from the jury denied the defendant due process, even though the defendant did not belong to the excluded group. The Court there stated (240 Md. at 273-274, 213 A.2d at 885):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">\"[0]nce it is established that the method of the grand jury\u2019s selection is unconstitutional, any accused indicted by such a jury has the right to have the indictment dismissed. He has this right, not because of any individual prejudice to him but because, under the basic law of our land, all persons accused of crime have the right to be tried in accordance with the requirements of our legal system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">\"... Madison\u2019s right to challenge his indictment ... rests upon the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and upon the law of the land provision of Article 23 [now Article 24] of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. When the law of the land has been made clear ... a person accused of a crime, to be entitled to due process, does not have to show that he would be injured if due process is lacking. The right to be tried in accordance with the law is the constitutional privilege of every man.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqP\"><em>See State v. Vincent, </em>91 Md. 718, 47 A. 1036 (1900); <em>Clare v.
