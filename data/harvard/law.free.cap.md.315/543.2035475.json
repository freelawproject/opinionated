Graham (Graham). We shall hold that on the facts of this case the collateral estoppel doctrine is inapplicable for two reasons. First, issue preclusion does not apply, since the fact-finding sought to be relitigated was not essential to the Commission\u2019s decision. Second, the doctrine is not available because the party against whom it is sought to be asserted could not have appealed from the decision that allegedly embodied the fact-finding in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">At the times relevant to this case, Murray International was a trucking company operating out of Baltimore County. Graham was the owner-operator of a tractor; he hauled freight for Murray International. Whether Graham was an independent contractor or an employee of Murray International is, as we shall see, a matter of some debate. In any case, Graham and Murray International at one point agreed that the latter would afford Graham coverage under its workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy. Murray Interna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>tional deducted from Graham\u2019s remuneration the premiums reflecting this coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">On 24 September 1985, Graham was allegedly injured while hauling freight for Murray International. He claimed workers\u2019 compensation. In opposition to the claim, Murray International raised several issues, one of them being that of Graham\u2019s employment status. On 17 April 1986, after hearing, the Commission passed an order finding that Graham \u201cwas an employee of Murray International Freight but ... that the claimant did not sustain an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment____\u201d Graham\u2019s claim was disallowed. Apparently, no one appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The scene now shifts to the District Court of Maryland. There, Graham sued Murray International to recover the workers\u2019 compensation premiums the corporation had deducted from his pay. The theory of the action was that since Graham had been a corporate employee, the employer itself should have paid the premiums, and any agreement to the contrary was invalid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Conflicting evidence on the employment issue was presented, but Graham prevailed when the District Court held \u201cthe doctrine of collateral estoppel requires this court to leave the Commission\u2019s finding that the plaintiff, Thomas Graham, was an employee conclusive, unreviewable, and final.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Murray International sought solace from the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, but in vain. That court agreed with the District Court: \u201cSince the issue here is collateral estoppel, it was not necessary for the District Court ... to review the evidence before it.\u201d It affirmed. We granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">As a matter of general policy, the law ordinarily precludes the relitigation of matters that have been fully and fairly litigated and finally decided between parties, by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction. This policy avoids \u201cthe expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserves judicial resources, and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibilities of inconsistent decisions.\u201d <em>Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 153-154, 99 S.Ct. 970, 973-974, 59 L.Ed.2d 210, 217 (1979). <em>See Pat Perusse Realty v. Lingo, </em>249 Md. 33, 45, 238 A.2d 100, 107 (1968). <em>See also MPC, Inc. v. Kenny, </em>279 Md. 29, 35, 367 A.2d 486, 490 (1977) (public policy against interminable delay \u201capplies with equal vigor in cases of collateral estoppel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Thus, rules have developed to preserve the conclusive effect of judgments, except on appeal or other direct review. These rules, sometimes referred to under the rubric of \u201cres judicata,\u201d include both claim preclusion and issue preclusion (sometimes here termed \u201ccollateral estoppel\u201d). <em>Kent County Bd. of Educ. v. Bilbrough, </em>309 Md. 487, 489-490, 525 A.2d 232, 233 (1987); <em>Cook v. State, </em>281 Md. 665, 668, 381 A.2d 671, 673, <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 839, 99 S.Ct. 126, 58 L.Ed.2d 136 (1978); <em>Scott v. Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>76 Md.App. 357, 374, 375 n. 19, 545 A.2d 81, 90 n. 19, <em>cert. denied, </em>314 Md. 193, 550 A.2d 381 (1988). <em>See also </em>J. Friedenthal, M. Kane and A. Miller, <em>Civil Procedure </em>\u00a7 14.1, at 607-609 (1985). We deal here with the latter, which has been thus described: \u201cWhen an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 27 (1982). <em>See also Welsh v. Gerber Products, Inc., </em>315 Md. 510, 517, 555 A.2d 486, 489 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">These principles are well-settled. <em>LeBrun v. Marcey, </em>199 Md. 223, 227-228, 86 A.2d 512, 514-515 (1952) (quoting with approval \u00a7 68 of the original <em>Restatement of Judgments </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>(1942), embodied without pertinent substantive change in \u00a7 27 of the <em>Restatement (Second) </em>quoted immediately above).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> What is not so well-settled, at least in Maryland, is whether a determination of the Commission is entitled to preclusive effect. <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 83(1) instructs (subject to exceptions) that \u201ca valid and final adjudicative determination by an administrative tribunal has the same effects under the rules of res judicata, subject to the same exceptions and qualifications, as a judgment of a court.\u201d Section 83(2) lists the \u201cessential elements of adjudication\u201d that must prevail if judgment of an administrative tribunal is to qualify for res judicata treatment. Judge Eldridge, writing for the Court in <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>282 Md. 641, 658, 387 A.2d 260, 270 (1978), explained that the Maryland Tax Court, an administrative agency, \u201cfunctions in many respects as a court\u201d and concluded \u201cthat the decisions of the Tax Court have res judicata effect.\u201d <em>See also Woodlawn Ass\u2019n v. Board, </em>241 Md. 187, 194-195, 216 A.2d 149, 154-155 (1966) (questioning earlier decisions declining to apply res judicata to decisions of administrative agencies) and <em>Bd. of Co. Comm\u2019rs v. Racine, </em>24 Md.App. 435, 447, 332 A.2d 306, 313 (1975) (applying some of the principles of res judicata to a zoning board decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Turning more specifically to cases involving the Commission, our decision in <em>Criminal Inj. Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 519, 331 A.2d 55, 75 (1975), may be read as affording preclusive effect to a Commission determination. <em>See also, e.g., Dolan v. Kent Research &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>63 Md.App. 55, 68, 491 A.2d 1226, 1233 (1985) (res judicata and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>collateral estoppel discussed but neither doctrine applicable under facts); <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Baker, </em>40 Md. App. 339, 344-345, 392 A.2d 94, 97-98 (1978) (even if res judicata applicable to Commission decision, effect limited by Art. 101, \u00a7 40(c)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But if we assume, arguendo, that res judicata effect ordinarily attends the Commission\u2019s decisions, Graham still cannot invoke the benefits of collateral estoppel. <em>See Mackall v. Zayre Cory., </em>293 Md. 221, 227, 443 A.2d 98, 101 (1982). We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Assuming, without deciding, that a court may, in general, give collateral estoppel effect to a Commission decision, there are prerequisites to be met before that can be done in a particular case. These are summarized in \u00a7 27 of the <em>Restatement (Second), </em>which we have quoted above. One of these is identity of parties. That is present here; Graham and Murray International were adversaries both before the Commission and in the subsequent District Court litigation. A second prerequisite is that the issue of fact or law actually be litigated. <em>See Welsh, </em>315 Md. at 518, 555 A.2d at 490. The parties are at considerable odds over whether much, if any, evidence about Graham\u2019s employment status was presented to the Commission. We cannot resolve the dispute because the record does not include the transcript of the Commission hearing. But the issue was certainly before the Commission. It was raised by Murray International and its insurer in the \u201cIssues\u201d form they presented to the Commission; it was expressly noted by the Commission in its order of 17 April 1986; and it was determined in that order. The <em>Restatement (Second) </em>teaches that \u201c[wjhen an issue is properly raised, by the pleadings or otherwise, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>is submitted for determination, and is determined, the issue is actually litigated within the meaning of [\u00a7 27].\u201d Section 27 comment d. See comment e for discussion of when issues are not actually litigated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We shall assume that the issue of Graham\u2019s employment status was actually litigated before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">But this is as far as we can accompany Graham on the road to collateral estoppel. The employment issue was not \u201cessential to the [Commission\u2019s] judgment.\u201d And what is even more important, Murray International could not have appealed from that \u201cjudgment.\u201d As we shall show, either factor alone precludes giving collateral estoppel effect to the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The Commission\u2019s \u201cjudgment\u201d read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">It is, therefore, this 17 day of April, 1986, by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission ORDERED that the claim filed herein by Thomas Edward Graham, claimant, against Murray International Freight, employer, and State Accident Fund, insurer, be and the same is hereby disallowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Patently, no determination that Graham was an employee of Murray International was essential to that \u201cjudgment.\u201d The Commission could have reached the same result without making any determination of Graham\u2019s employment status. For example, it could have determined that Graham had suffered no accidental injury, or that there was no causal connection between the injury and Graham\u2019s disability, or that (assuming employment) the injury did not arise out of or in the course of that employment. The fact that it found in a preliminary portion of its order that Graham was an employee of Murray International makes no difference. We turn again to the <em>Restatement (Second), </em>this time to \u00a7 27 comment h:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>If issues are determined but the judgment is not dependent on the determinations, relitigation of those issues in a subsequent action between the parties is not precluded. Such determinations have the characteristics of dicta, and may not ordinarily be the subject of an appeal by the party against whom they were made. In the circumstances, the interest in providing an opportunity for a considered determination, which if adverse may be the subject of an appeal, outweighs the interest in avoiding the burden of relitigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">The <em>Restatement </em>provides an illustration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">14. A, as owner of a trademark, brings an action against B for an infringement. B denies the validity of the trademark and denies infringement. The court finds that the trademark is valid, but that B had not infringed it, and gives judgment for B. Thereafter A brings an action against B alleging that since the rendition of the judgment B infringed the trademark. B is not precluded from defending this action on the ground that the trademark is invalid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">This illustration neatly fits the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">A similar point is capsulized in comment o of \u00a7 68 of the original <em>Restatement of Judgments, </em>as favorably quoted in <em>LeBrun, supra, </em>199 Md. at 227-228, 86 A.2d at 514:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACl\">\u201cThus, if the defendant interposes two defenses, either of which is sufficient to bar the plaintiffs claim, and there is a finding for the defendant on one of the issues, a finding for the plaintiff on the other issue is immaterial to the judgment, since the judgment would be for the defendant whichever way the court should find on the other issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">This Court further noted that estoppel does not apply to immaterial matters. 199 Md. at 228, 86 A.2d at 514. <em>See also Paolino v. McCormick &amp; Co., </em>314 Md. 575, 582, 552 A.2d 868, 871 (1989) (Commission\u2019s statement as to limitations was no more than step in reasoning that allowed Commission to reach dispositive issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Since the determination that Graham was an employee was not essential to the Commission\u2019s decision to deny his claim, the determination can have no preclusive effect in the litigation between Graham and Murray International. While this alone is sufficient to reverse the decision of the circuit court, we hold that the same result also is compelled by the fact that Murray International could not have appealed from the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">As our earlier quotation from the <em>Restatement (Second) </em>\u00a7 27 comment h illustrates, \u201c[i]f review is unavailable because the party who lost on the issue obtained a judgment in his favor, the general rule of \u00a7 27 is inapplicable by its own terms.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) </em>\u00a7 28 comment a. Indeed, that ordinarily is true even if all of \u00a7 27\u2019s prerequisites for preclusion are met, but \u201c[t]he party against whom preclusion is sought could not, as a matter of law, have obtained review of the judgment in the initial action____\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) </em>\u00a7 28(1). <em>See Grau v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>210 Md. 19, 24, 122 A.2d 824, 826 (1956) (applying \u00a7 69(2) of <em>Restatement of Judgments, </em>predecessor to \u00a7 28(1) of <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments)', </em><footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Lake Fls. Assn. v. Bd. of Zon. Appeals, </em>209 Md. 561, 567, 121 A.2d 809, 812 (1956) (same); <em>see also Dorsey v. Solomon, </em>435 F.Supp. 725 (D.Md.1977). The question then becomes whether Murray International could have appealed from the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">We answered the question in <em>Paolino v. McCormick &amp; Co., </em>314 Md. 575, 552 A.2d 868 (1989). There, Paolino (the employee) had sought to reopen an order of the Commission pursuant to Article 101, \u00a7 40(c). McCormick (the employer) argued that the petition was time-barred. The Commission determined that the claim was not time-barred, but, never<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>theless, rejected it. <em>Paolino, </em>314 Md. at 578, 552 A.2d at 869. We held that order was \u201cwholly favorable to McCormick\u201d and thus unappealable by McCormick, 314 Md. at 582-584, 552 A.2d at 871-872, for an order that is wholly in a party\u2019s favor ordinarily is not appealable by that party. <em>Paolino, </em>314 Md. at 579-582, 552 A.2d at 869-871 and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">For purposes of appealability, a final order or final action of the Commission is \u201c \u2018an order or award made by the Commission in the matter then before it, determining the issues of law and of fact necessary for a resolution of the problem presented in that particular proceeding <em>and </em>which grants or denies some benefit under the Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Paolino, </em>314 Md. 583, 552 A.2d at 872 (quoting <em>Great American Ins. v. Havenner, </em>33 Md.App. 326, 332, 364 A.2d 95, 99 (1976)) [emphasis in <em>Havenner </em>]. As we already have explained, determination of the employment issue was not necessary to a \u201cresolution of the problem presented\u201d by Graham\u2019s compensation claim. What is more, the Commission\u2019s order here, as in <em>Paolino, </em>denied the employee\u2019s claim altogether. It thus denied the employee any benefits under the Act and was, therefore, wholly in the employer\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Because the Commission\u2019s finding that Graham was employed by Murray International had no preclusive effect, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>must reverse.

Graham insists that the employment determination conferred a benefit on him and was, accordingly, appealable by Murray International. He attempts to conjure up the benefit from the provisions of Article 101, \u00a7 51. As we have seen, that section, among other things, declares invalid any agreement between an employer and an employee whereby the employer deducts worker compensation premiums from the employee\u2019s salary. This provision confers no benefit on Graham, as that term is used in <em>Paolino, </em>314 Md. 575, 583, 552 A.2d 868, 872, <em>Great American Ins. v. Havenner, </em>33 Md.App. 326, 332, 364 A.2d 95, 99 (1976), and similar cases. A \u201cbenefit,\u201d as those cases employ the word, means a grant of an award under Article 101, or something equivalent thereto; that is, something awarded by the Commission. The Commission has no authority to enforce \u00a7 51. It cannot apply that section to invalidate a contract and award restitution. That is within the province of a court. Thus, a Commission determination of employee status cannot, by itself, confer any benefit under that Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
