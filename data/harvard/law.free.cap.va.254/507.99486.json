In the first of two trials conducted by the Circuit Court of the City of Portsmouth, the judge struck the robbery charge and, when the jury reported that it was unable to reach a verdict on the murder charge, he declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Following three and one-half days in the conduct of the second trial in October 1995, the foreman of the jury announced that the jury was \u201cdeadlocked\u201d. Upon further deliberation required by an Allen instruction, the jury returned a verdict convicting Caprio of second degree murder and fixing his penalty at 15 years in the penitentiary. By final judgment order dated January 10, 1996, and entered February 1, 1996, the court confirmed the verdict and imposed the penalty. The Court of Appeals upheld the several rulings of the trial court challenged by the appellant, and we awarded Caprio this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Neither Caprio\u2019s testimony at trial nor the investigating officer\u2019s handwritten transcript of Caprio\u2019s statements contained an inculpatory admission, and the record shows that the evidence underlying this conviction was wholly circumstantial. Consequently, we will summarize only those facts in evidence relevant to the issue we consider dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">Ms. Bickley\u2019s corpse was discovered about 11:00 p.m. on August 5, 1991, lying in the middle of a street intersection. After Caprio was identified as a suspect, but before he was arrested, he volunteered to submit blood samples for DNA analysis. Jeffrey D. Ban, Section Chief of the Serology DNA Unit at the Virginia Division of Forensic Science, supervised a series of DNA analyses of these samples, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>samples of the victim\u2019s blood, and samples of genetic materials found on a pair of shorts Caprio had worn on the day of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In a \u201ccertificate of analysis\u201d dated May 17, 1995, Ban stated that \u201c[t]he DNA profile obtained from Harry Caprio\u2019s shorts ... is consistent with the DNA profile of Elizabeth M. Bickley . . . and different from that of Harry Caprio . . . .\u201d Based upon the five tests comprising that analysis, Ban concluded that \u201c[t]he probability of randomly selecting an unrelated individual with a matching DNA profile ... is approximately ... 1 in 210 in the Caucasian population <em>99 </em>,</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">This certificate reaffirmed Ban\u2019s conclusion, based upon a single test that was reported in his certificate issued September 16, 1993, that \u201cthe genetic material deposited on Harry Caprio\u2019s shorts cannot be eliminated as originating from Elizabeth Bickley.\u201d Both certificates and a report of enzyme testing by a forensic serologist were timely delivered to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">On the day before Ban testified at the second trial, he reviewed the results of the seven DNA tests underlying the two certificates and the serologist\u2019s report and advised the Commonwealth that he would use a chart during his testimony to illustrate the results of that review. The Commonwealth notified defense counsel and, invoking Code \u00a7 19.2-270.5, counsel objected to introduction of that evidence and, in the alternative, moved for a continuance. The trial court overruled the objection and denied the motion, and Ban testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">Taking each of these into account, each of the seven, you have approximately one in a hundred twenty thousand individuals would have a profile that would be consistent with each of these seven different areas that I have tested for in the Caucasian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">[W]e would have to test ... a hundred twenty thousand people before we\u2019d find this profile again . . . [and] we might find that profile again, or we might not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">Basically, we\u2019ve looked at seven different areas, several different tests that we have done; and in each of the tests we\u2019ve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>demonstrated that the profile that we found in Harry Caprio\u2019s shorts is consistent with that of Elizabeth Bickley and different than that of Harry Caprio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-270.5, the statute cited by defense counsel, provided at the time of trial in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">In any criminal proceeding, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) testing shall be deemed to be a reliable scientific technique and the evidence of a DNA profile comparison may be admitted to prove or disprove the identity of any person. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">At least twenty-one days prior to commencement of the proceeding in which <em>the results of a DNA analysis </em>will be offered as evidence, the party intending to offer the evidence <em>shall </em>notify the opposing party, in writing, of the intent to offer the analysis and <em>shall </em>provide or make available copies of the <em>profiles </em>and the <em>report </em>or <em>statement </em>to be introduced. In the event that such notice is not given, and the person proffers such evidence, then the court may in its discretion <em>either </em>allow the opposing party a continuance <em>or, </em>under appropriate circumstances, bar the person from presenting such evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The Commonwealth argues that \u201cthe statute does not apply\u201d because \u201cthe blood profile frequency calculation is not a profile, report, or statement\u201d. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">\u201cWhen a statute is plain and unambiguous, a court may look only to the words of the statute to determine its meaning.\u201d <em>Harrison &amp; Bates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Featherstone Assoc., </em>253 Va. 364, 368, 484 S.E.2d 883, 885 (1997) (citing <em>Brown v. Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985)); <em>accord Doss v. Jamco, Inc., </em>254 Va. 362, 370, 492 S.E.2d 441, 446 (1997) (this day decided). We have repeatedly articulated the principles of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-11\">\u201cWhile in the construction of statutes the constant endeavor of the courts is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, that intention must be gathered from the words used, unless a literal construction would involve a manifest absurdity. Where the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\"><em>Barr </em>v. <em>Town &amp; Country Properties, </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990) (quoting <em>Watkins v. Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934)). <em>See also, Abbott </em>v. <em>Willey, </em>253 Va. 88, 91, 479 S.E.2d 528, 530 (1997); <em>Weinberg v. Given, </em>252 Va. 221, 225-26, 476 S.E.2d 502, 504 (1996); <em>Turner v. Wexler, </em>244 Va. 124, 127, 418 S.E.2d 886, 887 (1992); <em>Grillo v. Montebello Condominium Owners </em>Assoc., 243 Va. 475, 477, 416 S.E.2d 444, 445 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The twenty-one day notice requirement of the statute at bar applies to \u201cthe results of a DNA analysis\u201d to be \u201coffered as evidence\u201d. Copies of \u201cthe profiles and the report or statement to be introduced\u201d must be made available to the defense. Ban\u2019s 1 in 120,000 extrapolation, a statistical probability of a DNA match, was clearly a \u201creport\u201d or \u201cstatement\u201d of \u201cthe results of a DNA analysis\u201d conducted in the course of the seven different tests Ban reviewed. Adhering to the plain meaning rule, we hold that Ban\u2019s blood frequency extrapolation was a matter within the contemplation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Even so, the Court of Appeals ruled that \u201c[t]he trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant\u2019s request for a continuance and appellant\u2019s alternative request to bar the evidence\u201d, and the Commonwealth contends that the statute should be construed to vest a trial court with such discretion. True, the statute provides that, in the event timely notice is not given, \u201cthen the court may in its discretion either allow ... a continuance or . . . bar . . . such evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">That language expressly limits the court\u2019s discretion by the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d to a choice of \u201ceither\u201d of two defined options. Stated differently, if, as here, a trial court determines that the evidence is admissible, the statute requires the court to grant a motion to interrupt and postpone the progress of the trial to afford the defense a period of time for consultation with other experts and preparation of an appropriate response to the new evidence. Article 1, \u00a7 8, of the Constitution of Virginia guarantees an accused the right \u201cto call for evidence in his favor\u201d, and \u201calthough granting or denying a continuance is within the discretion of the trial court, it must exercise its discretion \u2018with due regard to the provisions of the Bill of Rights, which secure to one accused of crime a fair and impartial trial ....\u2019\u201d <em>Gilchrist v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 540, 546, 317 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>784, 787 (1984) (citations omitted). Here, the trial court chose to reject both options.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Because the trial court erred in not applying the plain meaning of the statute, and because we cannot say that the dramatic statistical difference between the blood profile frequency reported in the certificate of analysis timely delivered to the defense and that which was not timely disclosed by the Commonwealth was harmless, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling. For the reasons stated by the Court of Appeals, we affirm its judgment upholding the other three rulings of the trial court at issue in this appeal, and we need not address Caprio\u2019s assignments of error related to those rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">We will annul the conviction and remand the case to the Court of Appeals with direction to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b531-8\">JUSTICE KINSER,</author>\n<p id=\"AhS\">with whom JUSTICE COMPTON joins, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">I agree with the majority decision in all aspects but one. Since the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to disclose the new blood profile frequency extrapolation in a timely fashion was prejudicial to Caprio, this Court does not need to decide in this case whether Code \u00a7 19.2-270.5 requires, in every instance, that the trial court must either grant a continuance or bar introduction of the evidence, regardless of the degree and nature of the deviation from the requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-270.5 or whether the opposing party was prejudiced. The statute plainly makes the decision whether to use either of these remedies discretionary with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">For these reasons, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
