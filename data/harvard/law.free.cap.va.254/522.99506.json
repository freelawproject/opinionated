Later that day, acting as a deputy sheriff-security guard at a local high school basketball game, Overbey again suffered chest pains which his attending physician, Dr. David B. Chemoff, diagnosed as a myocardial infarction or \u201cheart attack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Following a period of hospitalization and recovery, Overbey filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation against his employer, the Augusta County Sheriff\u2019s Department, and its insurer, the Virginia Municipal Group Self-Insurance Association (collectively, the employer). Asserting that Overbey\u2019s disability was not the result of an occupational disease suffered in the line of his duties as a deputy sheriff, the employer denied liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">After a hearing, a deputy commissioner of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission dismissed the claim on the ground that the evidence was sufficient to overcome the Code \u00a7 65.2~402(B) presumption that Overbey\u2019s heart disease was a result of work-related causes. On Overbey\u2019s appeal, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission disagreed with the deputy commissioner and awarded benefits. On the employer\u2019s appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision. Concluding that this case involves matters of significant precedential value, we awarded an appeal to the employer. Code \u00a7 17-116.07(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Prior to the hearing before the deputy commissioner, the employer took the deposition of Dr. Chemoff. According to Dr. Chemoff, although there was no \u201csingle etiologic cause\u201d for Overbey\u2019s heart attack, there were several \u201crisk factors\u201d which he thought caused the attack. Dr. Chemoff listed the following risk factors: (1) a history of heavy smoking (according to Overbey, he had smoked from two to two-and-a-half packs of cigarettes each day from age 19 until he had his heart attack at the age of 41); (2) elevated cholesterol; (3) a family history of heart trouble (Overbey\u2019s father had a heart attack while \u201cin his 50\u2019s\u201d); and (4) non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus coupled with a strong family history of diabetes.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Although Dr. Chemoff did not ask Overbey about his specific job duties, Dr. Chemoff had previously treated \u201ca few\u201d law enforcement officers in the Staunton area and \u201ca number of Security Police\u201d while he was a physician in the United States Air Force. Dr. Chem-off testified that, in his opinion, Overbey\u2019s employment was not a risk factor or a cause of his heart disease. However, on cross-examination, Dr. Chemoff indicated that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that \u201cstress\u201d may have contributed to cause Overbey\u2019s heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Overbey testified about the stressful incidents in his job. In his regular duties as a civil process server, he had many papers to serve in a limited time, occasionally upon people who were uncooperative. Overbey also testified that while serving papers, he encountered dogs \u201ctwo or three times a week.\u201d He responded to domestic violence calls \u201c[ajbout once a week,\u201d house or bank burglar alarms on an \u201caverage of two or three a week,\u201d and \u201con occasions,\u201d he \u201cworked accidents.\u201d When he could \u201cfeel\u201d his heart racing while driving a car at work, he would \u201cjust pull off the side of the road and just wind down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Approximately three weeks before Overbey\u2019s heart attack, his wife was suspended from her job, and a few days later she was charged with embezzlement and forgery. About a week before his heart attack, Overbey and his wife separated. Overbey testified that his state of mind was \u201ceasier\u201d after the separation. However, when Dr. Chemoff was treating Overbey\u2019s heart disease, Overbey\u2019s description of his wife\u2019s legal problems caused Dr. Chemoff to describe them as the \u201cmain stressor.\u201d No physician contradicted Dr. Chemoff\u2019s testimony listing the non-job-related risk factors which he thought contributed to cause Overbey\u2019s heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>To recover compensation for heart disease, a workers\u2019 compensation claimant must ordinarily establish, among other things, that the illness is an \u201coccupational disease ... by clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable medical certainty, [and] that it arose out of and in the course of employment.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-401.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, in the case of certain law enforcement officials, including deputy sheriffs, Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B) creates a presumption that their heart diseases are occupationally related, \u201cunless such presumption is overcome by a preponderance of competent evidence to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The employer concedes that the presumption in Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B) requires it to establish a non-work-related cause for Overbey\u2019s heart condition and that job stress was not the cause. Overbey contends that this presumption also imposes the burden upon the employer of producing a preponderance of evidence excluding the <em>possibility </em>that his heart disease was work related. The employer responds that Overbey\u2019s contention adds an additional burden upon it that is neither stated nor implied in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">We agree with the employer. In <em>Page v. City of Richmond, </em>218 Va. 844, 847-48, 241 S.E.2d 775, 777 (1978), this Court noted that in rebutting the presumption that heart disease is work related, the employer must adduce competent medical evidence of a non-work-related cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Overbey suggests that in <em>County of Amherst </em>v. <em>Brockman, </em>224 Va. 391, 399, 297 S.E.2d 805, 810 (1982), we established an obligation that the employer \u201cexclude\u201d the \u201cpossibility\u201d of job-related causes. We disagree. In Brockman, our statement about the employer\u2019s failure to \u201cexclude stress as a possible \u2018contributing cause\u2019 \u201d was made in the context of our affirmance of the Commission\u2019s award of compensation based upon conflicting medical evidence. In <em>Brockman, </em>not only had the employer failed to exclude job-related stress as a cause, but its medical evidence of a non-job-related cause of heart attacks was contradicted by other medical evidence \u201cadopted\u201d by the deputy commissioner and the full Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission on review. <em>Id., </em>297 S.E.2d at 809. Here, there was no medical evidence other than that presented by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Our decisions subsequent to <em>Brockman </em>have applied the basic standard noted in <em>Page </em>with no suggestion that the employer\u2019s proof must exclude the possibility of all job-related causation hypotheses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Thus, in <em>Doss </em>v. <em>Fairfax County Fire &amp; Rescue Department, </em>229 Va. 440, 442, 331 S.E.2d 795, 796 (1985), the Court simply applied the conclusion stated in <em>Page </em>that in order to overcome the statutory presumption, the employer merely \u201cmust adduce competent medical evidence of a non-work-related cause of the disabling disease.\u201d That burden has been met upon submission of competent medical evidence that the claimant\u2019s condition was more than likely a hereditary phenomenon, <em>id., </em>or a showing that the claimant\u2019s heart condition was \u201cgenerally thought to be congenital\u201d or was \u201cprobably\u201d congenital. <em>Cook v. City of Waynesboro Police Department, </em>225 Va. 23, 28-30, 300 S.E.2d 746, 748-49 (1983). Thus, nothing in the statute or the several decisions of this Court dealing with rebuttal of this presumption suggests that the employer has the burden of excluding the \u201cpossibility\u201d that job stress may have been a contributing factor to heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Because we conclude that the employer introduced sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption, Overbey had the burden of \u201cestablishing by clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable medical certainty,\u201d that his heart disease arose out of and in the course of his employment. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-401. As noted, no medical expert contradicted Dr. Chemoff\u2019s opinion. Hence, Overbey\u2019s description of his work stresses was, as a matter of law, insufficient to establish \u201cto a reasonable medical certainty\u201d that his heart disease arose out of his employment. For these reasons, we reject Overbey\u2019s contention that his claim for compensation was properly awarded under the \u201ctwo causes rule.\u201d That rule applies when the evidence shows that an employee\u2019s \u201c \u2018disability has two causes: one related to the employment and one unrelated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Fieldcrest Mills, Inc., </em>224 Va. 24, 28, 294 S.E.2d 805, 808 (1982) (quoting <em>Bergmann </em>v. <em>L &amp; W Drywall, </em>222 Va. 30, 32, 278 S.E.2d 801, 803 (1981)). Here, as we have said, the employer has met the burden of overcoming the statutory presumption and Overbey has not shown that his heart disease arose out of his employment. Thus, he has not shown that there was a cause \u201crelated to the employment,\u201d an essential component of the \u201ctwo causes rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and dismiss the claimant\u2019s application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\"> Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">Hypertension or heart disease causing . . . any health condition or impairment resulting in total or partial disability of . . .
