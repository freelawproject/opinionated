Bradick was an employee-at-will of Grumman Data in Virginia from October 15, 1990 until he was discharged on May 26, 1994. Bradick\u2019s job performance was satisfactory to his employer. However, while on vacation in Mexico in 1993, Bradick contracted a severe case of histoplasmosis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the disease caused Bradick to have recurrent attacks of extreme fatigue, Bradick\u2019s physician recommended that he take a leave of absence from his employment with Grumman Data on three occasions. Bradick\u2019s discharge occurred following the third of these leaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Bradick asserts in his pleading that he was and is able to adequately perform the duties of his former job. Therefore, he asserts that his discharge was in violation of public policy because it was based on his physical disability or Grumman Data\u2019s perception that he suffers from a physical disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Beginning with <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>State Bank of Keysville, </em>229 Va. 534, 331 S.E.2d 797 (1985), we have recognized a narrow public policy exception to this Commonwealth\u2019s employment-at-will doctrine, which ordinarily permits either the employer or the employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>to terminate the employment relationship without incurring liability. We have explained that this exception applies to discharges which violate <em>public </em>policy. <em>See Lawrence Chrysler Plymouth Corp. v. Brooks, </em>251 Va. 94, 98-99, 465 S.E.2d 806, 809 (1996). We also have explained that the cause of action arises not from the statute or statutes which express the public policy relied on by the employee, but from the narrow exception within the common law recognized in <em>Bowman. See Bailey v. Scott-Gallaher, </em>253 Va. 121, 125, 480 S.E.2d 502, 504 (1997); <em>Lockhart v. Commonwealth Educ. Systems Corp., </em>247 Va. 98, 105, 439 S.E.2d 328, 331 (1994). Upon these principles, we have permitted former at-will employees to maintain common law actions for wrongful discharge under the narrow exception recognized in <em>Bowman </em>where the conduct alleged would have violated Virginia\u2019s public policy against race and gender discrimination as reflected in the Virginia Human Rights Act (VHRA), Code \u00a7 2.1-715. <em>See Bailey, supra </em>(gender); <em>Lockhart, supra </em>(race and gender).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">We have never before considered whether the narrow exception recognized in <em>Bowman </em>permits a cause of action for unlawful discharge from at-will employment based upon a disability. However, it is not disputed that both the VHRA and the Virginians with Disabilities Act (VDA), Code \u00a7\u00a7 51.5-1 to 51.5-52, contain clear expressions of Virginia\u2019s public policy opposing discrimination against disabled persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In the present case, unlike <em>Lockhart </em>and <em>Bailey, </em>in order to determine the applicability of the exception recognized in <em>Bowman, </em>we must determine whether the common law cause of action has been abrogated by the General Assembly when it enacted the VDA. The VDA creates a comprehensive administrative procedure to combat discrimination on account of disability in employment, education, commerce, and civic affairs. Code \u00a7 51.5-41, which contains the Act\u2019s prohibitions against employment discrimination, specifically provides in subsection (F) that \u201c[tjhis section shall not apply to employers covered by the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 51.5-46 provides for the relief available for violation of the substantive provisions of the VDA, and subsection (C) specifically provides that \u201c[t]he relief available for violations of this chapter shall be limited to the relief set forth in this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Grumman Data is subject to the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and, thus, is exempt from the employment discrimination provisions of the VDA. The issue presented in this case, then, is whether the exclusivity provision of Code \u00a7 51.5-46(C) abrogates any action employees like Bradick might have under Virginia common law for wrongful discharge from at-will employment based on disability. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">While it is true that the VDA and the federal Rehabilitative Act of 1973 have similar purposes, nothing in the VDA expressly makes either the federal Act part of the VDA\u2019s statutory scheme or the provisions of the one applicable to the other. The exemption provision of Code \u00a7 51.5-41(F) applies \u201cto <em>employers </em>covered by the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Nothing in this language expressly addresses or otherwise implicates the claims an <em>employee </em>in this situation might have under the federal or state Acts. Rather, this code section expressly exempts certain employers from the application of one section of the VDA. The VDA was enacted in derogation of the common law and, therefore, it must be strictly applied and not \u201cenlarged in [its] operation by construction beyond [its] express terms.\u201d <em>See C. &amp; O. Railway v. Kinzer, </em>206 Va. 175, 181, 142 S.E.2d 514, 518; <em>see also Baumgardner v. Southwestern Virginia Mental Health Inst., </em>247 Va. 486, 489, 442 S.E.2d 400, 401 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The exclusivity provision of Code \u00a751.5-46(C) applies to \u201cviolations of this chapter.\u201d Because employers, such as Grumman Data in this case, who are covered by the federal Rehabilitative Act of 1973 are not subject to the employment discrimination provisions of the VDA, pursuant to Code \u00a7 51.5-41(F), actions by such employers which constitute disability discrimination in employment are not \u201cviolations of this chapter.\u201d Thus, it is clear that Code \u00a7 51.5-46(C) limits only the relief for claims that are brought under the substantive provisions of the VDA, and has no application to a claim which might be brought against an employer subject to the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Moreover, a statute which does not apply to acts of an employer, and provides no remedy to an employee if those acts violate public policy, cannot be said to be a statutory abrogation of an employee\u2019s common law cause of action based on those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">For these reasons, we hold that, based on the public policy expressed in the VDA and VHRA at the time of Grumman Data\u2019s alleged act of discrimination, the common law of Virginia provides a wrongful discharge remedy to an employee, such as Bradick, of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>employer covered by the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 where the employee is discharged on account of his disability or the employer\u2019s perception of his disability under the narrow exception recognized in <em>Bowman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\n<em>Certified question answered in the affirmative.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-11\"> Bradick\u2019s suit was initially filed in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County and subsequently removed by the defendants to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Northrop Grumman Corporation, an initial defendant, was dismissed by stipulation of the parties. Following an adverse decision in the district court, Bradick has appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b176-12\"> Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection of the lungs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b177-6\"> The federal statute addresses, <em>inter alia, </em>employment discrimination against persons with disabilities by employers with federal contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b179-5\">JUSTICE COMPTON,</author>\n<p id=\"AZp\">with whom CHIEF JUSTICE CARRICO and JUSTICE STEPHENSON join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">I would answer the certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The statement of Virginia\u2019s public policy against disability discrimination is contained in the Virginians With Disabilities Act (VDA), Code \u00a7\u00a7 51.5-1 through -52. The General Assembly has stated explicitly that the VDA provides the exclusive state remedy for employment discrimination based on disability: \u201cThe relief available for violations of this chapter shall be limited to the relief set forth in this section.\u201d Code \u00a7 51.5-46(C). Violations \u201cof this chapter\u201d refers to disability discrimination generally. Code \u00a7 51.5-41 (A) (\u201cNo employer shall discriminate in employment or promotion practices against an otherwise qualified person with a disability solely because of such disability.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The majority argues that the VDA does not apply because the employer, a government contractor, was not covered by the VDA. Clearly, the VDA does not apply to employers \u201ccovered by the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d Code \u00a7 51.5-41(F). But this does not save Bradick\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">The VDA\u2019s clear statement that it does not apply to employers covered by the federal Act plainly indicates that the General Assembly did not intend employees, who could proceed against their employers under the federal Act, to have the option of proceeding under the VDA, the exclusive state remedy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
