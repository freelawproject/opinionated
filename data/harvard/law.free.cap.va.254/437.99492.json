Both motions for judgment were consolidated by order of the trial court. As relevant to this appeal, the plaintiff alleged in her motions for judgment that the defendants improperly disseminated her \u201cprivate and confidential medical records and treatment information\u201d to third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">The defendants asserted in a demurrer and plea in bar that: the plaintiff waived any privilege of confidentiality in her medical records by filing a medical malpractice claim; the plaintiff had not alleged a cause of action because she sought damages solely for emotional distress; and the plaintiff\u2019s claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Overruling the demurrer, the court held that the plaintiff had a cause of action against the defendants for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the unauthorized dissemination of her medical records without her consent. The court also denied the defendants\u2019 special plea of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The litigants stipulated the relevant facts underlying this dispute, but disagreed about the application of the law. Consequently, the litigants submitted factual statements with exhibits to the trial court and stipulated damages. The trial court entered a judgment on behalf of the plaintiff for the amount of the stipulated damages, $100,000, and the defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Plaintiff received prenatal care at Fairfax Hospital beginning in July 1988. She was admitted to Fairfax Hospital in January 1989, and gave birth to a child, Jessie Curtis, on February 13, 1989. During the course of such treatment, she communicated personal information, including her medical history, to Fairfax Hospital\u2019s employees. Jessie later suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest and died.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">In March 1990, Patricia Curtis, in her capacity as administrator of the estate of Jessie Curtis, filed a notice of claim against Fairfax Hospital System, Linda Beckett, and others, pursuant to the Virginia Medical Malpractice Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Beckett was a nurse in the Hospital\u2019s neonatal intensive care unit at the time of Jessie\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Following receipt of the notice of claim, Nancy Perrelli, INOVA Health System Foundation\u2019s Director of Legal Affairs, requested that the Hospital provide a complete copy of Patricia Curtis\u2019 medical records to Gerald R. Walsh, an attorney for the Hospital. Subsequently, Walsh directed \u201cthat a copy of the medical records be provided to Nurse Beckett.\u201d Perrelli complied with Walsh\u2019s directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel learned during a discovery deposition of Beckett that she \u201chad possession of, and had reviewed three to four days before the deposition, the medical records obtained from Perrelli, pursuant to the direction of defense counsel Walsh. Beckett brought a copy of the medical records to the deposition.\u201d The medical records contained very personal information about plaintiff\u2019s medical history before and after her pregnancy with Jessie Curtis.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The defendants, relying upon <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Caday, </em>244 Va. 285, 422 S.E.2d 371 (1992), argue that Virginia does not recognize a cause of action against a health care provider for the unauthorized disclosure of a patient\u2019s medical records. The plaintiff asserts, however, that she does have a cause of action against the defendants for the voluntary disclosure of her confidential medical records without her authorization. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Caday, </em>a patient filed an action against her physician for the physician\u2019s alleged failure to assure nondisclosure of the patient\u2019s confidential information. The patient alleged that, even though her physician had assured her that certain matters she had discussed with him would remain confidential, the physician\u2019s employees had discussed the confidential information with others. The trial court dismissed the patient\u2019s action because, <em>inter alia, </em>she had failed to give the physician written notice of the claim prior to filing suit, as required by former Code \u00a7 8.01-581.2(A) of the Virginia Medical Malpractice Act, and her motion for judgment was insufficient in law because it failed to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Declining to decide whether Virginia recognizes a cause of action against a health care provider for the wrongful disclosure of the patient\u2019s medical records and information because such issue was not dispositive of our decision in <em>Pierce, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">\u201cSome courts in other jurisdictions . . . have recognized the nonstatutory right of a patient to recover damages from a physician for unauthorized disclosure of confidential communications concerning the patient; other courts have refused to create such a cause of action. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">In view of the General Assembly\u2019s repeated recognition of the privilege, we easily could adopt the view that a civil remedy lies in favor of a patient against a physician if the physician, or anyone under the physician\u2019s control, without the patient\u2019s consent makes an extra-judicial disclosure of confidential information obtained in the course of the physician-patient relationship. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-11\">But it is unnecessary for us today to recognize expressly the existence of such a cause of action in Virginia in order to decide this case. Indeed, the issue has not been raised or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>debated, the parties presuming that such a cause of action is available. Therefore, we will assume without deciding that such an action will lie.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">244 Va. at 290-91, 422 S.E.2d at 373-74 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In our jurisprudence, a health care provider owes a duty of reasonable care to the patient. Included within that duty is the health care provider\u2019s obligation to preserve the confidentiality of information about the patient which was communicated to the health care provider or discovered by the health care provider during the course of treatment. Indeed, confidentiality is an integral aspect of the relationship between a health care provider and a patient and, often, to give the health care provider the necessary information to provide proper treatment, the patient must reveal the most intimate aspects of his or her life to the health care provider during the course of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">We hold that in the absence of a statutory command to the contrary, or absent a serious danger to the patient or others, a health care provider owes a duty to the patient not to disclose information gained from the patient during the course of treatment without the patient\u2019s authorization, and that violation of this duty gives rise to an action in tort. We observe that our holding today is consistent with decisions of most jurisdictions which have considered this issue. <em>See Home </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>287 So.2d 824, 830 (Ala. 1973); <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>479 N.E.2d 113, 119 (Mass.), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1013 (1985); <em>Simonsen </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>177 N.W. 831, 832 (Neb. 1920); <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Clinger, </em>446 N.Y.S.2d 801, 804 (N.Y. App. Div. 1982); <em>Humphers </em>v. <em>First Interstate Bank, </em>696 P.2d 527, 535 (Or. 1985); <em>but see Quarles </em>v. <em>Sutherland, </em>389 S.W.2d 249, 252 (Tenn. 1965) (rejecting a cause of action in tort for health care provider\u2019s dissemination of patient\u2019s confidential information).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">The defendants suggest that even if the plaintiff has a cause of action for the wrongful disclosure of her medical records, she is not entitled to recover against them because she placed her medical condition \u201cat issue\u201d when she filed the notice of medical malpractice against the Hospital and others to recover damages for the death of her daughter. The plaintiff responds that she did not waive her right to the confidentiality of her medical records by preparing to file, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>by later filing, an action against the Hospital and others in her capacity as administrator for her deceased daughter\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Code \u00a7 8.01-399, in effect when the wrongful disclosures were made, and which we have described as \u201cmerely a rule of evidence,\u201d <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Caday, </em>244 Va. at 290, 422 S.E.2d at 373, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">\u201cExcept at the request of, or with the consent of, the patient, no duly licensed practitioner of any branch of the healing arts shall be required to testify in any civil action, respecting any information which he may have acquired in attending, examining or treating the patient in a professional capacity if such information was necessary to enable him to furnish professional care to the patient; <em>provided, however, that when the physical or mental condition of the patient is at issue in such action </em>... no fact communicated to, or otherwise learned by, such practitioner in connection with such attendance, examination or treatment shall be privileged and <em>disclosure may be </em>required.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Code \u00a7 8.01-399, before amendment in 1993, permitted disclosure of information that a patient had conveyed to a health care provider when that patient\u2019s physical or mental condition was <em>at issue in a civil action in certain circumstances. </em>Additionally, the express words contained in the aforementioned version of Code \u00a7 8.01-399 state that \u201cdisclosure <em>may </em>be required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">This statute did not automatically compel disclosure of a patient\u2019s confidential medical information in all instances, but permitted a court, in the exercise of its discretion, to require disclosure of such information. We hold that if the patient did not manifestly place his or her medical condition at issue in a civil proceeding, then the statute required a determination by a judicial officer whether the patient\u2019s condition was at issue in the civil action before the health care provider was entitled to disseminate the patient\u2019s confidential communications to third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The notice of claim that the plaintiff forwarded to the Hospital and others, in her capacity as administrator of her daughter\u2019s estate, simply did not manifestly place Curtis\u2019 medical condition at issue. Thus, before disseminating such information, the Hospital was required, in accordance with the aforementioned version of Code \u00a7 8.01-399, to obtain permission from either a court or the patient. The defendants concede that they unilaterally disseminated the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>tiff\u2019s confidential medical records to an attorney and a nurse without the requisite consent from the patient or determination from a judicial officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The defendants point out that during the subsequent medical malpractice panel proceedings, the chairman of the panel granted Beckett\u2019s motion to depose Curtis over her objections because \u201cPatricia Curtis\u2019 health is at issue in this action, [and] the privilege may not be asserted.\u201d The defendants also note that in the civil action styled <em>Patricia Curtis, as Administrator for the Estate of Jessie Curtis, et al. </em>v. <em>Fairfax Hospital Systems, Inc., </em>the trial court ruled that the defendants were entitled to obtain Patricia Curtis\u2019 medical records from other health care providers covering a period of two years before and one year after the birth of the deceased infant. Continuing, the defendants assert that these rulings demonstrate that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s medical condition was at issue and, hence, she had no privilege in the disseminated medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The defendants\u2019 contentions are not persuasive. The defendants disseminated the plaintiff\u2019s medical records before the aforementioned rulings of the medical malpractice panel and the trial court in the subsequent civil action. And, as we have already noted, an independent judicial officer, not the Hospital or the director of legal affairs for the Hospital\u2019s parent company, was the appropriate person to make the determination whether Curtis\u2019 physical condition was at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The defendants contend that a health care provider who discloses medical confidences without the patient\u2019s consent should only be subjected to liability if such disclosure was made in a \u201cnon-judicial\u201d context. The defendants say that \u201c[i]n <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Caday, </em>this Court carefully noted that if it were to recognize a theory of tort liability against a physician for the unauthorized disclosure of medical confidences, such an action would be limited to \u2018extra-judicial\u2019 disclosures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">As we have already demonstrated, the defendants\u2019 assertion is without merit because in <em>Pierce </em>we did not consider whether we would recognize a cause of action for the wrongful dissemination of a patient\u2019s medical information; nor did we articulate what limitations, if any, we would place upon such cause of action. Furthermore, the disclosure of the plaintiff\u2019s confidential information in this case did constitute an \u201cextra-judicial disclosure.\u201d Here, the Hospital\u2019s director of legal affairs made a unilateral decision to disseminate the plaintiff\u2019s medical records to the Hospital\u2019s attorney and a nurse without a judicial determination that the plaintiff\u2019s physical condition was at issue and without the determination that disclosure of those records was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">The defendants assert that the trial court erred by ruling that the plaintiff was entitled to recover for emotional distress caused by the defendants\u2019 negligent acts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">As a general rule, in tort cases, absent accompanying physical harm or wanton and willful conduct, emotional distress damages are not recoverable. <em>Carstensen </em>v. <em>Chrisland Corp., </em>247 Va. 433, 446, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>442 S.E.2d 660, 668 (1994)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; <em>Sea-Land Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neal, </em>224 Va. 343, 354, 297 S.E.2d 647, 653 (1982); <em>Womack </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>215 Va. 338, 340, 210 S.E.2d 145, 147 (1974). However, as we noted in <em>Sea-Land, </em>there are exceptions to this general rule: \u201c[W]e have approved the recovery of damages for humiliation, embarrassment, and similar harm to feelings, although unaccompanied by actual physical injury, <em>where a cause of action existed independently of such harm.\u201d </em>224 Va. at 354, 297 S.E.2d at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Here, we are of opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action falls within the exception to the general rule because her cause of action is independent of the humiliation, embarrassment, and harm to feelings that she suffered. Without question, a patient, whose intimate personal medical information is wrongfully disseminated to third parties, will experience some degree of humiliation, embarrassment, and hurt. Under these circumstances, we perceive no logical reason to refuse recovery of emotional distress damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The defendants argue that the trial court erred by failing to grant their motion for summary judgment which asserted that the plaintiff\u2019s claims are barred by the two-year statute of limitations contained in Code \u00a7 8.01-243(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants state that the trial court \u201cconcluded that the claims were subject to a two-year limitations period which accrued on March 7, 1990. . . . Since the case at bar was not filed until February 4, 1994, Plaintiff\u2019s claims would be barred by limitations, but for the Court\u2019s conclusion that the filing of the wrongful death claim in November 1991 tolled the statute until the entry of a final order, which followed commencement of the instant actions.\u201d Responding, the plaintiff argues that the defendants are precluded from raising this issue on appeal because they failed to raise it in the trial court. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>As we have already stated, the plaintiff filed two separate motions for judgment against the defendant, and, the second motion, styled <em>Patricia Curtis, Plaintiff </em>v. <em>Fairfax Hospital, by and through INOVA Health System Hospitals, Inc., </em>contained a count captioned \u201cCount I: Medical Malpractice.\u201d The plaintiff alleged in that count that the defendant, Fairfax Hospital, breached the applicable standard of care owed to her by disseminating her medical records without her authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment raising the statute of limitations defense. The defendants stated in their motion: \u201c[defendants, Inova Health System Foundation, Inc., Nancy Perrelli, and Fairfax Hospital by and through Inova Health System Hospitals, Inc., . . . move this Court ... for entry of Summary Judgment with respect to Count HI (Conspiracy to Commit Malpractice) and Count V (Punitive Damages).\u201d The defendants\u2019 \u201cMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d asserted that the plaintiff\u2019s claims of conspiracy were barred by the two-year statute of limitations contained in Code \u00a7 8.01-243(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The trial court\u2019s opinion letter, which explained the court\u2019s rationale for denying the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment states: \u201c[t]he defendants move now for summary judgment as to Count m (conspiracy to commit malpractice) and Count V (punitive damages), in support of which they claim that the statute of limitations bars the action. . . .\u201d The trial court\u2019s order, denying the motion for judgment, incorporated its opinion letter by reference. The defendants filed a motion for reconsideration which stated: \u201c[defendants, Inova Health System Foundation, Inc., Nancy Perrelli, and Fairfax Hospital. . . respectfully move this Court for reconsideration of its Order denying defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to Count III (Conspiracy to Commit Malpractice) and Count V (Punitive Damages).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The defendants did not request, and the trial court did not make, a ruling on the issue whether the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for negligence in Count I of her motion for judgment was barred by the statute of limitations. And, on the morning of trial, the plaintiff took a voluntary non-suit of her purported claim of conspiracy to commit malpractice. The defendants\u2019 statute of limitations defense was limited to the plaintiff\u2019s claim of conspiracy to commit malpractice, and the statute of limitations defense was not asserted against the plaintiff\u2019s negligence claim. Hence, the defendants may not, for the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>time on appeal, assert the statute of limitations defense to bar the plaintiff\u2019s negligence action. Rule 5:25.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In view of the foregoing, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-11\"> Patricia Curtis, administrator of the estate of Jessie Curtis, subsequently filed a motion for judgment against Fairfax Hospital and recovered a judgment which was affirmed by this Court. <em>See Fairfax Hosp.
