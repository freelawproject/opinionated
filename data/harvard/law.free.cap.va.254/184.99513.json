Following a unitary trial, a jury found the defendant guilty as charged and recommended a 15-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">After a hearing and consideration of a pre-sentence report, the trial court confirmed the 15-year sentence. However, the court suspended 14 years of the sentence, ordered defendant to serve 12 months in jail, and placed him on five years\u2019 probation upon release from jail. Defendant was allowed to remain free on bond pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-17\">Subsequently, the Court of Appeals granted in part and denied in part defendant\u2019s petition for appeal. In the order awarding the appeal, the Court of Appeals rejected defendant\u2019s contention that the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>dence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove the essential element of penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The appeal was awarded on the issue whether the trial court erred in allowing an expert witness, a mental health therapist, to testify for the Commonwealth about certain behavioral patterns of the victim that were consistent with a child who had been sexually abused. The defendant argued this testimony was improper because it was an impermissible comment on the victim\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In a February 1996 unpublished opinion, a panel of the Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 decision, ruled in favor of the Commonwealth on the issue presented. In July 1996, following an <em>en banc </em>hearing, the Court of Appeals, by a 6-3 decision, affirmed the judgment of the trial court for the reasons stated in the panel opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">We awarded the defendant an appeal. The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding there was sufficient evidence of penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Fundamental principles applicable here should be reviewed. To justify conviction of a crime, it is insufficient to create a suspicion or probability of guilt. Rather, the burden is upon the Commonwealth to prove every essential element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 108, 110, 175 S.E.2d 275, 276 (1970). <em>Accord Camp </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 879, 884, 419 S.E.2d 435, 438 (1992). \u201cThe evidence must exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence and be consistent only with the guilt of the accused.\u201d <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 386, 388, 177 S.E.2d 628, 629 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">\u201cPenetration by a penis of a vagina is an essential element of the crime of rape; proof of penetration, however slight the entry may be, is sufficient.\u201d <em>Elam </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 113, 115, 326 S.E.2d 685, 686 (1985). And, a conviction of rape may be sustained solely upon the victim\u2019s testimony. <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 792, 796, 263 S.E.2d 55, 57 (1980). <em>Accord Kehinde </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>1 Va. App. 342, 345, 338 S.E.2d 356, 357 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">We shall consider the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, which prevailed in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">The victim testified that on the day in question the defendant, who was 45 years of age at the time and a friend of the victim\u2019s mother, was visiting in the home where she resided with her mother. While the mother temporarily was away from the home, defendant asked the victim to play \u201chouse.\u201d Thinking defendant meant he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>wished to play with her toys, she consented, and defendant led her to a bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The victim described, using anatomical dolls, how defendant disrobed, how he undressed her, and how he positioned her on top of him. Then, the prosecutor elicited the following crucial testimony during direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">\u201cQ. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">A. And he told me to get on top of him and I was like this (demonstrating) on top of him. And his penis \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">Q. Can you show us the position of your legs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">A. Yes. They were like this (demonstrating). I was sitting on top of him. I was just sitting there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">Q. And your legs were spread over \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">A. Like this (demonstrating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-12\">Q. \u2014his abdomen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-13\">A. Yes. And he \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-14\">Q. Where was his penis? Can you show us that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-15\">A. It was like this (demonstrating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-16\">Q. Was it actually rubbing on your vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqW\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-19\">A. And he told me, he said, \u2018This isn\u2019t right.\u2019 So he rolled me over with his hands. Then I was laying like this (demonstrating) on the bed. He spread my legs open into a V.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-20\">Q. And what did he do that with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-21\">A. And then he got \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-22\">Q. Wait a minute. What did he spread your legs open with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-23\">A. With his hands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-24\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-25\">A. Then he got on top of me. He held his penis with one of his hands and he rubbed it on the inside of my vagina like this (demonstrating). And \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-26\">Q. Did he hurt you? Did you feel any pain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-27\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-28\">Q. You felt some pain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-29\">A. No, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t feel any pain at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-30\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-31\">A. I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Q. Okay. Let\u2019s back up a minute. He was on top of you. Let\u2019s go back over that again. He was on top of you and he had his penis in his hand; one of his hands?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">Q. And he was rubbing it on your vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">Q. All right, go from there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">A. Then he let go of his penis and he started to rub it like this on top of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">Q. Let\u2019s go back to when he was on top of you, okay. One time he was holding his penis rubbing it between your legs and another time you said he wasn\u2019t holding it; he was just rubbing it going back and forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">Q. Your testimony was you felt his penis on your vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-13\">A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">The victim\u2019s mother, age 24 at the time in question, testified her daughter told her the day following the alleged incident that defendant had \u201cfooled with her.\u201d The mother testified, \u201cI didn\u2019t believe her so I just sort of brushed it off.\u201d A neighbor of the victim testified the victim said to her the day after the alleged incident, \u201c \u2018My mamma\u2019s boyfriend made love to me.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">The victim experienced emotional problems over the years. In September 1993, according to the victim and her mother, the victim saw defendant at a local laundromat and she became \u201cso upset\u201d that the mother decided to take the child to a Lynchburg hospital. The child was then referred to the Appomattox Counseling Center, where she was first seen on September 20, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-16\">Shortly thereafter, the local sheriff\u2019s department received a complaint from \u201cSocial Services.\u201d When interviewed by a deputy sheriff, defendant denied having \u201csexual contact\u201d with the victim. Testifying at trial, defendant denied that he \u201chad sexual intercourse\u201d with the victim as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-17\">In this appeal, the Attorney General, pointing out that \u201cthe credibility of witnesses and the weight assigned their testimony are matters exclusively for the jury,\u201d contends the victim \u201ctestified in graphic detail\u201d how the defendant had raped her. The Attorney General observes the victim \u201cspecifically testified that Moore placed his penis <em>inside </em>her vagina.\u201d Thus, the argument continues, the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Appeals was correct in affirming the judgment of conviction. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">As we have already noted, \u201cit is universally held that under an indictment charging statutory rape of a child, as well as one charging the common-law offense of rape of an adult woman, the prosecution must prove that there has been an actual penetration to some extent of the male sexual organ into the female sexual organ.\u201d <em>McCall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 422, 426, 65 S.E.2d 540, 542 (1951). The fact that the man\u2019s penis is placed <em>on, </em>not <em>in, </em>the woman\u2019s sexual organ is insufficient to establish the element of penetration. <em>See Ashby </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 443, 444, 158 S.E.2d 657, 658 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1111 (1969) (in prosecution for sodomy, testimony that boy\u2019s mouth was merely placed \u201con\u201d defendant\u2019s \u201cprivates\u201d held insufficient to prove penetration).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In the present case, the prosecution presented evidence, <em>as part of its case-in-chief, </em>that the defendant placed his penis both \u201cin\u201d and \u201con\u201d the victim\u2019s vagina. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was in a state of equipoise on an essential element of the crime. In one breath, the victim said that \u201che rubbed it on the inside of my vagina.\u201d In the next breath, after the prosecutor asked her to \u201cback up a minute,\u201d she answered \u201cYes\u201d to the question, \u201cAnd he was rubbing it on your vagina?\u201d Again, when asked by the prosecutor to \u201cgo back,\u201d she answered affirmatively to the question, \u201cYour testimony was you felt his penis on your vagina?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">This is not a case where inconsistencies have been developed during cross-examination of the victim or a case where there has been other evidence contradicting the testimony of the victim. Certainly, those types of credibility issues are for the jury to decide. But, this is a case where the prosecution has presented, from the mouth of the victim, two different accounts of the essential facts relating to a crucial element of the crime. As we have stated, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence must be consistent only with the guilt of the accused. However, in this case, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence is consistent with the innocence of the accused regarding the crime with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The prosecutor here apparently was under the erroneous impression that proof the defendant\u2019s penis was \u201con\u201d the victim\u2019s vagina was sufficient to prove rape. At one point during a colloquy with the trial judge out of the presence of the jury, the prosecutor stated, \u201cShe may not necessarily have pain if he just rubbed his penis on her vagina.\u201d During argument of defendant\u2019s motion to strike the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>dence, the prosecutor said that \u201cmy recollection of the record was [the victim] testified that he rubbed his penis on her vagina, and that\u2019s enough. That\u2019s penetration, Judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">And to make matters worse, the prosecutor forcefully urged his erroneous theory upon the jury, after the trial court had instructed the jury that \u201csexual intercourse means an actual penetration, no matter how slight, of the defendant\u2019s penis into the sexual organ of\u201d the victim. The prosecutor told the jury that \u201cat one time\u201d defendant was \u201cholding it in his hand rubbing it up and down on her vagina. Then he lets go with his hand and continues to rub it up and down on her vagina. ... If he touches her vagina with his penis, I submit to you, that\u2019s penetration enough. That\u2019s all it takes and that\u2019s what the evidence is. That he rubbed his penis on her vagina.\u201d Parenthetically, we note that during the jury\u2019s deliberations, the trial court, exercising its discretion, refused a request from the jury foreman that the jury be provided with a transcript of the victim\u2019s testimony \u201cabout the sexual intercourse . . . whether or not it was actual penetration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">We have not overlooked the structure of a woman\u2019s anatomy involved here, and its possible impact on the victim\u2019s testimony that defendant\u2019s penis was placed \u201con\u201d her vagina. The Court of Appeals, construing <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>147 Va. 636, 136 S.E. 564 (1927), and quoting an attorney\u2019s dictionary of medicine, has said \u201cthat penetration of any portion of the vulva, which encompasses the \u2018external parts of the female sex organs considered as a whole\u2019 and includes, beginning with the outermost parts, the labia majora, labia minora, hymen, vaginal opening and vagina ... is sufficient\u201d to establish the element of penetration. <em>Love </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>18 Va. App. 84, 88, 441 S.E.2d 709, 712 (1994). But there is no indication whatever in the record that the young victim here was aware of the intricate structure of her sexual organ. Rather, it is clear from the evidence that when she referred to her \u201cvagina,\u201d she was describing the external part of that portion of her anatomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">This case is analogous to <em>Elam, supra. </em>There, the victim testified that the defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t rape me\u201d and that she did not know whether defendant \u201cput his penis\u201d into her sexual organ. 229 Va. at 115, 326 S.E.2d at 686. This Court said: \u201cWe agree with the defendant that this testimony, while sufficient to prove attempted rape, is insufficient, standing alone, to prove rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We affirmed Elam\u2019s conviction, however, finding the testimony did not stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>alone because medical and forensic evidence in that case \u201cwas compelling.\u201d <em>Id., </em>326 S.E.2d at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In the present case, there was no medical or forensic evidence of the alleged fact that the defendant committed the rape. Here, the victim\u2019s testimony does stand alone. Consequently, we hold there was a failure of proof of penetration as a matter of law, and the Court of Appeals erred in ruling to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Because of the view we take of the case, we do not reach the other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Accordingly, we will reverse the order of the Court of Appeals, reverse and annul the trial court\u2019s order of conviction, and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
