Haislip filed a motion for judgment against Raymond L. Goode and Tina L. Price to recover damages he incurred as a result of an automobile accident. Haislip alleged that Price negligently entrusted her car to Goode, who negligently operated the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">At the time of the accident, Price\u2019s car was insured under an automobile liability policy issued to her by Southern Heritage Insurance Company. Apparently, Goode did not have an automobile liability insurance policy, and Southern Heritage settled Haislip\u2019s claim against Goode and issued a settlement check to Haislip in the amount of $25,000, which Southern Heritage believes is the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to Haislip under the terms of the policy of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Subsequently, Southern Heritage filed a motion for declaratory judgment, asking that the trial court declare that: the maximum amount of coverage available to Haislip under the policy is $25,000; the policy had been exhausted by reason of the settlement paid on behalf of Goode and; Southern Heritage has no duty to defend or pay any amounts related to the claim Haislip made against Price. Haislip filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the maximum amount of coverage available to him under the insurance policy is $50,000. The trial court considered argument of counsel and entered an order denying Haislip\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting Southern Heritage\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment. The trial court entered a judgment declaring that the insurance coverage available to Haislip under the insurance policy had been exhausted by the payment of $25,000 to him in settlement of his claim against Goode. Haislip appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Haislip argues that even though the automobile liability insurance contract provided $25,000 of coverage per occurrence, Code \u00a7 38.2-2204 requires Southern Heritage to provide $25,000 of liability coverage to Goode and another $25,000 of coverage to Price. Haislip contends that Goode and Price are persons insured within the meaning of the policy and, as a result, Southern Heritage is required to provide a maximum of $25,000 of coverage to Price for her negligent entrustment of the vehicle and another $25,000 of coverage to Goode for his negligent operation of the insured vehicle. Continuing, Price asserts that Code \u00a7 38.2-2204 \u201cprovides that all contracts of bodily injury liability insurance must contain a provision insuring the named insured, as well as any other person using the motor vehicle with the express or implied consent of the named insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Southern Heritage argues, however, that Code \u00a7 38.2-2204 \u201cwas not created for the benefit of the insured, nor was it created in order to allow double recovery to the party who has suffered damage by the negligent use of the insured\u2019s car when operated by another with the owner\u2019s permission.\u201d Southern Heritage asserts that the purpose of Code \u00a7 38.2-2204 is to protect the injured party who has suffered damage \u201cby allowing that party a single recovery under the insured\u2019s policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Code \u00a7 38.2-2204, commonly referred to as the omnibus clause, states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">\u201cA. No policy or contract of bodily injury or property damage liability insurance, covering liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle . . . shall be issued or delivered in this Commonwealth to the owner of such vehicle ... or shall be issued or delivered by any insurer licensed in this Commonwealth upon any motor vehicle . . . that is principally garaged, docked, or used in this Commonwealth, unless the policy contains a provision insuring the named insured, <em>and </em>any other person using or responsible for the use of the motor vehicle . . . with the expressed or implied consent of the named insured, against liability for death or injury sustained, or loss or damage incurred within the coverage of the policy or contract as a result of negligence in the operation or use of such vehicle ... by the named insured or by any such person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">In deciding the meaning of the statute, we must consider the plain language that the General Assembly employed when enacting this statute. For example, we stated in <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Town &amp; Country Properties, </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990) <em>(quoting Watkins </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">\u201c \u2018While in the construction of statutes the constant endeavor of the courts is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, that intention must be gathered from the words used, unless a literal construction would involve a manifest absurdity. Where the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>Accord Abbott </em>v. <em>Willey, </em>253 Va. 88, 91, 479 S.E.2d 528, 530 (1997); <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>Given, </em>252 Va. 221, 225-26, 476 S.E.2d 502, 504 (1996); <em>Dominion Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Kenbridge Constr. Co., </em>248 Va. 393, 396, 448 S.E.2d 659, 660 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Additionally, in interpreting Code \u00a7 38.1-381, the predecessor to the current omnibus statute, we stated that the omnibus statute \u201cis by force of its provisions made a part of a liability policy, and is to be liberally construed to accomplish its intended purpose. However, ... we must look to the words used in the statute to determine its meaning, and only the meaning of the statute as determined should be given effect.\u201d <em>Grange Mutual </em>v. <em>Criterion Ins. Co., </em>212 Va. 753, 756, 188 S.E.2d 91, 93 (1972); <em>accord City of Norfolk </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>235 Va. 433, 437, 367 S.E.2d 725, 727 (1988); <em>Storm </em>v. <em>Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>199 Va. 130, 135, 97 S.E.2d 759, 762 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We are of opinion that the plain language contained in Code \u00a7 38.2-2204(A) requires Southern Heritage to provide $25,000 of insurance coverage for any claim or judgment that Price may be legally obligated to pay to Haislip for claims arising out of the underlying automobile accident, even though Southern Heritage has already paid $25,000 to settle Haislip\u2019s claims against Goode. The plain language contained in the omnibus clause requires the Southern Heritage policy to contain \u201ca provision insuring the named insured, <em>and </em>any other person using ... the motor vehicle. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The General Assembly\u2019s use of the word \u201cand\u201d in Code \u00a7 38.2-2204(A) means that Southern Heritage is required to provide insurance coverage to both Price, who is the named insured, and Goode, who was driving the motor vehicle with Price\u2019s consent. The word \u201cand\u201d is unambiguous. \u201cAnd\u201d means \u201calong with or together with . . . added to or linked to.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, </em>p. 80 (1986). Even though Southern Heritage\u2019s insurance policy contains a limitation of $25,000 per occurrence, that limitation, if applied, would violate the omnibus clause because once Southern Heritage paid the $25,000 to settle Haislip\u2019s claims against Goode, Price, the named insured, who paid the policy premiums, would not receive any liability insurance coverage. Thus, Southern Heritage\u2019s interpretation of its policy and the omnibus clause would render the word \u201cand\u201d used in the statute meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Accordingly, we will enter a declaration here that Code \u00a7 38.2-2204 requires Southern Heritage to provide a maximum of $25,000 in coverage for any claim that Haislip may make against Price in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>addition to the $25,000 that Southern Heritage has already paid to settle Haislip\u2019s claims against Goode.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b288-5\">JUSTICE COMPTON,</author>\n<p id=\"A0f\">with whom CHIEF JUSTICE CARRICO and JUSTICE STEPHENSON join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The issue in this case, involving allegations of negligent operation by a permissive user and of negligent entrustment by a named insured, is whether the policy\u2019s liability limits are to be paid for each accident or for each act of negligence that may result in injuries to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Of course, under the omnibus clause, Code \u00a7 38.2-2204(A), the policy in question must contain a provision insuring the named insured \u201cand\u201d any other person using the insured\u2019s motor vehicle with the expressed or implied consent of the named insured against liability for injury sustained as a result of negligence in the operation or use of the vehicle. Manifestly, Price, the named insured, \u201cand\u201d Goode, the permissive user, were \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy; the insurer was obligated to provide a defense to both Price \u201cand\u201d Goode and, if the policy\u2019s monetary limits had not been exhausted, to pay the claimant\u2019s damages upon establishment of legal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">But employment of the word \u201cand\u201d in the omnibus clause does not mandate or require payment of the policy\u2019s liability limits for each act of negligence, that is, both negligent driving and negligent entrustment. The insurer\u2019s policy unambiguously provided that \u201cthe limit of bodily injury liability . . . applicable to \u2018each person\u2019 is the limit of the company\u2019s liability for all damages . . . arising out of bodily injury sustained by one person as the result of any one occurrence.\u201d Nothing in the omnibus clause annuls that policy provision. \u201cSimply put, the liability limits are per accident, not per act of negligence. Any contrary interpretation of the policy language would be unfounded.\u201d <em>Helmick </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>452 S.E.2d 408, 411 (W. Va. 1994); <em>accord Mid-Century Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Shutt, </em>845 P.2d 86 (Kan. App. 1993). <em>But see Iaquinta </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>510 N.W.2d 715 (Wis. App. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Accordingly, the maximum amount that the claimant Haislip may recover under the insurance contract is $25,000. Thus, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court in favor of the insurer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
