Bryan, who sues as \u201cPersonal Representative and Administratrix of the Estate of Shirley A. Robertson, deceased,\u201d filed a motion for judgment against appellees Steven M. Burt, D.O., and Eric J. Maybach, M.D., seeking damages for the alleged wrongful death of the decedent. The plaintiff alleged that the decedent came to a hospital emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain. She alleged that Burt, the emergency room physician, diagnosed constipation as the cause of the pain when it actually was due to a perforated ulcer. The plaintiff alleged Burt discharged the decedent from the hospital after several hours of examination and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Subsequently, the plaintiff alleged, when the pain did not subside, the decedent\u2019s family contacted the office of Maybach, the decedent\u2019s family physician. The plaintiff further alleged that as the result of Burt\u2019s misdiagnosis, which Maybach \u201cknew or should have known of,\u201d the decedent\u2019s condition worsened and she died several months later while a patient in another hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">In a grounds of defense, Burt denied the plaintiff\u2019s allegations of negligence. Maybach filed a grounds of defense also denying he was negligent because \u201che was not involved in the care and treatment of\u201d the decedent on the day of the alleged misdiagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">Following presentation of the plaintiff\u2019s case-in-chief during a four-day jury trial in March 1996, the trial court sustained the defendants\u2019 respective motions to strike the evidence. We awarded the plaintiff an appeal from the trial court\u2019s April 1996 order entering summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">According to settled principles of appellate review governing a case in which the plaintiff\u2019s evidence has been struck at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case-in-chief, we will recite the essential facts in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Koulizakis, </em>229 Va. 524, 526, 331 S.E.2d 440, 442 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The focus of this lawsuit is upon the events of December 13, 1992. Near 9:00 p.m. of that day, a Sunday, the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, age 53, went to the emergency department of the Fauquier Hospital in Warrenton, where she was examined and treated by Burt. She complained of pain \u201ccovering the entire abdomen.\u201d The patient stated she had experienced \u201cthe acute onset of the abdominal pain\u201d about three hours earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Upon examination, the patient\u2019s \u201cvital signs\u201d were normal. She gave a history of peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, headaches, \u201ca cholesterol problem,\u201d and \u201cproblems with constipation.\u201d She reported that she recently had been taking a number of different medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Burt ordered \u201clab work\u201d and x-rays that were \u201cof a standard nature\u201d and \u201cnormal in this sort of situation.\u201d Upon making a diagnosis of constipation, the physician ordered injection of a pain relieving drug, Toradol, and giving of \u201ca high soapsuds enema\u201d about 10:00 p.m. Near 11:30 p.m., the patient began receiving \u201cIV fluids, to run at approximately 500 cc\u2019s an horn:.\u201d About 35 minutes later, she was given \u201can oil retention enema.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The patient was discharged near 1:00 a.m. on December 14. Upon discharge, Burt instructed the patient to drink \u201clots of water,\u201d to pursue a \u201chigh fiber diet,\u201d to take specified doses of mineral oil, and \u201cif no bowel movement\u201d resulted, to take \u201c8 oz. of citrate of Magnesia.\u201d She was told to return to the emergency room \u201cif fever or any vomiting\u201d developed and to \u201cfollow-up\u201d with her personal physician on December 14 or 15 \u201cfor recheck\u201d of her blood pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">The patient returned to her home, accompanied by her daughter. The pain continued, preventing the patient from sleeping. Over the course of the next few hours, she took the prescribed doses of mineral oil. The pain did not subside and the medication did not produce a bowel movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Before noon on December 14, the daughter called Dr. Maybach\u2019s office because the patient \u201cwasn\u2019t feeling better.\u201d The daughter spoke with the physician\u2019s receptionist. The daughter called Maybach\u2019s office again near 3:00 p.m. on the 14th, and the receptionist relayed a recommendation from Maybach\u2019s nurse suggesting a laxative and an enema. Maybach was not present in his office when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>either call was received, and there was no request during either call for the physician to call the daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Near 4:00 p.m. on December 14, the patient \u201cstarted getting worse.\u201d She \u201cstarted looking bad\u201d and began \u201c[g]asping for air.\u201d About 8:35 p.m., the daughter took her to the emergency room of the Fauquier Hospital, where the patient went into shock and was seen by Dr. Fortune Odend\u2019hal.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Within hours, Dr. J. Paul Wampler performed exploratory abdominal surgery on the patient. As a result, she was diagnosed as having a perforated pyloric ulcer and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A plaintiff\u2019s medical expert testified the ulcer perforated about 6:00 p.m. on December 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Following surgery, the patient\u2019s condition \u201cstabilized\u201d and she was admitted to the hospital. The patient remained there until she was transferred to the University of Virginia Medical Center at Charlottesville on February 5, 1993, where she died 20 days later. According to a plaintiff\u2019s medical expert, the cause of death was ARDS and respiratory failure. He testified that the ARDS was caused by the perforated pyloric ulcer.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Three medical experts testified for the plaintiff: Dr. Frederick L. Glauser, who is \u201cBoard Certified in internal medicine, pulmonary and critical care medicine\u201d; Dr. Philip G. Leavy, an expert in \u201cemergency medicine\u201d; and Dr. Robert Bowman, a \u201cfamily practitioner of general medicine\u201d presently employed in a hospital emergency department. The plaintiff proffered Glauser as a so-called \u201ccausation witness\u201d and Leavy as a so-called \u201cstandard of care\u201d expert in emergency medicine; neither purported to express an opinion on the alleged malpractice of defendant Maybach.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Glauser\u2019s testimony can be summarized as follows. From a review of the medical records, he said \u201cthe medically initiating cause\u201d of the decedent\u2019s death \u201cwas a perforated pyloric ulcer.\u201d Relying, in part, on his study of the pertinent x-rays, the witness opined that the ARDS began with the perforation of the ulcer at 6:00 p.m. on the 13th. He said there was a progression from the perforated ulcer to the ARDS to the death. Glauser\u2019s opinion was that the decedent had a 90 to 95 percent chance of survival at 6:00 p.m. on the 13th, a 75 to 80 percent survival chance on the 14th, and a 40 to 50 percent chance of survival on the 15th.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">The trial court restricted Glauser\u2019s testimony on the basis that he was attempting to offer opinions as a \u201cstandard of care\u201d witness and not as a \u201ccausation\u201d witness. That action of the court is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>subject of an assignment of error. We shall not address the substance of the issue because any error committed by limiting the testimony was harmless; the expert fully expressed his views and the excluded information was supplied by the plaintiff\u2019s other experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Leavy\u2019s \u201cstandard of care\u201d testimony can be summarized as follows. He opined that Burt \u201cviolated the standard of care in his emergency room examination\u201d of the decedent \u201con several occasions in several areas of his care\u201d for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Specifically, the witness said, Burt failed \u201cto appreciate the significance of the complaint of the abrupt onset of pain in the abdomen\u201d; he \u201cfailed to appreciate the medication[s] she was taking and failed to get a history of . . . how often she had been taking them\u201d; he failed to recognize she was being treated with a combination of medications that had a propensity to worsen ulcers; and Burt \u201cturned away from the chief complaint and focused on the chronic constipation problem that she had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">In addition, the expert opined that Burt should have noticed \u201cfree air,\u201d an abnormal condition, in the decedent\u2019s abdomen that was revealed on the x-rays taken on the 13th. The witness\u2019 \u201cimpression\u201d was that most patients with \u201cperforated ulcers will, in fact, have free air.\u201d Also, the witness said Burt\u2019s conduct fell below the standard of care by not monitoring more frequently the patient\u2019s vital signs during her four-hour emergency room stay on the 13th.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Bowman, proffered as a witness to testify about \u201cthe medical care\u201d provided by both defendants to the decedent, opined that both \u201cacted below the standard of care.\u201d Bowman\u2019s opinions on Burt\u2019s conduct were essentially the same as Leavy\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Focusing on the allegations against Maybach, who had been the decedent\u2019s family doctor for 18 years, Bowman criticized Maybach\u2019s prescription of certain medications in the past as inconsistent with \u201cgood care.\u201d He also testified: \u201cIn the care of her problem that brought her to the emergency room, I think there was an opportunity to have made the care for her in the emergency room to be more directed toward problems that might have diagnosed her correctly had communication been given.\u201d Continuing, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t have enough information to be able to know what the communication was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Additionally, the expert said that, upon the decedent\u2019s release from the emergency room following her stay on the 13th, Maybach\u2019s \u201coffice was contacted on two separate occasions and the information that was given was that she was continuing to have abdominal pain,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>and the suggested treatment was to \u201crelieve what was diagnosed as a constipation problem.\u201d The witness said Maybach acted below the standard of care because there was no suggestion during the two calls \u201cthat she should be reexamined, either by himself or by going back to the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Also, the witness opined that the standard of care was violated when, assuming Maybach was not in the office when either telephone call was received, Maybach\u2019s receptionist or nurse failed \u201cto obtain medical help\u201d for the decedent when her daughter called. The witness said a prudent physician should establish \u201cguidelines\u201d for the office staff to cover such situations. The expert admitted, however, that if Maybach\u2019s staff had urged the decedent to return to Fauquier Hospital\u2019s emergency room on the 14th, the standard of care would have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">As we have said, the main question on appeal is whether the trial court erred in striking the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. The issues to be decided under this broad question are whether there was sufficient evidence of primary negligence, in the case of defendant Maybach, and of proximate cause, in the case of both defendants, to have carried those issues to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The applicable law is settled. A physician is neither an insurer of diagnosis and treatment nor is the physician held to the highest degree of care known to the profession. The mere fact that the physician has failed to effect a cure or that the diagnosis and treatment have been detrimental to the patient\u2019s health does not raise a presumption of negligence. Nevertheless, a physician must demonstrate that degree of skill and diligence in the diagnosis and treatment of the patient which is employed by a reasonably prudent practitioner in the physician\u2019s field of practice or specialty. <em>Brown, </em>229 Va. at 532, 331 S.E.2d at 445. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-581.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">In medical malpractice cases, a plaintiff must establish not only that a defendant violated the applicable standard of care, and therefore was negligent, the plaintiff must also sustain the burden of showing that the negligent acts constituted a proximate cause of the injury or death. Thus, in a death case, if a defendant physician, by action or inaction, has destroyed any substantial possibility of the patient\u2019s survival, such conduct becomes a proximate cause of the patient\u2019s death. <em>Brown, </em>229 Va. at 532, 331 S.E.2d at 446. <em>Accord Poliquin </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>254 Va. 51, 57, 468 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1997), decided today.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>First, we shall consider the case against Dr. Burt. He does not dispute that the plaintiff presented expert testimony which showed he breached the standard of care and which showed the cause of the decedent\u2019s death. However, he contends the plaintiff failed to \u201cpresent any expert testimony linking these two events.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The plaintiff argues that \u201cproximate cause was shown by expert testimony of a loss of substantial possibility of Mrs. Robertson\u2019s survival.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Certainly, the plaintiff presented evidence that Burt\u2019s failure to diagnose the perforated ulcer on December 13 constituted a violation of the standard of care, and that her chances of survival diminished from 90 to 95 percent on the 13th to 40 to 50 percent on the 15th. Nonetheless, the plaintiff failed to present evidence of any course of treatment which should have been pursued on the 13th, given a diagnosis of a perforated ulcer, that would have increased the decedent\u2019s chances of survival. Affording the plaintiff benefit of all possible inferences, one could infer from the events of the 14th that, if the condition had been properly diagnosed on the 13th, the decedent would have been referred to a surgeon who would have been responsible for her care. But the record is silent about the details of that care and its possible effect on the patient\u2019s health.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">This case is unlike <em>Hadeed </em>v. <em>Medic-24, Ltd., </em>237 Va. 277, 377 S.E.2d 589 (1989); <em>Brown, </em>supra; and <em>Whitfield </em>v. <em>Whittaker Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>210 Va. 176, 169 S.E.2d 563 (1969), relied on by the plaintiff. In each of those cases, holding proximate cause to be a jury issue, the plaintiff presented testimony to establish the nature of the treatment the decedent could have undergone had the diagnosis been correct and the probability that such treatment would have extended the decedent\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">For example, in <em>Hadeed, </em>the defendant physicians were charged with negligently failing to timely diagnose and treat a decedent\u2019s coronary artery disease. According to the evidence, treatment in the form of medication or bypass surgery would have improved the decedent\u2019s chance of survival. There, we said: \u201cLikewise, proximate cause was a jury question. [The plaintiff] presented evidence that the doctors\u2019 failure to meet the applicable standard of care destroyed any substantial possibility of [the deceased\u2019s] survival. A jury reasonably could find that with bypass surgery [the deceased] would have had an 85-90 percent chance of living to age 70. With only medical therapy, he would have had a 50 percent chance of living to age 60.\u201d 237 Va. at 286-87, 377 S.E.2d at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Likewise, in <em>Brown </em>we stated: \u201cPrompt diagnosis of the presence of the clot, which existed at least 48 hours before the death, would have enabled the orthopedist to administer treatment in the form of medication which would have substantially increased the patient\u2019s chances of living, according to the testimony. This was evidence of proximate cause.\u201d 229 Va. at 533, 331 S.E.2d at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Consequently, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting Dr. Burt\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Second, we shall address the case against Dr. Maybach. The essence of the plaintiff\u2019s criticism of Maybach is that he mismanaged the decedent\u2019s care prior to December 13, that he should have communicated more of the patient\u2019s history to Burt, and that the handling of the two telephone calls on the 14th by Maybach\u2019s office staff was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Even if we assume for purposes of this discussion that one or more of those charges somehow support a finding of negligence, nevertheless Maybach\u2019s alleged deviations from the standard of care were too remote as a matter of law to be causally related to the decedent\u2019s death. Maybach never was afforded the opportunity to see, diagnose, or treat the decedent on the 13th. He was never asked to evaluate her complaints of pain on that day. Actually, the evidence showed he was working at a Front Royal hospital at the time. He was never asked to read the x-rays which the plaintiff now argues showed free air in the abdomen indicating a perforated ulcer.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The evidence shows that Maybach\u2019s only involvement with the decedent on the 13th consisted of two telephone calls. In the first call, he directed the patient to seek treatment at the Fauquier Hospital because he was on duty in the Front Royal hospital at the time. In the second call, Burt merely advised Maybach that the patient had been seen, evaluated, and discharged with a diagnosis of constipation.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">When the telephone calls of the 14th were received, Maybach was not in his office. The decedent\u2019s daughter was told, according to the evidence, that if the patient\u2019s pain was severe she should be brought to Maybach\u2019s office or returned to the hospital. The daughter responded the family did not want to take the patient back to the hospital. The daughter was asked if she wished to leave a message for Maybach, and she declined to do so. The patient never came to Maybach\u2019s office for treatment on the 14th.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">In sum, as Maybach argues, his involvement with the decedent at the pertinent times \u201cwas simply too limited, too remote and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>too indirect\u201d to be causally connected to her death. Thus, we hold the trial court did not err in granting Dr. Maybach\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Finally, we reject the plaintiff\u2019s other assignments of error. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the deposition testimony of a radiologist as part of the plaintiff\u2019s case-in-chief. The focus of that area of inquiry was upon what an emergency room physician should have seen and evaluated on x-rays, not what an expert radiologist should have seen and evaluated. And, the trial court properly excluded proof of medical expenses that had not been linked causally to any alleged malpractice of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">For these reasons, the judgment below in favor of the defendants will be</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
