Smith, by her next friend and parent, Nina Rosen, filed her motion for judgment against William C. Smith. Plaintiff alleged that the defendant, who is Ryan\u2019s father, converted proceeds from the sale of bonds that he had placed in a custodial account with Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., \u201cpursuant to the former Uniform Gift[s] to Minors Act, former Virginia Code \u00a7 31-26, <em>et seq. </em>and now \u00a7 31-37 as amended.\u201d The defendant filed a grounds of defense admitting that he had purchased certain bonds for the benefit of the plaintiff, but denying that he had committed any unlawful acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The plaintiff filed a pretrial motion for summary judgment and requested that the trial court enter judgment on her behalf. The trial court refused to do so, holding that there were genuine issues of fact in dispute and that summary judgment was premature at that stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">On the morning of a bench trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s action on the basis that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The defendant asserted that the evidence would show that the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act \u201ccould not apply because none of the prerequisites for [the] application of the Act under . . . Code \u00a7 31-38 were met by the alleged transfer.\u201d Code \u00a7 31-38, which is a part of the Virginia Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, states in relevant part<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">\u201cThis chapter applies to any transfer that refers to the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act or this chapter in the designation under \u00a7 31-45 A by which the transfer is made if, at the time of the transfer, the transferor, the minor, or the custodian is a resident of this Commonwealth or the custodial property is located in this Commonwealth. The custodianship so created remains subject to this chapter despite a subsequent change in residence of a transferor, the minor, or the custodian, or the removal of custodial property from the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">A <em>transfer </em>that purports to be made and which is valid under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, the Uniform Gifts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>to Minors Act, or a substantially similar act of another state is governed by the law of the designated state and <em>may be executed and is enforceable in the Commonwealth if, at the time of the transfer, the transferor, the minor, or the custodian is a resident of the designated state or the custodial property is located in the designated </em>state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The plaintiff objected, contending that the trial court should not consider such motion on the morning of trial. The trial court offered the plaintiff a continuance and cautioned her that \u201cthis is a matter either of granting you a continuance, which I would readily do under these circumstances, or alternatively, trying the case. ...\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel, after consulting with plaintiff, declined the court\u2019s offer of a continuance. The trial court took the defendant\u2019s motion under advisement and the plaintiff proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s mother testified that she, the plaintiff, and the defendant lived in the District of Columbia in September 1984, when the bonds were allegedly transferred. The plaintiff\u2019s mother also testified that the bonds were maintained in the District of Columbia at the offices of Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Plaintiff called the defendant as an adverse witness. The defendant testified that when he established the account at Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., he did not make a gift to plaintiff and that he explicitly told his broker \u201cnot to do anything with respect to a gift or any sort of gift act.\u201d Rather, the defendant stated that he had directed his broker to purchase the bonds and structure the transaction so that the bonds would be taxed at his daughter\u2019s lower rate of income taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The defendant testified that he redeemed the bonds and utilized the funds for various purposes, including payment of the plaintiff\u2019s private school tuition and child support. Additionally, the proceeds from the sale of one of the bonds, which the defendant had used as collateral for a business loan, was forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the defendant renewed his motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s case on the basis that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court agreed with the defendant, dismissed the action, and entered a judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Subsequently, the trial court, <em>sua sponte, </em>reconsidered its ruling. The trial court held that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence showed that the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ported designation and gift could not have been made pursuant to the Virginia Uniform Transfers to Minors Act because the plaintiff failed to prove that either the gift or the parties had any nexus to Virginia when the gift was purportedly made. Amending its earlier ruling, the trial court held that it did have subject matter jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. The court entered an order which stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\">\u201cADJUDGED, ORDERED and DECREED that Defendant\u2019s Motion to Strike be and hereby is GRANTED on the ground that Plaintiff\u2019s evidence was insufficient to support the claim for relief sought herein, for the reason that Plaintiff\u2019s evidence showed that the alleged designation and gift was not made under the Virginia Uniform Transfers to Minors Act and therefore Defendant owed no fiduciary duties to Plaintiff under the Virginia Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The plaintiff then filed a motion requesting that the trial court vacate its judgment and permit her to amend her pleadings to conform with the evidence. The trial court denied that motion and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">In response to the plaintiff\u2019s requests for admission, the defendant admitted the following: he purchased and transferred bonds to his daughter under the Virginia Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, Code \u00a7 31-26, <em>et seq., </em>now the Virginia Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, Code \u00a7 31-37, <em>et seq.; </em>he held the bonds in a custodial account for her; he sold seven of the bonds and deposited the proceeds of $58,093.03 in his personal checking account; and he forfeited a bond, in the amount of $11,282, which he had used as collateral for a loan. The plaintiff argues that the defendant\u2019s responses to her requests for admission demonstrate that she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and, therefore, the trial court erred by denying her motion for summary judgment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">We have stated that \u201cthe decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is a drastic remedy which is available only where there are no material facts genuinely in dispute.\u201d <em>Slone </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>249 Va. 520, 522, 457 S.E.2d 51, 52 (1995) <em>(quoting Turner </em>v. <em>Lotts, </em>244 Va. 554, 556, 422 S.E.2d 765, 766 (1992)). Additionally, \u201c[i]n our discovery rules, we have cautioned that dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>covery ordinarily should not supplant the taking of evidence at a trial____\u201d <em>Carson </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>245 Va. 135, 137, 427 S.E.2d 189, 190 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">\u201cI think there are genuine issues of fact that preclude the court from granting summary judgment. I think the legal issues are very novel and I think that they have been well presented. But I think that it would be premature to make a judgment about the merits of any of the legal issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The record reveals that there were factual issues in dispute. For example, the defendant denied that he had committed any illegal or unlawful acts against the plaintiff. The defendant also disputed the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that he used the proceeds from the sale of the bonds for his personal use. Rather, the defendant asserted that he had purchased the bonds to insure that he would have funds to satisfy his contractual obligations under a separation and property settlement agreement with the plaintiff\u2019s mother. Thus, we hold that the trial court properly denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">Plaintiff argues that the trial court abused its discretion \u201cin permitting the [djefendant to recant on the morning of trial, [his] prior written admission that the custodial property was created under the Virginia Uniform Gifts to Minors Act.\u201d The plaintiff says that the defendant did not file a motion to withdraw or amend his responses to requests for admission and, therefore, plaintiff was prejudiced \u201cby the court\u2019s allowance of the \u2018withdrawal.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">The defendant, relying upon <em>TransiLift Equipment, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>234 Va. 84, 360 S.E.2d 183 (1987), argues that the plaintiff waived her right to rely upon any conclusive effect of his responses to her requests for admission. We agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">Rule 4:11 permits a party to serve written requests for admission upon any other party. Rule 4:ll(b) states, \u201c[a]ny matter admitted under this Rule is conclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">However, in <em>Cunningham, </em>we held that a defendant, who failed to object to a plaintiff\u2019s testimony, which was contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s responses to requests for admission, waived any binding and conclusive effect of the responses to the requests for admission. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>Id., </em>at 92, 360 S.E.2d at 188. Applying this rule, we hold that the plaintiff waived her right to rely upon any binding and conclusive effect of the defendant\u2019s admissions because she failed to object to his testimony which directly contradicted those admissions. As we mentioned in part H of this opinion, the defendant testified without objection that he did not give the bonds to plaintiff. Indeed, we observe the plaintiff elicited the contradictory testimony from the defendant during her direct examination of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court erred by granting defendant\u2019s motion to strike her evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Code \u00a7 31-38 specifies that a transfer which is valid under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act or the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act is enforceable in Virginia if, at the time of the transfer, the transferor, the minor, or the custodian is a resident of the designated state or the custodial property is located in the designated state. The plaintiff\u2019s own uncontroverted evidence established that the plaintiff, defendant, and custodian of the account were residents of the District of Columbia when the defendant purportedly transferred the bonds to her. The plaintiff conceded at trial that Virginia is the designated state. Thus, applying the plain meaning of the words in Code \u00a7 31-38, the plaintiff may not enforce any rights that she may have obtained as a result of the alleged transfer because when the purported transfer occurred, none of the specified parties was a resident of Virginia and the custodial property was not located in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Plaintiff contends that the defendant was allowed to create and profit from a \u201cvariance\u201d between the proof and the pleadings and that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to grant the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend its pleadings to conform to the evidence as permitted by Code \u00a7 8.01-377. We find no merit in the plaintiff\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">Code \u00a7 8.01-377 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-11\">\u201cIf, at the trial of any action, there appears to be a variance between the evidence and the allegations or recitals, the court, if it consider that substantial justice will be promoted and that the opposite party cannot be prejudiced thereby, may allow the pleadings to be amended, on such terms as to the payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>costs or postponement of the trial, or both, as it may deem reasonable. Or, instead of the pleadings being amended, the court may direct the jury to find the facts, and, after such finding, if it consider the variance such as could not have prejudiced the opposite party, shall give judgment according to the right of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">We recently stated that Code \u00a7 8.01-377 \u201cshould not be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with its plain language.\u201d <em>Hensley </em>v. Dreyer, 247 Va. 25, 30, 439 S.E.2d 372, 375 (1994); <em>accord City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Richmond Metropolitan Auth., </em>210 Va. 645, 648, 172 S.E.2d 831, 833 (1970). Code \u00a7 8.01-377 authorizes a trial court to grant a variance \u201cat the trial of any action.\u201d Here, the plaintiff did not seek a variance at the trial of her action. Rather, she made her motion nine days after the trial court had granted the motion to strike her evidence and concluded the case. We hold that the trial court properly denied the motion because it was not made \u201cat the trial of any action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In view of the foregoing, we need not consider plaintiff\u2019s remaining arguments. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\"> The Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, former Code \u00a7\u00a7 3-26 through -36, was repealed by the General Assembly in 1988 and replaced by the Virginia Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, Code \u00a7 31-37 through -59.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
