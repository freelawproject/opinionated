Westmoreland appeals from the award of summary judgment in Virginia Power\u2019s favor and the dismissal of Westmoreland\u2019s action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">Westmoreland makes three complaints on appeal. First, Westmoreland says the trial court erred in holding that evidence of trade custom and usage would not be permitted to explain the meaning of certain contractual terms. Second, Westmoreland contends the Contract is ambiguous and that the trial court erred in ruling that parol evidence would not be allowed to show the parties\u2019 intent and understanding with respect to certain of the Contract\u2019s payment provisions. Third, relative to an alternative basis for recovery, Westmoreland maintains the trial court erred in failing to recognize that certain contractual language might entitle Westmoreland to at least a partial recovery for Virginia Power\u2019s alleged breach of the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">The facts are not in dispute. Westmoreland, a Virginia general partnership composed of Westmoreland Roanoke Valley, L.P. and LG&amp;E Roanoke Valley, L.P., is an independent power producer. Virginia Power is a public utility providing electrical service to its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">In the late 1970s, Virginia Power began purchasing electricity from independent power producers. In 1988, Virginia Power issued a request for proposals from a number of independent power producers, including Westmoreland, for the supply of electricity to Virginia Power. A model contract prepared by Virginia Power accompanied the request for proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">Westmoreland responded with a proposal, which Virginia Power accepted, and the two parties entered into the Contract on January 24, 1989.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On or about the same date, Virginia Power entered into agreements with approximately twenty other independent power producers as a result of its request for proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">In order to fulfill its obligations under the Contract, Westmoreland constructed a $300 million power plant, known as \u201cROVA I\u201d (the Facility), near Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plant commenced commercial operations in May 1994 with the capacity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>produce approximately 150 megawatts of electricity. Westmoreland is obligated under the Contract to supply this capacity to Virginia Power upon demand for a term of twenty-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">In the Contract, Westmoreland agrees to sell and Virginia Power agrees to purchase \u201cthe Net Electrical Output of the Facility.\u201d Also, Westmoreland agrees to sell and Virginia Power agrees to purchase \u201cDependable Capacity from the Facility.\u201d \u201cNet Electrical Output\u201d is defined in the Contract as \u201c[a]ll of the Facility\u2019s generating output made available for sale.\u201d \u201cDependable Capacity\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he amount of capacity set by [Westmoreland based upon prescribed tests] and delivered from the Facility\u201d to Virginia Power.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Under the Contract, Westmoreland must \u201ccontrol and operate the Facility consistent with [Virginia] Power\u2019s Dispatch of the Facility.\u201d \u201cDispatch\u201d is defined in the Contract as \u201c[t]he right of [Virginia] Power ... to schedule and control ... the generating level of the Facility in order to commence, increase, decrease, or cease the delivery of Net Electrical Output\u201d to Virginia Power. When Virginia Power dispatches the Facility by providing notice to Westmoreland of the estimated needs for the following week, Westmoreland must comply with the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">Virginia Power is obligated by the Contract to make two types of payments to Westmoreland, one for net electrical output, termed \u201cEnergy Payments,\u201d and the other for dependable capacity, termed \u201cCapacity Payments,\u201d based upon the different types of costs incurred by Westmoreland. Energy Payments are designed to compensate Westmoreland for the actual amount of electricity it generates and delivers to Virginia Power and to reimburse Westmoreland for its variable costs incurred to produce the electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">Energy Payments are not in dispute here, but Capacity Payments are. Capacity Payments are designed to compensate Westmoreland for the costs it incurred in constructing the Facility and for the fixed costs it incurs in operating and maintaining the Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">Under \u00a7 10.15(a) of the Contract, Virginia Power is required to make Capacity Payments in a fixed amount for a 25-year term, \u201cso long as the plant is available as required by the Contract.\u201d Although paid monthly, the Capacity Payment is calculated at the rate of approximately $200,000 per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-9\">The present controversy arose when Virginia Power withheld Capacity Payments for each day it deemed to be a \u201cForced Outage Day\u201d within the meaning of the Contract. In its amended motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>judgment, Westmoreland sought recovery for the total amount withheld by Virginia Power.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">Section 1.18 of the Contract defines a \u201cForced Outage\u201d as \u201c[a]n interruption ... of the Facility\u2019s delivery of the Net Electrical Output [that] is not ... the result of a Scheduled Outage.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 1.20 defines a \u201cForced Outage Day\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-5\">[e]ach continuous twenty-four (24) hour period beginning with the start of a Forced Outage (regardless of the number of actual outages that may occur during such twenty-four (24) hour period(s))</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-6\">(a) designated by [Westmoreland] as a Forced Outage Day,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-7\">(b) a Forced Outage Day which is determined pursuant to Section 10.15(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">Section 10.15(d) forms the entire basis of Virginia Power\u2019s defense in this case. It is a unique section, found only in the contract involved here and not in the agreements Virginia Power executed with other independent power producers at or about the same time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 10.15(d) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-9\">For each instance where [Westmoreland] fails, after the second oral notification (such notification shall not be less than fifteen (15) minutes from the first notification) from [Virginia] Power, to maintain the operating level specified by [Virginia] Power pursuant to Section 7.6, to within \u00b1 five (5%) percent of the Dispatched level then for each percent or portion of a percent deviation from the above allowed \u00b1 five (5%) percent, then at [Virginia] Power\u2019s option, the payment for that Day\u2019s Dependable Capacity shall be reduced two (2%) percent. If such deviation reduces that Day\u2019s payment for Dependable Capacity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>zero (0) then that Day shall be a Forced Outage Day. Example: If the Facility is Dispatched at 100MW but is only able to deliver 87MW then the payment for Dependable Capacity for that Day would be reduced by 16%.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Because, under \u00a7 10.15(d), the 2% reduced payment scale applies to each percent of deviation from the dispatched level, or portion thereof, the reduction in the capacity payment reaches 100% and a Forced Outage Day occurs on any day when power generation falls below 46% of the dispatched level, giving credit for the + 5% allowance. This is the result derived from the formula, 100 - 5 = 95 - 45 = 50 x 2 = 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Sections 10.15(g) and 10.18 also relate to Forced Outage Days. Section 10.15(g) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-7\">[Westmoreland] shall be allowed thirty (30) Forced Outage Days per full Capacity Test Period (May 1 through April 30). . . . Payments for Dependable Capacity will be reduced five hundred thousand ($500,000) dollars as liquidated damages for each Forced Outage Day that occurred or was designated by [Westmoreland] during that period in excess of the above allowances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-8\">And \u00a7 10.18 provides in pertinent part as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-9\">The parties agree that [Virginia] Power will be substantially damaged in amounts that will be difficult or impossible to determine if the Facility:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-10\">(d) Exceeds the allowed number of Forced Outage Days in Section 10.15(g).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-11\">Therefore, to the limited extent set forth in the Agreement, the Parties have agreed on sums which the Parties agree are reasonable as liquidated damages for such occurrences. It is further understood and agreed that the payment of the liquidated damages is in lieu of actual damages for such occurrences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-12\">The relationship between \u00a7 10.15(d) and the terms \u201cForced Outage Days\u201d and \u201cForce Majeure Days\u201d is also relevant to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>dispute. Under \u00a7 14.1, a delay in performance occurring on a given day is excused if Westmoreland designates such day a \u201cForce Majeure Day.\u201d A Force Majeure Day may be designated when a delay in performance is \u201cdue solely to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the Party experiencing such delay, [for example,] acts of God; . . . war; riots; ... or accidents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">A Force Majeure Day does not count against the thirty Forced Outage Days allowed before the $500,000 per day liquidated damage provision of \u00a7 10.15(g) may be invoked. However, under \u00a7 10.15(b) of the Contract, if a forced outage is designated as an event of Force Majeure, \u201cthen [Virginia] Power\u2019s obligation to pay the payments for Dependable Capacity specified in Section 10.15(a) above shall cease, prorated daily, until the condition of Force Majeure has been overcome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">In awarding summary judgment in Virginia Power\u2019s favor, the trial court found that the Contract was unambiguous and, therefore, that evidence of trade custom and usage as well as parol evidence concerning the parties\u2019 intent and understanding would be inadmissible. The court found further that Westmoreland had \u201cfailed to maintain power generation at greater than 45% of the specified level\u201d on the days for which it sought recovery. Hence, the court held, \u00a7 10.15(d) of the Contract expressly permitted Virginia Power to withhold Capacity Payments for those days, including the days Westmoreland had designated as Forced Outage Days, and to charge Westmoreland with all such days \u201cfor the purpose of determining the liquidated damages provision of the parties\u2019 contract pursuant to \u00a7 10.15(g).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\n<em>Admissibility of Evidence Concerning Trade Custom and Usage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Westmoreland argues that it should have been permitted to introduce evidence showing that \u201cthe terms \u2018Capacity Purchase Price\u2019 and \u2018Forced Outage Day\u2019 have special meaning in the trade custom and usage, under which the occurrence of such Days does not diminish the monthly payment unless the annual Forced Outage Day allowance is exceeded.\u201d Westmoreland submits that \u201c[t]his trade custom and usage, reflected in all of the contracts resulting from the 1988 solicitation, \u2018form a part [of the Contract] . . . unless the terms of the writing [clearly exclude] the usage or custom.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Walker v. Gateway Milling Co., </em>121 Va. 217, 224, 92 S.E. 826, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>828 (1917)). Westmoreland maintains there is no language in the Contract that clearly excludes consideration of custom and usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Noting that the trial court excluded the evidence of trade custom and usage because it found the Contract unambiguous, Westmoreland cites <em>Doswell Ltd. Partnership v. Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co., </em>251 Va. 215, 468 S.E.2d 84 (1996), for the proposition that such evidence is admissible to show that contract phrases or terms have acquired a peculiar meaning by trade custom or usage \u201ceven though the phrases or terms themselves are unambiguous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225, 468 S.E.2d at 90. Hence, Westmoreland concludes, the trial court erred in excluding its evidence of trade custom or usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">While we confirm what we said in <em>Doswell, </em>we disagree with Westmoreland. In our opinion, Westmoreland has not met the threshold requirement for admission of the disputed evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">In <em>Walker, supra, </em>we said that evidence of trade usage is proper \u201cto permit the jury to consider the situation of the parties and the circumstances leading up to the making of the contract for the purpose of determining whether the usage in question <em>operated upon the minds of the parties </em>in using the language which was employed in the contract.\u201d 121 Va. at 226, 92 S.E. at 829 (emphasis added). However, \u201cknowledge of the existence of the custom must be brought home to the [contracting parties], unless the evidence shows that it is so uniform and notorious at the place where the parties to be affected by it reside, as to raise a <em>prima facie </em>presumption that they knew of it.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Rice, </em>107 Va. 51, 55, 57 S.E. 575, 577 (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Because the Contract and the other agreements resulting from the 1988 solicitation were made at or about the same time, what was done under the other contracts could not possibly have been brought home to, or have operated upon the minds of, the parties to the Westmoreland contract at the time of its execution. In other words, Westmoreland has failed to establish the existence, at the time the Contract was executed, of any trade custom or usage relevant to the meaning of the language that was employed in the Contract. The trial court did not err, therefore, in excluding evidence of trade custom and usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">\n<em>Admissibility of Parol Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">Westmoreland contends that \u00a7 10.15(d) of the Contract is ambiguous, even when viewed in isolation, because it does not \u201cdefine the financial consequence of treating a day as a Forced Outage Day.\u201d And, Westmoreland says, when the Contract, including \u00a7 10.15(d), is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>read as a whole, it does not \u201cunambiguously permit any reduction of the capacity purchase price on account of allowed Forced Outage Days.\u201d Hence, Westmoreland concludes, \u201cthere was no justification for the Circuit Court\u2019s foreclosure of parol evidence of the parties\u2019 intent and understanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Virginia Power contends on the other hand that \u00a7 10.15(d) is unambiguous. Virginia Power says that the \u201c2-for-l reduced payment scale established by \u00a7 10.15(d) applies to <em>all </em>shortfalls in Westmoreland\u2019s generating capacity after the initial five percent variance.\u201d Therefore, Virginia Power asserts, \u201c[wjhen Westmoreland\u2019s generation is 45% or less of the Dispatched level, . . . Virginia Power has the right, in the words of \u00a7 10.15(d), to reduce \u2018that Day\u2019s payment for Dependable Capacity to zero (0).\u2019 \u201d This shortfall occurred, Virginia Power says, \u201con each day for which [it] made no Dependable Capacity payment\u201d and, hence, it was excused from making payment for each of those days.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">But, Virginia Power insists, even when \u00a7 10.15(d) is read along with the other provisions of the Contract, no ambiguity appears. \u201cThose other provisions,\u201d Virginia Power says, \u201chave nothing to do with the situation addressed by \u00a7 10.15(d) and do not make that section ambiguous.\u201d Hence, Virginia Power concludes, the trial court did not err in excluding parol evidence of the parties\u2019 intent and understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">\u201cThe question whether a writing is ambiguous is one of law, not of fact.\u201d <em>Tuomala </em>v. <em>Regent University, </em>252 Va. 368, 374, 477 S.E.2d 501, 505 (1996). Thus, \u201cwe are not bound by the trial court\u2019s conclusions on this issue, and we are permitted the same opportunity as the trial court to consider the contract provisions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">In <em>Doswell, supra, </em>we reiterated the principle that \u201c \u2018[p]arol evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral negotiations are generally inadmissible to alter, contradict, or explain the terms of a written instrument provided the document is complete, unambiguous, and unconditional.\u2019 \u201d 251 Va. at 222, 468 S.E.2d at 88 (quoting <em>Renner Plumbing, Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc. v. Renner, </em>225 Va. 508, 515, 303 S.E.2d 894, 898 (1983)). We also said in <em>Doswell:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">Contracts are not rendered ambiguous merely because the parties or their attorneys disagree upon the meaning of the language employed to express the agreement. Even though an agreement may have been drawn unartfully, the court must con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>strue the language as written if its parts can be read together without conflict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-4\">And, parol evidence may not be used to first create an ambiguity and then to remove it. Finally, an agreement is not rendered ambiguous merely because it deals with a technical subject that may be considered complex to the uninformed lay person who is not familiar with the topic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 222-23, 468 S.E.2d at 88-89 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u201cA contract must be construed as a whole to determine the parties\u2019 intent with respect to specific provisions.\u201d <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>Musolino, </em>234 Va. 558, 569, 364 S.E.2d 207, 212, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 823 (1988). \u201cNo word or clause in the contract will be treated as meaningless if a reasonable meaning can be given to it, and there is a presumption that the parties have not used words needlessly.\u201d <em>D.C. McClain, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arlington County, </em>249 Va. 131, 135-36, 452 S.E.2d 659, 662 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u201c \u2018An ambiguity exists when language admits of being understood in more than one way,\u2019 \u201d <em>Doswell, </em>251 Va. at 222, 468 S.E.2d at 88 (quoting <em>Renner, </em>225 Va. at 515, 303 S.E.2d at 898), or when \u201c \u2018language is of doubtful import,\u2019 \u201d <em>Galloway Corp. v. S.B. Ballard Constr. Co., </em>250 Va. 493, 502, 464 S.E.2d 349, 355 (1995) (quoting <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Green, </em>229 Va. 588, 592, 331 S.E.2d 472, 475 (1985)). And an award of summary judgment is improper when \u201cneither party has offered a construction of [contractual] provisions that could be deemed so clear that it unambiguously excludes the explanation offered by the opponent.\u201d <em>Cascades North Venture Ltd. Partnership v. PRC Inc., </em>249 Va. 574, 582, 457 S.E.2d 370, 374-75 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Guided by these principles, we reach the conclusion that the Contract is ambiguous. In the first place, the language of \u00a7 10.15(d), even when read in isolation, admits of being understood in more than one way, <em>Doswell, </em>251 Va. at 222, 468 S.E.2d at 88, and, hence, is of doubtful import, <em>Galloway, </em>250 Va. at 502, 464 S.E.2d at 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">The penultimate sentence of \u00a7 10.15(d) contains the crucial language. The sentence states that \u201c[if the deviation from the dispatched level on a given day] reduces that Day\u2019s payment for Dependable Capacity to zero (0) then that Day shall be a Forced Outage Day.\u201d If emphasis is placed upon the words, \u201creduces that Day\u2019s payment for Dependable Capacity to zero,\u201d the language of (d) may be taken to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>mean that the result of such a deviation would be no capacity payment for that day. If, however, emphasis is placed upon the words, \u201cthen that Day shall be a Forced Outage Day,\u201d the language of (d) may just as well be taken to mean that the only result of such a deviation would be the counting of the day in question against the thirty Forced Outage Day allowance provided by \u00a7 10.15(g) before the $500,000 per day liquidated damage provision may be invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Hence, this case presents a situation in which \u201cneither party has offered a construction of these provisions that could be deemed so clear that it unambiguously excludes the explanation offered by the opponent.\u201d <em>Cascades North </em>Venture, 249 Va. at 582, 457 S.E.2d at 374-75. This alone is sufficient to justify the admission of parol evidence concerning the parties\u2019 intent and understanding at the time they entered into the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">However, there is more. When \u00a7 10.15(d) is read in context with other provisions of the Contract, the ambiguity becomes even more apparent. <em>First, </em>a reading of \u00a7 10.15(b) demonstrates that when the parties wished to make clear under what circumstances Virginia Power would not be obligated to make Capacity Payments for a Forced Outage, they knew how to accomplish the task, using clear and precise language. Section 10.15(b) states that when Westmoreland \u201cdesignates [a] Forced Outage as an event of Force Majeure, then [Virginia] Power\u2019s obligation to pay the payments for Dependable Capacity . . . shall cease.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As Westmoreland suggests, the absence of such an explicit provision in \u00a7 10.15(d) casts doubt upon the correctness of Virginia Power\u2019s assertion that \u00a7 10.15(d) unambiguously relieves it from the obligation to make Capacity Payments for all Forced Outage Days, however they occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Virginia Power argues that \u00a7 10.15(b) is consistent with \u00a7 10.15(d) in that both \u201crelieve[] Virginia Power of any obligation to pay Westmoreland for capacity Virginia Power does not receive.\u201d However, this assumes the correctness of Virginia Power\u2019s position and begs the question to be decided, <em>i.e., </em>whether \u00a7 10.15(d) really does relieve Virginia Power of the obligation to make Capacity Payments for Forced Outage Days occurring under \u00a7 10.15(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Virginia Power also argues that \u00a7 10.15(d) applies only to those days on which Westmoreland\u2019s facility is dispatched to produce electrical power while \u00a7 10.15(b) applies even if Westmoreland is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>so dispatched. But this argument misses the point, viz., if it was necessary to say explicitly in \u00a7 10.15(b) that Capacity Payments cease for Force Majeure Days occurring under that section, was it not just as necessary to say explicitly in \u00a7 10.15(d) that payments cease for Forced Outage Days occurring under that section? In any event, we do not think it appears as a matter of law that the distinction drawn by Virginia Power would make a difference in its obligation with respect to Capacity Payments for Forced Outage Days, but perhaps parol evidence submitted by the parties on remand will reveal whether the distinction was intended to make a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\"><em>Second, </em>\u00a7 10.15(g) allows Westmoreland thirty Forced Outage Days annually before the provision for liquidated damages in the amount of $500,000 per day may be invoked. Section 10.18 provides that \u201cthe payment of the liquidated damages is in lieu of actual damages\u201d Virginia Power may suffer if Westmoreland \u201c[ejxceeds the allowed number of Forced Outage Days in Section 10.15(g).\u201d As Westmoreland maintains, these provisions support the implication that liquidated damages may be the only penalty Westmoreland must suffer for Forced Outage Days, and such an implication is completely inconsistent with Virginia Power\u2019s position that \u00a7 10.15(d) permits it to withhold Capacity Payments for all Forced Outage Days in addition to collecting $500,000 per day in liquidated damages if the number of such days exceeds the thirty days allowed annually.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Virginia Power says, however, that \u00a7 10.15(g) \u201crelates to a different subject matter than \u00a7 10.15(d),\u201d that \u201c[njeither section refers to the other,\u201d and that \u00a7 10.15(g) \u201chas nothing whatsoever to do with Virginia Power\u2019s obligation to make Dependable Capacity payments.\u201d However, both sections mention and deal with the subjects of Forced Outage Days and payments for Dependable Capacity \u2014 \u00a7 10.15(d) states that a Forced Outage Day occurs when the deviation on a particular day reduces that day\u2019s Dependable Capacity payment to zero and \u00a7 10.15(g) states that payments for Dependable Capacity will be reduced by $500,000 for each Forced Outage Day that exceeds the thirty-day allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Moreover, \u00a7 10.15(d) is implicitly incorporated by reference into \u00a7 10.15(g) because, in its final sentence, the latter section states that \u201c[p]ayments for Dependable Capacity will be reduced five hundred thousand ($500,000) dollars as liquidated damages for each Forced Outage Day that <em>occurred </em>or was <em>designated </em>by [Westmoreland] during [a capacity test] period in excess of the above allowances.\u201d (Emphasis added.) If a Forced Outage Day is not desig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>nated by Westmoreland, it can only <em>occur </em>as a result of the reductions required by the sliding scale set forth in \u00a7 10.15(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Therefore, it is not correct to say categorically, as Virginia Power would have us say, that \u00a7 10.15(g) has \u201cnothing whatsoever to do with Virginia Power\u2019s obligation to make Dependable Capacity payments.\u201d Rather, Westmoreland should have the opportunity to show by parol evidence on remand what the parties intended by the language they employed in the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">We hold that it was error for the trial court to exclude parol evidence concerning the parties\u2019 intent and understanding with respect to Forced Outage Days and Capacity Payments at the time they executed the Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\n<em>Alternative Basis of Recovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Westmoreland\u2019s amended motion for judgment contained an alternative claim of breach of contract for Virginia Power\u2019s withholding of Capacity Payments for days that Westmoreland designated as Forced Outage Days pursuant to \u00a7 1.20(a) of the Contract. The trial court\u2019s award of summary judgment in favor of Virginia Power encompassed this alternative claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Under \u00a7 1.20, a Forced Outage Day occurs when \u201c(a) designated by [Westmoreland] as a Forced Outage Day,\u201d or \u201c(b) determined pursuant to Section 10.15(d).\u201d Westmoreland argues that \u201c[e]ven if \u00a7 10.15(d) could be read as depriving [it] of [capacity] payments attributable to days that are classified as Forced Outage Days by [the section\u2019s] own operation, its impact [should] be limited to such days.\u201d Hence, Westmoreland concludes, it was \u201centitled, at a minimum, to a judgment for the amount attributable to the days covered by \u00a7 1.20(a).\u201d Virginia Power says the trial court did not err in denying Westmoreland a partial recovery for designated days.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">The trial court stated no reason for the inclusion of Westmoreland\u2019s alternative basis for relief in its award of summary judgment. As Westmoreland suggests in a footnote to its brief, the trial court\u2019s disposition of this phase of the case may have been inextricably entwined in the court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 10.15(d) unambiguously \u201cpermits Virginia Power not to make dependable capacity payments on days for which [Westmoreland] seeks payment,\u201d which necessarily included Forced Outage Days designated by Westmoreland pursuant to \u00a7 1.20(a). Since we hold <em>supra </em>that the Contract is ambiguous, we think the trial court on remand, if Westmoreland is unsuccessful on its principal claim for breach of contract, should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>have the opportunity to consider further the question whether Virginia Power is entitled to withhold Capacity Payments for Forced Outage Days designated by Westmoreland pursuant to \u00a7 1.20(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">We will affirm the trial court\u2019s action in excluding evidence of trade custom and usage. For the error in excluding evidence concerning the parties\u2019 intent and understanding with respect to Forced Outage Days and Capacity Payments, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b22-9\"> The Contract was \u201camended and restated\u201d in 1990 and 1991, but the provisions in issue here have remained unchanged since the 1989 version of the Contract was executed by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b22-10\"> Virginia Power operates in North Carolina under the name North Carolina Power.

However, because Westmoreland planned to use a low grade fuel to generate electricity, with likely reductions in power output below 95% of the dispatched level, the parties agreed to the inclusion of \u00a7 10.15(d) in the Contract, which increased from 5% to 55% the permitted deviation from the dispatched level before a Forced Outage Day occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b30-8\"> Similarly, \u00a7 5.3 of the Contract provides that Virginia Power \u201cshall not be obligated to make payments for Dependable Capacity\u201d during periods allowed to cure defaults under the Contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
