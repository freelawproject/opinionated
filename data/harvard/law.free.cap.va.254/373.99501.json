In November 1994, appellees Robert Eichelbaum and Lewis B. Goode, Jr., Co-Executors of the Estate of Katherine Haas Eichelbaum, Deceased, filed a bill of complaint naming as a defendant, among others, appellant Virginia School of the Arts, Inc. Noting that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>defendant had presented a claim against the estate, the executors sought the court\u2019s aid and guidance regarding \u201cthe legal enforceability of\u201d the claim. The school is a Lynchburg private \u201cresidential high school that fosters and encourages students of middle and high school age to achieve the highest possible standards in dance, theater, music and visual arts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">During the litigation, the cause was transferred to the law side of the court by agreement. The other defendants were dismissed, and the case proceeded as a claim by the school against the estate seeking to enforce a \u201ccharitable subscription of the Decedent\u201d in the amount of $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Following a June 1996 bench trial, at which only the school presented testimonial evidence along with stipulated documentary evidence, the court below ruled in favor of the estate. We awarded the school an appeal from the September 1996 final order dismissing its claim with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The facts are undisputed. Between 1991 and 1993, Mrs. Eichelbaum, a resident of Lynchburg, gave $467,433 to the school. Her benevolence took the form of both outright \u201cspecial gifts\u201d and contributions to the school\u2019s \u201cannual fund drive.\u201d For example, during the \u201cspring of \u201993,\u201d her $150,000 special gift enabled the school to avoid closing because of financial difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The transaction in question took place in October 1993. At that time, the school was involved in soliciting prospective donors for the 1993-94 annual fund for the fiscal year July 1, 1993 to June 30, 1994. Because Mrs. Eichelbaum had been \u201ca major donor of the school,\u201d the school\u2019s administrators decided to ask her to make a \u201cchallenge gift\u201d in order to encourage other persons to contribute to the fund drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Helen Burnette Harvey, who managed the school\u2019s internal operations, visited Mrs. Eichelbaum armed with fund-raising \u201cmaterials\u201d and a \u201crequest letter\u201d dated October 5, 1993. The letter provided: \u201cA gift of $100,000 as a challenge grant to the 1993-94 Annual Fund would ensure the School\u2019s place in this community as both a cultural and economic asset.\u201d The letter further provided: \u201cWith your permission we would like to promote your gift to encourage renewing and new donors to invest. . . We must raise $200,000 during this year\u2019s Annual Fund period; we believe a matching grant would make it possible for us to achieve this goal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Following the visit, Mrs. Eichelbaum consulted her financial adviser and signed a statement dated October 8, 1993 affixed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>end of the letter in which she \u201cagree[d] to commit the sum of $100,000 ... to The Virginia School of the Arts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The letter did not mention periodic payments of the \u201cmatching grant\u201d or how the pledge would be paid, nor were those subjects discussed with Mrs. Eichelbaum or her financial adviser by any of the school\u2019s representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">On October 18, 1993, Mrs. Harvey on behalf of the school wrote Mrs. Eichelbaum a letter of appreciation, stating her \u201crecent generous gift... in the form of a $100,000 matching grant is exactly what we needed to ensure the success of the \u201993-\u201994 Annual Fund drive.\u201d On December 3, 1993, the school issued a press release announcing an anonymous \u201cchallenge gift\u201d of $100,000, which \u201cwill encourage other individuals, business and industry sources, and private foundations in the community and beyond to contribute to the school\u2019s operations and programs.\u201d The press statement said the school \u201cmust match this challenge gift by the end of this fiscal year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The school then attempted to raise funds to match the pledge. In letters to prospects, the school called attention to the \u201c$100,000 challenge gift\u201d and stated it was \u201cstriving to meet this generous offering.\u201d In letters of appreciation to donors, the school stated that the particular gift \u201cbrings us closer to meeting our responsibility in relation to the $100,000 challenge grant that we received from a loyal supporter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Mrs. Eichelbaum died testate on January 14, 1994. The school had not asked her to make any payments on the pledge and she had made none. Additionally, by that date, the school had not raised $100,000 to equal the decedent\u2019s matching grant. By the end of the 1993-94 fiscal year, the school had raised only $67,592.71.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">In a letter opinion, the trial court determined that the \u201csubscription considered in context with the solicitation letter of October 5, 1993, and the resulting conduct of the parties, whether analyzed as a unilateral or bilateral contract, is unenforceable\u201d because the school \u201cfailed to match the sum pledged by the decedent during the 1993-94 Annual Fund Drive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">On appeal, the school contends the trial court erred in ruling that the estate was not liable for payment of the decedent\u2019s pledge. Arguing that \u201ccharitable subscriptions should be enforced as a matter of public policy wherever possible,\u201d the school says the trial court erred in failing to find it \u201cactually matched the pledge in this case.\u201d The school argues \u201cits evidence unequivocally establishes that the gift was matched within a reasonable time\u201d because it raised $212,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>during the period October 1993 - June 1995 through gifts from persons other than the decedent. The school says \u201cnothing in the pledge provided any limitation to the time within [which] the gift was to be matched by other pledges.\u201d This argument ignores the uncontradicted evidence and is contrary to settled law on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">A charitable subscription is governed by the law of contracts and must be supported by an offer, an acceptance, and consideration. <em>Galt </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 633, 635 (1853). And \u201ca subscription, like any other promise or offer, may be conditional. If particular terms are prescribed, these terms in themselves are conditions which must be complied with before the subscription is binding.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In the present case, there was valuable consideration to support a binding contract between the decedent and the school. The decedent\u2019s promise of a \u201cmatching\u201d or \u201cchallenge\u201d grant was relied on by school officials, who expended effort to solicit matching funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">But the contract as expressed in the letter of October 5, 1993, and evidenced by the school\u2019s subsequent conduct and statements, clearly and unambiguously included a condition, that is, the school was obligated to raise $100,000 during the 1993-94 fiscal year ending June 30, 1994. This the school failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The October 5 \u201crequest letter\u201d tied the request for a \u201cchallenge grant\u201d specifically to the \u201c1993-94 Annual Fund.\u201d The evidence plainly showed that the school operated on a fiscal year basis of July 1, 1993 to June 30, 1994, and that school officials considered the school had the \u201cresponsibility\u201d to match the pledge during that period. The fact that the school raised $212,000 by June 1995 did not satisfy the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Therefore, because the school failed to fulfill the condition, the contract is unenforceable, and the pledge is not binding on the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">The school raises two additional issues. First, it contends the trial court erred in refusing to apply the doctrine of promissory estoppel to these facts. We reject this contention. Today, we decide that the doctrine should not be adopted in Virginia. <em>W. J. Schafer Assoc., Inc. </em>v. <em>Cordant, Inc., </em>254 Va. 514, 493 S.E.2d 512 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Second, the school contends the trial court \u201cerred in failing to rule on the admissibility of\u201d an August 1992 letter from Mrs. Eichelbaum to her financial adviser, who was one of the executors, directing payment of \u201call signed commitments, in the form of a pledge, to charitable organizations.\u201d There is no merit to this contention. The recitals in the court\u2019s opinion letter and final order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>implicitly show that the court, sitting without a jury, considered the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Accordingly, we hold there is no error in the judgment from which this appeal is taken, and it will be</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
