The general work undertaken by the Phoenix Cheese Company at the time of the freezing was harvesting ice, and the claimant was employed solely for this purpose. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>He was asked, \u201cHow long have you worked for present employer ?\u201d and the answer was, \u201cJust filling their icehouse.\u201d Asked if he was doing\" his regular work when injured, the answer was, \u201cYes.\u201d It thus appears that the Phoenix Cheese Company employed the claimant for the single purpose of harvesting ice, and his special duty appears to have been the floating of the cakes of ice after they had been cut. In performing his work upon a day in December, when the mercury stood at 30 degrees below zero, he froze some of his fingers, and the Compensation Commission has awarded him $159.50. The Phoenix Cheese Company and the Zurich General Accident &amp; Liability Insurance Company, the insurance carrier, appeal from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Obviously this award cannot be sustained. The only subdivision of section 2 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act suggested as covering this case is subdivision 33, which names as one of the hazardous groups the \u201ccanning or preparation of fruit, vegetables, fish or foodstuffs; pickle factories and sugar refineries.\u201d The theory appears to be that the Phoenix Cheese Company (which we will assume is engaged in the preparation of foodstuffs) was the employer of the claimant, and that the harvesting of ice was incident to its business of preparing foodstuffs. What might be the law if the claimant was regularly employed in making cheese, and had been sent out into a freezing cold to assist in gathering a crop of ice, is not now before us. The record shows that he was employed for this special purpose, and was engaged in his regular occupation when the injury was sustained, and there is no suggestion in the statute that a common laborer engaged in harvesting ice is engaged in a hazardous occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\"><bracketnum>[2,3]</bracketnum> \u201cHazardous employment,\u201d as defined by section 3 of the act in question, \u201cmeans a work or occupation described in section 2 of this chapter\u201d; and section 2 provides that the \u201ccompensation provided for in this chapter shall be payable for injuries sustained or death incurred by employes engaged in the following hazardous employments.\u201d Among such employments there is no mention of harvesting ice, and the record conclusively shows that the claimant was not employed in \u201ccanning or preparation of fruit, vegetables, fish or foodstuffs; pickle factories and sugar refineries.\u201d He was at work at his regular employment of harvesting ice, and under well-established rules of construction the language of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law found in group 33 of section 2 cannot be stretched to cover this case. Hirst, the express mention of the matters embraced in the several groups necessarily excludes those not mentioned (Aultman &amp; Taylor Co. v. Syme, 163 N. Y. 54, 57, 57 N. E. 168, 79 Am. St. Rep. 565); and, second, the rule of ejusdem generis would prevent any general language to be extended beyond the special language used (People ex rel. Kinney v. White, 64 App. Div. 390, 392, 72 N. Y. Supp. 91; Lantry v. Mede, 127 App. Div. 557, 560, 111 N. Y. Supp. 833).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">The order appealed from should be reversed, and compensation denied. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
