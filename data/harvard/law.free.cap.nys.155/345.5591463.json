Defendant\u2019s counsel (to quote the record) \u201casked leave to read these two exhibits to the jury, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>court directed that they be handed to and read by the jury, and directed the defendant\u2019s attorney then to proceed with the testimony.\u201d Exception was duly taken to the refusal of the court to permit the exhibits to be read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">It cannot be assumed that the jury read the exhibits before the testimony was proceeded with, for the only possible motive for refusing to permit exhibits to be read to the jury by counsel during the trial would be to save time, and if the trial were stopped while each juryman perused the exhibits for- himself the time consumed would be many times multiplied. If, as is evidently the case, the jury were to take the exhibits with them to the jury room and read them during their deliberations, the court\u2019s action would seriously prejudice the defendant\u2019s rights. While theoretically a jury\u2019s judgment is reserved until the case is finally submitted', it is, of course, true that strong impressions are formed as the trial proceeds. It is the right of a party' to have the jury hear all of his evidence when the- evidence is received, for this tends to a better understanding of the case, and particularly to a fuller appreciation of all testimony subsequently brought out. Furthermore, there is no certainty that each juryman will read the exhibits after retiring to the jury room. Defendant\u2019s counsel was clearly within his rights in insisting upon reading these letters to the jury, and the court\u2019s ruling was erroneous and prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Judgment reversed,- and new trial ordered, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
