The documents attached to the alleged exemplified copy of the judgment show that the court had a seal, for the seal is affixed to them. The clerk, however, omitted to affix the seal to the exemplified copy of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">Defendant\u2019s objection thereto; although purely technical, was valid, and as, in the absence of this document, there was no evidence of a recovery o-f the judgment, the judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the' event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
