Rutkowsky v. Cohen, 74 App. Div. 415, 77 N. Y. Supp. 546; Sumkow v. Sheinker, 84 App. Div. 463, 82 N. Y. Supp. 995; Daus v. Nussberger, 25 App. Div. 185, 49 N. Y. Supp. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The fact that in his previous action for the same cause the plaintiff was dismissed, with costs against him, which costs are unpaid, is not a bar to a prosecution of his proposed action (section 461, Code of Civil Procedure); but such outcome of that action may properly be considered upon the essential question whether the petitioner has a good cause of action (section 460, Id.).
