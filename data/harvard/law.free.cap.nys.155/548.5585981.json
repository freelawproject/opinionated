Defendant, besides defending, counterclaimed for $10 motion costs. The judge awarded the defendant $3, thus in effect allowing plaintiff\u2019s claim. In 1913 defendant, over plaintiff\u2019s protest, passed an amendment to its by-laws which, inter alia, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201cA member who <em>leaves </em>Greater New York to establish himself in other cities,\u201d etc., \u201cshall remain a member. * * * However <em>the </em>member who is outside of Greater New York shall not receive sick benefits,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">In the agreed state of facts contained in the record, it is conceded that the plaintiff lived in Newark, both before and after he joined the society, and that the society knew this fact. It is not, therefore, necessary to decide whether the by-law is unreasonable, or violative of plaintiff\u2019s rights, since it does not apply to him, as he did not <em>leave </em>Greater New York. It is also admitted that defendant was always a member in good standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Upon the present state of the record the judgment should be affirmed, with $25 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
