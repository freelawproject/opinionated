While the employer was not responsible for the act of the receiver, he was, of course, answerable for his own act. The dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ages, however, should have been assessed by the jury. They were not a mere matter of computation. Plaintiff\u2019s salary in his new employment was $22 a week. He testified that he worked on the average only about three-quarters of the day; that \u201cI received about $16 and $17, because I worked three-quarters time\u201d; that he worked \u201cmostly three-quarters time.\u201d This indefinite testimony did not afford the basis for a mathematical computation of the damages by the court. The damages should have been assessed by the jury. That was what the jury was there for.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
