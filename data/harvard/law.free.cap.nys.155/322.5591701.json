Such a writ does not lie except to carry out a clear right that has been denied. The personal right of a director to inspect and examine the corporation books is unquestioned; and, because such corporate accounts may be often intricate and complicated, an accountant or:an attorney at law may aid the director in this investigation. People ex rel. Clason v. Nassau Ferry Co., 86 Hun, 128, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>33 N. Y. Supp. 244. From the first, defendants admitted this. However, the exercise of this right became inconvenient when the cemetery company closed its town office in the borough of the Bronx and removed its books to the cemetery office at Woodlands, in the town of Greenburgh, Westchester county, which involved a railroad journey of less than 20 miles from New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> This, however, did not authorize the relator to- delegate his official right and duty as director to the American Audit Company, and to subject the corporate books to the unchecked scrutiny of the Audit Company\u2019s employes. Where such inspection is internal, being in the line of a director\u2019s official acts, such scrutiny is a duty, because of the trust reposed in the director\u2019s fiduciary office and responsibility. Thompson on Corporations (2d Ed.) \u00a7 4520. But such a broad right cannot be entirely turned over to professional accountants, acting alone, who have not this responsibility, and over whom there is not the same judicial control. When defendants offered to exhibit the books to relator, \u201cassisted by any one person whom he may designate,\u201d they stated their legal duty (People ex rel. McInnes v. Columbia Bag Co., 103 App. Div. 208, 92 N. Y. Supp. 1084), and in such a proceeding were not obliged to turn over the corporate books to the Audit Company, as might possibly be required in a hostile proceeding for discovery, or under the power of visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">It is true that in such investigation by stockholders, on whom rests no duty to look at the books, they have been allowed to appoint an agent. State of Louisiana ex rel. Martin v. Bienville Oil Works Co., 28 La. Ann. 204. This was also permitted to the 1,300 dissatisfied members of a trade union, who obviously could not personally examine the society accounts. Norey v. Keep, [1909] 1 Chan. 561. But even there the examining accountant had in advance to undertake that the data obtained should only be used for informing his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">While a director may properly use professional aid to familiarize himself with the accounts, still it is the director, as a corporate official, who himself makes the search through the corporate books. In cases like that at bar, his responsibility cannot be left wholly to a firm of accountants.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The order is therefore reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the relator\u2019s application denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
