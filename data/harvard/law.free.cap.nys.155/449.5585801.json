All that it is material to show before that time is that some profits have been realized, but it would be contrary to the rule uniformly applied in such cases to permit in advance of an interlocutory judgment an examination as to the amount of such profits. As to the so-called guaranty agreement we are unable at present to see that it merits the importance which plaintiff attributes to it. Whether any sum which may have been paid under such a guaranty is to be considered as profits under plaintiff\u2019s agreement is a question of law, to be determined before defendant is called upon to show how much was so paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">The order appealed from will be modified, so as to limit the examination under it to the bare question whether any profits were realized from the contracts described in the complaint, and, as so modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to appellant. Settle order on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
