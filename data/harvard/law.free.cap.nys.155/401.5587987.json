The policy of $3,000 taken out by the decedent was payable \u201cto his wife, Jane S. Corwin, if living; otherwise, to' his legal representatives.\u201d The court found that the word \u201cassigns\u201d was omitted therefrom. A stipulation, which was agreed upon as the sole source of proof, showed that decedent\u2019s said wife predeceased him, rhat the accountant is his daughter, only heir, and next of kin, that she lived with the decedent until his death, that decedent died without real property, possessed of personalty, aside from the proceeds of the insurance, of but $1,479.69, and that decedent was not a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">We think that this conclusion may be sustained by the authority of Griswold v. Sawyer, 125 N. Y. 411, 26 N. E. 464. Cullen, J., in Leonard v. Harney, 173 N. Y. 352-354, 66 N. E. 2, said that the principal ground, as \u201cvery clearly pointed out by Judge Earl in the case of Gris-wold v. Sawyer,\u201d upon which! Griswold v. Sawyer was decided, was the omission of the word \u201cassigns\u201d in the policy. Other considerations like unto some of those which moved the court in Griswold v. Sawyer may be urged in this case, such as the general purpose of life insurance, the financial condition of the decedent, as revealed at his death, the' existence of a wife and of a daughter, who resided with him, and the fact that decedent was not a lawyer. We see no reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>for disturbance of. the court\u2019s disposition of the item in her accounts for 'funeral expenses, in thei absence of cross-examination of the accountant, and of any evidence offered as to- the unreasonableness of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of Kings County is affirmed, with costs to the respondent, payable out of the estate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
