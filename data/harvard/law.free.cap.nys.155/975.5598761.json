Shalek against the Jetter Brewing Company, impleaded with others. From an order sustaining a demurrer to the answer, defendants appeal. Affirmed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1007-13\">The opinion of Shearn, J., at Special Term, is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1007-14\">It has already been held that this action \u201cis in the nature of a creditors\u2019 bill, a search and trace by a diligent .[uilgment creditor for, and the enforcement of an equitable lien upon, the assets of the corporation that have been distributed by the trustees in violation of law.\u2019\u2019 3.55 N. Y. Supp. 972. The complaint alleged that of this illegal distribution a sum sufficient to satisfy plaintiff\u2019s judgment remains in the hands of the directors, and it is upon such funds that the action seeks to enforce a lien. It is now alleged as a defense by the defendant Jetter, one of the directors, that at the time of the transfer by the corporation of ail of its assets a fund amounting to $40,-000 was set aside and specially deposited as a trust fund for the purpose of paying debts of and claims against the corporation, and for a long time thereafter sufficient funds remained of such amount, more than enough to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>cover the claim of the plaintiff, but that during all' of said time the plaintiff failed to present his claim, although he was aware of the creation and the existence of the fund, and that by this alleged negligence and these alleged laches plaintiff has lost his rights. It is not alleged that the vendee assumed payment of the debt, or that it set aside the alleged fund. The directors could not relieve themselves of personal liability by going through the form of \u201csetting aside a fund.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1008-5\">What constituted the alleged \u201csetting aside\u201d of a fund? Where was it \u25a0 deposited, and with whom and under what conditions? What became of the fund? It is not alleged that the so-called fund was withdrawn from deposit only after notice to the creditors. If the creation of such a fund amounted to anything, it could only be by making the deposit under such terms as precluded the withdrawal of the fund upon notice to all creditors. To set aside a fund for the purpose of paying debts, but without paying them, is no defense against a creditor whose judgment has been made worthless by the sale of all of the debtor\u2019s property without notice and the division of the proceeds among the stockholders and directors. .The case of Darcy v. Brooklyn &amp; N. Y. Ferry Co., 196 N. Y. 99, 89 N. E. 461, 26 L. R. A. (N. S.) 267, 134 Am. St. Rep. 827, makes it clear that directors who sell and tranfer the assets of their company without taking the steps provided by the General Corporation Law and the Stock Corporation Law do so at their peril. The plea that directors may interpose alleged negligence in presenting^ a claim short of the statutory period of six years as an excuse for their misconduct needs no consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1008-6\">The demurrer to the separate defense in the amended answer is sustained, with costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1008-7\">Argued before INGRAHAM, P.
