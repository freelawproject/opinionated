Hence, when the $1,000 was paid in November, 1910, it was in full of the bonus on the lease from May 1, 1910, to May 1, 1911. A new year began May 1, 1911, and one month of it had expired on June 1st. Hence plaintiff was entitled to but one-twelfth of $1,000\u2014that is, $83.33\u2014and four months\u2019 rent, $400, on which was paid $200 February 7th, leaving balance of $283.33, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-25\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, costs to abide the event, unless within 20 days plaintiff stip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>ulates to reduce the verdict in accordance with this memorandum, and in which event the judgment is affirmed, without costs to either party.
