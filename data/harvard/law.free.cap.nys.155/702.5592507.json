J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmK\">The employer and insurance carrier stand neutral upon this question. All parties simply desire an interpretation of the law, that it may be determined to whom the moneys allotted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>infant children of the deceased shall be paid. Section 16 of the Compensation Act provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-3\">\u201cThe compensation known as a death benefit shall be payable in the amount and to or for the benefit of the following persons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\">\u201c2. If there be a surviving wife * * * thirty per centum of <em>the </em>average wages of the deceased during widowhood, * * * and if there be surviving child or children of the deceased under the age of eighteen years, <em>the additional amount </em>of ten per centum of such wages for each such child until the age of eighteen years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">This provision of the statute would seem to authorize the payment to the wife, not only of her 30 per cent., but of <em>the additional amount </em>which is allotted for the support of the several children. This conclusion is supported by the provision of section 20 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, as amended by Laws 1915, c. 167, which authorizes the wife, as the principal dependent, to make an agreement with the employer, subject to the approval of the Commission, as to the payment of the award both to herself and for her children. There is no other provision in the act as to the payment of the award to infant children, and it does not seem probable that it was the intention of the Legislature to require the appointment of a general guardian, with an attendant expense, in order to enable the children to collect the amounts alloted to them under the act. Under Domestic Relations Law (Consol. Laws, c. 14) \u00a7 80, in regard to real estate, if there be no general guardian, the mother is the general guardian of the infants. This law by analogy tends to support the construction thus given. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
