It may be that the defendant\u2019s exception did not raise a question of law. Upon that question we now express no opinion. The verdict, however, is a large one, and this court is entitled to consider and pass upon the question whether or not it is excessive. It may be that the character of the summing up by counsel would throw light on that question, and, whether or not defendant\u2019s exception raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>any legal question, it might be considered as a protest against the substance and manner of the summation, and forestall any suggestion that the objection thereto was an afterthought.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion to allow amendment granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
