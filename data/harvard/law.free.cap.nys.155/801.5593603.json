Kingsley for compensation to himself for personal injury, opposed by William F. Donovan, employer, and the Fidelity &amp; Casualty Company of New York, insurer. Compensation was awarded, and the employer and the insurer appeal. Award affirmed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b834-4\">This is an appeal by the employer and insurance carrier from an award of the State Compensation Commission. The facts are stated in finding 2 of the Commission, as follows: On said date, and for some time prior thereto, said Kingsley had come to his work on a motorcycle, which was owned by himself, and had used the said motorcycle for going to and from jobs, with the knowledge and consent of his employer, but was not paid extra for the use of the motorcycle by the employer. On said date he arrived at his employer\u2019s place of business at 7 a. m. to start work, and placed his motorcycle against a tree on the property adjoining the premises of his employer, and started to clean the clutch, so that the machine might be in proper working order for the day. While so doing he caught his fingers in the chain guard, which resulted in the traumatic amputation of the distal phalanges of the first and second fingers of the right hand. The Commission also finds that the injuries arose out of and in the course of his employment. This finding of fact is attacked as against the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b834-5\">Argued before SMITH, P.

KELLOGG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUcb\">The appellants contend that the accident was not one arising out of and in the course of the employment. There is some evidence tending to prove those facts, and under sections 20 and 21 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law the decision of the Commission is conclusive upon the facts. Clearly, if the bicycle was only used for the convenience of the claimant in bringing him to and from his place of work, the case would not be within the act. But the evidence shows that from time to time it was used in the business in going to and from the work off the premises, and that at other times, when it had been cared for during working hours, no question had been raised by the employer. It could not be used in the business, unless kept in proper condition. The fact that the workman was engaged upon it near the place of .business and during business hours, and that it was frequently used in the business, do not make the findings of the Commission unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">The award is therefore affirmed. All concur, except SMITH, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
