The rails used by it were the ordinary 80-pound T-rails in common use by steam railroads. At street crossings there was placed inside its main rail another T-rail to serve the purpose of a guard rail. In order to reduce the open space between the heads of the main and guard rails, a portion of the base of one of the rails was chiseled off. The rails were then bolted together in order to make a rigid construction, and were spiked to the ties. Hiere was thus left between the heads of the rails a space of 1 <em>y2 </em>inches wide and about 4 inches deep. Through this space, which had been tilled with gravel to within 1 <em>y2 </em>or 2 inches, or thereabouts, of the surface of the rails, the flange of the car wheel ran. The street crossing between the guard rails and for a space of 2 feet outside the main rail was paved with brick, which were fitted tightly against the rails. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the plaintiff was driving across the defendant\u2019s tracks at a street crossing, one of the calks of the horse\u2019s shoe became wedged in the space between the main rail and the guard rail, and the foot was so- badly injured as to: render the horse practically valueless. The complaint charged negligence upon the part of the defendant in maintaining Trails at street crossings in violation of the statute forbidding the use of center bearing rails, in failing to suitably cover or guard the opening between the main and guard rails, and in failing to use grooved rails.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\">Section 192 of the Railroad Law (Consol. Laws, c. 49; Laws 1910, c. 481), formerly section 109, Laws 1892, c. 676, provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\">\u201cNo street surface railroad corporation shall hereafter lay down in the streets of any incorporated city or village of this state what are known as \u2018center bearing\u2019 rails, but in all cases, whether in laying new track or in replacing old rails, shall lay down \u2018grooved\u2019 or some other kind of rail not \u2018center, bearing,\u2019 approved by the local authorities. Such groved or other rail shall be of such shape and so laid as to permit the paving stones to come in close contact with the projection which serves to guide the flange to the car wheel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The question as to whether T-rails are \"what are known as \u2018center bearing\u2019 rails\u201d was sharply contested upon the trial. The civil engineer called by the plaintiff testified that a T-rail was a-\u201ccenter bearing\u201d rail, and not a groove or girder rail. The expert witness called by the defendant testified that neither the T-rail nor the girder rail is known to engineers as a \u201ccenter bearing\u201d rail, but that a rail for a two-flange wheel is tire rail known as a \u201ccenter bearing\u201d rail. It appeared that two accidents of a similar nature had occurred at this crossing within the preceding three or four months. The T-rail, as well as the groove rail, were exhibited to the jury, and the situation at the crossing fully described.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">At the close of the evidence the defendant moved for a nonsuit upon the grounds, among others, that there was no evidence to justify a jury in finding, that the accident was caused through the negligence of the defendant, and that it affirmatively appeared that the type of rail used by the defendant was not an improper construction. The court granted the nonsuit, remarking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">\u201cI think that is so. That is the question that is in my mind. The question is whether that is a center bearing rail. I am satisfied in my mind as to what I should do; that this is not a center bearing rail. If it was a center bearing rail, it would alter the proposition. I see no negligence in this case, and there is no question for the jury, and the motion is granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">To this ruling the plaintiff excepted. We think that under the evidence it was a question of fact for the jury whether a T-rail was ordinarily known as a center bearing rail; also as to whether the defendant was negligent in maintaining such a construction at this crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">The judgment should therefore be.reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to: abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">KELLOGG, HOWARD, and WOODWARD, JJ, concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"pAYFZ\">SMITH, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOK3\">(concurring in result). The experts have differed as to what, technically speaking, is a center bearing rail. From a read<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>ing of the entire statute, however, it is apparent that the rail prescribed is a rail to which the pavement cannot be laid up1 plumb upon both sides. As this combination of rails permits of the construction which seems to be contemplated by statute as the proper construction, in my judgment the jury should not be allowed to say whether or not this is technically a center bearing rail; but the court should hold as matter of law that the requirement of the statute in that respect had been observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\">These rails were so shaped and placed together at such distance as to permit the calk of the horse\u2019s shoe to become wedged in and cause this injury. Whether this constituted negligent construction would, in my judgment, be a question for the jury, and the only question which should be submitted to the jury in determining the defendant\u2019s liability.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
