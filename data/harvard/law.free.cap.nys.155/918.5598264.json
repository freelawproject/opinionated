The learned Special Term was of opinion that there are certain defects in the complaint which required denial of the motion, adding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-15\">\u201cUpon the argument of the demurrer all defects may be pointed out and permission given to amend, but this motion has no such purpose in view.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">The defects specified in the opinion of the Special Term, or at least some of them, are in our opinion grave enough to justify an affirmance of the order. In Posner v. Rosenberg, 153 App. Div. 249, 137 N. Y. Supp. 1084, we decided when the plaintiff had moved for judgment on the pleadings, which was denied, that in tire absence of a counter motion on the defendant\u2019s part the demurrer still stood, and thereby an issue of law was raised which could only be disposed of by trial\u2014citing Ventriniglia v. Eichner, 138 App. Div. 274, 122 N. Y. Supp. 966; Zeikus v. Florida East Coast Ry. Co., 70 Misc. Rep. 339, 128 N. Y. Supp. 931, affirmed 144 App. Div. 91, 128 N. Y. Supp. 933. Ventriniglia\u2019s Case, supra, was also approved by us in Jamaica Water Supply Co. v. Hill, 157 App. Div. 894, 142 N. Y. Supp. 1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-17\">We have concluded, therefore, no.t to discuss the merits of the decision at Special Term. And, inasmuch as upon this appeal we could not afford any affirmative relief to the respondent upon its demurrer, there is no reason why now we should discuss the merits thereof. The trial of the demurrer will afford a full hearing upon the pleadings. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>plaintiff could have avoided the burden of such an additional hearing by procedure indicated in Schwartz v. Williams, 153 App. Div. 302, 137. N. Y. Supp. 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The parties hereto having stipulated in open court that this case may he disposed of by a court of four, the decision is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
