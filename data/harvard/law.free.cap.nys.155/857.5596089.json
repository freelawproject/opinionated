KELLOGG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQrb\">Unquestionably the deceased met his death while in the employment. A freight elevator was used sometimes by the employ\u00e9s in going from floor to floor, especially when carrying merchandise or freight, and the deceased frequently used it. The Commission has found that he accidentally fell down the shaft and was killed. He was found at the bottom of the shaft. It also finds that he was employed as a porter and shipping clerk, and that one of his incidental duties was to operate the elevator when he had occasion to use it. It also finds that the employers were engaged in the business of selling glassware.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">The employers\u2019 first report describes their business as a glass-selling agency. The employers\u2019 affidavit, attached to the proof of loss, in answer to the question, \u201cWhat is the kind of character of the business conducted?\u201d answers, \u201cMfrs. of glassware.\u201d But the finding of the Commission that the employers were engaged in the business of selling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>glassware, in connection with the evidence, establishes conclusively that they were not manufacturers of glass, but sellers of glass only, and therefore the case does not come within group 20 of section 2 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. The employ\u00e9 was not engaged in a hazardous business within the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, unless the business falls within group 41 of that section, which embraces:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-5\">\u201cThe operation, otherwise than on tracks, on streets, highways, or elsewhere, of cars, trucks, wagons or other vehicles, and rollers and engines propelled by steam, gas, gasoline, electric, mechanical or other power or drawn by horses or mules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">There was no elevator man, but the elevator was used in the business by the different employ\u00e9s from time to time. The serious question is whether it was a \u201cvehicle,\u201d within the meaning of group 41. Clearly it was a means of carrying persons and things, and falls fairly within the definition of a vehicle. There seems to- be no good reason why cars, trucks, and wagons, propelled in the manner mentioned in that group, should be included, and an elevator excluded. They are all vehicles for the carrying of persons and things. It cannot be urged that an elevator is excepted by the expression \u201cotherwise than on tracks.\u201d There are guides upon each side of the elevator to keep it plumb and to facilitate its operation, but it cannot be said to be operated upon tracks within the meaning of that section. If such a construction were to be given, the reasoning, would force it into group 1, which includes the operation of railways operated by steam, electric, or other motive power, street railways, and incline railways. The elevator is operated by the power mentioned in group- 41, and a liberal construction of the statute brings it within that group. Group 1 and 41 seem to embrace the operation of every kind of a vehicle by steam, electric, or other motive power.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">The award should therefore be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
