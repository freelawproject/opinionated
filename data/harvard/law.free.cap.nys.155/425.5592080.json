Plaintiff drew a bill ol: exchange upon a corporation, which duly accepted it and thereafter defendants indorsed it. It was not paid at maturity, though it remained in plaintiff\u2019s hands. <em>Held, </em>that defendants, as indorsers, were not liable, their liability being secondary to that of plaintiff the drawer; the person on whom it was drawn after acceptance being primarily liable, and the drawer being the one next liable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b457-8\">[Ed.

There is no allegation of any special or collateral agreement on the part of defendants, the payees and indorsers of the bill, so that the bald question presented by the pleading is whether the drawer of a bill of exchange, upon its dishonor, may recover from the payees, who have indorsed it before maturity.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-19\">. Section 111 of the Negotiable Instruments Law provides, as to the liability of the drawer of such an instrument, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>\u201cIf it be dishonored and the necessary proceedings on dishonor be duly taken, he will pay the amount thereof to the holder, or to any subsequent indorser who may be compelled to pay it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Thus, upon acceptance, a bill .of exchange becomes in effect a promissory note; the acceptor standing in the place of the maker and becoming primarily liable, and the maker standing in the place of a first indorser. So upon the face of the drafts in suit Ernst Wiener &amp; Co. became primarily and the plaintiff secondarily liable to defendants. When the acceptor defaulted in payment, plaintiff\u2019s obligation arose, and when it acquired title to the note its liability was extinguished, because it was both debtor and creditor; but .this did not create any liability on the part of these defendants as original payees and indorsers. Plaintiff relies, to sustain its judgment, on Piad dock, Blanchard &amp; Co. v. Haddock, 192 N. Y. 499, 85 N. E. 682, 19 L. R. A. (N. S.) 136. That case, however, is not applicable. The bill of exchange therein considered was drawn by plaintiffs to their own order, and the case turned upon a collateral agreement by the defendant to become liable in case the draft was dishonored. No such agreement was alleged in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> A letter was read in evidence, signed, \u201cErnst Wiener &amp; Co., Charles W. Tallcott, Treas.,\u201d reciting that the company accepted plaintiff\u2019s proposition to take \u201c60-day acceptances,\u201d provided that \u201cour Messrs. Wiener and Tallcott indorse the said notes.\u201d This letter was not admissible, not having been pleaded, and its meaning is not entirely clear. It does not purport to- be an agreement on the part of Tallcott and Wiener individually, and is not signed by the latter in any capacity. Whatever may be the fact as to any collateral agreement on the part of defendants, none was alleged, and the complaint was therefore insufficient so far as concerns the bill of exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">As to the note sued upon the only'defense is that notice of dishonor was not properly given to defendants. We think that, under the circumstances, the notice was properly given. The result is that the judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event, and the findings numbered \u201cV\u201d and \u201cXIX\u201d reversed, unless plaintiff stipulates to reduce the judgment by the amount recovered upon the two bills of exchange, in which case the judgment, as reduced, will be affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
