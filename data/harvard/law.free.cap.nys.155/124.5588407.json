Defendant has had repeated extensions of time to comply with the order. That nevertheless, in July, defendant urged that he could not particularize the commissions and the names of his customers so lost, argues that such items are not provable. Such prolonged failure to obey the order for a bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>of particulars requires, as matter of course, an order to preclude. McKenna v.
