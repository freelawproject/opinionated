Laws, c. 23, \u00a7 6]), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number><em>\u201cNo </em>certificate of incorporation of a proposed, corporation having the same name as a corporation authorized to do business under the laws of this state, or a name so nearly resembling it as to be calculated to deceive, shall be filed or recorded in any office for the purpose of effecting its incorporation, or of authorizing it to do business in this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The plaintiff was incorporated under the laws of New York on the 3d day of February, 1888, and it was found by the trial court that the words \u201cMaterial Men\u2019s\u201d were first used in a corporate title by it. Ever since its incorporation the plaintiff has been actively engaged in business in the city of New York in making mercantile credit reports on building contractors and others engaged in building operations, and it originated and has annually compiled, copyrighted, and issued to its customers and to others a book known as \u201cThe Association\u2019s Book,\u201d containing ratings on those engaged in building operations, and has adopted for use in its business and uses blank forms or requisitions printed on paper of distinctive different colors.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The trial court also found, on evidence sustaining it, that at the time of the trial the plaintiff\u2019s annual book had reached the twenty-sixth edition, and has been and is now furnished to a great number of subscribers, and that there is great demand therefor; that owing to the care, skill, and experience exercised by the plaintiff, its business has become very extensive; that the plaintiff has expended large sums of money in advertising its business and securing subscribers; that it has in conducting its business from 12 to- 15 employes, and has acquired a valuable good will and reputation for honesty and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The defendant was' incorporated under the laws of New York on October 20, 1913, for conducting a business similar to that conducted by plaintiff and in the same locality. At that time, and for a long time prior thereto, the plaintiff\u2019s office had been at 41 Park Row, borough of Manhattan, New York. The defendant established and maintains an office at 66 Broadway in the same borough. When the action was commenced, the defendant was actively engaged in competing with the plaintiff in business; the only substantial difference being that for service in some respects more extended than that for which the plaintiff was charging from $50 to $90 per annum the defendant solicited business at the rate of $15 per annum. The defendant also issues annually a book under the same title as. that of the plaintiff, and containing similar information and blank forms, also quite similar to those issued by the plaintiff. The trial court found, on evidence sustaining it, that the defendant is engaged in a business similar to that of the plaintiff, and is competing with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Prior to the commencement of the action, which was seven months after the incorporation of the defendant, the defendant solicited business from one of the plaintiff\u2019s subscribers, and continued to solicit business from plaintiff\u2019s customers. There is no evidence that the plaintiff has lost any business or customers to the defendant, owing to the similarity of the corporate names; but the evidence shows that some of plaintiff\u2019s customers have been misled by the similarity of the names into believing that business solicited by the defendant was solicited by the plaintiff, and into believing that an extension of the business of the defendant beyond that conducted by the plaintiff, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>which the defendant offered to furnish legal services to its customers, was made by the plaintiff. In behalf of the plaintiff, evidence was given tending to show that the words \u201cMaterial Men\u2019s,\u201d in connection with mercantile credit reports, had acquired a secondary meaning, as designating the plaintiff; but this evidence was not conclusive, and the court refused to find the fact as claimed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff conducted its business in its corporate name, but it was also referred to and known in the trade by the shorter name, \u201cMaterial Men\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It may be that the evidence on this point was insufficient to establish a secondary meaning which entitles the plaintiff to the exclusive right to use those words in the mercantile credit report business, but in the view we take of the case we do not deem it necessary to review the evidence to determine whether or not it sustains the finding. The long period during which the plaintiff was established and conducted its business, and became more or less known to the trade as the \u201cMaterial Men\u2019s,\u201d entitles it to protection against the incorporation of and competition from a rival under a name so similar as to be likely to mislead the public. In one sense, the corporate name adopted by the defendant may be said to be practically identical with that of the plaintiff; the only difference being in prefixing the name \u201cNew York,\u201d and in a substitution of the word \u201cIncorporated\u201d for the word \u201cLimited,\u201d following the name.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> Inasmuch as the plaintiff contemplated conducting business in New York, and had so conducted it for upwards of 25 years, it became and was, in effect, the New York Material Men\u2019s Mercantile Association, which is the name adopted by the defendant. Although the name \u201cNew York\u201d was not in the corporate name of the plaintiff/ it is manifest that, since it conducted its business in New York City, it became known as the New York Material Men\u2019s Mercantile Association. It was not necessary for the defendant so nearly to copy the plaintiff\u2019s corporate name, annual book, and forms. The business it intended to conduct could have been described equally well by another name, which would have distinguished the two corporations and would have prevented confusion. The use of so similar a name, in the circumstances, fairly warrants the inference that it was selected by those who incorporated the defendant for the purpose of obtaining some benefit or advantage from the good will of the plaintiff\u2019s long-established and successful business.

Mallory (Or.) 147 Pac. 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Neither company was engaged in manufacturing, or had a plant or place of business other than an office. The business of each evidently was principally conducted by soliciting agents. The different locations of the offices would not insure against confusion. The business and method of conducting it, therefore, render confusion between the two- corporations probable, if not inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The court cannot change tire corporate name of the defendant, but its incorporation in violation of the statute herein quoted, under a name so similar to that of the plaintiff as to be calculated to- deceive, does not protect it in the right to conduct business under that name as against the right of the plaintiff, whose business it is quite plain it may obtain, and it is highly probable that it will obtain. People ex rel. Columbia Co., v. O\u2019Brien, 101 App. Div. 296, 91 N. Y. Supp. 649; Corning Glass Works v. Corning Cut Glass Works, 197 N. Y. 173, 90 N. E. 449. It is quite probable that the secretary of state was misled by the prefix of the name \u201cNew York,\u201d and did not discover that the plaintiff had been incorporated under identically the same name with the exception of the prefix. The courts have often had occasion to decide, in cases of infringement and unfair competition, whether the addition of a prefix or suffix is sufficient to distinguish one name from another and prevent deception, and it has usually been held that it is not, and that prior adoption and use entitles a corporation to protection against the use by a rival of a name so similar that it is calculated to mislead the public.
