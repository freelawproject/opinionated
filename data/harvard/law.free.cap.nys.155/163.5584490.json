The court deducted from that, however, the amount of taxable costs which had been paid by the plaintiffs to the defendant. Such a deduction seems to&gt; be entirely unwarranted. Brooks v.

Supp. 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The order must therefore be modified, by fixing the amount to be paid by the surety on the undertaking at the sum of $250, and, as thus modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
