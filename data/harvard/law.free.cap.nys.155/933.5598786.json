The injunction, in so far as it is mandatory,- in requiring him to restore the property to the condition in which it was before the acts complained of, is unauthorized by the evidence or the findings as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">The judgment appealed from is therefore modified accordingly, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs in this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
