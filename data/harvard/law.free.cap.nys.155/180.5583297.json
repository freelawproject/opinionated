Proc. \u00a7 308, the allowance to counsel assigned to defend one arraigned charged with a capital offense is to be on the certificate of the judge or justice \u201cpresiding at the trial or otherwise disposing of the indictment.\u201d In this case the justice who took the plea o,f guilty of murder in the second degree, which he afterwards let the defendant withdraw, did not dispose of the indictment, but left it to be tried on the substituted plea of not guilty. Doubtless the court in. which the action was finally disposed of can make an allowance to duly assigned counsel for services in defense, even if only partial and followed by substitution of other counsel, if the aggregate allowance does not exceed $500. But here'the justice, who did not dispose of the indictment, rightly denied appellant\u2019s application for allowance, for want of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-17\">The order is therefore affirmed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
