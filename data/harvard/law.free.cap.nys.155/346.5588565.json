How the plaintiff could believe that his creditor, holding notes for $300 long overdue, would accept his further note for $200 in full settlement, is not apparent or explained. It suffices, however, to say that, assuming the other elements in an action for fraud and deceit were established, there was no proof of damage, except to a nominal amount. The entry of judgment and issue of execution thereon against the property of one who is judgment proof does not establish damage to the amount of the judgment entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with $30 costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
