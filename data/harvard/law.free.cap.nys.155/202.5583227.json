One of the decisive issues volved was the question whether the goods were sold, if at all, by the defendant personally, or by him as agent for the Grafton Roller Mill Company. The learned judge below instructed the jury that the contract was with defendant as matter of law. Defendant testified repeatedly that he told plaintiff that he was acting solely as a middleman or agent for the Grafton Roller Mill Company. Two- copies of a paper were put in evidence. Had these been filled out, and been properly executed by both parties, they might have constituted a contract; but they were only partially filled out. Passing that objection, however, the defendant admitted that the words \u201cThe Grafton Roller Mill Company,\u201d printed in the body of both papers, had been stricken out by him, and his own name written in in place thereof. The signature on the copy produced by the plaintiff has the name of the company erased, as also- the word \u201cSalesman,\u201d leaving the signature as that of the plaintiff personally. The copy produced by the defendant is signed, \u201cThe Grafton Roller'Mill Company, Seller, by Oberman, Salesman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-20\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Assuming the papers to- represent a contract, the signature on defendant\u2019s copy would, if defendant had authority to act, concerning which there seems- to be no dispute, have bound the company notwithstanding its name did not appear in the body of the contract. See' Electric Carriage, etc., Co. v. Herman, 67 Misc. Rep. 394, 123 N. Y. Supp. 231. Defendant testified that he had not stricken out the corporate name on plaintiff\u2019s copy, and contended that that had been done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>by the plaintiff. From every point of view, therefore, there was a sharp issue for the jury to determine, in respect of whether the defendant or the Grafton Roller Mill Company had made whatever contract was entered into. The existence o E the issue was emphasized by correspondence introduced in evidence by the defendant between plaintiff and the Mill Company subsequent to the alleged breach oE thcr contract, in which, among other things, plaintiff writes, \u201cOctober 23d, Oberman sold me for <em>your account\u201d </em>goods in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">As due exception was taken to the court\u2019s charge above referred to,, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
