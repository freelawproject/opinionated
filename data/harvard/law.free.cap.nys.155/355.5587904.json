The evidence adduced in support of the alleged contract was a telephone conversation of the plaintiff\u2019s general manager with a Mr. Jordan, who was a member of the defendant club and a member of its house committee, in which Jordan is said to have inquired the costs of such inspection and recommendations, and, on being informed that the work would cost $100, ordered that it be done. Two' men in the employ of the plaintiff company inspected the club house, accompanied by Jordan and another member of the house committee, and a report and estimate for performing the work recommended in the report were sent to the club. Jordan denied the conversation concerning the payment of $100, or any other sum, for the inspection, and claimed that the defendant merely made an estimate for the work of installing a fire alarm service outfit at the club, and that the estimate was too high, and was never or acted</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant moved for a dismissal of the complaint for failure to prove that Mr. Jordan had any authority to make a contract binding upon the Montauk Club. As the record is barren of any evidence of such authority in Mr. Jordan, the motion should have been granted. The house committee of a social club is a special agent, and not authorized to bind the club generally by its contracts. Mr. Jordan was only one of five members of the house <em>committee, </em>and had no apparent authority to- bind the club in any way. The plaintiff coiild not recover without proof of such authority.
