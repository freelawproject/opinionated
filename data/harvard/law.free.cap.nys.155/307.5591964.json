The latter case had been begun the afternoon before, and was ultimately finished on the day of the default. These circumstances having been adequately presented by a sufficient affidavit, the case should have been held until the termination of the trial in the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-19\">Order reversed, and default opened without terms, and without costs of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
