As formulated in the petition the principal charge is that :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">\u201cIn December, 1913, the respondent, in violation of section 120 of the Penal Law, inserted an advertisement in the program of the Negro Civic League Banquet held December 19, 1913, reading as follows: \u2018Telephone 5806 Barclay. Residence Phono 5372 Harlem. Large accident, matrimonial and criminal actions a specialty. All matters strictly confidential. Samuel K. Newman, Lawyer, 281 Broadway, New York. A white lawyer who is a colored man\u2019s friend. Indorsed by leaders of the community. Has estimable record in all courts.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">It was also charged that the respondent had previously placed the same or a similar advertisement in the Amsterdam News, a weekly paper published in the city of New York and devoted to the interests of the colored race. The repeated publication of an advertisement in the Amsterdam News was admitted, and copies of the advertisement were received in evidence. This advertisement read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">\u201cSamuel E. Newman,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\">\u201cA white lawyer who is a colored man\u2019s friend. Indorsed by leaders of the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-13\">\u201c2G1 Broadway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-14\">\u201cAccident, criminal and matrimonial actions a specialty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-15\">\u201cSuite 609. Tel. 6800 Barclay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-16\">\u201cResidence 2094 Fifth Avenue (near 129th St.). Res. tel. 5372 Harlem.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-17\">It appeared quite clearly that the use of the word \u201clarge\u201d in the program was due to a printer\u2019s error. The copy or dummy from which that program was printed contained the word, preceding the words \u201caccident, matrimonial and criminal actions,\u201d but was intended merely as a direction as to the size of type tO' be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-18\">Much evidence was taken as to whether or not the publication of the advertisement in the program of the Negro Civic League Banquet was by the procurement and consent of the respondent. Upon this question the official referee does not express an opinion, unless one may be inferred from the fact that in his report he accepts the statements of respondent that the advertisement was inserted without his knowledge and ignores the evidence of all the other witnesses to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-19\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> A careful reading of the evidence inclines us t\u00f3 a different opinion, but the determination of that question is unimportant, in the face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>of the admitted insertion by the respondent of a similar advertisement in the Amsterdam News. What we have to determine is whether or not such insertion constituted professional misconduct. The petitioner charges, and now insists, that the publication of this advertisement was a violation of section 120 of the Penal Law, which reads as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-3\">\u201cSection 120. <em>Advertising to procure divorces. </em>Whoever prints, publishes, distributes or circulates, or causes to be printed, published, distributed or circulated any circular, pamphlet, card, hand bill, advertisement, 'printed paper, book, newspaper or notice of any kind offering to procure or to aid in procuring any divorce \u25a0 or the severance, dissolution, or annulment of any marriage, * * * either in this state or elsewhere, is guilty of a misdemeanor. This section shall not apply to the printing or publishing of any notice or advertisement required or authorized by any law of this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The first question to be considered is whether or not tire respondent\u2019s advertisement that he made a specialty of matrimonial actions was a violation of this statute. We think it was. It is true that he did not offer, in precise terms, \u201cto procure or to aid in procuring\u201d divorces, or the severance, dissolution, or annulment of marriages; but such is, as we think, the clear purport of his reference to \u201cmatrimonial actions.\u201d In common parlance, and in the minds of such persons as were designed to- be reached by such an advertisement, \u201cmatrimonial actions\u201d mean actions 'for 'a divorce or separation, and when a lawyer advertises that he malees a specialty of such actions, what would be conveyed to the ordinary reader, and what was undoubtedly intended to be conveyed, was that he made-a specialty of divorce and separation actions, and offered his services to institute such actions. Section 120 of the Penal Law was enacted to- meet an abuse that had become a scandal, and we are unwilling to hold that it may be evaded by avoiding the use of the particular words used in framing the section, while using words which are intended to and inevitably must convey the same meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> But even if we should be of the opinion expressed by the official referee that the publication of the advertisement in question did not amount to a crime under section 120 of the Penal Law, still the respondent in publishing that advertisement was guilty of professional misconduct which cannot be allowed to pass unnoticed. \u201cThe admission of attorneys and counselors at law to- practice, the censure, suspension from practice, and removal from office, depend, not upon the commission of a crime, but upon the character of the applicant for admission and the method in which the attorney and counselor at law has performed his duties after his admission.\u201d Per Ingraham, P. J., in Matter of Rouss, 162 App. Div. 496, 503, 147 N. Y. Supp. 713, 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">For a lawyer to advertise for business has long been recognized by the profession at large as grossly undignified and improper, 'and has been distinctly condemned by the twenty-seventh canon of the Code of Ethics adopted generally by the Bar Associations ,o-f this country, and specifically adopted by the New York State Bar Association o-n January 28, 1909. While this' Code has never been incorporated into our statutes, it has been so far recognized by the Supreme Court that a general rule of practice requires that a copy of the Code shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>furnished to each lawyer upon his admission tg the bar.. Not only has the respondent repeatedly violated this rule of ethics, but he has undertaken so cunningly to phrase his advertisement as to violate in spirit and in effect, if not in words, a distinct statutory provision adopted to meet an acknowledged evil.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">We arc unwilling- to lend our countenance to the violation by indirection of so laudable a statute as that which the respondent sought to evade. He is accordingly found guilty of the charges preferred against him, and is suspended from practice for one year, with leave to apply at the expiration of that period for reinstatement, upon showing compliance with the conditions to be recited in the order to be entered hereon.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
