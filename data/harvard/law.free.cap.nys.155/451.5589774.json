The defendant held a lease from the former owner for a term of three years expiring May 1, 1915, at $60 per month. It is conceded that this lease was terminated by the foreclosure prior to July 1, 1914. The only evidence of the nature of the defendant\u2019s tenancy is the fact that he paid rent to the new landlord each month at the rate of $60 per month until January 30, 1915, upon which date he paid the rent for the month of January and vacated the premises. This action is brought to recover rent for the month of February, 1915, on the theory that it is an indefinite hiring, which section 232 of the Real Property Faw converted into a hiring until the 1st day of May following. Judgment was granted for the plaintiff on this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">It is well settled that section 232 of the Real Property Faw only applies where there is an agreement for hiring in which the term of lease remains undetermined. In the case at bar there is no evidence of such an agreement. In Douglass v. Seiferd, 18 Misc. Rep. 188, at page 191, 41 N. Y. Supp. 289, at page 290, McAdam, J., said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">\u201cWhere It appears that there is an annual rent reserved, and the payment is to be made by the quarter, or month, or week, then the renting is a yearly letting, without regard to the periods of payment. But where there is no such letting, and there is no evidence but the mere fact of payment at intervals of a week or month, the implication is that \u2022 the renting is a monthly or weekly one, just as the payment is monthly or weekly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">I am of the opinion that in the instant case the evidence shows a monthly letting, rather than an indefinite hiring, and the statute relied upon by the plaintiff does not apply. The case is very similar to the case of Fawrence v. Hasbrouck, 21 Mise. Rep. 39, 46 N. Y. Supp. 868, in which the tenant executed a lease of premises for 13 months, which lease was void because the landlord failed to execute it. The tenant occupied the premises for several months, paying the rent monthly, and then abandoned them. In an action for the subsequent rent, it was held by this court that the tenant, by entering without a valid agreement and paying monthly rent, became a monthly tenant, and had the right to remove at the end of any month. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the present case, there being no agreement except such as could be implied from the payment of monthly rent, the tenancy must be held to be a monthly tenancy, which terminated at the end of each month.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The judgment for the February rent must accordingly be reversed, with $30 costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
