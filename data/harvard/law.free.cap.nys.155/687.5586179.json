On March 15th the defendant served his notice of retainer and an unverified answer. These were returned by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, with notice indorsed on the answer that it was returned on the ground that more than 20 days had elapsed since the service thereof. The defendant made a motion to compel the plaintiff to accept the answer. The motion was not granted, but an order was made permitting the defendant to serve his answer on condition that he pay $10 costs. From this order the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The 20 days within which the defendant had a right to serve a notice of retainer and answer expired on the 14th day of March; but the 14th was Sunday and under section 20 of the General Construction Law the defendant had all of the following day on which to make the service. This right is given absolutely by statute, and therefore the plaintiff was in error in returning the answer, giving as \u00e1 reason that it was not served within time.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In both briefs argument is made concerning the fact that the answer was unverified; but this discussion is wholly irrelevant, for the reason that the plaintiff assigned no such reason for returning the answer. The plaintiff\u2019s relief against an unverified answer is found in section 528 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">The defendant having served his answer within the time prescribed by the statute, and the plaintiff having improperly refused to receive it, the defendant was entitled as a matter of right, not as \u00e1 matter of favor or discretion, to an order compelling the plaintiff to accept the pleading. This being so, the defendant\u2019s motion should have been granted, and no costs should have been imposed against him; but, on the contrary, the plaintiff should have been compelled to pay costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">Therefore the order is reversed, with $10 costs, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
