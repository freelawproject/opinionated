At the close of the charge the plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the court to charge that he did not intend by the charge \u201cto convey to them as to how they should decide this case on the facts,\u201d which request was declined. It can scarcely be doubted that a charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>in the form described was seriously calculated to influence the jury against plaintiff\u2019s claim, but we do not rest our reversal on this alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In this case, however, the court unfortunately, not only indicated by this form and language an opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was without merit, but in one instance at least distinctly misstated the plaintiff\u2019s contention. Thus the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">\u201cBy that he must satisfy you by a fair preponderance of evidence as to his contentions; that is, that the defendants agreed to pay him compensation for the selling of defendants\u2019 merchandise <em>while the plaintiff was selling his oten merchandise in Boston to various houses, </em>as claimed by the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Neither in the complaint nor during the course of the trial did plaintiff make any such contention, nor was it claimed by him that defendants\u2019 agreement was to pay him any compensation while plaintiff was engaged in anything other than the sale of defendants\u2019 merchandise. By this sentence a circumstance that had appeared in evidence was transmuted into an integral part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and contention, and there can be no doubt that the jury was misled thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide tire event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
