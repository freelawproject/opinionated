Y., and was employed as a porter, elevator man, and general utility man by the Paine Drug Company, a corporation doing business of manufacturing and selling drugs and chemicals and medicines and pharmaceutical preparations, at both retail and whoiesale, In the city of Rochester, N. Y.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-24\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The evidence on which the Commission based this finding of fact is the affidavit of the secretary of the employer, in which he states that the character of the Paine Drug Company was \u201cretail and wholesale drugs and physicians\u2019 supplies.\u201d The employer being a wholesale druggist, it might reasonably be inferred that the concern was engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>in the \"manufacture of drugs and chemicals\u201d; for a \u201cdrug,\u201d according to Webster, is \u201cany substance used as a medicine,\u201d and it may be assumed that a wholesale druggist compounds and mixes different substances together into medicines, and thus manufactures drugs. The Commission did undoubtedly so assume; but; in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, section 21 of the act commanded the Commission, and commands us, to presume \"that the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> The Commission has found that at the time of the accident the deceased\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">\u201cwas engaged in building a shelf near the elevator well, and while reaching into the elevator well to obtain a board which he had placed some place on the side of the well, he lost his balance and fell down the elevator shaft from the third floor to the basement, by reason of which he was instantly killed.\u201d \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">A general utility man, engaged in an establishment where drugs and chemicals are manufactured, must be presumed to participate more or Jess in the work of the establishment. The deceased was engaged at the instant of the accident in building a shelf, but in order to do this it may have been- necessary to handle the drugs and chemicals in the building; that is, move them so as to have room to build the shelf, and after it was built place them upon the shelf. In fact, the evidence before the Commission shows that tire deceased was required to rearrange cases and do- work of that character. In McQueeney v. Sutphen &amp; Myer, 167 App. Div. 528, 153 N. Y. Supp. 554, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\">\u201cIf the employ\u00e9 is engaged in an employment declared hazardous by this law, but at times may work in a nonhazardous employment, it is not unreasonable that the injury should be considered within the act, if the employer fails to show all the facts. * * * - If the employer had insured in the state fund, the insurance premium would rest upon the basis that when at work for his employer the claimant, McQueeney, was to be engaged in the hazardous business all the while, and, the premium having been exacted upon that basis, prima facie the loss should be met upon that basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">We think it should b'e held that the claimant\u2019s intestate came to his death while engaged in one of the hazardous employments enumerated in the act, and that the award of the Commission should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">KELLOGG and LYON, JJ., concur. SMITH, P. J., and WOODWARD, J., dissent</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
