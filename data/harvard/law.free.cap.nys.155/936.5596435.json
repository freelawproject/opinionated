Burns from an order of the Special Term that grants the motion of the Bridge Caf\u00e9 to intervene as a party defendant, and for the appointment of a receiver pendente lite of the leasehold property. The action is for partition of realty and of a chattel real. The latter was the subject-matter of Burns v. City of New York, 213 N. Y. 516, 108 N. E. <em>77. </em>The plaintiff in the case at bar complained that the Burns\u2019 had entered into- an agreement to sell and to assign the renewed term of the lease if granted to parties unknown. The Bridge Caf\u00e9 identified itself with the other party to the said agreement. We think that the discretion of the Special Term (see Pope v. Manhattan Railway Co., 79 App. Div. 583, 80 N. Y. Supp. 316) should not be disturbed so far as the intervention of the Bridge Cafe is concerned. Section 452, Code of Civil Procedure; Townsend v. Bogert, 126 N. Y. 370, 27 N. E. 555, 22 Am. St. Rep. 835; Delcambre v. Delcambre, 210 N. Y. 460, 466, 104 N. E. 950. By this affirmance nothing, more is determined but the propriety of the order that makes the Bridge Caf\u00e9 a party. The contention of the respondent, who sought for a receiver, is that the said lease for years passed to Burns as administrator de bonis non. We think that under the circumstances the court should not have taken the property from him. See Patterson v. McCunn, 46 How. Pr. 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">The order must be modified, as indicated in this opinion, and, as so modified, it is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
