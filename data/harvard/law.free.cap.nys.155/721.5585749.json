The court upon the trial held that an amendment was necessary, and withdrew a juror so that an application could be made at Special Term. It appears by the moving papers that the plaintiff is out of funds, almost penniless, and practically destitute, there being no property or money of the estate of the intestate aside from the cause of action. If the court had permitted the amendment upon condition that she pay the] costs, it would have been equivalent to denying the amendment, as the payment of costs was beyond her ability. In that case the amendment would not have been made on just terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\">Considering the destitute condition of the estate and of the administratrix, the party to be benefited by the action, the terms imposed were just. The order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
