The said envelopes were duly produced in court and opened, and the general ballots therein there marked, respectively, Exhibits 1, 2, etc.; and the court at Special Term, by said final order, passed upon said ballots so far as the same may affect the election of Representative in Congress in said district.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-3\">The petitioner, Brown, was the candidate of the Democratic party, and the intervener, Hicks, that of the Republican. The said Brown here appeals from so much of said order as passed upon ballots marked, respectively, as Exhibits 2, 7, 26, 28, 38, 39, and 48; and the said Hicks has appealed from so much thereof as passed upon ballots marked Exhibits 37, 39, and 40. It is therefore necessary that this court review the decision of the Special Term as to nine separate ballots, namely, Exhibits 2, 7, 26, 28, 37, 38,. 39, 40, and 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> As to the ballot marked Exhibit 2, both parties here agree that the court at Special Term properly held it void; but the petitioner claims that the court there erred in deciding that the ballot had been counted by the inspectors for him and in directing that it be deducted from his count. He contends that there is no proof that the inspectors counted the ballot as a vote for him. The official statement of the canvass of that election district states, as to the office of Representative, as follows: ,</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Ballots voted..........................................................297</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">Brown ....................................................190</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Hicks ..................................................... 88</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Post ...................................................... 10</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">Sinclair ................................................... 4</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">Blank votes................................................ 24</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">Void ...................................................... 1</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">297</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-13\">Also that the number of blank, void, and protested ballots was 25. From this return it would seem that all the votes not blank were counted for some one, save the 1 returned as void; also that there were 4 ballots \u201cprotested as marked for identification,\u201d all of which were counted for the several candidates named thereon, and that both those 4 ballots and the 1 held void and counted for no candidate were \u201cin the sealed package returned herewith.\u201d The sealed package or envelope, however, proved to\u2019 be marked as containing only 4 ballots marked \u201cProtested as marked for identification,\u201d and upon being opened it was found to contain only 4 ballots, each 1 marked in blue pencil \u201cMarked for Identification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-14\">The counsel for the petitioner states, in his brief, that such marks . were made by the justice at Special Term; whereas the counsel for the intervener, in his brief, says that they were not made by the justice, and as evidence thereof refers to the fact that they do not bear his initials, and that the record shows that when the envelope was opened the justice remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-15\">\u201cThere are four ballots in the envelopes, indorsed, \u2018Marked for identification.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>However the truth may be in regard to- this disputed matter, it is plain that no one of the four ballots was marked void by the inspectors; and that the inspectors, upon the outside of the sealed envelope, filled in only the blank in the line designated \"Protested as Marked for Identification,\u201d and not the blank in the line designated \u201cVoid Ballots.\u201d From these facts I think that the fair inference is that somehow or other the ballot, which they treated as void, was not placed by them in the sealed envelope. I conclude, therefore, that the learned justice at Special Term decided correctly that this ballot, Exhibit No. 2, had been counted for the petitioner, and in deciding that it must be deducted from the petitioner\u2019s total.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As to the ballot marked Exhibit No. 7, which the Special Term held valid as a vote for the intervener, Flicks, and therefore added one vote to his count, although the petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal includes that ballot as one of those in reference to- which he questions the decision at Special Term, I do not find that his counsel in his brief makes any contention that such decision was erroneous, and therefore I do not further consider that ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> As to ballot Exhibit No. 38, next discussed in the brief of petitioner\u2019s counsel, it had the name of the petitioner written in the blank line, although his name was printed as a candidate for the same office, namely, Representative, upon the ballot. The court at Special Term held that the ballot so marked was void, at least as to the office of Representative. Petitioner\u2019s counsel claims here that the provisions of the former Election Law (Consol. Laws, c. 17), in subdivision 9 of section 368, expressly declaring void a ballot upon which the name of a person, printed upon the ballot, has been writen by the voter, is not expressly continued in the present law (Laws 1913, c. 821), in section 358. I think, however, that the effect of the present provision, viz., subdivision 4 of section 358, viz., \u201cTo vote for any candidate not on the ballot, he shall write the candidate\u2019s name on a line left blank in the appropriate place,\u201d has the same effect; that, in other words, the elector who so wrote relator\u2019s name in the blank line on ballot No. 38, did not vote for him in the authorized way\u2014that is, as provided by subdivision 2 of said section 358. Hence I conclude that the court at Special Term properly disposed of said ballot, Exhibit No. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> As to ballot Exhibit No. 26, the petitioner here contends that it should not by the final order have been added to the intervener\u2019s total, because \u201cit is quite as probable that it has already been counted\u201d (by the inspectors) \u201cfor him as that it has not\u201d; while the counsel for the intervener seems to concede that it should not have been so added, as it had already been counted for the intervener, but he couples his concession with the claim that it should be held also that ballot Ex- . hibit No. 28 was counted by thfe inspectors as a valid vote for the petitioner, and therefore he contends that such vote, the ballot having properly been held to be void, should at Special Term have been deducted from the petitioner\u2019s count. As this concession cannot well be accepted, except upon such condition, the petitioner\u2019s counsel cannot be regarded as having accepted it; and this court must pass upon his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>contention that ballot 26 should not have been added to the intervener\u2019s total.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-3\">It appears that ballots Exhibits 26, 27, 28, and 29 were found in the same sealed envelope; that the inspectors\u2019 return from that election district shows that for the office of Representative there were:</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">Blank ballots......................................................... \u2022 \u2022 -35</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Void .................................................................. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Total, blank, void, and protested.........................................30</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">The sealed envelope was indorsed merely, \u201cEight void ballots.\u201d It contained 4 constitutional convention delegate ballots and 4 general official ballots, each without any indorsement upon it by the inspectors. From the return it would appear that they held only 1 of the ballots void as to that office, but that they did hold 35 ballots blank as to the same. It is plain that ballot No. 26 was a valid vote for the intervener, as the Special Term held. Its only defect was that the voter marked his cross in the proper voting spaces in front of each of 5 candidates for the office of state treasurer, which, under section 358 of the present Election Law, made the ballot a blank vote lor such office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">Exhibit No. 27 was an absolute blank for the office of Representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> Exhibit No. 28 had a semicircular mark put over the left part or side of the cross in the voting space in front of petitioner\u2019s name, and should be held void, as the Special Term decided. The counsel for the petitioner, however, claims that the court should have held that ballot valid within the provision of section 358, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-10\">\u201cBut no ballot shall be declared void because a cross X mark thereon is irregular in character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">I do not think that this contention is well made, as the semicircular mark seems to be imposed over the cross and not to be a part thereof. In this view of the matter, that ballot might properly have been regarded by the inspectors as wholly void under section 358, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-12\">\u201cAny mark other than a cross X mark or any erasure of any kind shall make the whole ballot void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> Ballot Exhibit No. 29 had a cross in the voting space in front of each of the 5 different candidates for the office of Representative, and therefore has to be held blank for that office, as ballot Exhibit No. 26 had to be held blank for the office of state treasurer. It seems to me therefore, that of the 4 ballots found in the scaled envelope only 1 of them, viz., Exhibit No. 28, was properly to be held as a void ballot; that one of them, viz., Exhibit No. 26, was to' be held valid as to the office of Representative; and the other two to be held blank as to the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">I conclude, therefore, that the decision of the Special Term was correct in substance, although the verbal distinction between \u201cvoid\u201d and \u201cblank\u201d was not there made, and that the final order correctly added the vote upon ballot No. 26 to intervener\u2019s total, but made no change as to the other 3, as no one of them had been counted by the inspectors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-15\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> As to- ballot Exhibit No. 39 the court below held that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>void on account of the third mark in the cross in one of the comptroller voting spaces; at least, both counsel, in their briefs, declare that such was the ground of the decision at Special Term. Prom my inspection of the ballot, it seems to me quite as likely that the voter, in making the heavy transverse line or smear, was attempting to erase the cross which he had at first made in front of Travis\u2019 name, and later made a cross in front of Sohmer\u2019s name. This seems likely from the fact that he voted otherwise the Democratic ticket. Such erasure, under section 358, would make the ballot equally void. If the ballot be not void by reason of such mark, it is a valid vote for the petitioner. The Special Term refused to count it for him, or to de- - duct it from his count, as that court held that it had been regarded by the inspectors as void. The petitioner here contends that the three marks contained in such voting space should be regarded as constituting merely an irregular cross, and so was saved by the provision of section 358 above quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-3\">In the recent case of Matter of Garvin, 168 App. Div. 218, 222, 153 N. Y. Supp. 549, the First Department held that excessive crosses in a voting space make the ballot void, \u00e1nd it seems to me that that is just the situation here\u2014that is, that there are two crosses in such Travis voting space, or at least that there is an attempted erasure of the cross made therein. Therefore I conclude that the decision holding ballot No. 39 void was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> The court at Special Term refused to deduct it from the petitioner\u2019s total, holding that it had not been counted for him by the inspectors; and the intervener here contends that it should be so deducted, as having been so counted by the inspectors. The ballot was marked \u201cvoid\u201d in ink by the inspectors; and I think, therefore, that the presumption is that they so treated it and did not count it. The counsel for the intervener contends that, as the return shows only 2 void ballots for Representative, and the envelope, being indorsed \u201cFive Void Ballots,\u201d contained 5. general ballots, viz., Exhibits 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41, all of which, except Exhibit No. 38, had, by the inspectors, been marked \u201cVoid,\u201d the inference should be that of the 4 so marked \u201cVoid\u201d only 2 were so treated by the inspectors and not counted by them; that, as Exhibit No. 41 was an entire blank as to this office, only 2 of the other 3 could have been rejected and not counted by the inspectors; and' that, therefore, 1 more should have been deducted from his count at Special Term, as, all 3 being apparently votes for him, are really invalid as such, namely: Exhibit No. 37 has one straight line in the comptroller\u2019s voting space and is therefore clearly void; Exhibit No. 39 has the two crosses in the same voting space, or the erased cross as above stated, and therefore is void; and Exhibit No. 40 has a cross in the Governor\u2019s named space, and is therefore clearly void. Hence the intervener contends that the inspectors must have counted at least 1 of the 4 ballots, namely, Exhibits 37, 39, 40, and 41, three of which, 37, 39, and 40 were void, No. 41 being blank, and therefore that 1 of the 3 should be deducted from petitioner\u2019s total, and that ballot No. 39 should be so deducted as presenting the only possible debatable question of validity. This argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>is ingenious, but docs not convince my mind, though possibly it may be correct. Each of those 3 ballots was marked \u201cVoid\u201d by the inspectors. They had in mind the term \u201cProtested,\u201d and marked it upon ballot No. 38. I therefore think that they were sensible of the respective meaning of the two terms, \u201cVoid\u201d and \u201cProtested.\u201d The burden no doubt rests upon the intervener to satisfy the court that ballot No. 39 was actually counted for the petitioner by the inspectors. I do not think that we can hold that he has met that burden, although the matter is not entirely clear, and therefore I think that we should uphold the decision at Special Term in refusing to deduct ballot No. 39 from the petitioner\u2019s total.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-3\"><bracketnum>[9]</bracketnum> At the most, it is a case here where the general, the written, return, in giving 2 as the number of void ballots, was inconsistent with the indorsements upon the ballots themselves, which made 4 void, 1 of which plainly was merely blank. It seems to me that, if anything, the particular indorsement should prevail as a special return over the general return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\"><bracketnum>[10]</bracketnum> As to ballot No. 48, which was held void below, the defect is that there appeal's at the upper end of the line of the cross, which tends to the right, a sort of a little curve, made apparently in closing that line, as though the pencil had flourished a bit, and also there is something similar, but not so marked, at the top of the other line of the cross. It seems to me that neither is a distinct line, but that each was made with the same impression of the pencil, and that, therefore, the entire thing should be considered simply as an irregular cross and a valid voting mark, and that the order appealed from should be modified accordingly, so as to give that vote to the petitioner. This ballot seems to me to present a far different case from that of either of the ballots, exhibits 28 and 39, above considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">I advise, therefore, that the order appealed from be modified, so as to provide that the ballot marked Exhibit No. 48 was and is a valid ballot and vote for the petitioner, and therefore, by reason of such ballot, that one vote be added to the total number of votes heretofore counted, for said petitioner, Brown, by the inspectors, and that, as so modified, said order be affirmed, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
