The papers upon which the vacated attachment was granted merely state why plaintiffs suspect the defendant of having disposed of his property with intent to defraud his creditors. They contain no evidence upon which fraud may be fairly inferred, and the very grounds of plaintiffs\u2019 suspicion are consistent with honest business dealings.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">PAGE, J., concurs.
