Such information should, however, be confined to the identity and date of purchase of the tires complained of. The order appealed from is, however, manifestly far too broad to accomplish the simple purpose aimed at.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Appellant also complains that the extension of time contained in defendant\u2019s order for examination violates both rule 24 of the General Rules of Practice and rule 11 of the Rules of the City Court. From plaintiff\u2019s affidavit it appears without contradiction that defendant\u2019s time to answer the amended complaint, served on July 20, 1915, had been extended a number of times, until under the last stipulation it expired on September 20th. The order for examination was obtained September 17th, but was not served on plaintiff\u2019s attorney until September 20th, and on the plaintiff himself September 23d or 24th. Under no circumstances, therefore, did plaintiff or his attorney have the two days\u2019 notice required by the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The defendant offers no excuse for its laches or delay, except to cite in its brief Dudley v. Press Pub. Co., 53 Hun, 347, 6 N. Y. Supp. 388, which differs radically from the case at bar in that very respect. I think, on the other hand, that if defendant should apply for leave to open its default, the order should be granted on payment of the costs of the action to date, without the necessity of defendant disclosing its defense, since, from the peculiar facts developed by the affidavits, it is evident that defendant cannot know what defense it may have, nor whether it has any at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">If, therefore, to avoid the trouble and delay of an additional motion, both parties will within three days file their consent to treat the application for the order for examination as one also to open defendant\u2019s default on notice, the same will be opened upon payment by defendant of the costs of the action, namely, $25, and defendant\u2019s time extended as in the order of September 17, 1915, except that the right to demur should be eliminated. Said order will be also modified, however, by limiting the examination of plaintiff to a statement of the date of purchase and the identity of the tires complained of, or, in the alternative, at plaintiff\u2019s option, to furnish a bill of particulars thereof, such examination to take place or the bill be furnished on November 16th, and, as so modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements of this appeal to appellant. If the consent above provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>for is not filed by both parties, the order appealed from will be reversed, and the order of September 17, 1915, vacated, with $10 costs and disbursements of the appeal to appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
