From an order requiring an examination of two of defendant\u2019s officers before trial, and of complainant\u2019s electrical expert at defendant\u2019s plant, with permission to such expert, plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and the referee to make an examination of the plant, defendant appeals. Order reversed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b793-6\">Argued before SMITH, P.

Foster, of Syracuse (Hinman, Howard &amp; Kattell, oh Binghamton, of counsel), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b793-8\">Charles R. Stewart, of Binghamton, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b793-9\">JOHN M. KELLOGG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJd\">The right to examine a witness or party before trial is a statutory right, and to obtain it the statutory provisions must be complied with. The Special Term has no power to grant the original order; it must be made by a judge. Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 873; Heishon v. Knickerbocker Life Ins. Co., 77 N. Y. 278; Wiechers v. New Home Sewing Machine Co., 38 App. Div. 1, 56 N. Y. Supp. 235; Weinstock v. Hallenbeck, 163 App. Div. 966, 148 N. Y. Supp. 1150. The order was therefore improperly granted at Special Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">We may state that the papers do not sufficiently show the necessity for the examination of the witness Rover, and do not warrant, his examination and the examination of the defendant\u2019s plant. An examination of the plant cannot be obtained by such an order. Perhaps, upon proper facts shown, an inspection of the plant might be permitted under sections 803 to 809 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">The order is therefore reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">WOODWARD, J., concurs. SMITH, P. J., and LYON and HOWARD, JJ., concur in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
