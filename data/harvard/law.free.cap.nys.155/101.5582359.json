Tw'entv-one days thereafter, or on February 8, 1909, Joseph D. Kelly, Esq., served upon plaintiff\u2019s attorney a notice of appearance entitled in the Supreme Court, instead of in the City Court, which was returned by plaintiff\u2019s attorney with a notation to the effect that no action between the plaintiff and the defendant was pending in the New York Supreme Court. No further pleading or notice of appearance was served by the defendant, and about five years later the plaintiff entered judgment without notice to the defendant as in case of default in appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-22\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The defendant moved upon the judgment roll to vacate the judgment, on the ground that it was entered without notice, and from the order granting this motion and setting the case down for trial this appeal is taken. It does not appear from the record that a proper notice of appearance was ever served on behalf of the defendant. He was therefore fully in default, and the plaintiff was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>enter judgment at any time without notice. The judgment is therefore perfectly regular, and should not have been vacated upon that ground. The learned justice at Special Term apparently regarded the motion as one to open a default, but the papers were entirely insufficient to support such a <em>motion; </em>no excuse for the default having been presented, no merits having been shown, and the motion having been made solely upon the judgment roll and filed papers. The defendant\u2019s proper remedy was a motion to open his default, which could be granted only upon terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> It is said that the plaintiff\u2019s delay of five years in entering judgment should weigh against her as evidence of bad faith. It is difficult, however, to see how the delay has prejudiced the defendant. The only case in which the time within which a judgment may- be entered is limited by the Code of Civil Procedure is where an order of arrest has been granted. C. C. P. \u00a7 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs, without prejudice to a motion by the defendant to open his default. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
