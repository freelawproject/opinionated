Moreover, the mere fact that Wlodaver may not have delivered the notes to plaintiff in perfectly regular form would not, as between plaintiff and Wlodaver, have affected the actual nature of the transaction between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-19\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> a 'here being ample testimony in the record from which the jury might have inferred that the notes were actually rediscounted by Wlodaver with plaintiff's knowledge of their usurious character, and it being conceded that that fact, if found, would constitute a complete defense (Schlesinger v. Lehmaier, 191 N. Y. 69, 83 N. E. 657, 16 L. R. A. [N. S.] 626, 123 Am. St. Rep. 591), the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
