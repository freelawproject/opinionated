It appeared that plaintiff had delivered a showcase to defendant to be repaired, that defendant repaired the same, but refused to redeliver it to plaintiff until defendant\u2019s charges for repairs were paid. Thereupon, in a prior action, plaintiff sought to replevin the showcase. The testimony as to the prior action was given orally in the present suit, and the judgment is testified to have been \u201cfor plaintiff for the return of the property or its value, $50, subject to defendant\u2019s special property or lien thereon for $15, defendant to retain property until the lien is paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Appellant urges that this judgment was an adjudication to the effect that his services in repairing the chattel were worth $15, and consequently is equally determinative adversely to' plaintiff\u2019s present claim that the services injured the chattel. This seems to me to be so evident as to\u2018 require nO\u2019 discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Judgment reversed, with $30 costs, and complaint dismissed, with costs.
