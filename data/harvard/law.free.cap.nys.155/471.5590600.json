The action is to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien. Section 17 of the Lien Law provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">\u201cNo lien specified in this article shall be a lien for a longer period than one year after the notice of lien has been filed, unless Within that time an action is commenced to foreclose the lien * * * or unless an order be granted within one year from the filing of such notice by a court of record, continuing such lien, and such lien shall be re-docketed as to the date of the granting such order and a statement made that such lien is continued by virtue of such order. No lien shall be continued by such order for more than one year from the granting thereof, but a new order and entry may be made in each successive year. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">The lien was filed April 1, 1913. The complaint alleges as follows as to its renewal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-14\">\u201cXI. That heretofore, and on the 31st day of March, 1914, by an order of this 'court, duly made, said lien was duly continued for a period of one year from the date of granting said order, which order was duly entered on that date in the office of the clerk of New York county, and said clerk being therein and thereby directed to redocket such lien as of the date of the granting of such order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-15\">The point of the demurrer is that this paragraph does not, in terms, allege a redoclceting, but merely the granting and entry of an order extending the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-16\">We think that the orders appealed from are too technical. The complaint alleges that the lien was \u201cduly continued,\u201d and that the order continuing it was \u201cduly entered\u201d on March 31, 1914, in the office of the county clerk, and that he was therein and thereby directed to re-docket it. This sufficiently alleges the doing by plaintiff of all that it was required to do. The duty of redoclceting rested upon the clerk, and we are not to presume that he failed of his duty, and, even if he had improperly omitted to redoclcet the lien, the lienor could not be made to1 suffer thereby. Hurley v. Tucker, 128 App. Div. 580, 112 N. Y. Supp. 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It may be that the plaintiff failed in some duty, such as paying the requisite fee, and thus prevented the redocketing; but that does not appear on the face of the complaint, and, if it be a fact, it can be set up in the answer. This appears to have been what was done in Manton v. Brooklyn &amp; Flatbush Ry. Co., 160 App. Div. 783, 145 N. Y. Supp. 996. At all events the point was not raised in that case by demurrer, but upon the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\">The orders appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to appellant, and the demurrers overruled, with $10 costs of each motion, with leave to defendants to' withdraw the demurrers and to answer over within 20 days upon payment of all costs in the action. Order filed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
