The plaintiff claimed that he had been arbitrarily excluded from such places of public amusement and discriminated against solely because defendants professed to be displeased with a certain dramatic criticism written by him. An injunction pendente lite having been granted by the Special Term, an appeal was taken to this court, which resulted in the reversal of the order and a denial of the motion for such injunction. 154 N. Y. Supp. 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">Thereafter the defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, which motion was granted by Mr. Justice Weeks, by an order which gave leave to the plaintiff to serve an amended complaint within 20 days after the service of said order, and that, in the event that the plaintiff should fail to serve an amended complaint within the time specified, the defendant should have judgment against the plaintiff, dismissing the complaint, with costs. Upon the argument the plaintiff\u2019s counsel conceded that the decision of this court upon the injunction pendente lite proceedings required tire granting of the motion for judgment, and stated that no' amended complaint would be served, but that for the purpose of getting the real question involved before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the Court of Appeals at the earliest possible moment he would appeal to the Appellate Division from the order about to be made granting the motion for judgment. It was suggested that a stipulation be entered into to extend the time of the defendants to answer or demur until after the decision of the Court of Appeals. A stipulation to that effect was sent by the attorneys for the defendant to the attorneys for the plaintiff; but it contained the further stipulation that the plaintiff should make no effort to obtain admission to any theater controlled by the defendants until said determination, and to institute no proceedings looking to the enforcement of any criminal liability under the civil rights statute until after such determination. These clauses were obnoxious to the plaintiff, and the stipulation was therefore returned unsigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Thereafter the plaintiff took an appeal to this court from the aforesaid order of Mr. Justice Weeks, and also instituted four suits against defendants in the Municipal Court, claiming in each instance a penalty of $500 because of alleged acts of the defendants in refusing to permit him to enter certain theaters. Thereupon the plaintiff made a motion for an order extending the plaintiff\u2019s time within which to pay the costs and to serve an amended complaint, as provided by the order of Mr. Justice Weeks, until 20 days after the decision of the Appellate Division of the appeal taken from said order. Said motion was granted by Mr. Justice Shearn, and from the order entered thereon this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The order appealed from is clearly wrong. Nillson v. Lawrence, 148 App. Div. 155, 132 N. Y. Supp. 664; Schwabe v. Herzog, 157 App. Div. 672, 142 N. Y. Supp. 652. The proper practice, as indicated, would have been for the plaintiff, after appealing, to apply to the Special Term on notice, before pleading over, for a stay of proceedings, and leave it for this court to determine whether or not, in the event of an affirmance, he should be given leave to plead over. The notice of motion was broad enough to permit of that relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The order appealed from should therefore be modified, by striking out the provision for the extension of time in which to serve an amended complaint, and by inserting in lieu thereof a stay of proceedings pending the appeal to this court, without costs. Settle order on notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">INGRAHAM, P. J., and LAUGHLIN and SCOTT, JJ., concur. DOWLING, J\u201e dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
