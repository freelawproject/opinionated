She demands judgment that the contract be rescinded and that she recover tire $245. The defendants\u2019 answer denies everything, except the execution of the contract, the default of the plaintiff, and the levying of the assessment against the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The defendants moved at Special Term for a bill of particulars, some of the items- of which were granted, and some of which were refused. The requests which were refused are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201cFirst. Which one or more of the defendants duly extended the time of. plaintiff for making payment and the interest on the same, as alleged in folio <em>4 </em>of the complaint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">\u201cSecond. Which one or more of the defendants repudiated the provision of the contract requiring said assessments to be paid by the defendants, as is alleged in folios <em>4 </em>and 5 of the complaint?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">\u201cFourth. Which one or more of the defendants endeavored to cause the plaintiff to believe that she would have to pay assessment, as is alleged in folio 6 of the complaint, and how and when this was done, if at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">\u201cFifth. The exact time when, and the particular defendant or defendants whom, plaintiff asked to return the moneys which she has paid on account of said contract, as alleged in- folio 7 of the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">\u201cSixth. Which defendant or defendants promised to return to plaintiff the ' moneys, which she had paid on account of said contract, and the exact date of such promise, and whether or not such promise was in writing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-11\">\u201cSeventh. Which defendant or defendants have violated the provisions of said contract, providing the immediate possession of said lot and property should be given the plaintiff, as alleged in folio 8 of the complaint?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-12\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> We think these requests of the defendants should have been granted, particularly that one which seeks to discover whether the alleged modifications of the contract were oral or in writing. Boland v. Emma Willard School, 152 App. Div. 915, 137 N. Y. Supp. 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">There are four defendants, and all four of them are parties to the contract. The plaintiff should inform the defendants which one of them she conferred with when these rather unusual alleged modifications of the contract were made; and she should give to the defendants the name of their agent who has interfered with her rights. Interesting legal questions may arise as a result of such information, not only between the plaintiff and tire defendants, but between the defendants themselves. These-questions should be determined, as far as may be, before the day of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Vague and general allegations in pleadings are not to be encouraged. Pleaders should be pinned down as much as possible to specific facts. This clarifies the situation, simplifies the issues, and minimizes the work on the day of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The order of the Special Term should be modified, by granting all the requests which were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Order modified, by granting all the requests which were denied, with $10 costs a.nd disbursements to the appellants. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
