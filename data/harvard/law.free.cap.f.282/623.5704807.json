Both defendants pleaded guilty to three counts of the indictment. The railroad company was fined $1,000 on each of the three counts, and ordered to pay one-half of the costs of the prosecution. Plaintiff in error was fined the sum of $1,000 on each of said counts, and ordered to be imprisoned in the United States penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kan., for a period of one year and one day on each of said counts, the terms of imprisonment to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The fines imposed were the minimum fines provided by law; so was the term of imprisonment. It is assigned as error that the court below abused its discretion in imposing a sentence of imprisonment on plaintiff in error. The record presents nothing that this court can review. Goldberg v. U.
