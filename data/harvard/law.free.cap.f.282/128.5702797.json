The Belt Company agrees within three (3) months from the date hereof, at its own expense, to acquire the necessary rights of way and ordinance rights for the construction of its line of railway from a point of connection with the line of railway in the possession of the receiver at the point marked \u2018A\u2019 on said Exhibit A to the point marked \u2018B\u2019 thereon, and along the line indicated in red, and to construct in a good and substantial manner a railway thereon according to the plans and specifications to be' agreed upon between the parties hereto, or their chief engineers or other representatives designated for that purpose.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">\u201cThat Leon F. Lonnbladh, chief engineer of the plaintiff, and C. B. Smith, chief engineer of the defendant, agreed that the construction of said road (by the plaintiff, who had agreed to construct the same for the defendant) with native earth, in so far as the embankments and roadbed was concerned, was a full and complete compliance with section 1 of said contract above set forth, and wherein said section provides: \u2018And to construct in a good</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">and substantial manner a railway thereon according to the plans and specifications to be agreed upon between the parties hereto or their chief engineers, or other representatives designated for that purpose.\u2019 The chief engineer of the plaintiff stated to the chief engineer of the defendant that, inasmuch as the plaintiff was under contract to operate and maintain the road being built for a period of ten years, the expense of maintenance and operation would be greatly reduced if the road was ballasted, whereupon the two engineers reached the following agreement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">\u201cThat the plaintiff was to deliver chats for the ballasting of said road on the road at Oklahoma City, and the defendant agreed to pay an amount for said ballast not to exceed 60 cents per cubic yard, the exact amount to be ascertained, based upon the cost of chats at the mines and the cost of transporting same to Oklahoma City in work trains on a work train basis as determined by the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">\u201cThat thereafter said agreement was submitted by the engineer of the plaintiff to Mr. Webb, chief operating officer of the plaintiff, who approved the said contract and authorized and assisted in the consummation thereof; that the duties of a chief operating officer are substantially the same as the duties of a general manager of a railroad not in the hands of a receiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">\u201cIt is further agreed that this subsequent contract was never submitted to Charles E. Schaff, the receiver, and that Mr. Schaff, as such receiver, did not approve or disapprove said contract or arrangement until after the consummation thereof, but that when the matter was called to Mr. Sehaff\u2019s personal at- \u2022 tention he did disapprove of it; that the said Charles E. Schaff had no personal knowledge of the same; that the defendant did not know whether or not the chief operating officer submitted the same to Mr. Sehaff, and did not know whether or not Mr. Schaff personally had any knowledge of the same, or whether or not he had approved the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">\u201cIt is further agreed that the plaintiff did during the months of May, June, July, August, and September, 1917, procure chats at the mines located at or near Chitwood, Mo., in the aggregate amount of 12,492 cubic yards, and transported the same from that point over plaintiff\u2019s lines of railway in work trains to Oklahoma City in cars furnished by the plaintiff and there delivered the same on the railway which the plaintiff was building for the defendant and placed the same on said railway so being constructed ; that the said chats were originally billed as company material, consigned to T. G. Banks, division engineer of plaintiff, at Oklahoma City, and that the plaintiff\u2019s station agent at Oklahoma City, some time after the receipt of said shipments changed the waybills to. show the Oklahoma Belt Railroad Company as the consignee, and reported, them to plaintiff as revenue waybills. It is further agreed that the defendant was not notified, and had no knowledge, of the change of said waybills from \u2018deadhead\u2019 or company freight to revenue waybills until September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>or October, 1918, or more than a year from the time said chats were moved, and it is agreed that the increased amount now claimed by the plaintiff and for which a recovery is sought in this case was not presented to the defendant, and that the defendant had no notice or knowledge of the same, until September or October, 1918, or more than a year after the chats moved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">\u201cIt is further agreed that the plaintiff rendered a statement to the defendant in accordance with the contract hereinbefore mentioned, based upon 10 cents per cubic yard and actual work train cost of transportation, or $5,983.67, which was duly paid by the defendant; that the said $5,983.67 account was rendered under this second or special contract to ballast said road, and that it was not connected with nor an act arising out of the original contract for the construction of said road by the plaintiff for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">\u201cIt is further agreed that at the time said service was performed the tariffs and schedules of the plaintiff, duly filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and in effect, prescribed the charges for the transportation of chats in interstate commerce from Chitwood, Mo., to Oklahoma City, OUla., over the line of railway of plaintiff, when said chats were to be used for general or commercial purposes, but not for railroad purposes of the plaintiff; that by the charges so fixed in said tariffs and schedules the total amount thereof for transporting the 12,492 cubic yards of chats between said points would be $14,138.40, which sum, added to the purchase price of 10 cents per cubic yard, or $1,249.20, makes a total of $15,387.60, which last-mentioned sum is $9,403.93 in excess of the sum of $5,983.67 heretofore paid plaintiff by the defendant, as above set forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">\u201cIt is further agreed that the ballast placed upon said road by the plaintiff inured to the benefit of the plaintiff in reduced maintenance expense and reduced operating expense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">\u201cIt is further agreed that the plaintiff was to operate the road in question for a period of ten years under the terms of the original contract attached to plaintiff\u2019s petition, as Exhibit A; that the ballast which was put in said road at the instance and request of said plaintiff under the subsequent contract was for the benefit of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">\u201cIt is further agreed that the defendant was not obligated or required to ballast this track under and by the terms of the contract by which it was to construct this track, and by which contract the plaintiff agreed to operate said road for a period of ten years, and which was attached to plaintiff\u2019s petition as Exhibit A, and but for the subsequent contract or arrangements whereby said road was ballasted the plaintiff would have been required to operate said road without ballast and maintain the same for a period of ten years, or ballast the same at its own expense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">\u201cIt is further agreed that there is, and was, no tariffs on file, at the time the chats in controversy were transported, prescribing rates for interstate transportation of chats, except for commercial purposes, as above stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">\u201cIt is further agreed that this case may be submitted to the court for final determination without a jury on the foregoing statement of facts; a jury being hereby expressly waived.

Bryson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">The only question involved is whether, under the original contract and the later contract between the parties, the Belt Railroad was \u2022to pay for the transportation by the receiver of chats for the ballasting of its track, the tariff rates filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, or the actual cost of transportation as provided by the contract made by Leon F. Lonnbladh, chief engineer of the plaintiff, and C. E. Smith, chief engineer of the defendant, which was approved by the chief operating officer of the plaintiff, whose duties, the agreed statement of facts recites, were substantially the same as the duties of a general manager of a railroad not in the hands of a receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-17\">The agreed statement of facts also states that the chief engineer of the plaintiff stated to the chief engineer of the defendant that, \u201cinasmuch \u00e1s the plaintiff was under contract to operate and maintain the road being built for a period of ten years, the expense of maintenance and operation would be greatly reduced if the road was ballasted,\u201d and thereupon the following agreement was made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-18\">\u201cThat the plaintiff was to deliver cliats for the ballasting of said road on the road at Oklahoma City, and the defendant agreed to pay an amount for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>said ballast not to exceed 60 cents per cubic yard, the exact amount to be ascertained based upon the cost of chats at the mines and the cost of transporting same to Oklahoma City in work trains on a work train basis as determined by the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">After the ballasting had been completed, the plaintiff rendered a statement to the defendant, in accordance with this second contract, based upon 10 cents per cubic yard, and the actual work train cost of transportation, which was duly paid by the defendant. It was also agreed that, if this contract as to the cost of transportation was void, the plaintiff would be entitled under the tariff filed by it with the Interstate Commerce Commission to the sum of $9,403.93, in addition to the amount paid by the defendant. The court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the sum demanded, with interest thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Under the original contract between the parties the plaintiff was to have the exclusive use of the Belt Railroad, was to maintain it to conform to standards for other lines of railway similarly situated, to pay all taxes lawfully levied thereon during the term of the agreement, and be responsible to any and all parties for loss and damage-arising from the operation of the property leased to it, and at the expiration of the lease turn the property back in as good condition as it was when received, ordinary wear and tear excepted; that the lease was to be in effect while the receivership of the plaintiff continued, but the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway, of which the plaintiff was receiver, or any successor company which may purchase or operate its lines of railway after the determination of the receivership, shall have the right at its option to continue this lease in effect for the period of ten years from the date of the contract, and thereafter subject to termination on one year\u2019s written notice by either party. It also provided that, if there is a cancellation after the ten-year period, the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway, or its successor, shall at its option have a right to a further period of ten years to switch, receive, and deliver cars and freight to and from any industry which may hereafter be located upon or along the line of the Belt Company, south of the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Railroad, upon the payment to the Belt Company of a trackage charge of $1 per loaded car.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The learned trial judge, in a memorandum opinion, held that, while the plaintiff would reap an advantage from the use of the ballast, it would only be temporary, and that the real beneficiary was the defendant, and therefore, under the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St. \u00a7 8563 et seq.), the plaintiff could make no contract for transportation at a less rate than that in the tariff schedules filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. That if, by mistake or contract, a carrier in interstate transportation charges less than the filed tariff rate, it not only may recover the difference, but it is its duty to do so, or else it violates the law\u2019, is beyond question. Nor does it matter if the carrier is benefited to some extent by the lower rate, unless it is connected with its duties as a carrier, and not in the field of some other business. New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 200 U. S. 361, 26 Sup. Ct. 272, 50 L. Ed. 515; Montgomery v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R. Co., 228 Fed. 616, 143 C. C. A. 138, decided by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>So the question is narrowed down to whether the contract was made for the benefit of the plaintiff in its business as a carrier. The rental in the original contract was evidently based upon the cost under that contract, and when the contract for the ballasting was made no extra rental charge was made on that account. That it was intended primarily, if not altogether, for the benefit of the plaintiff, is shown by the agreed statement of facts, when the chief engineer of the plaintiff stated^ to the chief engineer of the defendant, that \u201cinasmuch as the plaintiff was under contract to operate and maintain the road being built for a period of ten years, the expense of maintenance and operation would be greatly reduced if the road was ballasted.\u201d That was one of the considerations, if not the sole consideration, of the agreement to transport the ballasting material at actual cost. It was therefore for the benefit of plaintiff in its business as a carrier, and not for any collateral benefit, unconnected with the operation of the railway.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">In Santa F\u00e9, P. &amp; P. Railroad v. Grant Bros., 228 U. S. 177, 185, 186, 33 Sup. Ct. 474, 477 (57 L. Ed. 787), it was held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">\u201cIt is apparent that there may he special engagements which are not embraced within its duty as a common carrier, although their performance may incidentally involve the actual transportation of persons and things, whose carriage in other circumstances might be within its public obligation. * * * In constructing,, improving, or repairing its road, and in building its extensions and branches, the railroad company is providing facilities for its service as a common carrier, but of course is not acting as such. It may do the work itself, if it chooses, or it may make it the subject of contract with another. In the latter case it simply employs an appropriate agency. The haulage by the railroad company of the men, appliances, and supplies, required by the contractor for the purpose of the construction or improvement, to or from the point on its line where the work is to be done, is merely incidental to the work itself. The cost of such haulage is obviously an item of expense which must be taken into account in fixing the terms of the construction contract, and in providing for it over its own line the railroad company may adjust the matter with the contractor as it sees fit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In the instant case the ballast waas solely for the benefit of the plaintiff, as stated by its chief engineer. While it is true that upon the expiration of the lease the defendant would receive the benefit of the ballast, it had paid the cost of it as provided in the contract, without receiving any additional compensation for the increased cost paid by it for the construction of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In Montgomery v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co., supra, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">\u201cIt may be freely conceded that, in the present state of the law, a common carrier has no right to enter the field of general business and transport the articles and commodities used and sold therein at less than the regular published rates available to the general public. It has the right to provide eating houses for its passengers and employees \u00e1t points on its line, and may transport the articles and commodities for the use of such eating houses at less than the full published rate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 200 U. S. 361, 26 Sup. Ct. 272, 50 L. Ed. 515, relied on by counsel for plaintiff is based upon a state of facts which makes it inapplicable to the instant case. In that case the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad Company made an agreement to sell to the New Haven Railroad 60,000 tons of coal at $2.75 per ton for delivery in Connecticut from the Kanawha district in Virginia. This price was only 28 cents a ton for carrying the coal from the Kanawha district to Newport News, as the coal and the cost of'transportation from Newport News to Connecticut would aggregate $2.47 per ton, while the published tariff rate for like carriage from the same, district was $1.45 per ton. This was clearly a violation of the Interstate Commerce Law, as the reduced rate was not in consideration of any benefit to accrue in the operation of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">There can be no doubt that, if the contract for ballasting the road had been inserted in. the original contract, it would have been valid, and plaintiff would not be entitled to recover the tariff rates. Then why could it not be made at a later day ?</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">It is also urged by the plaintiff that the second contract, not having been approved by the receiver, it is not binding; but there is no merit in this contention. Northern Pacific Railroad Co. v. American Trading Co., 195 U. S. 439, 461, 25 Sup. Ct. 84, 49 L. Ed. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The judgment is reversed, with directions to enter judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b152-7\">STONE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">(dissenting). I am compelled to dissent for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The law is that an interstate common carrier, when acting as a common carrier, is not permitted, through contract or otherwise, to depart from its lawfully established tariffs. L. &amp; N. R. Co. v. Maxwell, 237 U. S. 94, 35 Sup. Ct. 494, 59 L. Ed. 853,_ L. R. A. 1915E, 665, and citations therein. This rule is so strictly interpreted that the carrier cannot, as a common carrier, transport even its own property. As where a railway owning mines and selling coal undertook to \u00bftransport that coal and deliver it to a purchaser at less than the cost of the coal plus delivering and tariff transportation charges. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co. v. I. C. C., 200 U. S. 361, 26 Sup. Ct. 272, 50 L. Ed. 515. Nor can there be such a departure based on some benefit therein to the carrier, such as increased traffic. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co. v. I. C. C., supra, 200 U. S. at page 397, 26 Sup. Ct. 272, 50 L. Ed. 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">The only instance in which such a, carrier is permitted to depart from its tariffs, and carry persons or freight for less than the tariffs, or even for nothing, is where the carriage is for the sole benefit of the carrier, with no resulting benefit or injury direct or incidental to another person. In such carriage the carrier is regarded as not acting as a \u201ccommon carrier.\u201d The definition-and confines of this departure rule-are stated in Santa Fe, P. &amp; P. R. Co. v. Grant Bros., 228 U. S. 177, at page 186, 33 Sup. Ct. 474, at page 477 (57 L. Ed. 787), where the court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">\u201cIn constructing, improving, or repairing its road, and in building its extensions and branches, the railroad company is providing facilities for its service as a common carrier, but, of course, is not acting as such. It may do. the work itself, if it chooses, or it may make it the subject of contract with another. In the latter case it simply employs an appropriate agency. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>haulage by the railroad company of the. men, appliances, and supplies, required by the contractor for the purpose of the construction or improvement, to or from the point on its line where the work is to be done, is merely incidental to the work itself. The cost of such haulage is obviously an item of expense which must be taken into account in fixing the terms of the construction contract, and in providing for it over its own line the railroad company may adjust the matter with the contractor as it sees fit. If the railroad company did the work directly, it would have to take its employees and the necessary outfit to the place of work, and it may undertake to do the like for the contractor, either free of charge or at reduced rates, as they may agree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">And at page 188 of 228 U. S. (33 Sup. Ct. 478, 57 <em>L. </em>Ed. 787):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">\u201cIt is clear that in dealing with transportation of this character over Its own road, in connection with construction or 'improvement, a railroad company is not acting in the performance of its duty as a common carrier, and the arrangement for free or reduced rate carriage for the necessary materials and men used in the work, when it is a part of the contract, entered into in good faith and not as a subterfuge, is not obnoxious to the provisions of law prohibiting departures from the published tariffs, for the reason that such an agreement lies outside the policy of these provisions. See Matter of Railroad-Telegraph Contracts, 12 I. C. C. Rep. 10, 11.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The same limitations are suggested in a case in this circuit (Montgomery v. C., B. &amp; Q. R. Co., 228 Fed. 616, 143 C. C. A. 138) which involved the right of a railway company to maintain an eating house on its line, to which it carried, free of freight, the food'and other supplies. This court there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">\u201cIt is conceded in the petition that it is lawful for defendant to ship, free of charge, such supplies, articles, or commodities as may be necessary and intended for its use in the conduct of its business as a common carrier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The facts show that the carrier was here selling mine products, chats, to the Belt, and delivering them to it, after an interstate carriage, for use in .ballasting the roadbed of the Belt. If these were all of the facts, there could be no question of the application of the tariff rate,, because the carriage would be as a common carrier for the benefit of the Belt. It would make no difference that the Belt was or was not obligated to so ballast its line under the original contract, or that the new contract was at the request of the receiver, because such circumstances would in no wise affect the character of the carriage, which is the test. But the agreed statement of facts contains statements that this ballast \u201cinured to the benefit of the plaintiff [receiver] in reduced operating expense,\u201d and that the ballast was put in \u201cfor the benefit of the plaintiff.\u201d Since the receiver was obligated, under the lease, to maintain the line during the lease term, and was to operate over the line, it is clear that the above statements show a benefit accruing to the carrier, other than the freight charges, from the transportation. But the carrier does not lose its character as .a common carrier because it receives from the transportation benefits or gains in addition to the freight charge. It must receive the entire substantial benefit. In short, the transportation must be, in substance, entirely for its own .use, in the conduct of its business as a common carrier, before it can ignore the tariff rates. No part of the agreed statement of facts undertakes to allege that the receiver would receive the sole substantial benefit from this ballasting. In fact, such a statement seems to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>been carefully avoided. The nearest approach thereto is a statement that the lease is for a term of ten years. This statement is insufficient for two reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">First, the lease (set forth in the evidence) is not for ten years and no agreed statement of the parties to the contrary can affect this court, because the issue here is one of concern, not only to the parties to this action, but to the public. The lease is for the duration of the receivership, which is entirely uncertain. The contract then provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">\"Upon the expiration of this lease, the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway Company, or any successor company which may purchase or operate its lines of railway after the termination of the present receivership, shall have the right, at its option, to adopt' and continue this lease in effect for a period equaling, together with the period leased by the receiver, ten (10) years from the date of this contract, and thereafter subject to termination on one year\u2019s written notice by either party thereafter given to the other of its desire and intention to terminate the same upon the expiration of such notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Second, we are nowhere informed as to the life of such ballasting. So far as we are advised, it may be as good at the end of the lease as at any time during the lease. In short, the Belt may, at the end of the lease, receive back its line well ballasted with chats, which would be a distinct addition to the value of its property. Again, the requirement of the contract that the property, which consisted entirely of trackage, should be \u201cmaintained\u201d by the lessee during the lease and turned back to the Belt \u201cin as good condition as when received, ordinary wear and tear excepted,\u201d requires that this ballasting, constituting a part of the leased property, should be kept up during the lease. I think the Belt has not only failed to sustain the burden of showing that the transportation of the chats was solely for the benefit of the receiver, but that the facts show clearly that a substantial benefit would accrue to the Belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">I think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
