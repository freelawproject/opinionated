The contract in question provided for defendant\u2019s employment as general manager for a period of six years at a salary of $10,000 a year and percentages of the net profits, ranging from 5 per cent, on profits above $20,000 to and including $30,000 to 20 per cent, of the net profits above $80,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-4\">The following is the opinion of Hough, Circuit Judge, delivered in the court below, and hereinafter referred to:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-5\">The structure of this hill is so simple and the facts (in the primary sense of things done, said, or written) so fully admitted or proven, that no elaborate fact findings are thought necessary. It is sufficient to state that I regard the bill as one falling under a well-known head of equity jurisdiction, viz. to set aside a contract obtained by fraud or attempted to be made ultra vires (as matter of form, it makes no difference which), and obtain an accounting for moneys procured by defendant under color and cover of said contract. But, while the facts are practically admitted, the inferences from them are seriously in dispute, and for this reason I note as separate findings the inferences drawn by me.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-6\">(1) Owing to the long continuance in office of more than three directors of plaintiff company, not only Moody, but all other persons concerned in the transaction complained of, were well warranted (entirely apart from all other considerations) in believing the board of seven directors to be fully authorized to act in all corporate matters properly cognizable by any board of directors. This tends to negative all actual fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-7\">(2) There is no proof of any mutual understanding or agreement between Moody and Robinson, whereby each of them or either of them agreed beforehand to vote for the other man\u2019s contract, in consideration of a like vote by that other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-8\">(3) At no time was there any actual fraud worked on the plaintiff by any action of any board of directors in increasing their own number, and their action was subsequently ratified by the shareholders. Bor many years before October, 1919, seven directors were the expressed and recorded wish of the stockholders of plaintiff\u2019s corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-9\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> (4) As an inference or conclusion of law, it is held that, after the stockholders\u2019 ratification at the latest, the plaintiff company was estopped from .questioning or denying the acts of the seven directors, or of a quorum' thereof, except for fraud or other malfeasance in office. That such estoppel may not have extended to the state of New York as the creator of the corporation is here immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-10\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> (5) While the mere amount of a promised compensation may be so ex, cessive as to be evidence of fraud, the method and quantum of the promised payment to Moody, having regard to the volume and nature of the plaintiff\u2019s business, was so clearly within the business discretion of plaintiff\u2019s board of directors that it must be held that there was no wrong, fraud, or malfeasance per se in promising to pay to Moody, or to pay to both Moody and Robinson, the amounts agreed upon in the contracts of October, 1919.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-11\">(6) In respect to so much of its alleged .cause of action as rests on the legal incapacity of the plaintiff through or by a quorum' of its directors to make the contract in suit, the plaintiff is not guilty of laches. In respect, however, of all allegations of actual or constructive fraud, or of moral turpitude, on the part of the defendant or other directors, \u00e1s there is no proof of the same, inquiry into laches is immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-12\">The foregoing findings sufficiently show that in my opinion this case is to be considered as if the seven men who honestly believed themselves directors of plaintiff in 1919, and who were honestly believed to be directors by the shareholders of the company, were in office both de jure and de facto. Thus the questions in the case become these:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-13\">(a) Could the board vote to one or more of their number largely increased compensation?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-14\">(b) Could the board make such compensation retroactive? and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>(c) Is the contract ot October 31, 1919, invalidated by the bald fact that without Robinson\u2019s vote, Moody\u2019s contract could not exist, and without Moody\u2019s vote Robinson\u2019s contract would not have been given?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-4\">On these questions, I hold as matter of fact and conclusions of law:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> (7) It is true that the Moody and Robinson contracts, and the antecedent increase in wage (as distinct from commissions) to Moody, were unknown to the majority shareholders\u2014i. e., the Smith interests, until after October 31, 1919; but just how long after that date they became aware of what had been done does not appear. But, the' matter being one of business and within the discretion of the board of directors, there was no legal, nor indeed moral, obligation on the directors or officers to consult or advise with the Smiths on any such matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-6\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> (8) As matter of law, the fact that the agreement of October 31, 1919, grants salary to date from January 1, 1919, does not per se invalidate this entire agreement. But, as matter of fact, the proofs show that Moody\u2019s increase from $600 per month to $833.33 per month was granted by Steele as president of the corporation early in the year 1919, to wit, in the month of March. In such increase of salary there was nothing fraudulent in fact, and I am satisfied from the evidence that not only this salary increase, but indeed the whole scheme of stimulating Moody and Robinson to vigorous effort, by making them quasi partners in the business by granting them shares of profits, was Steele\u2019s plan. He chose that plan out of several put to him by Moody and Robinson, and indeed personally advised it in so far as Moody and Robinson\u2019s commissions were to be computable, not upon sales, but upon \"net profits.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-7\">I further find as a fact that Steele honestly regarded this plan as the best for the welfare of the company and for his own interests as a shareholder. He was doubtless irritated by the Smith refusal to expedite the original plan of practical reincorporation, and by Mr. Smith\u2019s apparent refusal to meet and confer with him (Steele). He was determined to retain Moody and Robinson in the service, some such plan of increased remuneration was necessary to effect this result, and he (Steele) adopted and pushed through the plan, scheme, and contract now complained of. It is admittedly true that Moody expected Robinson to vote for the former\u2019s contract and e converso; but such expectation rested, not upon any agreement, corrupt or otherwise, between these two men, but- on the controlling fact that Steele, whom they both properly regarded as the head and chief of the corporation, had approved these two contracts, and Moody and Robinson depended upon Steele, \" and not upon each other, to carry through what were practically their bargains with Steele.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-8\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> (9) As a conclusion of law it is prima facie within the power of the president of a corporation existing under the law of New York to make any contract on behalf of the company which the directors of the company would have power to make by vote of the board; and the burden is on one who impeaches the president\u2019s authority. Such burden has hot been borne in this case in respect of Mr. Moody\u2019s increase in salary, which increase was actually made' by Steele as president not later than March, 1919, and which had been the subject of consideration by Steele, who had expressed favorable view thereof for some months previous; i. e., considerably before January 1, 1919.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-9\">(10) As a finding of fact it is my opinion that, regarding the history of this concern so far as we deal in evidence, the nature of its business, and the paucity of profits to and including 1918, it was a good business plan and one necessary for the growth of the corporate enterprise to attract and hold for a term of years skillful and vigorous managers, by making their compensation largely dependent upon an increase in business which they were themselves relied upon to bring about.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-10\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> It is true (and cognizance is taken thereof) that the years 1918-1919 were years of war, and that the product of this company was in governmental demand; but, even so, the enormous increase in the company\u2019s business and profits for 1919^-1920 is strong evidence justifying (in a business way) the Moody-Robinson contracts. Thus the case narrow's to inquiry whether, with honesty all around, with all the men concerned acting, not only without fraud, but in the exercise of a sound business discretion, what was done (or any part thereof) is so opposed to settled law as to require a declaration of nullity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>on the part of a chancellor. I do not think that a trial court is often the place for exhaustive discussion of cases; it is sufficient to indicate the view of the law entertained by the trial judge, and I shall do this as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-4\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> , All discussion concerning de facto and de jure directors is beside the mark. Doubtless the law is as laid down in Matter of Ringler, 204 N. Y. 30, 97 N. B. 593, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 1036; but this plaintiff, by its stockholders\u2019 action, is estopped from asserting this particular variety of act ultra vires. That the relation of a director to his corporation is that of a fiduciary is undoubted (Jacobson v. Brooklyn, etc., Co., 184 N. Y. 152, 76 N. E. 1075); and it is equally clear that all contracts made by boards of directors with one of their own number, or indeed with any \u201cinsider\u201d (to speak colloquially), are closely scrutinized in equity, and frequently overturned, when, if made ^ith strangers, they would be far more liberally viewed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-5\">It is not without interest to note that the leading cases (such as Godley v. Crandall, 212 N. Y. 121, 105 N. E. 818, L. R. A. 1915D, 632) on this point are brought by minority shareholders; whereas, this action is brought by the corporation itself. The minority holder is in the nature of things not estopped by corporate action in which he did not join; whereas, this corporation, and more particularly the Smith majority therein, is thoroughly estopped as to the illegality of the seven-director board. This point, however, does not affect the right of the corporation to complain of a contract obtained by actual or constructive fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-6\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> But none of the eases known to me goes so far as to lay down the rule that directors, in all honesty and for the benefit, not only presumed, but actual, of their corporation, may not hire one of their own number as general manager and increase his salary as seems best. There is no legal yardstick; every case stands on its own bottom, and the ultimate question always is whether the contract was honest and beneficial. The decisions relied upon by defendant\u2014McNab v. McNab Co., 62 Hun, 18, 16 N. Y. Supp. 448, affirmed 133 N. Y. 687, 31 N. E/627; Mitchell v. Forest, etc., Co., 107 Mise. 709, 176 N. Y. Supp. 157, affirmed 187 App. Div. 743, 176 N. Y. Supp. 157; Commercial, etc., Co. v. Northampton, etc., Co., 115 App. Div. 388, 100 N. Y. Supp. 960\u2014 seem to mo conclusive on this point. On the reason of the matter it would be inadvisable to lay down any hard and fast rule, or to make an/ legal yardstick. The question is always one of fact; i. e., was the bargain a good, fair, honest bargain? I find this bargain is entitled to all of those adjectives.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-7\"><bracketnum>[9]</bracketnum> It may further be observed that this question of a directors\u2019 dealing with his corporation is one of general law; wherefore (although no radical divergence is perceived between the federal decisions and those of New York) the rulings of the courts of the United States are of controlling authority. The general rule has been laid down in this circuit, in Re Franklin Brewing Co. (C. O. A.) 263 Fed. 512. Cowell v. McMillin, 177 Fed. 25, 100 C. C. A. 443, and Stewart v. St. Louis, etc., Co. (C. C.) *T Fed. 736, are relevant. My view of the main case may be summed up thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-8\">The bill primarily rests on the theory that all the acts of the directors of 1919 were null, because there never was any legal board after the stockholders assumed to create more than three directors. The corporation, by the action of its shareholders, is estopped from asserting or maintaining this position. Thus the primary object of the bill fails; but there are sufficient allegations therein to require an answer to the question whether, in making the arrangements that were made with Moody and Robinson, the majority of the board of directors were or were not guilty of fraud, actual or constructive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-9\">' I do not care to enter into the difference (if there be one) between these two kinds of frauds. It has been held as a matter of fact that there was no fraud, and as matter of law that, where the influence (but not the actual vote) of a director is used <em>to </em>procure corporate action of pecuniary benefit to himself, the trans\u00e1etion is not void, but voidable, and reasons must be found to make it voidable. In my opinion no reason is found in this record. Therefore the bill, viewed as one to obtain rescission on the ground of fraud, also fails.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-10\">In making the above rulings it may be noted that no compensation of any kind has been given to either Moody or Robinson for his services as director. The office or employment of general manager or of sales manager was entirely distinct from the directorate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><bracketnum>[10]</bracketnum> Thus is reached the counterclaim, a pleading singularly like that shown in American Surety Co. v. American Mills Co. (2d C. C. A., April 13, 1921) 273 Fed. 67. This counterclaim is a pure action at law, to which fact I called the attention of parties at the outset of the case; but nevertheless both sides have gone on, taken testimony, argued the matter, and neither in pleadings, nor during the taking of testimony, or at the close thereof, has any effort been made to get the counterclaim out of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-4\">I am not sure whether a court of equity is required to consider and enforce a counterclaim of this nature; but the decision last cited is sufficient authority for saying that the trial court in equity is permitted, in the absence of any objection, so to consider and decide the defendant\u2019s demand. 'For this reason I shall proceed to do so.

In an action so brought and tried before the expiration of term, the rule of damages is not different from that laid down years ago in Howard v. Daly, 61 N. Y. 362, 19 Am. Rep. 2S5, a decision which is one of Prof. Dwight\u2019s essays on historic law. It was followed without any discussion in this circuit in Park, etc., Co. <em>r. </em>Bushnell, 60 Fed. 583, 9 C. C.

Labatt, Master and Servant, vol. 1, p. 1091 et seq., and the cases cited. Under these authorities such cases as Sehroeder v. California, etc., Co. (D. C.) 95 Fed. 296, and Darst v. Mathieson, etc., Works (O. C.) 81 Fed. 294, must be regarded as overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-7\">The testimony on damages before this court is indeed small. It is known that Moody received his last monthly salary in October, 1920,, and that since that time he has obtained no remunerative occupation. But it is also true that by his own evidence he does not want salaried employment. My inference is that he is in his own estimation above it; he is looking for an opportunity to enter a business or found one as a partner or the equivalent of a partner. In short, he is making no effort to find salaried employment at any rate of compensation, and he does not intend to make such effort at present. As for his commissions, it is in evidence that after, and inferably in large part as a result of the labors of the defendant and Robinson, th\u00ae plaintiff\u2019s profits jumped from a little over $4,000 in 1917, through about $29,-000 in 1918, to upwards of $150,000, in 1918, and more than $160,000 in 1920. There the evidence stops, except for the statement of plaintiff\u2019s auditor that it would be impossible, except as the result of some months of work, to state the profits of the company for the elapsed portion of 1921, while as for the future there is no evidence, and\"it appears to me that in the nature of things there can be none.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-8\"><bracketnum>[13]</bracketnum> It is, however, legitimate to mention that of which the court may take cognizance, viz. that the present and an indefinite time for the future is a period of great business depression, with profits small and dividends largely absent. Such times of scarcity recur according to obscure laws, and it is perhaps for this reason that the average of the past is usually considered as some evidence (not very good) of the probable occurrences of the future. At all events, this is the best evidence that this case affords.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-9\">Before considering these figures, two questions raised at the hearing may he considered;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-10\">(1) In computing net profits is it permissible to charge off (for instance) against the apparent excess of sales over expenses in 1919 losses incurred before 1919, but becoming hopeless in that year? In other words, how much of suspense account or its equivalent should be charged off in any one fiscal year?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>(2) Is the percentage of Moody\u2019s commissions computable before or after the payment for the year of computation of excess profits or income tax.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-4\">Neither of these questions, when it comes to assessing damages as by a jury, is of vital importance in dollars and cents, but my view of them is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-5\"><bracketnum>[14-16]</bracketnum> Cognizance is taken of the practice of bookkeepers or accountants to carry what is the equivalent of a suspense account; i. e., for example, still to carry as an asset, but a doubtful one, demands the enforcement of which Is doubtful, but not hopeless. Exactly how much of such doubtful assets may be charged off in one year is a matter of degree. Contracts are to be interpreted as far as possible in the light of experience, and of the experience of the men who made them. Both parties to this contract knew that a reasonable amount of charging off of depreciation, suspense, and the like was customary in all good bookkeeping, and there is no evidence in this case that any more charging off was done than was reasonably to be expected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-6\"><bracketnum>[17]</bracketnum> As to the second proposition, I agree with the reasoning of Patton, etc., Syndicate v. Etherington, [1919] 1 Ch. 306, in respect of excess profits tax. As to the national income tax I express no opinion, because after reflection the whole amount involved is loo small to affect results. The point is very perplexing, as I am firmly of opinion that no well-advised employer would use the phrase \u201cnet profits\u201d so that a servant, in receipt of commission, would be sure of his share of what the agreement called \u201cprofits,\u201d and yet, after paying the so-called income tax, the employer would have no profits left.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-7\">On the other hand, contemporary exposition is always of great importance, and it is in evidence th\u00e1t Moody was paid his share of net profits for 1919 before the deduction of any income tax, and such payment was treated in the return as an expense of the business, which in one sense it certainly was. This procedure was in accord with the intimation of Bennett v. Millville, etc., Co., 67 N. J. Law, at page 323, 51 Atl. 706. In short, it does not seem to me that solution of this problem is necessary in this ease; but I admit being influenced in respect of the.quantity of Moody\u2019s recovery by what I conceive to be the plain intention of the parties, however difficult it may be to work out such intention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-8\"><bracketnum>[18]</bracketnum> Thus is reached* assessment of defendant\u2019s damages. As has been often said, he may recover \u201cprospective damages,\u201d which phrase means no more than compensation for lack of future employment. It may be admitted that such damages may consist in \u201cthe contract price unpaid, in the absence of proof by [the employer] that plaintiff might have obtained other employment\u201d American, etc., Co. v. Boyd (C. C.) 148 Fed. 258.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-9\">But there must always be some evidence on which to base any recovery. In the matter' of wages or salary, there is always the evidence of the rate agreed upon between the parties, which was to continue through the term of employment; but in respect of commissions there is no evidence, except that of past years, and in the nature of things there can be no other evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-10\"><bracketnum>[19,20]</bracketnum> But the sentence above quoted from the Boyd Case (which is itself but a quotation from Sedgwick on Damages) does not infringe upon the rule that it is incumbent upon the discharged employee to exercise reasonable diligence in seeking other employment; nor does it mean that the evidence moving the court must be introduced by the employer. Any party who takes the witness stand may, and often does, give evidence unfavorable to some branches of his own contention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-11\"><bracketnum>[21]</bracketnum> It is to me a most weighty consideration that Mr. Moody has not sought, and does not intend to seek, salaried employment; he does not want it; he prefers what most men regard as a higher and more independent style of occupation. He should therefore be entitled to that indefinite period, a \u201creasonable time,\u201d to seek and find or make the business that he wants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-12\">It is matter of fact only, and really no more than an explanation of how the mind of this particular court functions when acting as a sort of jury; but I do hold that that reasonable time had not expired when this trial was begun, say June 1, 1921, and that therefore Mr. Moody is entitled to recover at the least what would have been his salary from the time of discharge to said June 1st, and his commissions on profits for the year 1920. These sums amount in my opinion to $29,185.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>He is also, entitled as prospective damages to compensation for losing the chance of continuing to get salary at the rate of $833.33 per month for three years and seven months, and to his chance of getting commissions for four years. Of course, the salary rate is certainly known, as above pointed out; but on this evidence I cannot estimate the future profits of this company at any more than the average profits for the years whose financial history has been proven. Such average is between $60,000 and $70,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-4\">When an employee, unjustly discharged, brings instant suit and promptly tries his cause, he has elected to submit his claim on testimony far less certain than would perhaps be the case if he waited for events to develop. He must be taken to prefer promptness to certainty. I do not think any one can say with any basis of fact to go on that, if Mr. Moody had continued to serve this plaintiff until the end of the six-year period, he would have received in salary and commissions after June 1, 1921, all told more than about $54,000. It is no more than a \u201cjury guess\u201d; it cannot he anything else; but, in my opinion, it will reasonably compensate him for the loss of that chance to presently award him $25,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-5\">It follows that a decree may be entered, dismissing the bill of complaint herein and sustaining the counterclaim, with an award of a money judgment in favor of the defendant Moody and against the plaintiff heroin for $54,185, together with the costs of this cause.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-6\">Davis, Wagner, Heater &amp; Holton, of New York City (Arnold E.

The answer, inter alia, set up a counterclaim, and asked for a decree or judgment for such counterclaim. The District Court entered a decree dismissing the bill of complaint, with costs, and ordering judgment in favor of defendant and against plaintiff on the counterclaim for $54,185, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">At the outset of the case, the District Court pointed out to counsel that the counterclaim was an action at law. As said by the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">\u201cNevertheless, both sides have gone on, taken testimony, argued the matter, and neither in pleadings, nor during the taking of testimony, or at the close thereof, has any effort been made to get the counterclaim out of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">The court then proceeded to consider the counterclaim, and determined the issue in favor of defendant, as above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\"><bracketnum>[22]</bracketnum> Plaintiff appealed from the final decree, and also took a writ of error to the judgment on the counterclaim. In respect of the writ of error, no bill of exceptions'was settled, allowed, or filed, and no assignments of error, as required by rule 10 of this court (235 Fed. vi, 148 C. C. A. vi), were filed.
