Because, however, the trial judge failed to charge the jury on self-defense, we are constrained to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction for aggravated assault and remand for a new trial. We affirm defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence for the unlawful possession of a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">During trial, differing accounts of the incident unfolded. On July 5, 1995, at approximately 11:20 p.m. the victim, Erv-Wakine Smith, Archie Crooks, Tamara Bush, Shakisa Lawson, and Malcolm Stohall were walking down the middle of Amherst Street in East Orange. As they proceeded down the street, they observed defendant \u201cstanding on the comer ... rolling up a blunt\u201d of marijuana. Lawson called defendant \u201cPuff Daddy.\u201d Defendant noticed that the victim was staring at him and asked, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d or, \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">The victim then walked toward defendant and asked him what he had said. The victim testified that when he was three or four feet in front of defendant, defendant pulled out a gun from his waistband and put the gun to the victim\u2019s head. The victim questioned defendant\u2019s actions and when defendant cocked the gun and \u201cstarted squeezing the trigger,\u201d the victim grabbed defendant\u2019s arm in an attempt to avoid being shot. A straggle ensued and the victim attempted to run away. \u201cAs [he] pushed off and went to run, [defendant] pulled the trigger.\u201d The victim was shot in his lower abdomen.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">Defendant\u2019s account of the incident was different. He agreed that he was in the area \u201crolling a blunt,\u201d of marijuana, when he heard the voices of the victim and his companions. He testified that he looked up and noticed that the victim was staring at him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>He asked the victim if \u201cthere was a problem\u201d and the victim and another member of the group \u201cbegan charging\u201d him. He said that he was afraid \u201cthat they might try to jump\u201d him. He further reiterated that the two were \u201crushing [him] at the time\u201d and that \u201cthey [were] going\u201d to \u201cattack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">As a result, defendant pulled out a gun and \u201cwaved it around,\u201d intending to cause the two to \u201cback off.\u201d The victim grabbed the gun and a struggle ensued. During the struggle the gun discharged and a bullet struck the victim. Defendant was aware that the victim was shot, however, he ran from the scene. He testified that he never put the gun to the victim\u2019s head and that he pulled out the gun to scare the victim. He said he never intended to shoot anyone. After the shooting, defendant took the gun to a junkyard located in Newark and watched as the gun was melted down with a welding torch.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Here, defendant\u2019s request for a charge on self defense was denied by the trial judge. The judge concluded that there was no evidence to support a self-defense charge and further that defendant\u2019s theory of the case was that the shooting was an accident. We first observe that the defenses of accident and self-defense are not mutually exclusive. There is \u201cno inconsistency between a defense of self-defense and a defense of accidentally wounding the particular victim.\u201d <em>State v. Giberson, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>241, 246, 379 A.2d 480 (App.Div.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Having determined that the two defenses are not inconsistent, however, does not alone justify a charge of self-defense. In <em>State v. Burks, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>595, 506 A.2d 779 (App.Div.1986), we summarized the elements of self-defense as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4a provides that the \u201cuse of force upon or toward another person is justifiable when the actor reasonably believes that [it] is immediately necessary\u201d for his self-protection \u201con the present occasion.\u201d As a general rule, \u201ca person employing protective force may estimate the necessity\u201d of its use \u201cwithout retreats ing.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4b(3). However, \u201c[t]he use of deadly force is not justifiable ... unless the actor reasonably believes that [it] is necessary to protect himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>against death or serious bodily harm.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4b(2). Nor is it justifiable if the actor \u201cknows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4b(2)(b). Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-llb, the term \u201cdeadly force\u201d means \u201cforce which the actor uses with the purpose of causing or which he knows to create a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">[Id. at 604, 506 A.2d 779 (citations omitted) (alterations in original.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u201c[T]he right of self-defense \u2018is measured against necessity.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Harmon, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>216, 223, 496 A.2d 707 (App.Div. 1985) (citation omitted), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>189, 516 A.2d 1047 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">The trial judge must charge the jury on self-defense \u201cif any evidence raising the issue is adduced, either in the State\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s case____\u201d <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 200, 478 A.2d 364 (1984). <em>See State v. Bryant, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>27, 35, 671 A.2d 1058 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>589, 677 A.2d 761 (1996). Further, once evidence \u201cof self-defense is adduced, ... then the jury must be instructed that the State is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the self-defense claim does not accord with the facts____\u201d <em>State v. Kelly, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 200, 478 A.2d 364. Here, we conclude that a rational basis for a charge of self-defense is present in the evidence. During his direct examination defendant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-14\">Q: Why did you pull [the gun] out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-15\">A: Because I thought, I didn\u2019t know what they was going to do. They was just charging me, charging at me like, you know what I\u2019m saying, like I did something to them when I just asked them a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-16\">Q: Were you afraid at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-17\">A: \u25a0 Yes, a lot of thoughts was running through my mind. I didn\u2019t know what was going to go on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-18\">Q: What were you afraid of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-19\">A: I was afraid they might try to jump me or take my weed or something like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-20\">During cross-examination, in response to the question whether the victim and his companions had attacked defendant, he said: \u201cThey was going to, yes.\u201d With the above evidence, the trial judge erred in not charging self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>We note that when defendant pulled out the gun from his waistband, if his testimony is believed, his waving of the gun was not a display of deadly force. \u201cA threat to cause death or serious bodily harm, by the production of a weapon or otherwise, so long as the actor\u2019s purpose is limited to creating an apprehension that he will use deadly force if necessary, does not constitute deadly force.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-11b.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The confrontation here that led to the shooting of the victim took place on a public street. There is no evidence that either the victim or his companions were armed with any weapons. Despite the lack of weapons, \u201cour statutes do not require the actor to retreat under such circumstances even though such an opportunity is at hand and is clearly apparent.\u201d <em>State v. Harmon, swpra, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 223, 496 A.2d 707 (footnote omitted). Defendant could have retreated, and had he done so, this shooting may not have resulted. The duty to retreat, however, applies only to the use of deadly force. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4b(2)(b). \u201cThus, <em>N.J.S.A, </em>2C:3-4a permits an individual to display or brandish a firearm or other weapon when the need for self-protection is reasonably perceived and he merely intends to create an apprehension in the aggressor that he will use deadly force if necessary.\u201d <em>State v. Harmon, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 223, 496 A.2d 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">We question the wisdom of a policy that permits an individual to brandish a handgun on a public street in circumstances such as these when retreat is readily available. This is particularly so when, \u201cthe dangers presented by the modern proliferation of handguns in the possession of millions of citizens including, of course, many violent criminalsf,]\u201d is well documented. <em>State in re of H.B., </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>243, 245, 381 A.2d 759 (1977). Because of the present state of our law, however, we are constrained to reverse defendant\u2019s aggravated assault conviction because there is evidence to support a self-defense instruction. There is evidence here that, although the victim and his companions were unarmed, defendant viewed the display of a handgun as a necessity. <em>See State v. Abbott, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>63, 69, 174 A.2d 881 (1961). Any change in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>policy that would prohibit defendant\u2019s conduct under these circumstances must come from the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In light of our decision, we need not consider the other issues raised by defendant. As we noted, <em>supra, </em>the remaining issues lack sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence for aggravated assault are reversed. His conviction and sentence for the unlawful possession of a handgun are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
