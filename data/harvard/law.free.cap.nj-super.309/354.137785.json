The jury found defendant guilty. Thereafter, the trial judge found defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>dant guilty of disorderly persons possession of burglary tools. Concurrent sentences were eventually imposed: five years imprisonment with two-and-one-half years of parole ineligibility for the third degree crime and six months for the disorderly persons offense. In the March 10, 1997 judgment of conviction the trial court provided for 514 days of custodial credit, and \u201crequest[ed] all drug and alcohol programs be made available to defendant.\u201d Appropriate statutory assessments were also ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Defendant was tried in jailhouse garb, described by counsel as \u201cdetention greens and ... blue canvas slip-ons.\u201d His argument that he was denied a fair trial by reason of that fact is premised upon a violation of the standards established in <em>State v. Carrion-Collazo, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>103, 534 A.2d 21 (App.Div.1987), <em>certif. denied, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>171, 540 A.2d 171 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In <em>Carrion-Collazo, </em>an appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s post-conviction relief application, we held, largely on the basis of <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 <em>U.S. </em>501, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1691, 48 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>126, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>954, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>3182, 49 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>1194 (1976), that the defendant, by reason of the extant circumstances, had suffered no deprivation of a federally guaranteed due process right. \u201cUnder <em>Williams, </em>the federal rule of law is that where defendant is represented by counsel, a waiver of defendant\u2019s right not to be compelled to appear at trial in prison garb is implied from defendant\u2019s failure to object.\u201d <em>State v. CarrionCollazo, supra, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 111, 534 A2d 21. We noted that there was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\n<em>Ubid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Notwithstanding this conclusion, we went on to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5_\">express our concern that certain unfortunate defendants may in the future, without regard to a tactical or strategic trial decision, suffer an erosion of their presumption of innocence due to the unavailability of civilian clothing. <em>See Coffin v. United States, </em>156 <em>U.S. </em>432, 15 <em>S.Ct. </em>394, 39 <em>L. Ed.481 </em>(1895) concerning the importance of this presumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\"><em>Cf. State v. Burton, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 288-290, 706 A.2d 1181, 1184-1186 (App.Div.1998). We found it unnecessary to posit broader protection under the State Constitution in this connection than is afforded by the federal Constitution, but rather established protective procedures to be followed in all future cases.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">[E]ven in the absence of a constitutional requirement, future criminal defendants appearing for a jury trial in prison garb should be personally questioned by the trial judge concerning their desire to relinquish the right to appear in civilian clothing and that this right should be given up only by means of a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver on the record before the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">* * Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">[T]he interests of justice are better served by trial judges ensuring that all future defendants in this State are advised of their right to wear civilian clothing and that defendants proceed to trial in prison garb only after explicit in-court waivers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">Moreover, when a request for civilian clothing or a precautionary <em>voir dire </em>or jury charge is made by a defendant or his counsel such request may not be denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-13\"><em>[Id. </em>at 112-13, 534 A.2d 21.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">These procedures were not followed here. The trial judge not only omitted to question defendant directly concerning defendant\u2019s choices relative to the question of trial attire, he made no effort to obviate the potential for prejudice by a proper <em>voir dire </em>of the jurors, as the trial judge in <em>Carrion-Collazo </em>had done, <em>see id. </em>at 112, 534 A.2d 21; and his cautionary instruction was inadequate, whether measured by the thorough instruction provided by the trial judge in <em>Carriorv-Collazo, see id. </em>at 106-07, 534 A.2d 21, or by a simple rule of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">The question whether defendant was guilty of an attempted burglary required the jury to assess his intentions, <em>i.e., </em>his state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>mind, when he was found with certain implements in the rear of a store, banging on the concrete wall. The prejudice inherent in his appearance before the jury in prison garb with no adequate curative steps having been taken is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Defendant\u2019s conviction by the judge for possession of burglary tools must also be reversed. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-5, under which defendant was charged, also requires an assessment of intent or state of mind. The trial judge\u2019s determination in this regard was expressly based upon the jury\u2019s verdict on the attempted burglary charge and thus flawed in the same manner as was the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Accordingly, both convictions are reversed. This disposition renders moot defendant\u2019s second argument on appeal that the law of the case doctrine required his commitment to a long-term inpatient drug treatment program in lieu of a prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
