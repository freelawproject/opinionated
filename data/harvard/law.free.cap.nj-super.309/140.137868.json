He was also assessed a $2,400.00 V.C.C.B. penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Scott was sentenced as follows: count sixteen was merged into count fifteen and on count fifteen Scott was sentenced to an extended term of life imprisonment with twenty-five years parole ineligibility for the attempted first degree murder of Officer O\u2019Connor; count twenty was merged into count nineteen and on count nineteen to a consecutive term of twenty years imprisonment with ten years parole ineligibility for the attempted first degree murder of Officer Lopez; on count four, to a consecutive term of ten years imprisonment with five years parole ineligibility for the second degree aggravated assault of Johnson; on count one, to a concurrent sentence of ten years imprisonment with five years parole ineligibility for conspiracy to commit the second degree robbery of Johnson; on count eight, five years imprisonment with two and one-half years parole ineligibility for third degree hindering apprehension; on counts twenty-three, twenty-four, and twenty-five, five years imprisonment with two and one-half years parole ineligibility for each of the third degree unlawful possession of weapons counts; and on counts twelve and twenty-two, eighteen months imprisonment with eighteen months parole ineligibility for each of the two fourth degree aggravated assault counts. The court merged count twenty-six, second degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, with counts twelve, fifteen, nineteen, and twenty-two. Thus, Scott\u2019s aggregate sentence is life imprisonment plus thirty years, with forty years of parole ineligibility. The court also imposed a $2,200.00 V.C.C.B. penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Defendants\u2019 convictions stemmed from related incidents that began at approximately 4 p.m on May 28, 1991, involving Corey Johnson. Johnson was in a liquor store when he was approached by Rainey and co-defendant Maurice Davis who robbed him of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>$114.00 at gunpoint and attempted to abduct him. Johnson resisted their efforts to force him into a gray Cadillac Seville and escaped, but in doing so was shot in the head. Investigation would later reveal that the Cadillac Seville was owned by Milda Rainey, Maurice Davis\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Eric Hankerson (Eric) informed Officers Lopez and O\u2019Connor that he believed the individuals involved in shooting Johnson were in a white Chevette. The three individuals, later identified as the three defendants, Rainey, Scott and Davis, had previously approached Eric and asked him if he knew \u201cMalik.\u201d Scott was then armed with a shotgun. Erie also reported that he saw an Uzi in the backseat of the car that Rainey was driving with Scott and Davis as passengers. Eric said that he had seen the same three men in a gray Cadillac Seville two days before, and the same three in the same ear the day before Johnson was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Later that evening, Lopez and O\u2019Connor stopped the Chevette that Eric described. Shots were fired from the Chevette at the officers, and a chase ensued. Rainey, who was driving the car, jumped out of the car while it was moving and exchanged gunfire with two other police officers, Cefalu and Zamora. Rainey ran from the scene and was apprehended later in a garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">In the meantime, the driverless Chevette crashed. By this time, the four police officers already identified were joined by three more, Connolly, Montalvo and Russo. Scott and Davis fired at the officers, and the officers returned the fire. Defendant Scott was shot in the buttock and defendant Davis was shot in the shoulder during the incident. Davis was found in the backseat of the car in a fetal position cradling a machine gun in his arms. Scott was found to be in possession of a loaded .380 semiautomatic in an ankle holster. An expert witness would later testify that the bullet that wounded Johnson came from that gun. A shotgun was also recovered from the scene. Evidence offered at trial showed that the shotgun was owned by Samuel Johnson, who lived in Virginia with his daughter, L\u00e1veme Scott. The State contended that Laverne Scott was defendant Scott\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Tony Hankerson (Tony), Eric\u2019s brother, gave a statement to the police concerning his knowledge of the incident resulting in the shooting of Johnson. He said that on May 28, 1991, at approximately 4 p.m., he was in a delicatessen in Newark when he saw defendant Scott get out of a gray Cadillac Seville and walk into the delicatessen. Scott then asked those in the store if anyone had seen \u201cFella,\u201d Corey Johnson\u2019s apparent nickname. Scott also inquired about a person named \u201cSkeet.\u201d Tony replied that he had not seen either \u201cFella\u201d or \u201cSkeet.\u201d Tony then left, and last saw Scott using the telephone inside the store. The evidence would reveal that the delicatessen was only a few buildings away from the liquor store where Johnson was accosted by Rainey and Davis. Tony later recanted his statement concerning his encounter with Scott in the delicatessen, but his statement was admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Defendants have raised numerous issues on appeal.

WHETHER THE CUMULATIVE ERROR DOCTRINE APPLIES IN THIS CASE?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">We have reviewed the record in light of the issues presented and are satisfied that any error that we shall identify herein did not have the capacity to affect the result. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">[At the request of the court, only point I merits publication, and, therefore, the remaining points are omitted.]</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">During the jury selection phase of the trial, the attorney for Rainey requested that the trial court compel the prosecutor to disclose his reasons for challenging five particular jurors. He maintained that the court had authority to do so pursuant to <em>State v. Gilmore, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>508, 511 A.2d 1150 (1986). His request was based on the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>[According to what I saw, juror number 920, black male, had no answers positive to any of the questions that were asked by the Court, either yesterday or today; juror number 836, another young black male, also no answers to any of the questions; juror number 709, a black female, did have some answers to some questions yesterday regarding guns, police officers, victim of a crime; juror number 950, a black female, had no answers; elderly woman, one sitting in seat 14 \u2014 -juror number 948, again, just recently, his last challenge, only answers to any questions she had, that she sat on a civil jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">However, counsel said he was not making a formal <em>Gilmore </em>motion because he did not want the court to dismiss the jurors who had been selected and did not want the court to quash the remaining venire. Counsel for Scott and Davis subsequently joined in the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Judge Cooper stated that, in light of defendants\u2019 narrow request, he would not order the prosecutor to provide reasons for any of his peremptory challenges, unless defendants wanted the court to strike the existing jury panel, since that was the remedy that the Supreme Court provided for in <em>State v. Gilmore. </em>Judge Cooper explained that, under <em>Gilmore, </em>if a defendant establishes that the prosecutor has improperly excluded potential jurors on the basis of race, then the entire panel had to be dismissed and the jury selection process must begin anew. Defense counsel disagreed with Judge Cooper\u2019s interpretation of <em>Gilmore, </em>arguing that the discharge of the entire panel was not the sole remedy provided by the <em>Gilmore </em>decision. We agree with Judge Cooper\u2019s interpretation of <em>Gilmore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">In <em>Gilmore, </em>our Supreme Court determined that under our state constitution a state prosecutor is forbidden from exercising \u201cperemptory challenges to remove potential petit jurors who are members of a cognizable group on the basis of their presumed group bias.\u201d 103 <em>N.J. </em>517, 511 A.2d 1150. The <em>Gilmore </em>decision followed the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>79, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), in which the Court held that the use of peremptory challenges to discriminate on the basis of race is a denial of equal protection of the laws. There, the United States Supreme Court set forth a burden shifting test to determine whether or not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>challenge was made on a discriminatory basis, requiring the defense to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing that the prosecutor exercised his peremptory strikes in a discrimininatory manner toward a protected cognizable group, and then, once that burden-is met, the State has the burden of coming forward with a neutral explanation for challenging the jurors. <em>Batson, supra, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>at 97, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1723, 90 L.Ed.2d at 88. Although for the purposes of this case we need not recount in detail that process, suffice it to say that our Supreme Court in <em>Gilmore </em>adopted essentially the same procedure as a matter of state constitutional law as the <em>Batson </em>Court did on federal constitutional grounds. <em>See Gilmore, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>533-39, 511 A.2d 1150; 103 <em>N.J. </em>at 545-46, 511 A.2d 1150 (O\u2019Hem, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The crux of this appeal deals not with the process of determining a <em>Batson-Gilmore </em>violation, but rather requires us to determine the appropriate remedial action a trial court should take if in fact a violation exists. On this issue, the United States Supreme Court left the task of prescribing the appropriate remedy to the states.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">In light of the variety of jury selection practices followed by our federal and state trial courts, we make no attempt to instruct these courts how best to implement our holding today. For the same reasons, we express no view on whether it is more appropriate in a particular case, upon a finding of discrimination against black jurors, for the trial court to discharge the venire and select a new jury from a panel not previously associated with the case ... or to disallow the discriminatory challenges and resume selection with the improperly challenged jurors reinstated on the venire____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\"><em>[Batson, supra, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>at 100 n. 24, 106 <em>S.Ct </em>at 1725 n. 24, 90 L.Ed.2d at 90 n. 24.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">In <em>Gilmore, </em>our Supreme Court directed the trial courts on how to proceed after it has determined that the prosecutor exercised challenges in an unconstitutional manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">In the final analysis, the trial court must judge the defendant\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case against the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal to determine whether the defendant has carried the ultimate burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the prosecution exercised its peremptory challenges on constitutionally-impermissible grounds of presumed group bias. If the defendant is found to have sustained this burden, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the court must then conclude that the <em>jury </em>as constituted fails to comply with the representative cross-section requirement, and it must dismiss the jurors thus far selected. So too <em>it must quash any remaining venire, since the complaining party is entitled to a random draw from an entire venire </em>\u2014 not <em>one that has been partially or totally stripped of members of a cognizable group by the improper use of peremptory challenges. </em>Upon such dismissal a different venire <em>shall </em>be drawn and the jury selection process may begin anew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\"><em>[State v. Gilmore, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 539, 511 A.2d 1150 (citing <em>People v. Wheeler, </em>22 <em>Cal</em>.3d 258, 148 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>890, 906, 583 <em>P.</em>2d 748, 765 (1978)) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In the present ease, the attorneys for the defendants did not want the court to strike the jury panel. Thus, they withdrew their motions. In doing so, however, the defendants eschewed the only remedy that the <em>Gilmore </em>decision permits when the State has impermissibly exercised peremptory challenges. Their argument on appeal that the trial court should have fashioned some other remedy is without support in New Jersey. The only appropriate remedy is to start with a new venire that has not been impermissibly stripped of minority membership. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Our decision in this regard is not without consideration of the decisions from other jurisdictions that have implemented other remedies to a <em>Batson-Gilmore </em>type violation. Our research reveals that the majority of jurisdictions having addressed the issue leave the decision of determining the appropriate remedy within the discretion of the trial judge to reseat the wrongfully challenged venireperson. <em>See Morning v.

Only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>handful of jurisdictions have taken the position that the entire venire must be discharged. <em>See State v. McCollum, </em>334 <em>N.C. </em>208, 433 S.E.2d 144,159 (1993); <em>State v. Jones, </em>293 <em>S.C. </em>54, 358 <em>S.E.2d </em>701, 704 (1987); <em>People v.

Nonetheless, we are bound by the holding of <em>Gilmore. Gilmore </em>unequivocally requires that the entire venire be discharged and the selection process begin anew where there has been an unconstitutional use of a peremptory challenge. We find it to be no coincidence that the decision relied on most heavily in <em>Gilmore, People v. Wheeler, supra, </em>expressly adopts the same remedy. If the rule in <em>Gilmore </em>is to be reevaluated and modified in light of the weight of authority across the nation, that direction can only be given by our Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-12\"> Maurice Davis was also tried with Rainey and Scott. His appeal has been withdrawn. Separate appeals were filed by Rainey and Scott. They were scheduled back-to-back on our calendar. We now consolidate them for the purpose of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
