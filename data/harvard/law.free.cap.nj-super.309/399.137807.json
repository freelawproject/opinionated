The issue presented on appeal is whether plaintiff qualified for an alternate \u201cbase year\u201d calculation pursuant to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(c)(3). We disagree with the Board\u2019s interpretation of the statute and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The following facts appear undisputed in the record before us. On January 15, 1994, plaintiff was employed by Metro Service Company when he was caused to leave his employment on that date because of a back injury incurred one year earlier. He came under the care of Dr. Barolat, a Philadelphia physician approved by his employer. Dr. Barolat performed surgery on plaintiff after which plaintiff received physical therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">In December 1995, plaintiff attempted to return to work. He was informed by his employer that he could not return until he received a physician\u2019s certificate releasing him for work. Plaintiff immediately scheduled an appointment with Dr. Barolat for an unspecified date in December 1995 for that purpose. However, according to plaintiff, and verified by a letter from Dr. Barolat\u2019s office, his appointment was canceled due to bad weather conditions. An appointment scheduled for \u201cearly January\u201d 1996 was also canceled for the same reason. Dr. Barolat was unable to see plaintiff until January 24, 1996, at which time he released plaintiff to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Upon presenting Dr. Barolat\u2019s certificate to his employer on the following day, plaintiff was advised that there was no position available for him. On January 25, 1996, plaintiff filed a claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>unemployment compensation benefits. A Division Deputy denied his claim, and plaintiff appealed to the Appeals Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">On March 14,1996, a hearing was conducted before the Appeals Tribunal. Plaintiff was represented by counsel. At issue was the interpretation of the following statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">With respect to a benefit year commencing on or after June 1, 1990 for an individual who immediately preceding the benefit year was subject to a disability compensable under the provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation law ..., \u201cbase year\u201d shall mean the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individual\u2019s period of disability, if the period of disability was not longer than two years, if the employment held by the individual immediately preceding the period of disability is no longer available at the conclusion of that period and if the individual files a valid claim for unemployment benefits after the conclusion of that period. <em>For the purposes of this paragraph, \u201cperiod of disability\" means the period from the time at whick the individual becomes unable to work because of the compensable disability until the time that the individual becomes able to resume work </em>and continue work on a permanent basis____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>43:21 \u2014 19(c)(3) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The specific issue before the Appeals Tribunal was whether plaintiffs \u201cperiod of disability\u201d was \u201clonger than two years.\u201d Plaintiff contended at the hearing that the statute should be \u201cliberally construed\u201d and contended that but for the weather conditions Dr. Barolat would have issued the back-to-work order in December 1995, well before the January 15, 1996, anniversary date. The Appeals Examiner conceded that the issue presented was a novel one.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">On March 19, 1996, the Appeals Examiner issued his opinion denying plaintiffs claim. The crux of his decision is found in the following passage from the opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">The claimant contends that his original doctor\u2019s appointment was scheduled for 12/95 but was rescheduled twice because of inclement weather. As a result, the claimant\u2019s claim for Unemployment Insurance Benefits was filed late after the statutory two year period. While this Tribunal can emphasize (sic)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with the claimant\u2019s predicament, there is no precedent derision which would allow the validation of a claim which was filed after the two year statutory limit. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the Unemployment Insurance Claim dated 1/21/96 is invalid in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(e)(3) as it was filed late.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">On appeal to the Board of Review, the decision of the Appeals Examiner was affirmed for the reasons stated by the examiner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">We are not bound by the Board\u2019s determination of a purely legal issue. <em>Mayflower Sec. Co., Inc. v. Bureau of Sec., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973). Our purpose is to construe the statute so as to effect the legislative intent, mindful that the statute is remedial in nature and should be liberally construed. <em>DiPasquale v. Board of Review, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>341, 345, 669 A.2d 275 (App. Div.1996) (citing <em>Roig v. Kelsey, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>500, 515, 641 A.2d 248 (1994) and <em>Teichler v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>585, 133 A.2d 320 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The Appeals Examiner interpreted the statute to preclude a claim such as this simply because plaintiff filed his claim after the two year anniversary date of the commencement of his disability. In doing so, the Appeals Examiner did not give full meaning to the words of the statute. Although the statute contains a temporal component as a condition for qualification, the statute does not focus on the date on which the claim is filed but rather focuses on the time at which the claimant\u2019s disability ends. That is, \u201cif the period of disability was not longer than two years,\u201d a claimant will be entitled to the alternate base year calculation so long as the other conditions of the statute are met. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(c)(3). The Legislature did not say that a claimant will be disqualified if the claim is filed more than two years after the employee\u2019s temporary disability began, as the Appeals Examiner\u2019s opinion appears to suggest.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">The critical question in terms of the two year period, then, is when did plaintiffs \u201cperiod of disability\u201d end? The phrase \u201cperiod of disability\u201d is defined in the statute as \u201cthe period from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the time at which the individual becomes unable to work because of the compensable disability until the time that the individual becomes able to return to resume and continue work on a permanent basis.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That question, <em>i.e., </em>when plaintiff was \u201cable to return to ... work on a permanent basis,\u201d was never specifically decided in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">While the date on which Dr. Barolat signed the back-to-work slip was relevant to that issue, it cannot be determinative in the context of this record. According to plaintiff, he felt able to resume work in early December 1995 and reported to his employer for that purpose. The employer refused to accept him back to work until he produced an authorization from the treating physician. The Appeals Examiner did not appear to discredit plaintiffs representation that he felt able to resume work in December. Indeed, the Appeals Examiner observed that plaintiff scheduled an appointment with his doctor to obtain a release in December 1995, but the appointment was canceled by the doctor through no fault of the plaintiff. We assume that was why the Appeals Examiner said he \u201cempathized\u201d with \u201cthe claimant\u2019s predicament.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Neither the statute nor any regulation of which we have been made aware requires a doctor\u2019s certificate to prove the point in time at which a claimant\u2019s disability ended. That question is a matter of proof. The Appeals Examiner in this case could simply have accepted plaintiffs representation that he was ready to return to work in December. Or, if he wished corroboration on that point, he could have continued the hearing subject to a report from Dr. Barolat that plaintiff would have been released in December had the appointment not been canceled. In any event, we are satisfied that where, as here, a claimant attempts to return to work before the second anniversary of the commencement of his disability and schedules a medical examination for that purpose on a date prior to the anniversary date, the fact that the claimant cannot be examined by his doctor through no fault of his own before the anniversary date does not preclude him from making a claim simply because he files the claim after the two year anniver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>sary date of the commencement of his disability. Rather, the Appeals Examiner must determine from all the available facts when it was in point of time that the claimant was actually able to resume work.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We also note that the Appeals Examiner may have placed some reliance on the fact that the workers\u2019 compensation insurance company paid temporary disability benefits to plaintiff up to the point when Dr. Barolat signed the back-to-work slip. It may very well be that it is the insurance company\u2019s policy to pay temporary disability until such an event occurs, but such policy does not determine how the unemployment compensation statute should be interpreted. As plaintiffs counsel noted at the hearing before the Appeals Examiner, the compensation matter had not yet proceeded to the final hearing, and he fully expected the insurance company would ask for a credit once it learned that plaintiff believed he could return to work in December 1995. Clearly, an insurance company\u2019s decision to pay or not pay temporary disability benefits is not competent evidence, standing alone, of when a claimant\u2019s entitlement to temporary disability benefits ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">It is not our function to decide the facts of a given case but rather to determine whether the agency\u2019s findings are supported by the record, and whether its conclusion is in accord with accepted principles of law. <em>See Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579-80, 410 A.2d 686 (1980). In this case we have determined that the wrong legal principle was applied to the evidence, and that the necessary fact finding has not been made with respect to the correct legal principle. Accordingly, we remand the matter to the Board for further consideration in light of the foregoing discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The judgment under review is reversed. The matter is remanded for further consideration. Jurisdiction is not retained.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b432-11\"> We assume the Appeals Examiner used the word \u201cempathized\u201d and it was transcribed incorrectly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b433-11\"> The Board's additional determination that plaintiff did not establish the base year pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-19(c)(1) is not relevant to this proceeding. Plaintiff never contended that he qualified under that provision of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
