The wife was awarded $400 a week in alimony. She is to pay the husband $75 a week for the support of their fifteen year old daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">The husband contends: (1) the alimony award was grossly excessive and based upon erroneous and unsupported findings of fact; (2) the child support award was insufficient because the judge used the wife\u2019s 1994 income rather than her 1995 income; and (3) in determining the wife\u2019s share of the husband\u2019s pension, the judge should have offset immediately the wife\u2019s future social security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-16\">After careful consideration of the record and the arguments of counsel, we affirm for the reasons well stated by Judge Parker in her written opinions of May 10, 1995 and August 29, 1995, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>portion of which have been published. <em>White v. White, </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>300, 664 A.2d 1297 (Ch.Div.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
