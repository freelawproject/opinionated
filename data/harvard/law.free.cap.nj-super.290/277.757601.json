Garden State contends on appeal that: (1) the judge \u201cerred in requiring a secondary health care provider to pay benefits prior to the exhaustion of all applicable personal injury protection benefits,\u201d (2) the \u201cplaintiff has failed to meet her burden of proof,\u201d and (3) the judge \u201cerred in granting plaintiff benefits not available under the plan of insurance.\u201d We affirm the ruling on the coverage dispute for the reasons given by Judge Longhi in his published opinion, 280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>206, 654 A.2d 1043 (Law Div.1994). <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-37.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">We also affirm the judge\u2019s ruling that plaintiffs first admission at Kessler Rehabilitation Institute from May 10 to June 8,1994 was primarily for medical treatment rather than rehabilitative purposes, for the reasons given by Judge Longhi at the conclusion of the factual hearing on this issue. This conclusion was essentially a factual determination based on ample credible evidence in the record. <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-84, 323 A.2d 495 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Nothing which we have ruled upon in affirming Judge Longhi\u2019s decision as to plaintiffs eligibility for Garden State\u2019s coverage should be construed to deprive Garden State of its right to review the expenses which may have been paid to date by the PIP carrier Prudential Insurance company and to resist its contribution toward those payments on the ground that such payments were not \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d in the circumstances, if such ground indeed exists. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-37.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-9\"> <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:3-37.2 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">\"Medical expenses\u201d means expenses for medical, surgical and dental treatment, professional nursing services, hospital expenses, rehabilitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>services, diagnostic services, ambulance services, prosthetic devices, medications and other reasonable and necessary expenses resulting from the treatment prescribed by persons licensed to practice medicine and surgery, dentistry, psychology or chiropractic in accordance with this State's laws, or by persons similarly licensed in other states or nations, or any nonmedical remedial treatment rendered in accordance with a recognized religious method of healing.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
