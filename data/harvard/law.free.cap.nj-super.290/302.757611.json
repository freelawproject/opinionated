Thus, we reverse and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">/</p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">For the purposes of this opinion, it is unnecessary to detail every aspect of the trial testimony except to say that Robert and Sharon Denike, who were at the location of the crime for the purpose of obtaining drugs, were the only eye witnesses to the whole encounter between defendant and the victim. They testified essentially that the defendant and the victim fought over money the victim owed the defendant; that defendant was the aggressor in the fight; and that the victim was backing up while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>defendant was punching into him with a knife. Both fell down the basement steps.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">On the contrary, defendant who testified on his own behalf stated that <em>he </em>owed the victim money; that the victim demanded the money and tried to go into defendant\u2019s pockets. According to defendant, a fight ensued during which the victim pulled a knife and tried to stab him over the money. They fought for the knife. Somehow defendant was able to retrieve the knife and stab the victim dining the tussle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In essence, the stories told by the Denikes and defendant were polar opposites in the critical details. They could not be reconciled. According to the Denikes, defendant had a motive to kill the victim and was the aggressor during the stabbing. According to defendant, <em>he </em>was the victim of an enraged aggressor and he fought back to save himself during a robbery. Depending on which version the jury believed, defendant\u2019s actions could be characterized as cold blooded murder, justifiable homicide or a mitigated offense in between. The outcome hinged on the believability of the Denikes and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">When defendant testified, his long prior record, including drug offenses and robberies, was made known to the jury for use as part of their credibility assessment. However, when the Denikes testified, a fleeting statement by Robert Denike as to being on parole, and Sharon Denike\u2019s admission that she stopped using drugs in jail were the sole references to their prior records.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">What were those prior records? In 1990, in an unpublished opinion affirming Robert Denike\u2019s conviction, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">In 1973, defendant was tried by a jury and was found guilty of kidnapping <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:118-1), rape <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A-.90-3), assault with an offensive weapon <em>(N.J.S,A, </em>2A:90-3), threatening to take a life <em>(N.J.S.A </em>2A:113-8), lewdness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>(N.J.S.A </em>2A:115-1), possession of an offensive weapon <em>(N.J.S.A </em>2A:151-41(c), and possession of an offensive weapon with the intent to use it unlawfully <em>(N.J.S.A </em>2A:151-56). On the kidnapping conviction, defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. A consecutive sentence of seven to ten years was imposed on the conviction for possession of an offensive weapon with the intent to use it unlawfully. Defendant received concurrent sentences on the remaining counts. The aggregate sentence thus imposed was life imprisonment plus ten years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\"><em>[State v. Denike, </em>Docket No. A-4167-87T2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Recognizing that Robert Denike qualified for persistent offender status, we also pointed out that his record <em>prior </em>to the convictions he was appealing \u201ccan fairly be described as horrendous.\u201d At the time of the crime, Sharon Denike was on probation for a conviction for an indictable offense and was under indictment for six other indictable offenses. Both Denikes, having acknowledged that they were involved in a drug transaction on the night in question, were subject to the revocation of their respective parole and probationary terms. Sharon Denike also had six other charges hanging over her head, including conspiracy, burglary and theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Although the suggestion that the state failed to provide evidence of these records to the defense has dogged this case, we are satisfied from the certification of the assistant prosecutor, which was not controverted, that the Denikes\u2019 prior records were supplied to the defense. We thus address this case from the perspective of the effectiveness of defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Counsel\u2019s performance must be analyzed under the standards set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), adopted by our Supreme Court in <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 519 A.2d 336 (1987). <em>Accord State v. Paige, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>362, 376-77, 607 A.2d 164 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>17, 611 A.2d 655 (1992). Under the <em>Strickland </em>test, the key inquiry is \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>Strickland, supra, </em>at 686, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 692-93. <em>Strickland </em>sets forth a two-part test to determine whether counsel\u2019s performance has been deficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction ... resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 687,104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 693.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Under the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, to be deficient, counsel\u2019s performance must fall \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693. Client loyalty, adequate consultation and legal proficiency are all relevant considerations in assessing counsel\u2019s performance. <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 52, 519 A.2d 336. <em>Strickland </em>urges great deference in the evaluation of counsel\u2019s conduct, requiring \u201ca strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, swpra, </em>at 689, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test requires a showing of actual prejudice. Prejudice to the defendant must be proved, normally it may not be presumed. <em>Id. </em>at 692-93, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2067, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 696-97.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">An error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment. The purpose of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel is to ensure that a defendant has the assistance necessary to justify reliance on the outcome of the proceeding. Accordingly, any deficiencies in counsel\u2019s performance must be prejudicial to the defense in order to constitute ineffective assistance under the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 691-92, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2066-67, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 696 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Moreover, the Supreme Court, in recently revisiting the <em>Strickland </em>test in <em>Lockhart v. Fretwell, </em>506 <em>U.S. </em>364, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993), held that, to establish prejudice, a defendant must show not only that the outcome of his trial would have been different absent the alleged deficient representation, but also that the deficient representation rendered the result of his proceeding fundamentally unfair or unreliable. <em>Lockhart, supra, </em>at 372, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 844, 122 L.Ed.2d at 189. <em>See, e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>United States v. Lively, </em>817 <em>F.Supp. </em>453, 458-59 (D.Del.), <em>order affirmed 14 </em>F.3d 50 (3d Cir. Del.1993). To set aside a conviction or sentence solely because the outcome would have been different but for counsel\u2019s error may grant defendant a windfall to which the law does not entitle him. <em>Lockhart, supra, </em>at 373, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 844, 122 L.Ed.2d at 189. The burden to prove that incompetence of counsel had a prejudicial effect upon the outcome of the proceeding is squarely on the defendant. <em>State v. Paige, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 377, 607 A.2d 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Applying these principles, we are satisfied that defendant is entitled to a new trial. We begin our analysis by reiterating that this case was a pitched credibility battle between defendant and the Denikes. The outcome of the case depended on who the jury believed. Thus, anything which could have tipped the credibility scale had the potential to affect the outcome and, to the extent that the credibility scale was wrongly tipped, a fundamental injustice was the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">We think defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. In the face of his client\u2019s own record being paraded before the jury as a way of attacking his credibility, counsel\u2019s failure to do the same to the Denikes is incomprehensible. As one commentator has put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">The cross-examination of government witnesses regarding prior convictions is extraordinarily dear to defense counsel. For the same reasons that defense counsel ought to fight so strongly to keep a jury from learning of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction, every effort must be made to make a jury aware of government witnesses\u2019 prior conviction. The goal of course is to transform the government witness into the same piece of meat into which the government tries to turn defendants with records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">[Vol. 1B <em>Criminal Defense Techniques </em>\u00a7 26.08[e][a], (Zeppetello, Latner, Kwalbrun, Editors, (1994).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Even more egregious was defense counsel\u2019s failure to delve into the fact that the Denikes had the potential loss of parole and probationary status hanging over their heads and in addition, that Sharon Denike had six other indictables facing her. It is fundamental that defendant has a right to explore, with a prosecution witness, evidence that the State has a \u201chold\u201d of some kind over the witness, the mere existence of which possesses the <em>potential </em>of prompting him to color his testimony in favor of the prosecution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJWZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Bias is a term used in the \u201ccommon law of evidence\u201d to describe the relationship between a party and a witness which might lead the witness to slant, unconsciously or otherwise, his testimony in favor of or against a party. Bias may be induced by a witness\u2019 like, dislike, or fear of a party, or by the witness\u2019 self-interest. Proof of bias is almost always relevant because the jury, as finder of fact and weigher of credibility, has historically been entitled to assess all evidence which might bear on the accuracy and truth of a witness\u2019 testimony. The \u201ccommon law of evidence\u201d allowed the showing of bias by extrinsic evidence, while requiring the cross-examiner to \u201ctake the answer of the witness\u201d with respect to less favored forms of impeachment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\"><em>[United States v. Abel, </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>45, 52, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>465, 469, 83 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>450 (1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzF\">There may exist no express agreement at all that the witness will benefit from testifying favorably for the State, or, alternatively, that the witness will suffer because of failing to do so. All that matters is that the witness subjectively <em>regards </em>himself as vulnerable to government pressure. Thus, in <em>United States v. Leonard, </em>494 F.2d 955 (D.C.Cir.1974), the court held it error for the trial judge to limit the cross-examination of a prosecution witness concerning unrelated charges which were pending against him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqA\">The permissible scope of exploration on cross-examination is not curtailed by the absence of explicit government promises of leniency, for the defense may attempt to show government \u201cconduct which might have led a witness to believe that his prospects for lenient treatment by the government depended on the degree of his cooperation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">[Id. at 963 (quoting <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>426 F.2d 547, 549 (2d Cir.1970)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak5\">The law in New Jersey concerning the constitutional right of the defendant to explore potential bias on the part of a prosecution witness is even broader than that which exists in federal courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoM\">Contrary to the trial judge\u2019s assertion, it is not necessary to show that there existed a prior arrangement between the prosecutor and the witness whereby the latter was to receive immunity from criminal prosecution, before his \u201c \u2018expectations for favorable treatment\u2019 may be shown as evidence of bias.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\"><em>[State v. Mazur, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>89, 94, 385 A.2d 878 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>399, 396 A.2d 586 (1978).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The test of propriety of questions addressed to credibility is not necessarily whether there was an arrangement to grant the witness concessions. It is as relevant and significant for a defendant to demonstrate the <em>state of mind </em>of the witness based on his <em>subjective </em>reactions to the favorable treatment he may have received or may <em>hope </em>to receive in connection with his own criminal involvement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acj\">[Id. at 94, 385 A.2d 878 (quoting <em>State v. Vaccaro, 142 N.J.Super. </em>167, 176, 361 A.2d 47 (App.Div.), <em>certif. den. </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>518, 366 A.2d 674 (1976)). (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Both Robert and Sharon Denike had criminal records. In addition, the former was on lifetime parole, and the latter on probation after convictions for indictable offenses imposed at different times, both when they made their statements to the police and when they testified at trial. The failure of defense counsel to impeach the credibility of the State\u2019s principal witnesses by reason of their prior criminality as well as by reason of their hopes and fears as a result of their vulnerable status, is impossible to square with the concept of effective representation. Under no possible scenario could this be viewed as within the range of legitimate decisions as to how best to represent a criminal defendant. The strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance has been overcome on these facts. <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 689, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694. The failure of defendant\u2019s counsel to launch an attack on the Denikes based upon their convictions and expectations in light of a similar attack advanced against defendant, so undermined the proper fimctioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">This is not to suggest that every single time a defense counsel fails to probe a state witness\u2019s prior record or pending charges, a new trial is an inevitability. We hold only that where, as here, the key to a case is a jury credibility evaluation of the State\u2019s witnesses versus the defendant, and where defendant has been subjected to a credibility attack based upon his prior record, the failure of his counsel to advance the same kind of an attack on the State\u2019s witnesses when such an attack is richly merited, warrants retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">We are satisfied as well that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of defendant as to his pre-arrest silence and to request an instruction as to the limited effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>such testimony constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under the standards we have outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">During the course of cross-examination, the prosecutor and the defendant engaged in the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">Q. Jerome Alford pulled a knife on you; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">Q. Okay.

Brown, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>595, 573 A.2d 886 (1990), the Court considered the circumstances under which a defendant\u2019s pre-arrest silence may be used to impeach his credibility as a witness. It concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\u25a0 \u201c[Bjvidence regarding a pre-arrest silence is admissible if, when viewed objectively and neutrally in the light of all the circumstances, it generates an inference of consciousness of guilt that bears on the credibility of the defendant when measured against the defendant\u2019s apparently exculpatory testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 615, 573 A.2d 886.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Although a defendant is under no duty to speak prior to his arrest, if \u201ca reasonable person\u201d situated as was the defendant would \u201cnaturally\u201d have come forward and told the authorities of his \u201cinvolvement in the criminal episode,\u201d then \u201cthe failure to have done so has sufficient probative worth bearing on defendant\u2019s credibility for purposes of impeachment.\u201d 118 <em>N.J. </em>at 613-14, 573 A.2d 886. A defendant\u2019s silence is never substantive evidence of his guilt, but is admissible only to cast doubt upon the credibility of his exculpatory testimony at trial. It is consequently inadmissible if the defendant does not take the stand. <em>State v. Marshall, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>591, 597, 617 A.2d 302 (App.Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">It follows that the prosecutor\u2019s examination of defendant concerning his failure to report his role in the killing of Fuquan should have been objected to, and a determination made out of the presence of the jury whether a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s circumstances would have summoned the police and informed them that he had killed Fuquan while resisting a robbery attempt. <em>State v. Brown, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 613, 573 A.2d 886. Defendant\u2019s explanation of Fuquan\u2019s death as inextricably intertwined with their drug dealings, could well have been a basis for barring testimony as to his pre-arrest silence because he was already in violation of his parole when Fuquan was killed, making his arrest should he report the incident inevitable, and the ultimate revocation of his parole a certainty. <em>Cf. State v. Merola, </em>214 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>108, 518 A.2d 518 (App.Div.1986), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>91, 526 A.2d 168 (1987) (defendant\u2019s reporting of criminal incident would have resulted in violation of his probation). Although within minutes of the event, defendant told many neighbors that he was responsible for Fuquan\u2019s death, we would ordinarily not expect a parole violator so subject to arrest on independent grounds, to inform the police that he had, however justifiably, killed someone in the aftermath of an illegal narcotics transaction. <em>See State v. Merola, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Even if testimony concerning defendant\u2019s pre-arrest silence had been held admissible, defendant would have been entitled to an instruction by the trial judge limiting its application to his credibility, not, as the jury necessarily assumed, as substantive evidence of his guilt. <em>State v. Brown, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 616, 573 A.2d 886. \u201cA jury may consider a defendant\u2019s pre-arrest silence only to affect his credibility and even then only when the trial judge first rules that defendant\u2019s silence may reasonably be viewed as inconsistent with his testimony.\u201d <em>State v. Marshall, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 598, 617 A.2d 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Because this highly damaging evidence was not objected to, the trial judge issued no instruction to the jury which would have limited its prejudicial impact to defendant\u2019s credibility rather than serving as substantive evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. These errors on counsel\u2019s part constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Combined with the deficiencies we have previously noted they require that we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction and remand the case for a new trial at which the principles to which we have adverted are put into practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\"> Joanne Dunham, who arrived at the scene just before defendant and the victim fell down the basement steps said she saw defendant \"shank\u201d the victim who had nothing in his hands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-12\"> The victim sustained 12 stab wounds to various parts of his body.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
