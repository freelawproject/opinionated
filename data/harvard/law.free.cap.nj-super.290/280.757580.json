The court sentenced defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>to twenty-five years imprisonment with a twelve and one-half year period of parole ineligibility for the carjacking. The court also sentenced defendant to ten years imprisonment with five years of parole ineligibility for the second degree robbery and to five years imprisonment with a two and one-half year period of parole ineligibility for the criminal restraint. All sentences were imposed to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On April 16,1994, Daniel McLaughlin, the assistant manager of a drugstore in Teaneck, saw defendant put items in a bag and then leave without paying. The store\u2019s security alarm sounded, and McLaughlin tried to get defendant to return to the store in order to check the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Defendant instead walked away briskly, and McLaughlin followed him to the intersection of Penn Avenue and River Road. Defendant stopped a car and tried to get in it, but the passenger pushed him away. He went to the next car, operated by Alison Bond, and got in on the passenger side.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Shortly thereafter the car stopped at a red light, and McLaughlin approached it. He told Bond that he was following defendant \u201cin relation to a possible shoplifting and that she may not want to be in the vehicle with him.\u201d Bond immediately put the transmission in park and tried to get out, but defendant \u201creached across and grabbed her by her right arm and what I thought was a purse strap and physically pulled her back and h[e]ld her in the car while he ... put his foot on the accelerator and put the gear shift into drive.\u201d McLaughlin ran to a nearby gas station and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Ralph Ronne, who lived near the intersection of Penn Road and River Road in Teaneck, saw part of the incident. He heard McLaughlin say, \u201cWell, come back to the store. You just robbed the store.\u201d By the time Ronne got outside to his porch, defendant was standing in the middle of River Road stopping traffic. Defendant stopped a car and three men jumped out. McLaughlin said, \u201cHe robbed my store. Grab him.\u201d Defendant then got into another car with a woman driver, about a block from Ronne\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>house. The manager went to the driver\u2019s door and knocked on her window. Eonne heard the manager ask defendant to get out of the car, but when the men from the first car approached, Eonne supposed that defendant \u201cgot nervous and he jammed on the woman\u2019s gas pedal and went through the light.\u201d The driver was trying to get out, but her seat belt impeded her and defendant \u201cgrabbed her by the shoulder and pulled her back in.\u201d Eonne did not see defendant step on the accelerator, but he \u201cknew\u201d the driver was not operating it. Eonne added that the driver \u201cwas dumbfounded, she didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Bond testified that at the time of the incident she was going to Eiverside Square, a mall on Eoute 4 in Hackensack. She was on Penn Avenue, approaching the intersection with Eiver Eoad, when she saw a man with a bag trying to stop cars. The vehicle ahead of her did not stop for him, so she stopped \u201cto find out what the problem was.\u201d There were two women on the sidewalk near him, and Bond thought they were related and that there was a medical emergency, \u201ca man who wants to take his wife to the hospital to have a baby or something of that order.\u201d The man got in her car and said he needed a ride to Eoute 4. Bond apparently turned onto Eiver Eoad at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Bond thought the man was very agitated. She asked him what was the matter, and he said he had been in a fight with his sister\u2019s boyfriend and needed to get to Eoute 4. She realized then that there was no medical emergency. She testified that she thought \u201cwell, I\u2019ll have to take him to Eoute 4, you know, and just hope that\u2019s all I have to do.\u201d She felt that she did not really have a choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Bond drove one block and stopped for a red light. At that point, McLaughlin ran up to her car and knocked on her window. Bond opened the door after he identified himself. McLaughlin said to her, \u201c[a]re you aware you have a shoplifter in your car?\u201d Bond put the car in park and tried to get out but her seat belt was still fastened. She testified that it was more the seat belt than defendant that prevented her from leaving the car. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>put the transmission back in drive, put his foot on the accelerator, and said \u201c[l]et\u2019s go.\u201d Bond added that \u201che may have pulled my arm\u201d as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">They crossed the intersection and proceeded along River Road for about five blocks until Bond asked defendant to take his foot off the accelerator, and he complied. Two blocks later they approached a red light, and the man told her to \u201crun it.\u201d She did so because she felt she had no choice. She \u201cwas feeling very frightened and annoyed at myself for stopping in the first place because I felt like I had gotten into something that I couldn\u2019t control.\u201d She \u201cwasn\u2019t afraid of being killed,\u201d but rather \u201cwas just afraid of the whole situation of being in the car and speeding along and just not knowing what was going to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">When they turned onto Route 4, the man was still very agitated. \u201cHe kept saying he didn\u2019t want to go to jail, he didn\u2019t want to go to jail, and he didn\u2019t want to hurt me, but he didn\u2019t want to go to jail.\u201d The Route 4 traffic was stopped because of heavy volume. Bond asked defendant, \u201c[w]hy don\u2019t you get out,\u201d and he did. He had not threatened her, he did not have a weapon, and Bond understood that all he wanted was to get away from the other man who had called him a shoplifter. At some point he said he \u201cwas scared about what [Bond] might say,\u201d which she took to mean her telling the police \u201cwhere he was going so they could catch him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Bond turned the car around and went back to a gas station at the comer of River Road and Cedar Lane, where she saw a police car and spoke to the officers. Two hours later she went to the police station to give a statement. In it she said she was in fear for her life, because she \u201cfelt very, very scared initially.\u201d She did not mention the man\u2019s grabbing her arm. At trial she explained that omission by saying that it \u201cwas not the primary thing,\u201d and specified that \u201cI\u2019m not saying now that he was forcing me in that he pulled me,\u201d only that \u201cI know that he had at some point touched my arm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Officer Thomas Sikorsky, who took defendant\u2019s statement, read it to the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Question: \u201cWhat can you tell us about this incident?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">Answer: \u201cI was in the CVS store on Cedar Lane. I took about 17 boxes of Bayer aspirin, Advil, and Anacin____ I put them in a plastic bag____ Then when I left the store, I walked up Cedar Lane and made a right on Elm Avenue. I went through some apartment buildings, through an alleyway, and back onto Larch Avenue, and then I ran down Penn Avenue because I had the stolen shit on me and I wanted to get out of the area. Actually, I didn\u2019t start running until I saw the store worker from CVS following me and then I started to run.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">\u201cWhen I got to River Road, I tried to flag down some cars. A lady stopped, rolled down her window, and I said, \u2018Excuse me, ma\u2019am, can I get a ride to Route 4?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">\u201cShe said, \u2018Okay,\u2019 and then she opened the door and let me get into her ear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlK\">\u201cWhen we got to the red light at River Road and Cedar Lane, the manager walked up to the ear and said, \u2018Are you aware that you picked up a shoplifter?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvO\">\u201cPm not sure how the lady answered the manager. The light turned green and I said, \u2018Go.\u2019 The lady had her foot on the brakq and I took my left foot and pressed down on the accelerator and said, \u2018Go.\u2019 So I had my foot down on the accelerator with so much velocity that she had to let go of the brakes because the brakes wouldn\u2019t hold. I told her, \u2018Take me to Route 4. I don\u2019t want to go to jail.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arr\">\u201cShe said, Tm going to take you there and get out of the car.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">\u201cNot once did I threaten her and not once did I hurt her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-12\">Question: \u201cWhat happened next?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-13\">Answer: \u201cShe gave me a ride to Route 4 between Riverside Square and the Bergen Mall. It was by HoSman-Koos [sic], and I got out near there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-14\">Question: \u201cAt any time did you force this lady to drive through a red light?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adj\">Answer: \u201cNot that I remember.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-15\">Defendant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-16\">The theft of the over-the-counter drugs from the pharmacy was the predicate for the robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-17\">On appeal, defendant makes the following contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-18\">POINT i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-19\">THE SENTENCE AUTHORIZED BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR VIOLATION OF <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2c:15-2a.(4) CONSTITUTES CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT, AND ON ITS FACE, AND AS APPLIED, VIOLATES DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHTS UNDER THE EIGHTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE I, PARAGRAPHS 1 AND 12 OF THE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION.

As to Point I, <em>see Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. </em>153, 175-76, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2909, 2926, 49 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>859, 876 (1976); <em>State v. Hampton, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>250, 273-74, 294 A.2d 23 (1972); <em>see also State v. Maldonado, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>536, 556-57, 645 A.2d 1165 (1994). We recently rejected the same contention in <em>State v. Williams, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>611, 674 A.2d 643 (App.Div.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">We address Points II and V. The carjacking statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">a. Carjacking defined. A person is guilty of carjacking if in the course of committing an unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, as defined in <em>N.J.S. </em>39:1-1, or in an attempt to commit an unlawful taking of a motor vehicle he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">(1) inflicts bodily injury or uses force upon an occupant or person in possession or control of a motor vehicle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-13\">(2) threatens an occupant or person in control with, or purposely or knowingly puts an occupant or person in control of the motor vehicle in fear of, immediate bodily injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-14\">(3) commits or threatens immediately to commit any crime of the first or second degree; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-15\">(4) operates or causes said vehicle to be operated with the person who was in possession or control or was an occupant of the motor vehicle at the time of the taking remaining in the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-16\">An act shall be deemed to be \u201cin the course of committing an unlawful taking of a motor vehicle\u201d if it occurs during an attempt to commit the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle or during an immediate flight after the attempt or commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-17\">b. Grading. Carjacking is a crime of the first degree and upon conviction thereof a person may, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>N.J.S. </em>2C:43-6, be sentenced to an ordinary term of imprisonment between 10 and 30 years. A person convicted of carjacking shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment and that term of imprisonment shall include the imposition of a minimum term of at least five years during which the defendant shall be ineligible for parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-2].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The case was submitted to the jury under section a(4), consistent with the offense charged in the indictment. In its instructions to the jury, the trial court defined an \u201cunlawful taking\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad4\">An unlawful taking of a motor vehicle is defined as follows: It includes the taking, operating, or exercising of control over a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner or other person authorized to give consent with the purpose of either permanently depriving the owner of the motor vehicle or temporarily withholding the motor vehicle from the owner or other person in control of the motor vehicle. The term motor vehicle includes all vehicles propelled otherwise than by muscular power excepting such vehicles as run only upon rails or tracks and does not include motorized bicycles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">This instruction is consistent with the statutory definition of \u201cunlawful taking.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-14o and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-10. Defendant contends that the court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal because \u201cthere was absent from the State\u2019s proofs evidence of a critical element of \u2018carjacking\u2019 without which the crime is not established, namely a \u2018purpose to withhold,\u2019 however \u2018temporarily,\u2019 the vehicle \u2018from the owner ...\u2019 <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:20-10b.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">We disagree. The standard for ruling on a motion for acquittal is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">whether, viewing the State\u2019s evidence in its entirety, be that evidence direct or circumstantial, and giving the State the benefit of all its favorable testimony as well as all of the favorable inferences which reasonably could be drawn therefrom, a reasonable jury could find guilt of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\"><em>[State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 459, 236 A.2d 385 (1967).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-11\"><em>See also State v. Johnson, </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>137, 156, 643 A.2d 631 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>265, 649 A.2d 1285 (1994); <em>State v. Tarver, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>414, 424-25, 640 A.2d 314 (App.Div. 1994); <em>State v. Ball, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 121, 632 A.2d 1222 (App.Div.1993), <em>aff'd, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>142, 661 A.2d 251 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>\u2014, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>779, 133 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>731 (1996). Applying this standard, we conclude that the evidence supported a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>determination beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant exercised control of the Bond vehicle with a purpose to temporarily withhold it. <em>See State v. Alexander, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>522, 531, 522 A.2d 464 (App.Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We conclude, however, that the case must be remanded for resentencing on the carjacking charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The role of an appellate court in reviewing a sentence is limited. <em>State v. Gardner, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>510, 551 A.2d 981 (1989) defined those limits. There the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">We begin with the by-now-familiar admonitions that in reviewing a sentence, an appellate court should not substitute its judgment for that of the lower court, and that a sentence imposed by a trial court is not to be upset on appeal unless it represents an abuse of the lower court\u2019s discretion. <em>E.g., State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 362-65, 471 A.2d 370 (1984), and the authorities cited therein. In <em>Roth, </em>we summarized as follows the criteria to be used on appeal to determine whether the sentencing court abused its discretion: an appellate court should</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiC\">(a) review sentences to determine if the legislative policies, here the sentencing guidelines, were violated; (b) review the aggravating and mitigating factors found below to determine whether those factors were based upon competent credible evidence in the record; and (c) determine whether even though the court sentenced in accordance with the guidelines, nevertheless application of those guidelines to the facts of this case makes the sentence clearly unreasonable so as to shock the judicial conscience. [Id. at 364-65, 471 A.2d 370.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">We cautioned further that \u201c[w]hat we seek by our review is not a difference in judgment, but only a judgment that reasonable people may not reasonably make on the basis of the evidence presented,\u201d and that \u201c[w]hen conscientious trial judges exercise discretion in accordance with the principles set forth in the Code and [relevant case law], they need fear no second-guessing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365, 471 A.2d 370; <em>cf. State v. Dunbar, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>80, 83, 527 A.2d 1346 (1987) (a sentence within the statutory guidelines \u201cmay strike us as a harsh sentence, but that is a consequence of the legislative scheme and not a clear error of judgment by the trial court.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 516, 551 A.2d 981.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">In the present case the sentencing judge found four aggravating factors. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-11\">On the aggravating side there are four aggravating factors. There\u2019s clear risk that you will, I guarantee it, you will commit further offenses. That\u2019s not permission to do it. I know it in my heart and everyone in this room who has any sense of this case knows it. The nature and extent of your prior criminal history led inexorably to the point where you committed this offense. That is an aggravating factor. There is a special need to deter, not an ordinary deterrence, but special deterrence. The persistent and repetitive and almost commonplace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>taking of other people\u2019s property inevitably led to this type of an offense and it is special deterrence that must be employed here, not <em>State versus Jarbeth </em>deterrence. And the last aggravating factor is that a fine or other punishment besides incarceration would be merely viewed as a contingent business liability, a cost of doing business, and that\u2019s not what this is about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">You are a clear and present danger to every person on the street at any time, at any place, and I will sentence you as follows:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Our only observation regarding these findings is that aggravating factor <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-1a(11), the imposition of a fine or other monetary penalty as a cost of doing business, would appear to have little significance in this case. Like deterrence, it can be found applicable to any convicted defendant whom the court has resolved to incarcerate. <em>See State v. Gardner, supra, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>at 520, 551 A.2d 981 (\u201c \u2018There would be no case in which a trial judge could not by the mere assertion of the need for general deterrence imprison an individual____\u201d\u2019) (quoting <em>State v. Gardner, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>84, 97, 521 A.2d 357 (App.Div.1987) (dissenting opinion)). The other aggravating factors are supported in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">The court determined that there are no mitigating factors. We are persuaded that the evidence supports the existence of mitigating factor (2), that \u201cdefendant did not contemplate that his conduct would cause or threaten serious harm.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1b(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">We have no quarrel, otherwise, with the trial court\u2019s determination regarding the aggravating and mitigating factors. We focus our concern on the range of sentence available for a carjacking when considered in relation to the various elements which escalate the unlawful taking of a vehicle to a carjacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">The minimum mandatory sentence is ten years imprisonment with five years of parole ineligibility. The court may sentence a defendant beyond the minimum to a maximum term of thirty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>years with exposure to a maximum period of parole ineligibility of fifteen years. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6b. Although carjacking is characterized as a first degree crime, the range of sentencing discretion is much wider for a carjacking. The ordinary term for a first degree crime is between ten and twenty years, with a presumptive term of fifteen years. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-6a(1); <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-1f(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">There is no presumptive term for carjacking beyond the mandatory minimum of ten years imprisonment with five years of parole ineligibility. Thus, in that regard, the Legislature treated carjacking differently than it treated aggravated manslaughter and first degree kidnapping. As to those first degree crimes, the Legislature authorized an ordinary term of imprisonment between ten and thirty years for aggravated manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:11-4c, and between fifteen and thirty years for kidnapping of a person sixteen years of age or older. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:13-1c(1). Regarding those crimes, the Legislature established presumptive terms of twenty years \u201cunless the preponderance of aggravating or mitigating factors ... weighs in favor of a higher or lower term.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-1f(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Rational sentencing is one of the objectives of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice, <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. 334, </em>351, 471 A.2d 370 (1984), as is uniformity and the avoidance of sentencing disparity. <em>State v. Towey, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>69, 78-79, 552 A.2d 994 (1989); <em>State v. Hodge, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>369, 379, 471 A.2d 389 (1984). To achieve those objectives .the Code\u2019s sentencing philosophy is \u201coffense-oriented.\u201d <em>State v. Hodge, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 375, 471 A.2d 389 (1984). Thus, punishment under the Code must \u201cfit the crime, not the criminal,\u201d and the Code achieves this goal, in part, by precise grading of offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 375-76, 471 A.2d 389. \u201cIt is ... paramount that the sentence reflect the Legislature\u2019s intention that the severity of the crime now be the most single important factor in the sentencing process.\u201d <em>State v. Megargel, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>484, 500, 673 A.2d 259 (1996). Presumptive terms play an important role in achieving these goals of rationality, uniformity, the elimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>tion of disparity, and the imposition of a sentence to fit the offense. <em>State v. Towey, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 79, 552 A.2d 994. A presumptive term provides a benchmark which may be adjusted \u201cupward or downward depending on [the court\u2019s] evaluation and balancing of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(a) and (b).\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The absence of a presumptive term or other benchmark to guide imposition of a carjacking sentence beyond the mandatory minimum impairs the achievement of those goals, in light of the twenty-year range of permissible discretionary sentence. <em>See, e.g., State v. Williams, supra, </em>in which the court sentenced defendant to the minimum term, ten years imprisonment with five years of parole ineligibility, for a carjacking based on the use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">We conclude, therefore, that trial courts must look to the alternative elements of carjacking to guide their sentencing discretion, in conjunction with the aggravating and mitigating factors applicable to all sentencing decisions. <em>See State v. Jarbath, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>394, 400-01, 555 A.2d 559 (1989) (noting that in the Criminal Code\u2019s sentencing scheme there is \u201can important function for appellate courts in clarifying relevant standards, promoting consistent interpretation of sentencing guidelines, and enhancing uniformity in the application of statutory standards to similar facts under similar circumstances\u201d). As indicated, the statute elevates an unlawful taking to a carjacking if the unlawful taking is accompanied by any one of four elements. Element a(l) is the most serious additional fact: the infliction of bodily injury or the use of force. Element a(4), operation of the vehicle with the lawful occupant remaining in it, ordinarily would be the least serious carjacking.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Elements a(2) and a(3), the threat of bodily injury or the commission or threat to commit a first or second degree crime, are of intermediate concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>We are persuaded that the Legislature intended that the high end of the sentencing range be reserved for the carjackings that involve the most serious accompanying elements. <em>See State v. Megargel, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 500, 673 A.2d 259 (noting that \u201c[t]he surrounding circumstances of an offense may make it very similar to a lower degree offense, thus suggesting that a downgraded sentence may be appropriate.\u201d). In the present case, defendant was convicted under a(4), the least serious accompanying element. Yet the court\u2019s sentence of twenty-five years with twelve and one-half years of parole ineligibility approaches the maximum available carjacking sentence. Indeed, the sentence approaches the maximum available for aggravated manslaughter. N.J.S.A 2C:11-4c.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The trial court focused on defendant\u2019s criminal record. It began in 1981, and it is extensive. With one exception, however, all of defendant\u2019s convictions have been in municipal court and involved shoplifting, petty theft and disorderly persons drug offenses. Those offenses are the consequences of defendant\u2019s addiction to heroin and cocaine. The only exception is a conviction for aggravated assault on a police officer, a third degree offense, for which he was sentenced to three years in prison. We infer that the aggravated assault was under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:12-1b(5)(a), a simple assault on a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Under the carjacking statute the court had to impose ten years imprisonment with five years of parole ineligibility. The trial court\u2019s determination that defendant should receive more than the minimum mandatory sentence because of his record is unassailable. We must keep in mind, however, that defendant was being sentenced for a carjacking under the least egregious definition of that offense and that \u201cthe severity of the crime is now the single most important factor in the sentencing process.\u201d <em>Hodge, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 379, 471 A.2d 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Because this is an issue of first impression, the trial court did not have the benefit of our analysis. Consequently, we vacate the base term and period of parole ineligibility imposed for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>carjacking and remand for resentencing on that charge. In all other respects the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-13\"> Regarding this mitigating factor, the sentencing court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-14\">That no harm was contemplated is also nonsense. The harm was the continuation of a skein of taking other people\u2019s property. First you took the aspirin or the Advil or whatever it was, then you took a car. So that no harm was contemplated is incredible.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\"> In some cases, an a(4) offense may be especially egregious, <em>e.g., </em>if an infant is the remaining occupant, or the perpetrator further victimizes the occupant by committing a third or fourth degree crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
