He died on February 18, 1992, after collapsing at police headquarters. The death certificate listed cardiac arrest due to coronary artery disease as the cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">Chief Terminelli was a member of the Police and Fireman\u2019s Retirement System (PFRS). His estate applied for accidental death benefits, contending that death was the direct result of a traumatic event that occurred on February 3, 1992, during the actual performance of police duties. The application was denied by the Board of Trustees of PFRS (Board), which did not accept this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">Following administrative appeal, an Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision supporting the PFRS denial of accidental death benefits. It was adopted by the Board, and the Estate appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">It is not disputed that Chief Terminelli suffered a heart attack in 1986 for which he was hospitalized and underwent cardiac catheterization. Various cardiac medications were prescribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>thereafter. He returned to work on a part-time basis three months after discharge from the hospital, gradually increasing his hours. By February 3, 1992, Chief Terminelli was working a forty-hour week, free of pain or discomfort, walking three miles a day and apparently in good health, according to his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">On February 3,1992, while on patrol car duty, he apprehended a burglary suspect after a vigorous foot chase that culminated when he tackled and subdued the suspect. Another senior officer testified that when he responded to a request for back-up, Chief Terminelli was clutching his chest and gasping for breath. The Chief thought he might have been kicked in the chest or fallen against a tree during the tackle. According to the same witness and Mrs. Terminelli, the Chiefs capacity, vigor, and disposition appeared to have deteriorated from that time until his fatal attack on February 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The Administrative Law Judge considered the expert opinion testimony of the Estate\u2019s witness, Dr. Bernard Eisenstein, who concluded that Chief Terminelli\u2019s fatal acute myocardial infarction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\"><em>was a result of the physical exertion on February 3rd, </em>producing an acute coronary insufficiency state, known as unstable angina, with bridging symptoms and continued coronary insufficiency, until an acute myocardial infarction resulted on \u2014 the 18th of February.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">So, therefore, the acute myocardial infarction was due to the traumatic event of February 3rd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">While Dr. Eisenstein opined that Chief Terminelli\u2019s death was the direct result of pursuing, tackling, and subduing the suspect, he also unequivocally confirmed that death was due to coronary artery disease as stated in the death certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">The ALJ recognized the clarifying, but restrictive, judicial interpretations given to the phrase \u201ctraumatic event\u201d as used in N.J.S.A 43:16A-7(1). In <em>Kane v. Board of Trustees, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>651, 663, 498 A.2d 1252 (1985), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">We think it consonant with the legislative intent to characterize a traumatic event as one that arises in cases in which a worker involuntarily meets with a physical object or some other external matter and is victim of a great rush of force or power chat he himself did not bring into motion. As <em>Cattani </em>makes clear, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>focus of inquiry is on the event itself rather than the injury. The force or power must originate from sources other than the injured party. Hence, to be eligible for accidental disability retirement allowance, a worker must demonstrate (1) that his injuries were not induced by the stress or strain of the normal work effort; (2) that he met involuntarily with the object or matter that was the source of the harm; and (3) that the source of injury itself was a great rush of force or uncontrollable power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">[ (Citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">It has long been judicially recognized that the concept of \u201caccident\u201d for purposes of death claims under <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:16A-10 must be the same as that for disability retirement, notwithstanding absence of the words \u201ctraumatic event\u201d from the death benefits statute. <em>Russo v. Teachers\u2019 Pension &amp; Annuity Fund, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>142, 152, 299 A.2d 697 (1973); <em>In re Hill, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>382, 388-89, 390 A.2d 131 (App.Div.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The ALJ concluded that occurrence of a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d had not been established, making the factual findings: \u201c[ajlthough the chief may have been kicked in the chest by the suspect, this has not been proven by petitioner; indeed even the chief was uncertain.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, the ALJ found that, unlike the situation in <em>Petrucelli v. Board of Trustees, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 511 A.2d 735 (App.Div.1986), Chief Terminelli had a preexisting <em>symptomatic </em>coronary artery disease, which was aggravated by the February 3 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">These findings of the ALJ find support in the record. Adopting these findings, the Board reasonably could have determined that the three conjunctively-expressed prongs of <em>Kane </em>were not satisfied. Even if injury sustained during violent physical apprehension of a suspect is not necessarily deemed part of the normal work effort for a law enforcement officer, see <em>Gable v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>Board of Trustees, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>212, 557 A.2d 1012 (1989), and the \u201cinvoluntary\u201d prong is read narrowly for policy reasons, <em>id. </em>at 224, 557 A.2d 1012, the evidence in this case falls short of compelling a conclusion that application of an external great rush of force, which Chief Terminelli did not himself bring into motion, caused his death. <em>See Kane, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 662, 498 A.2d 1252; <em>Cattani v. Board of Trustees, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>578, 586, 355 A.2d 625 (1976). The legislative criterion is not satisfied by proof of disability or death \u201cresulting from the aggravation or acceleration of a preexisting disease even though unusual or excessive work effort is involved.\u201d <em>Cattani, supra, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>at 585, 355 A.2d 625; <em>see also Hill, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 390, 390 A.2d 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Neither the Board nor we are free to construe liberally the death benefits statute. <em>See Mazza v. Board of Trustees, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>22, 24, 25, 667 A.2d 1052 (1995). The Board\u2019s decision is supported by sufficient credible evidence on the record as a whole and we cannot say that, in endeavoring to follow the law and legislative policy, it clearly erred or reached an unreasonable conclusion. <em>See id. </em>at 25, 667 A.2d 1052.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\"> Although not integral to our decision, we take notice that the classic symptoms of a heart attack are, \"[c]rushing pain in the center of the chest, accompanied by difficult breathing, sweating, nausea, or a feeling of faintness.\u201d Lawrence Deckelbaum, M.D., <em>Heart Attacks and Coronary Artery Disease, in Yale University School of Medicine Heart Book </em>133, 137 (Barry L. Zaret, M.D., et al. eds., 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b265-7\">HUMPHREYS, J.A.D.,</author>\n<author id=\"AUl\">dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The Pension Board denied accidental death benefits to the family of Chief of Police Anthony J. Terminelli on the ground the Chiefs death was not the direct result of a traumatic event. The Board\u2019s decision is directly contrary to the undisputed medical testimony. The decision is also in sharp conflict with the unanimous opinion of the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>Gable v. Board of Trustees, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>212, 557 A.2d 1012 (1989). I would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">The Chief chased, tackled and subdued a person suspected of burglarizing a home. During the struggle, he was either kicked in the chest or struck a tree. A police officer arrived and saw the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Chief clutching his chest and gasping for breath. Two weeks later the Chief died. He was forty-nine years of age. The only medical witness at the hearing before the ALJ testified that the Chiefs death was the direct result of his encounter with the burglary suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Accidental death or disability benefits are granted if the incident was a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d and the injury was a \u201cdirect result.\u201d <em>Gable v. Board of Trustees, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 219, 557 A.2d 1012; <em>Russo v. Teachers\u2019 Pension &amp; Annuity Fund, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>142, 152, 299 A.2d 697 (1973) (concept of \u201caccident\u201d is the same for both disability and death). <em>See also N.J.S.A </em>43:16A-10 and 43:16A-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">A traumatic event is an \u201celusive concept.\u201d <em>Gable, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 215, 557 A.2d 1012. The injured employee \u201cmust demonstrate: (1) that his or her injuries were not induced by the stress or strain of the normal work effort; (2) that he or she met involuntarily with the object or matter that was the source of the harm; and (3) that the source of the injury itself was a great rush of force or uncontrollable power.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221, 557 A.2d 1012; <em>Mazza v. Board of Trustees, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>22, 24, 667 A.2d 1052 (1995) (severe twisting injury without an impact could be found by the Board not to be a traumatic event); <em>Kane v. Board of Trustees, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>651, 663, 498 A.2d 1252 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In <em>Gable, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 215-216, 557 A.2d 1012, the officers were injured in altercations with prisoners. The Court held that the evidence met the above three criteria. <em>Id. </em>at 222, 557 A.2d 1012. The incidents, Justice Garibaldi said, were not \u201cmere \u2018scuffles\u2019\u201d; the officers were the victims of \u201cviolent physical assaults.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223, 557 A.02d 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">In <em>Gable, </em>the Board unsuccessfully argued, as it has successfully decided here, that the injuries were part of the stresses and strains of the employee\u2019s normal work effort. <em>Id. </em>at 217, 557 A.2d 1012. The Supreme Court disagreed and said that it was \u201cnot part of the stress or strain of the \u2018normal\u2019 work effort of a corrections officer to be violently assaulted by an inmate. Corrections officers are not hired to be punching bags.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224, 557 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>A.2d 1012. The Court said that \u201cthe corrections officers clearly sustained injuries as a result of \u2018a great rush of force or uncontrollable power.\u2019 Each incident was caused by a violent external force \u2014 the actions of an unruly inmate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 557 A.2d 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The Court said further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">We do not want corrections officers to shy away from subduing unruly inmates. <em>Nor do we want to discourage police officers from chasing (criminal suspects. </em>If law enforcement officers act cautiously, they will not get injured \u2014 but they will also not be doing their jobs properly, <em>and the public will not be as well protected</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATn\"><em>[Id. </em>at 224, 557 A.2d 1012 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The Board\u2019s decision that this was not a traumatic event is directly contrary to the public policy enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Gable. </em>The Board\u2019s decision discourages police officers from \u201cchasing\u201d criminals who burglarize homes; even worse it discourages police officers from struggling with and subduing these criminals. In the language of Justice Garibaldi in <em>Gable, </em>the Board\u2019s decision will foster cautious police officers who will not do their job properly; the final result will be a public who are denied the protection from criminal attack promised by their government. <em>State v. Davis, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>16, 22, 231 A.2d 793 (1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 <em>U.S. </em>1054, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>805, 19 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>852 (1968) (government\u2019s primary mission is \u201cits promise that the individual shall be secure from attack upon his person and his things\u201d); <em>State v. Bisaccia, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>586, 590, 279 A.2d 675 (1971) (the reason we have government is to secure the first right of the individual which is to be protected from attack); <em>State v. McKnight, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>35, 52, 243 A.2d 240 (1968) (\u201cthe first right of the individual, [is] the right to be protected from criminal attack\u201d); <em>State v. Boykins, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>73, 81, 232 A.2d 141 (1967) (\u201cPre-eminent in the galaxy of values is the right of the individual to live free from criminal attack in his home, his work, and the streets____ That primary individual right demands that government be equal to the reason for its being\u2014 the protection of the individual citizen----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">My colleagues conclude that the Board is \u201cendeavoring to follow the law and legislative policy\u201d and did not \u201cclearly\u201d err or reach \u201can unreasonable conclusion.\u201d Majority opinion at 235, 675 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>at 675. I disagree. Neither the Board nor the ALJ followed, discussed or even cited the New Jersey Supreme Court decision in <em>Gable </em>which clearly and firmly stated the law and policy applicable to the facts in this case. The Board is surely not unaware of <em>Gable. </em>The Board was reversed by us in <em>Gable, </em>and the Supreme Court upheld that reversal. We are under no obligation to defer to unsound administrative decisions on legal questions, especially those which ignore or flout decisions of the New Jersey Supreme Court. <em>See In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 7:26B, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>442, 450, 608 A2.d 288 (1992); <em>Greenwood v. State Police Training Center, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>500, 513, 606 A.2d 336 (1992). The Board\u2019s decision that what happened to Chief Terminelli was not a traumatic event is manifestly erroneous and should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The ALJ also found that the Chiefs death did not directly result from his violent encounter with the burglary suspect. The ALJ said that the \u201cincident merely aggravated the decedent\u2019s preexisting symptomatic coronary artery disease.\u201d The Board adopted this and the other findings of the ALJ. This finding has no support in the record and is directly contrary to the undisputed medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Dr. Bernard Eisenstein is a physician, Board Certified in internal medicine with a subspecialty in cardiac pulmonary disease. He testified that the acute myocardial infarction from which' the Chief died was the direct result of the Chiefs pursuing and battling with the burglary suspect. This traumatic event, the doctor testified, caused an acute coronary insufficiency known as unstable angina which developed into an acute myocardial infarction resulting in the Chiefs death two weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The doctor agreed with the statement on the death certificate that the cause of death was coronary artery disease. However, the doctor also testified unequivocally that the Chiefs death was the \u201cdirect result\u201d of the Chiefs struggle with the burglary suspect. Neither the doctor\u2019s testimony nor any other evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>suggest any aggravation of a preexisting condition. On the contrary, the evidence was that the Chief was in excellent health. He had recovered from a heart attack of six years ago and had returned to work full time. He worked a ten hour day and regularly worked on his day off. He had stopped smoking. He never complained about chest pain or discomfort. He walked three miles a day and visited his cardiologist only once a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The doctor\u2019s testimony was uncontradicted. The Deputy Attorney General at the hearing accepted the doctor\u2019s medical testimony as accurate or substantially accurate. The Deputy Attorney General told the ALJ that the State\u2019s medical expert \u201cagrees substantially\u201d with Dr. Eisenstein and therefore would not appear. Dr. Eisenstein\u2019s testimony was corroborated by the Chiefs widow and another witness who testified as to the Chiefs rapidly deteriorating condition in the two weeks after the incident. No witnesses were presented on behalf of the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">In view of the above uncontradicted and accepted testimony, the finding that the violent encounter \u201cmerely aggravated\u201d a preexisting condition is totally without foundation. Moreover, even if the Chiefs death were attributable to some extent to his heart attack six years prior to the incident, this is not a bar to recovery. Where a disability or death involves the \u201ccombined effect of [both] a traumatic event and an underlying disease\u201d then the issue is whether the traumatic source was the \u201cessential significant or the substantial contributing cause\u201d of the resulting disability or death. <em>Gerba v. Board of Trustees, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>174, 186-187, 416 A.2d 314 (1980); <em>Korelnia v. Board of Trustees, 83 N.J. </em>163, 170, 416 A.2d 308 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Dr. Eisenstein\u2019s testimony and that of petitioner\u2019s other witnesses overwhelmingly establish that the traumatic struggle with the burglary suspect was the \u201cessential significant or the substantial contributing cause\u201d of the Chiefs resultant disability and death. <em>Gerba, supra, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 186-187, 416 A.2d 314; <em>Korelnia, supra, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 170, 416 A.2d 308. The record is bereft of any contrary evidence. Under these circumstances, we need not defer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>to the Board\u2019s finding. <em>Petrucelli v. Board of Trustees, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 289, 511 A.2d 735 (App.Div.1986) (in construing \u201cdirect result\u201d statutory test for accidental disability benefits, court need not defer to administrative judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">In sum, the Board\u2019s decision directly conflicts with our Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the statute, is far too \u201cwide of the mark on the undisputed facts,\u201d and flagrantly violates established public policy. <em>See Cianciulli v. Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System Trustees, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>399, 401, 582 A.2d 1004 (App.Div.1990). Last but not least, the decision is grossly unfair. A police chief who dies as a direct result of chasing and battling with a criminal is entitled to at least the same measure of benefits as the injured corrections officers in <em>Gable.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
