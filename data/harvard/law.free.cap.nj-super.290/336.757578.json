He was sentenced to an extended term of ten years with a five year period of parole ineligibility. The trial judge also imposed appropriate Violent Crimes Compensation Board and Safe Neighborhood Services Fund assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">Defendant appeals, contending that the following trial errors warrant reversal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-14\">\n<em>POINT I:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-15\">THE ADMISSION OF TESTIMONY THAT DEFENDANT COMMITTED AN UNCHARGED CRIMINAL TRESPASS THE DAY BEFORE THIS INCIDENT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>AT THE SAME APARTMENT BUILDING, WITHOUT ANY THEORY OF ADMISSIBILITY OR LIMITING INSTRUCTION, VIOLATED HIS RIGHTS UNDER <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404b AND HIS RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW (U.S. CONST.AMEND.

Thus, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">/</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">The evidence at trial established the following facts. Willie Moore owns a four unit apartment building in Trenton. There is one apartment on the first floor; two on the second; and, one on the third which is occupied by Stanley Gant.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">On January 26, 1994, the day before the incident in question, \u201csome time in the early morning hours\u201d Moore received a report that someone had broken into the vacant apartment on the second floor which had previously been occupied by Willie Robinson. When Moore arrived he discovered that the door to that apart-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>merit had been broken open. When he entered the apartment Moore found defendant asleep. Moore asked defendant to leave, but because defendant \u201cseemed a little lethargic and a little disoriented,\u201d Moore called the police. The police escorted defendant from the building. Moore did not \u201cpress charges,\u201d a decision which he later regretted. The police \u201cadmonished [defendant] and rebuked him very severely,\u201d after which \u201cthey let him go.\u201d Moore then fixed the broken door.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">On January 27, 1994, the second floor resident, George Smith, heard someone walking in the supposedly vacant apartment next door. He found that the door had been broken open. He also observed that the door to Gant\u2019s third-floor apartment had been broken, and heard a noise coming from that apartment as well. Knowing that Gant was visiting his girlfriend up the street, Smith went to notify him.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Upon returning to the building, Gant saw the two broken doors. He observed defendant standing inside his apartment at the top of the stairs. Defendant had \u201ca few items in his hand,\u201d including an electrical appliance and a bowl of \u201coatmeal or something,\u201d which he was eating. Gant\u2019s apartment had been \u201cransacked pretty bad\u201d as if someone had been looking for something.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Gant testified that when he entered the apartment, he saw that his television had been removed from its stand in the bedroom and placed on the floor at the top of the stairs. (The jury was shown a photo of the TV set on its stand). Also, his iron had been removed from its usual place on the floor under a counter and was on top of the counter. Gant also saw \u201csome paper that was burnt at the top of the stairs like someone was starting a fire.\u201d When Gant asked defendant to leave, defendant \u201ckept mumbling\u201d that he was not \u201cgoing anywhere\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to leave.\u201d Defendant \u201ckept saying that this was my cousin\u2019s apartment or something, something like that.\u201d Gant knew that defendant was referring to Vernard Moore, who was Gant\u2019s cousin and was also defendant\u2019s cousin and who had resided with Gant until about three weeks before this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Officers Martin and Montez responded to the scene at about 12:56 a.m. on January 27. As Martin arrived, defendant was walking out of the building. Gant identified defendant as the one he had found in his apartment, and Martin placed defendant under arrest. Defendant told Martin that his name was Michael Smith, but Martin later determined his real identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Upon searching the apartment, Martin saw the television on the floor at the top of the stairs and the iron on top of the kitchen counter. Martin confirmed that two doors had been broken. Defendant did not testify. Defense counsel called Officer Montez who testified that Gant\u2019s apartment had no light bulbs or working lights. In addition, he substantially corroborated Officer Martin\u2019s testimony except that he stated that the television was not at the top of the stairs but inside the apartment near the bedroom door. On this evidence the jury convicted defendant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">We turn first to the trial judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury as to criminal trespass. Burglary requires three elements of proof: (1) purpose to commit an offense; (2) entry into a structure; and (3) absence of license or privilege to enter. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-2(a). The relevant portion of the criminal trespass statute <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-3(a)) requires two elements, which are the same as the second and third elements of burglary. In a burglary case, if the State attempts to prove that the entry was for the purpose of stealing, the trial judge normally should charge the lesser included offense of criminal trespass, \u201cin case the State should fail to convince the jury of larcenous intent.\u201d <em>State v. Clarke, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>219, 225, 486 A.2d 935 (App.Div.1985) (dictum).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">When there is a \u201crational basis\u201d for a verdict on a lesser included offense, the judge must grant a defendant\u2019s request for a jury charge on that offense. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8(e); <em>State v. Crisantos (Arriagas), </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>265, 277, 508 A.2d 167 (1986). Where, as here, a defendant fails to request the charge, the test is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>stringent: the judge must charge a lesser included offense only if the evidence \u201cclearly indicates\u201d that such a charge is appropriate. <em>State v. Purnell, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>518, 541, 601 A.2d 175 (1992); <em>State v. Choice, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>295, 299, 486 A.2d 833 (1985). The judge has no duty \u201cto meticulously sift through the entire record\u201d to uncover some facts that might support a lesser included offense instruction. <em>State v. Purnell, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>at 540-41, 601 A.2d 175; <em>State v. Maiorana, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 364-65, 573 A.2d 475 (App.Div.1990), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>327, 604 A.2d 601 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Our task, therefore, is to determine whether the evidence before the judge clearly indicated that the trespass charge was warranted. In our view it was. The judge did not have to sift through the evidence in this case to uncover facts to support a trespass charge. On the contrary, the viability of such a charge was clearly indicated. Defendant, who appears to have been homeless, apparently broke into a vacant apartment in the building to sleep on the night before the crime charged. At that time, he was lethargic and disoriented and the owner of the building did not press charges against him. One night later, defendant was found in Gant\u2019s apartment, one floor up, eating a bowl of oatmeal. Gant testified that the apartment was ransacked as if someone was looking for something. In view of the fact that the apartment was entirely without a light source, a jury could well conclude that this is how defendant found the cereal, the bowl, the spoon and the cord Gant said he saw in defendant\u2019s hand. When Gant confronted defendant, he did not run away but insisted that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere because this was his cousin, Vemard Moore\u2019s apartment. Vemard Moore is also Gant\u2019s cousin. He had lived in Gant\u2019s apartment for six months, vacating it about three weeks before the incident. Also Gant testified that defendant had visited a former tenant, Willie Robinson in the apartment downstairs in which he had been found the previous night. Given defendant\u2019s rather confused state as testified to by Moore and Gant, it seems to us that there was ample evidence that defendant was in Gant\u2019s apartment for a purpose other than to steal, the most likely being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>to get in out of the cold January night. To be sure the testimony as to the ransacking and the movement of the iron and the TV would also support submitting the burglary charge to the jury. However, the trespass charge was also essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Defendant also argues that his right to a trial before an impartial jury was subverted when the trial judge dismissed one of the jurors during deliberations. This was juror number five, Mr. Despeines. During jury selection Despeines was accepted without any expressed concerns about his facility with English. He coherently answered all the simple voir dire questions, although he apparently was not completely fluent in expressing himself in English (\u201cI be in to work at four o\u2019clock.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The juiy began to deliberate at about 2:00 p.m. on July 14,1994. At 5:10 p.m. the judge sent the jurors a note asking if they wished to continue or return the next day. Up to that point, the jurors had apparently not experienced a sufficient problem with Despeines to warrant their alerting the judge to it. In response to the judge\u2019s inquiry, the jury sent back a written response: \u201cWe will return. We have a juror who cannot reach a decision because he can\u2019t \u2018condemn anyone\u2019 for profoundly religious beliefs, and is unable to pronounce a guilty or not guilty verdict. Would this have had a bearing on his service to this jury.\u201d The note did not make any reference to defendant\u2019s inability to speak or understand English. The judge called Despeines into chambers and questioned him in detail about his ability to perform as a juror. Their colloquy in its entirety is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">THE COURT: Could you come in, please Mr. Despeines, and sit right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A27\">JUROR NO. 5: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">THE COURT: It\u2019s been brought to my attention that you cannot make a decision because you can\u2019t condemn anyone for profoundly religious beliefs, and that you\u2019re unable to pronounce a guilty or a not guilty verdict. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-11\">JUROR NO. 5: Oh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-12\">THE COURT: Exc\u00faseme?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>JUROR NO. 5: Everything you read not all I said.

And also if he had to go to the apartment because he said he had his cousin live there, I think he got the second\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">THE COURT REPORTER: Judge, I am not understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not asking you to justify your thinking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">JUROR NO. 5: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">THE COURT: I\u2019m just asking you to answer the question, it is your position because of religious beliefs that you cannot make a decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-12\">JUROR NO. 5: Okay. It\u2019s not because of religious, I just said to my jury, I been study in four different Bible, I can make a right judgment, what\u2019s right or what\u2019s wrong. I said for me it\u2019s wrong because to get to the apartment with no permission, first of all. And for the food eating, I would not condemn him for eating the food because if he eat the food because he\u2019s hungry, I will give him the warning, and stay fifty feet away from the apartment. Next I find you there, it would be stricter jail. That was what I saying. And he said do you have any belief, like if you were, if you were the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-13\">THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-14\">THE COURT: Religious?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-15\">JUROR NO. 5: Religious. I say, yes, I grow up since a little boy and now, I, I do believe in God. I do believe in the law, what is right to do, and stand by the law. And I will do everything the law tell me to do. And that I will say, I can give you my decision, what you\u2019re thinking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-16\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t want your decision. I will ask you for the third time. I\u2019ve been asking you a question and you don\u2019t answer it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-17\">JUROR NO. 5: Oh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-18\">THE COURT: Is it your position that you cannot condemn anyone and that you, therefore, cannot make a decision as to guilt or innocence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-19\">JUROR NO. 5: Yeah, I can make it. What I\u2019m saying, what she wrote right here, I didn\u2019t say that, all of them. I just said what I told you, what you hear what I said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-20\">THE COURT: Do you have religious beliefs that prevent you from making a decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-21\">JUROR NO. 5: No. Not to make a decision. I can make a guilty or not guilty. THE COURT: Did you understand the trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-22\">JUROR NO. 5: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-23\">THE COURT: Did you understand my jury instruction when I gave the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASi\">JUROR NO. 5: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-24\">THE COURT: When I gave the law to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>JUROR NO. 5: Yes. And they said we all of them have to say guilty or not guilty, whatever else\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">THE COURT: That\u2019s right, I said that. It has to be unanimous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">JUROR NO. 5: And say, I just feel the way it\u2019s supposed to happen, I said I agree altogether, I said I agree altogether no right to get into the apartment. And after we come into the second one, because they said he have the item\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">THE COURT: Well, look, I don\u2019t want you to tell me what you\u2019re thinking or what the other jurors are thinking. I just want to resolve this matter. I\u2019ve been told that you can\u2019t make a decision because of religious beliefs and because you have said, \u201cI cannot condemn anyone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">JUROR NO. 5: Right, I said I cannot condemn anyone. Because I said, I just vote for him saying not guilty, and I would explain to them the way I find him he\u2019s not guilty. And, yes, he\u2019s guilty. And I say, no, he\u2019s not guilty. But I would say, I found the first part is guilty because he get to the apartment without permission of the owner. That\u2019s what I said. And then second part, I say, in the pictures\u2014 THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">JUROR NO. 5: In the photograph. There the police say he find him with something in his hand, with cereal. They find him empty-handed. And if no pictures of the floor for the TV, and I didn\u2019t see the picture of the TV in the pictures on the stand because all this missing. And the picture for the room is mistaken, because you should give a full profile of the room look like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">THE COURT: Okay, could you step out, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-12\">JUROR NO. 5: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-13\">(Juror No. 5 is excused from chambers).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">What followed was an exchange between the judge and counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-15\">THE COURT: He says guilty for the first part and not guilty for the second part. The first part is the burglary and the second part is eating cereal, which is no part of this ease. He doesn\u2019t have the slightest idea, in my opinion, what is going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOLL\">MS. LYONS: I think what he is saying with regard to the second part as you read it to them with the theft, the theft part of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-16\">THE COURT: Oh, maybe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-17\">MS. LYONS: He\u2019s suggesting that he had, he had a bowl in his hand eating the oatmeal and he couldn\u2019t find that\u2019s theft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-18\">THE COURT: But what he doesn\u2019t understand, that it doesn\u2019t have to be a theft, it\u2019s entering purpose of committing a theft therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-19\">MS. LYONS: But the two elements you gave, judge, was one and two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-20\">THE COURT: I described what theft meant to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-21\">MS.

MEIDT: Well, his religious belief, he thinks he\u2019s guilty, but he almost wanted to give the guy a second chance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">THE COURT: He pronounced his own law, that he can\u2019t come within fifty feet of it again or if you do, I\u2019ll put you in jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">MR. MEIDT: It doesn\u2019t seem he\u2019s able to follow the law as the Court instructed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abe\">THE COURT: For the record, the Court Reporter had a very difficult time in understanding him, in translating him. I understood about maybe twenty-five percent of what he said after he repeated it several times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">It\u2019s my strong opinion that the gentleman is not up to the responsibility of being a juror. He does not understand the law. He does not understand what his responsibilities are. And I don\u2019t think he should continue. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s capable of being a juror. He cannot express himself. I asked him the same question three or four times and I haven\u2019t gotten a clear answer to it yet. Does anyone else have any thoughts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">MR. MEIDT: I agree, your Honor. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s able to understand the law as it was provided by the Court, and he\u2019s not able to express himself to the other jurors. At least I was not able to understand what he was trying to express for at least seventy-five percent of what he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">MS. LYONS: Your Honor, I disagree somewhat It seems to me that he did understand, certainly understood the explanation given to the Court with regards to burglary and the elements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">As I recall, your Honor highlighted, one, what a burglary was, and, two, the second element of that offense was the purposeful, the unlawful taking, the intent to enter the structure to unlawfully take. And it seems to me that\u2019s where he has a problem. He said he found the first \u2014 he was guilty on the first count. Not the first count, but the first aspect of the offense. And on the second part he seemed to not be able to resolve that because of the cereal bowl which was found in the defendant\u2019s hand. And he seems to be hung on that particular aspect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">THE COURT: AH right. It\u2019s my decision from aU that I\u2019ve heard and seen that he should be removed, and I\u2019m going to remove him and replace him with the alternate and have the jury return tomorrow morning to begin their de\u00fcberations anew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-12\">I need Juror Number 5. And he is the juror who was smiling at defendant, isn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-13\">MS.

The Court observed that <em>R. </em>l:8-2(d) was intended \u201cto strike a balance between the need for judicial economy, especially in the context of lengthy trials, and the fundamental right of defendants to a fair trial by jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467, 643 A.2d 582. By its terms, the rule permits discharge of a juror only for reasons that are personal to the juror and that do not relate to the juror\u2019s interaction with other jurors or with the case itself. <em>Id. </em>at 468, 643 A.2d 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">The Court cautioned that the rule should be \u201cemployed sparingly\u201d and that the \u201cunable to continue\u201d condition must be \u201cstrictly construed\u201d to apply only to \u201ccompelling circumstances which are exclusively personal to the juror in question.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting from <em>State v. Trent, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>231, 240, 384 A.2d 888 (App.Div.1978), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>251, 398 A.2d 1271 (1979)). Thus, a trial court may not dismiss a juror merely because that juror is the lone dissenter. <em>Valenzuela, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 468-69, 643 A.2d 582. <em>Accord State v. Paige, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>362, 380-81, 607 A.2d 164 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>17, 611 A.2d 655 (1992) (holding, \u201ca trial court cannot replace with an alternate a juror whose position is at odds with the rest of the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">When it appears that the jury is deadlocked because of one juror, the judge must \u201cinquire of the jury whether further deliberation will likely result in a verdict.\u201d <em>Valenzuela, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 469, 643 A.2d 582. If the answer is no, the judge should declare a mistrial. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">In deciding whether to dismiss a juror for personal \u201cinability to continue,\u201d the judge first must create a record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>If a court is uncertain whether a juror is unable to continue, the court should question the juror in sufficient detail to establish a record adequate to inform the trial court, as well as a reviewing court, whether the juror possesses the intellect and the emotional stability to discharge the duty of a juror. On that issue, a trial court should not rely on instinct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 472, 643 A.2d 582.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The record should reveal whether the juror\u2019s problem stems from an inability to comprehend his or her function as a juror, or from honest indecision over an element of the State\u2019s proofs. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Applying these standards, we think the trial judge erred in excluding Despeines. The jury cited only one problem in bringing this matter before the judge: Despeines\u2019 religious convictions which made him \u201cunable to pronounce a guilty or not guilty verdict\u201d Apparently the jury did not have concern over Despeines\u2019 ability to comprehend and communicate in English. During the in-chambers proceeding, Despeines clearly refuted any suggestion that his reaction was grounded in religious beliefs (\u201cIt\u2019s not because of religion.\u201d). Further, he affirmed his ability to make a decision on guilt or innocence and on right and wrong (\u201cI can make a right judgment, what\u2019s right or what\u2019s wrong.\u201d). He also professed his ability to understand the nature of the proceedings and the jury instructions on the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Further, he demonstrated an understanding of the elements of burglary. Despite his imperfect English, a fair reading of the transcript shows that Despeines felt that defendant was guilty of breaking in, but that he was not guilty of intending to steal. As to what he called the \u201cfirst\u201d element, he said: \u201cI find he\u2019s guilty because broke in the apartment to get in\u201d; \u201che not like a tenant, he don\u2019t belong to the apartment, and that he broke the law to get in the apartment\u201d; \u201cfor me it\u2019s wrong because to get to the apartment with no permission, first of all\u201d; \u201cBut I would say, I found the first part is guilty because he get to the apartment without permission of the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">He then explained that ultimately he would have to vote not guilty because of the \u201csecond\u201d element, which he apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>understood to be the intent-to-steal element. Thus, he reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">And then second part, I say, in the pictures\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">JUROR NO. 5: In the photograph. There the police say he find him with something in his hand, with cereal. They find him empty-handed. And if no pictures of the floor for the TV, and I didn\u2019t see the picture of the TV in the pictures on the stand because all this missing. And the picture for the room is mistaken, because you should give a full profile of the room look like.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Presumably by this testimony, Despeines was indicating dissatisfaction with the State\u2019s proofs on the issue of whether defendant intended to steal, (ie. no pictures of the TV set on the floor and no overall photos of the apartment).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">At that point the judge excused Despeines from chambers and commented: \u201cHe says guilty for the first part and not guilty for the second part. The first part is the burglary and the second part is eating cereal, which is no part of this case. He doesn\u2019t have the slightest idea, in my opinion, what is going on.\u201d Defense counsel disagreed, arguing that by the \u201csecond part\u201d Despeines was referring to the intent-to-steal element; counsel reminded the judge that in the jury charge the judge had required two elements of proof: first, entry without permission, and second, an intent to commit a theft. The judge answered: \u201cOh, maybe.\u201d Nonetheless, the judge decided to dismiss Despeines.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">On this record, we are not satisfied that the compelling circumstances personal to the juror in question as described in <em>Valenzuela, supra, </em>were established. As the record stands, it shows that Despeines understood his function and had decided on a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict by rationally applying the judge\u2019s jury charge on the elements of burglary. He recognized the distinction between unlawful entry- \u2014 of which he thought defendant was guilty \u2014 and entering with the intent to commit an offense \u2014 of which he thought defendant was not guilty. He also expressly affirmed his ability to decide according to the law, to reach a verdict, and to understand the trial. Thus, the premature discharge had a real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>capacity to lead to a verdict that might not otherwise have been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Together with the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury as to the lesser included offense of trespass which was apparently the offense of which Despeines thought defendant was guilty, this error warrants reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
